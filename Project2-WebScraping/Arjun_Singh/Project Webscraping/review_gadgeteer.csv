"I love building things with LEGO, from as far back as I can remember†to this day, with the Gadgeteer Kid.† I would argue that LEGO are one of the greatest toys ever invented, enabling kids and adults alike to transform their imagination into reality. Back in my day, all we had were the classic bricks, but in todays world you can build everything from Hogwarts Castle to a real-life, fully functional Braille printer. The Mindstorms EV3 is arguably the most advanced and capable†LEGO set ever released. The Gadgeteer Kid and I will be taking a look at LEGO is latest and greatest technology as a joint review. Dave: This is what was considered are advanced back in my day. †This motorized brick and wired controller (that died decades ago) were how, when I was the Gadgeteer Kids age, you were able to bring your LEGO creations to life. But as we all know, the world is a much different place these days.,Dave: The,These creations vary in complexity difficulty; while the†Track3r involves about 20 to 30 steps, the humanoid-like EV3RSTORM has well over 100. In addition to the five are Starter Robotsù, LEGO also†provides instructions to build a dozen are Bonus Robots as well.,Dave: The Kid and I built the most basic of the are Starter Robotsù, the †and also built the most advanced, the ,. We controlled both robots†via his a†iPhone and my Note 3 apps.,Dave†So far we have controlled the Mindstorms EV3 in what I consider more of a remote-control capacity. While doing this is fun, and what we have created very capable, the EV3 system has so much more potential.,The EV3 programming software is an as basedù system that enables you to truly program your creations to do your bidding. There is a massive Mindstorms community on the internet, books to help you create, and clubs to build robots with other geeks ì impressively so.,In today are world of immersive gaming, I find the , a much better way for a young person to spend their time and parent money. There really is no end to how complex and massive your creation could be; it is limited only by your imagination. The Mindstorms (and LEGO) universe is huge and growing larger and more capable all the time. Though in this case, I will leave learning how to program and the next epic Mindstorms creation to the Gadgeteer Kid; this old dog just does not have the time to learn a new trick. But to those parents debating on whether to give your kid(s) an XBox or PlayStation, I suggest seriously considering the EV3 instead. You'll like these stories too:,The software is derived from LabView, and the previous versions had icons that looked like LabView VI icons too.  Now the icons look to be more user friendly, so you can access the variables directly.  I will bet it is worth the high price. johnkes the same LabView from National Instruments?,Gageteer Kid as  Glad that you were there to help your Dad struggle through this review. When I visited your house a couple of weeks ago Dave expressed his anxiety. Great job pulling this review together. Continue to do good work.,Heya Mike, ,Yep, the G.K. definitely picked up my slack on this one. My hope is that he takes the time during his summer holiday to create AND program something cool/interesting. Is LEGO manual has the LabView logo."
