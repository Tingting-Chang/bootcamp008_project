"I purchased this EV3 set. Very very good so far and my first robot kit. Bought it as soon as it came out back in, I think, November 2013 or something like that. Love the experience and the switch from studded to studless is awesome. It's just amazing, and it's wonderful on what you can do with it.
But there's no such thing as a perfect product. The EV3 brick display is dim and very hard to read. Couldn't they have moved the leds from the buttons into a backlight of some sort? Even $60 cellular phones have a backlight. And if there are three button backlight colors, green orange red, why couldn't they make it RGB, so there are lots of colors to choose from!?
Plus, it's way too expensive! Even some other company sells a similar kit for cheaper, and that one comes with 12 ports that you can plug anything in. Up to 12 motors!!! And now, this set has only three!? That's why i bought extra. This thing is outrageously expensive! Make it $150 next time.
Well, that aside, it's a great set. Even my grandson loves it, and the iPad works perfectly. But to be honest, the laptop is better to program. Thank you Lego for this product, it has now become one of my hobbies. Continue to make good stuff, may be EV4. But price it competitively and make it easier to use. Add C++ or Python support? More motors and sensors? Come on, the EV3 brick costs $200, and my smartphone costed $120. You can do it. It's the best robot kit in the world, make it better, cheaper. 
PERFECT ITEM!!!!,This is an amazing thing to have. I highly recommend it to people who love lego. there is 1 thing which is weird. The brick has 4 motor ports but 3 motors come in the pack.In the mindstorm NXT there are 2 touch sesors in 1 pack, but here is one.
The computer software is ONLY AVAILABLE FOR MAC & WINDOWS COMPUTERS!!!!
I LOVE IT,NightSerpent,Best Mindstorms Ever,After months of waiting I finally got the Mindstorms EV3 last week. With my 2 sons I assembled the first robot Tracker together and got it moving within an hour. Downloading and installing the Mindstorms software for our MAC laptop was easy and a matter of minutes to get it going. The software is easy to use and we got the other bonus robots immediately from the LEGO website. With still over a dozen robots to chose from this set has weeks of play fun still ahead of us - not to mention the unlimited possibilities of creating robots on your own. Using the Tracker robot I could show my sons how to use the robot with a running program as well as by switching it to IR control quickly since its so intuitive to use.
There are only 2 things which were a little disappointment: The Mindstorm set was announced to have instructions for 5 robots included - but the box had only the instructions for the Tracker robot included.This is not a major problem because you can get the building instructions for the other ones (Gripper, etc.) from the Lego website. What would have been nice if the building instructions would have been part of the project files (not only the program itself) and if everything would have been a single download file.
All in all this set is amazing and offers given the amount of robots (15) out of the box the best price / performance of all lego sets.,
Apersoncoolerthanyou,Very cool stuff,We use these at school (I'm a student) and I seriously adore these. We are placed in groups based on experience and ability, so that more advanced groups get harder, more challenging projects, probably on of the coolest I have made with this set is the EV3STORM, its huge. I would definitely buy it for myself and recommend it as a powerful learning tool useful for all ages. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
