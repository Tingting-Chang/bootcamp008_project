"Here's the finished robot!,The packaging will give you a good idea of what you can build.,Note that this sleeve slips off to become the Mission Pad (you do have to cut along one edge).,There are 601 parts in the box and if you don't create a system for keeping track of them, you could get lost.,This programming brick is the brains of the operation.,The ball launcher (front) plugs into one of the kit's large motors. You control it via programming and remote control.,The kit does come complete with everything you need to build the ball launcher, including 3 red wooden balls.,You can program missions that will be carried out on this colorful cardboard mat.,While this robot may not look that complex, you have to build pretty much every single part of it.,Depending on how you configure these treads, they can be great for rolling over obstacles or stability.,Built with the help of Autodesk, this iOS app is a great visual guide for building all of Mindstorms robot creations.,The app lets you pinch, zoom and rotate the project at virtually every building stage.,I used this app to effortlessly drive my robot around the office.,LEGO Mindstorms Ev3 is a product whose very existence in the consumer electronics universe seems impossible: It‚Äôs expensive, complex and extremely nerdy. Yet 15 years in and some 15,000 crowdsourced robotic creations later, this robot building and programming kit is not only still standing, but also changing with the times and getting better and better and better.,The latest edition maintains virtually all that was good about both the original Mindstorms (circa 1998) and 2006‚Äôs NXT addition, while adding more power, greater functionality, more aggressive designs and smart mobile tool integration. ,Inside the $349 box are some 600 pieces of specially designed LEGOs, cables, motors, sensors, gears, wheels, rubber treads and the all-important Intelligent (read ""programmable"") Brick. Different classes of LEGOs are collected in a number of non-resealable bags, so be sure to repack each batch in a Ziploc bag (you'll thank me later).,The sheer number of parts is overwhelming. When you look at the admittedly cool robot pictures on the boxes and in the Quick Start manual (the only paperwork that comes with Mindstorms), it can be a little daunting. However, LEGO is so methodical in its guidance both in print for your first project and in the downloadable project software, it‚Äôs almost a challenge to get lost.,While some of the coloring and parts design changed to more of a , look, the Mindstorms parts remain recognizable and are even interchangeable with the NXT ones.,The AA battery-powered brick also looks very familiar (with the same number of input and output ports), but a lot of work has been done inside to make it more powerful and faster. Mindstorms now runs Linux on an ARM-based processor, a change that should make the whole system much more easy to hack ‚Äî though no hacking is necessary if you want to build and program robots. ,The brick screen is still a monochrome LCD, which in our Retina display age, is a little off-putting. Still, it‚Äôs highly readable and easy to navigate with the six physical buttons on the front and a tab-based interface onscreen. LEGO also added an SD card slot for memory expansion and a full-sized USB port for adding a Wi-Fi radio dongle.,Like any traditional LEGO project, a LEGO Mindstorms robot begins with the build. There are five different base robots you can build from among all the parts and sensors in the box: Track3r, Spik3r, Ev3rstorm, Rapt3r and Gripp3r. (Those numbers in the names are intentional.) These builds vary in complexity; while my Track3r involved about 20 to 30 steps, the humanoid-like Ev3rstom has well over 100. , One of the most difficult parts is finding the right pieces. LEGO does a poor job of organizing many of the pieces, so I probably spent as much time searching as I did building.,At the center of every build is the programmable brick, which is essentially your robot's brain. All motors and sensors plug into the brick via included cables that snake around the robot body. One small criticism of the brick: It takes a surprisingly long time to start up despite 16 MB of flash memory and 64 MB of RAM.,The free tablet-based 3D Building app (available for iOS and Android tablets) is new to this edition, built in collaboration with Autodesk. The app takes you step-by-step through each build, and thanks to Autodesk‚Äôs mad CAD skills, each piece is lovingly recreated in fully rotatable and zoomable 3D. While I was expecting to virtually build the robots by hand with this app, it only allowed me to watch each step and pinch and zoom to get a good look around at how the pieces should look like apart and together.,Building your first robot is only half the fun (okay, maybe 65% of the fun). The next step is programming. I know that very word may scare some of you, especially when it comes to programming robots: What if you get it wrong? What if it attacks you? Relax, this won‚Äôt happen. First of all, ,After downloading and installing the desktop software (Windows 7 and 8 and Mac OS), use it to help guide you on a build with more step-by-step visuals. Then it literally points you to the programming step. You have two choices: Let the program walk you through the object-oriented process or download a pre-built program. I chose the former, since I wanted to learn.,The interface includes six module sets, including Actions (for the motors), Flow Control, Sensors, Data Operations, Advanced controls and even custom-built blocks. Each drag-and-droppable module in Actions, for example, controls a different part of the robot (large or small motor plugged into one or another port). Settings on each module allow you to control speed, rotations and direction. The guide tells you which settings to use, but if you're good enough, you will likely start experimenting with your own settings. The programming interface is a key area where you do as little or as much programming as you want. ,When you are done, there is sadly no way to virtually test out your programming, though a video will show you what your robot is supposed to do. To download the app to the robot, plug connect the included USB cable from your computer to the brick's mini USB port. Select the download button and the program loads onto the robot in seconds. Finally, find it on the brick is screen and hit the center button to launch.,Part of  the packaging of LEGO Mindstorms EV3 converts into a colorful are Mission Pad isù that you can use to carry out programmable missions. The printing on the cardboard is synchronized to Mindstorms  onboard base program. As a result, newly added programs work perfectly, as long as you make sure to place the robot in the ‚Äústart box.as One of my first builds was a robot that could shoot tiny red balls. On the pad, it could aim and shoot at two sets of tires that I placed at two predetermined positions on the board.,LEGO added a number of new sensors to the kit, including a new IR sensor for objects and distance and an IR beacon that works with the new palm-sized remote control.,The battery-powered remote is the only part of Mindstorms that requires a screwdriver (a rather silly oversight). But once you set the brick to work with IR control, it lets you control movement or the other attached motors. Oddly, it does not let you do both at once. Instead, you must move this rather rigid, tiny red slider on the face of the remote to choose which output port to control. I think LEGO might want to do a bit more work on the remote.,Using the new tablet-based LEGO Mindstorms Commander app is far more pleasurable. You start by enabling Bluetooth (2.1) on the brick and then syncing with your tablet. The app, which relies heavily on images instead of words (pretty much Lego  M.O.) , lets you choose which robot to control and then presents an interface that allows your thumbs to control the robot.,In the case of the Track3r robot with the ball-shooting head, the setup and control could not have been easier. It let me effortless you drive around the robot (I had to keep it in sight, since it did not have object sensors) at variable speeds. I could proceed slowly and carefully around turns and then spin in place and zip forward at a decent clip. At one point, I guided Track3r into a room, took aim and launched a red ball at one of our interns is all through the app on my ,.,At $349, Lego Mindstorms EV3 is not a causal purchase, but it is also not casual robotics. With the software, LEGO pieces, motors controllers and both LEGO and the communities guidance, you can build a dizzying array of relatively complex robot characters. Designed for ages 10 and up, it is the perfect product for someone interested in technology, automation and programming. Building robots is incredibly fun and satisfying as it is also a great group activity. ,LEGO Mindstorms kits have long been used as part of Dean Kamens , robotics program and competition. This latest kit should be a welcome addition. And for schools looking to promote , education, I can not think of a smarter investment.,This is, by far, the best robot building kit I have ever tried and I want to make more robots. (Now.) So put Lego Mindstorms EV3 on your wantedù list.,Quality build,Tons of Building options,Lots of guidance,Excellent App experience,Nonsensical remote,Pieces are poorly organized in non-resealable bags"
