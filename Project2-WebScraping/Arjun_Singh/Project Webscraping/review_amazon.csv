310 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product that sparks the imagination,By,H. Chan,on September 7, 2013,The LEGO Mindstorms EV3 (31313) is my first mindstorms product that I have ever owned so I can't compare it with the previous generations.  After playing with it for 6 days and building 4 of 5 the default models, I am simply left amazed, inspired and smiling from ear to ear.,The set comes in a large flat box with a removable outer sleeve that you can cut out to use as an obstacle course (the 1st basic EV3 model you build utilizes this).  When you open the box, the contents are contained in several plastic bags with the main computer brick (P-Brick) in a white cardboard box and instruction booklet and stickers in another plastic bag with cardboard backing.,Unfortunately, it doesn't come with any bins or boxes to store/organize the pieces.  So I suggest buying some storage organizer or if you happen to have the LEGO Mindstorms Education EV3 Core Set (45544) you can combine BOTH sets into the Education Core Set storage bin for one beefy development kit!! (more on that later),The instruction booklet gives you instructions on building the basic robot model and instructions for writing the program directly into the P-Brick to get you started.  The instruction booklet will point you to LEGO website to download the FREE ""EV3 Software"" which will comes with detailed instructions to build and program the other 4 standard models as well as 12 more models from the Mindstorms community.  The download is rather large (about 603MB download for the windows version) so you can download and try it out now and experiment before deciding to put down your money.,Once you download and install the EV3 software, you'll be guided through an intuitive interface that guides you to building the selected models.  Once you select the model, you will go over a series of missions that goes over building the Lego Model and Programming.  You can scan the QR code with your Android or iOS Tablet to download the free android/iOs app (Large 142 MB, so download it over wifi!!) called ""LEGO Mindstorms 3D Builder"" for your Android Tablet or iPad that gives you the build instructions in 3D (i.e. pan and rotate the LEGO pieces on a Tablet) or you can also view it through your web browser.,In each mission, you go through the build instructions and then the step-by-step programming instructions (or you load the completed program) and download it to the P-Brick over USB.  So far each model has taken me on average 1 - 3 hours to build (not counting programming) and about 1/2 hour to take apart.  As you build each model, you will learn the various design techniques and patterns in building your robot model.,After you program you robot model, the robot will either interact with you through the various sensors, running a simple loop or control it thorough the included IR Beacon/Remote.  You can also enabled the Bluetooth on the P-Brick and download the Android/iOS app called ""Lego Mindstorms Robot Commander"" and control the 5 basic models or custom model over bluetooth. My 4 year-old son loves interacting with R3PTAR model.,For the more advance user:,This is a great platform for learning linux (which is the main reason why I got it).  The P-Brick runs Linux on a ARM9 processor with 64MB RAM and 16MB Flash + up to 32GB of external storage via microSD.  You can communicate with it over wifi dongle via telnet (only supports Netgear WNA 1100) and the Linux source code is available and well documented.,As I have previously hinted, I have also purchased the ""LEGO Mindstorms Education EV3 Core Set 45544"" when it came out in Sept 1, 2013.  However it was designed to go with the Education EV3 software which costs extra ($99).  Fortunately the P-Bricks are the same in both kits and thus works with the Free EV3 software.  The education kit does contain some different sensors (e.g. ultrasonic and gyro sensor) and technic parts as well as a rechargeable DC battery and storage tray/bin which is large enough to contain both ""Retail"" and ""Education"" Sets in one box.  The Retail EV3 Software can support the ultrasonic and gyro sensors from the Education set if you enable a trick that you can find off of ""google"".,With these 2 sets you can daisy chain the 2 P-Bricks which will allow you to build more complex achines.,In summary, I'm am really happy that I got this fabulous and amazing EV3 mindstorms set.  It is easy to use, has a large community of users and has a large eco system (i.e compatible with the older NXT parts and 3rd party devices).  Its a bit pricey but for all the things that you can do with it, so its easy to justify its value.  Its a great way to introduce your kids to programming while having FUN!!,76 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,slight facelift, slow software, glaring difference(s),By,MahaRex,on October 30, 2013,********UPDATE 5 December 2013************,So after a reviewer pointed out that import from brick works for programs built on the brick itself, I updated my words to reflect the fact that it was user error on my part.  I'd still like to be able to use that function on programs written in the software that were sent to the brick though, although a PC-less brock to brick send with bluetooth is a neat feature and I'll have to see if that might be a workaround, although the teams robots are just different enough that a code written for one won't instantly work for the other; they would definitely need the ability to pull it into the software to make minor tweaks,********UPDATE 30 November 2013***********,I've changed my writeup below to reflect that you CAN easily download a module from the EV3 website that lets you use the gyro sensor for the home edition software.  After giving it some thought, I'll stick with 3-stars for now due to the other reasons listed.  If I could give this a 3.4, I would,******************************************,Original Writeup:,I purchased this kit because I regularly mentor a First Lego League (FLL) team (well 2 teams, from the same school) and wanted to be able to work on things from home without having to borrow their equipment (they have 2 new EV3 Education kits).  Not being an educator (in the formal sense) I purchased this version (i.e. not the education version) and figured that the biggest difference would be the data logging portion of the software not being part of the home edition.  I realize that with a little research, I might/should have known what I was getting (or not getting as it were) but at the end of the day some of the `deltas' between the Education version and this version are just so glaring, that I can't be satisfied with my purchase.,To start off positive, First, the things I like about EV3:,1 - I like the look of the new software, and some of the changes.  (see below),  A - One good example is how less brain power is involved in connecting data wires between certain types of blocks.  The effort it took to convert a number to text, although minor, seemed unnecessary to me in NXT; its much easier now in EV3 (although ironically I had to look up some info to make a basic motor test code because I was expecting to have to do extra steps),  B - I like that there are arrows on the sides and top/bottom of the screen so that you can scroll left, right, up, down without having to change to the `hand' cursor and click and drag the screen over (or zoom out/in, or do a click drag sort of deal which isn't possible on all peripherals).,  C - I like that you now have a project, and then tabbed programs as part of one overall project.  This makes organizing the codes we have for each task much easier.  (on the brick menu, you open a project folder, then the programs are listed underneath).,2 - I like the new look of the brick display(s) - the tabbed browsing and way that everything is displayed is much more intuitive, and space efficient,3 - I love the motor control, and port view functions on the EV3 - I was able to do a lot of good teaching about how the sensors work to the kids just by using a brick, wire and sensor (assembled robot not required),4 - Its great that there are now 4 motor control ports (versus 3 on the NXT).  This opened up the possibility of 4 motors in an FLL match, which increased the kids options in bots and assemblies that they build.,5 - SD card slot and USB - good, common sense add-ons,Now, my issues with it:,1 - The Software,  A - Its super bloated and slow!  I have a dual, dual core Xeon server board, velociraptor hard drive, nVidia GTX 265 with 1GB memory, 8 GB of RAM, and windows 7 64 bit ultimate, and it still lags for me!  I realize that my Xeon 5200 series CPU isn't quite `with the times' but that should be more than enough computing power to run this thing effortlessly.  I suppose Lego only has LabView to blame in this case. . . ., *******UPDATE*******,Part B below is no longer true - you can download a module from the Ev3 website that lets you control a gyro sensor using the home edition software.  I'll leave what I originally wrote below,**********************, B - Even if I buy a gyro sensor, the home edition software can't control it!  I can see not including this sensor in the kit, but I would think that's a bad business practice limiting the sale of a gyro sensor to ONLY the education kits?,  C - you can't open NXT programs in the EV3 software, and to my knowledge, there is no conversion available.  This is a problem, because the NXT community is well defined with lots of codes available to help the kids learn, and work their game board.  Having to transpose codes over, when you consider the differences mentioned above (data wires and such) won't necessarily be a drag and drop situation.,*********UPDATE**********,I've tweaked part D below after becoming aware that import from brick didn't do what I assumed it did(user error),*************************,  D - ""Import from Brick"" only works for programs that you wrote on the brick itself (as opposed to on the PC using the software).  I had high hopes for this so that we could easily share programs between our 2 teams, but when I tried it the only program that was available to import was the demo.  Although sending from brick to brick by bluetooth might be a workaround or sorts, the teams really need to be able to make a minor tweaks to the code to adjust for minor differences between their robots, so simply moving the program over to the other robot won't quite get the job done.,2 - You can't build the basic 'tribot' with the parts included.  The biggest part missing is the ball bearing (referred to as the 'ball pivot' on legoeducation.us).  Other parts are some basic angled connectors (seriously standard parts here), some basic axles of specific sizes (again. . . these are COMMON parts that aren't included) and some bigger wheels.  This is probably the MOST glaring difference between the kit, because these are parts that probably cost pennies.,3- LEGO's promises of the brick not acting up when the battery gets low were false.  I had 6 double A's in, brand new out of the box, and after a couple hours occasional use (we were working on and troubleshooting a line following bot) the brick FLIPPED OUT, during the line follower competition (yes, the competition).  The two robots the 2 teams built have had the same issue (although theirs is rechargeable - I have to take my robot apart to change the batteries, which is a real pain),In conclusion, I think this product line is great.  There is a ton you can do to educate, compete, challenge yourself, or just plain have fun.  The problems I have with it are the price tag considering how little has changed from the previous kit, and the glaring differences between the regular version and the education kit.  It made it uniquely hard, and required extra spending on my part, for me to most effectively help my team , Verified purchase only,All stars,Search,Showing 1-10 of 530 reviews,(Verified Purchases).
    ,5.0 out of 5 stars,By,on November 7, 2013,Verified Purchase,I am a seasoned RC vehicle veteran.  Over the last several years I've owned and operated nearly 50 different RC vehicles, ranging from basic starter trucks all the way up to $500+ vehicles.  My experience with RC vehicles led me to a Parrot AR.Drone, which has a few features on it that allow it to fly somewhat autonomously.  These autonomous features made me start looking into ways to make a regular RC truck more autonomous, which of course led me to start looking into robotics.,Years ago, when the very first LEGO Mindstorms set was released, I actually purchased one.  Upon getting it home, I decided that it was probably too advanced for me, and I ended up returning it.  Fast forward to this year.  While looking into ways to start getting into robotics, I headed to the store to buy a Robosapien X.  Although basic, the Robosapien X seemed like a good place to start with robotics, as it had a basic way of being programmed, and it had some options for modifying it to add features and accessories.  While at the store, I saw the Mindstorms EV3 set.  I was immediately in awe, as the box just draws you in.  I liked the looks of the models that it was showing, and knowing LEGO quality I knew it would be a product that functioned as good as it looked.  It was a bit pricey for me, so I passed on it initially.,A few days later, I kept thinking about the EV3 set, so I just went ahead and ordered one on Amazon.  It arrived quickly, as is the case for most of the things shipped from Amazon, and I was all set to get started.,Upon opening the packaging, you quickly realize that the outside sleeve is a ""course"" for the robots that you are going to build to navigate on.  It's a nice feature, and a good way to include something like this.  The cardboard is more sturdy than just a poster that folds up, so it seems like it will last longer than if it was made out of regular paper and included in the box.,After getting the box open, I started inspecting the things that were included.  Lots of parts, the motors, sensors, and that all important ""brain"" type of brick.  The instructions included are for building the first model, which is called Track3r.,I set about following the instructions to get the Track3r built.  It was a fairly quick build, with no real issues that popped up.  As is always the case the instructions were clear and concise and didn't leave me guessing at any point.  After getting the model built, I headed to my PC to download the EV3 software, which installed quickly and easily.  I then went about following the instructions for setting up my first program.,Now, I'm pretty tech savvy...however, I've never really tried any kind of computer programming.  This was the part of the Mindstorms EV3 kit that had me a bit concerned, as I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to wrap my head around it.,Luckily, the LEGO programming method is extremely easy to use.  It's a graphic system where you drag and drop ""blocks"" that serve as the commands, and then in those blocks you change settings in order to change what the robot will do when it reaches that portion of the program.,In a matter of minutes I had the first program written and installed, and the robot very quickly did exactly what it was supposed to do...it moved forward, spun a blade and knocked a tire off of a spot, then moved back to the starting point.,I was impressed.  I had managed to program a robot all by myself, and it didn't even seem to frustrate at all.,Over the next several days, I continued using the EV3 software to progress through the different models and ""missions"" that went with the Track3r.  I continued to not have many problems with the programming, and by about the third mission I realized something...the LEGO EV3 software was slowly, subtly, but surely TEACHING me programming.  Each mission was bringing new variables to the table that required different programming blocks and options.  It was so subtle that at first you don't even realize that you're being taught something, and to me this is ingenious.  Any time learning can be disguised as fun, I feel that it's something that will be more easily recalled and will be something that people WANT to continue to do.,After the first four missions, before even progressing to the final mission with the Track3r, I decided to give it a go at creating a program completely from scratch.  What I wanted to do was effectively ""reverse"" the Track3r, so that it's back was it's front and it's front was it's back, so that it could use the IR sensor as an ""eye.""  I then wanted the Track3r to move around on it's own, and when it came into a certain proximity of an object it would back up and turn around, then continue going.,It took me a little while to figure out a couple of the functions, mainly because I wanted the speed it reversed and the amount it turned to be ""random,"" but with the help of the great Mindstorms Community on LEGO's site, I was able to figure it out...and in fact, I figured it out while waiting for a response from that site, but then used the response just to check my own work.,After about a night worth of work, I had managed to create a program that had the Track3r roam about on it's own.  Whenever it would get within about 8"" of an object, it would back up (at a random speed), growl, turn around (a random amount at a random speed) and then move forward again.  With this program, the Track3r is effectively able to just autonomously roam around the room and not get stuck on anything.,Success!!!  I had built a robot, and programmed it myself with a program that I had built from the ground up.,I've had so much fun tweaking and adjusting this program that I've made, that I haven't really felt a need to move on to any more of the models.  That's not to say I'm not looking forward to moving on to those other models, I am, and I probably will start a new one this next week...but the ways I've been able to slowly tweak my program to do EXACTLY what I wanted it to do has been a lot of fun for me.,I believe that even though I've only gone through a small portion of what this set has to offer, I'm already convinced of this set's awesomeness.  This is, without a doubt, the best LEGO set I've ever had...and, dare I say, one of the best products I've ever bought, period.  Is it pricey??  Absolutely, but I believe it is worth every penny.  I've had so much fun with the first set of builds for the Track3r that I feel I've already gotten value out of the kit...and the fact that I have a ton of stuff left to do before I even start moving on to ground up models with ground up programs just says to me that this kit's value is through the roof.,Highly, highly recommended!September 8, 2013,Verified Purchase,My kids and I have played with the new EV3 for a whole weekend.  We've only built two robots and have otherwise experimented with the set.,Pros:,- Android interface is very good.  Not only can you control any of the five stock robots out of the box there is a nice interface for building controls for your own creations.  This means no figuring out how to control things!  It just works.,- Easy to build with a good selection of parts,- Nice techy look.  My kids built some spaceships while I built one of the harder, non-stock robots.,- Easy to program.  We used one of the downloadable extra robots and its code, but then used that to make our own modifications.  That makes it easy to start off with someone else's code and then later try to do all your own.,- Bluetooth works relatively easily.  I had troubles at first but now it works fine.  Don't mistakenly tick the box for iPhone thinking they mean any phone.  Leave that unticked if you're using Android.,- After your initial five robots there are several great downloadable robot instruction sets.,Cons:,- No built-in wifi.  This really should have been built in.,- Cable is mini USB instead of micro USB.,- Long bootup and shutdown time.  This is likely because the brick runs a full Linux build running on a slower chipset.  Takes time.,I have a five year old who likes to play with the original Mindstorms and an eight year old who prefers normal lego.  They were both interested in the look and style of the new set.  The younger one built something with interlocking gears and the older one used the new wing shapes to make some cool ships.,Once you get the lay of the land you'll find that this is very easy to use.  You have to download the software from the website - there is no CD.  However I tend to throw away CDs and do that anyway.  The book only covers the first basic tracked robot but that is fine.  All the rest of the builds require a computer.  You'll likely have a computer anyway to use this so that is fine.  However I find that it excels if you use a phone.  The EV3 app makes control a snap.,I've not tried to program from the brick yet.  It looks difficult and a bit confusing.  To program from a PC, if you've not done it before, you may want to purchase a book to learn what to do.  There are some videos online to help learn how to program too.October 3, 2013,Verified Purchase,I remember asking my mom for this type robot kit 25 years ago. It has finally arrived, albeit a bit late, this time for my son and I.,Lego has put together a very nice collection of pieces, motors, sensors, and a control brick that allows for lots of creativity. I was initially concerned that there wouldn't be enough pieces included build our own creations, but have been pleasantly surprised by the flexibility in the variety Lego has included. It would have been great to have gotten another medium motor or the gyro sensor, but I didn't want to pay more either. These are available from the Lego site.,The Tracker, the robot included on the paper instructions in the box, took less than an hour to build. You need to download the software as well as the models from the mindstorms site onto a computer to load the program into the brick. This is a fairly straightforward process, but isn't without its pitfalls. The graphical programming interface on the computer is nice and my 8-year-old son took to the basics pretty easily. We haven't tried the on-brick programming yet.,Overall this is a great set. My daughter and I participated in First Lego League last year with the previous generation of Mindstorms and had a good time with it. This set is definitely an improvement on a great product.,I attached a quick video review my son and I did along with some stills. Sorry for a few fuzzy parts, I guess the iPhone 5s' camera isn't that good with autofocus on robots. on October 22, 2015,Verified Purchase,I have waited for two years to write this review. There's a good reason for it.,I first bought these as a Christmas gift for my son when he was nine/fourth grade. The reason was that we had sent him to a day camp for a week that same year, and this was what they were using. EDIT: I did not know at the time that there was a difference in the ""retail"" vs. ""educational"" kits, and my son was getting frustrated over some of the things that he could not get the mindstorms to do that he could do at camp. If you get/got these after a Lego robotics camp, it's important to keep that in mind. END EDIT. He was initially ecstatic about them. He and my husband built a few things, and although my son is really focused on science and math, trying to build something on his own was intimidating for him. He didn't really want to build anything unless my husband could guide him. That wasn't what we were going for - my husband is a great dad and spends a lot of time with our son, but our goal was for my son to use his imagination and start creating things himself. We installed the software on my laptop, but as I was working from home at the time, that situation led to issues with trying to get things to work.,I found myself really resenting that I shelled out SO much money for toys that were just sitting there. We would find ourselves saying, ""Why don't you go do something with your mindstorms?"" and he'd look at us like he was being punished.,Over the course of the next year, he would build a few things, but only sporadically.,Fast forward to sixth grade/age 11. He's matured a bit (as much as one can expect of an 11-year-old). But I mean he's got more initiative and can create things without feeling the need to have dad with him. He does have a low-end smartphone, and we said he should get the mindstorms app so he doesn't have to rely on my laptop. He's creating all kinds of things, sending them into the living room to show us while he's in his room.,I think that even for a kid who was so geared toward things like this at age nine, he needed more time to really get into these. He's never been one to just build a lego set and keep it that way; he always pulls them apart to create things on his own, and those are usually pretty cool. I guess I thought that he would have been the same way with these, but perhaps the mindstorms were a little overwhelming. I'm not really sure, but I think my tip for anyone is that if their kid doesn't fully get into these right away, give it time. My son is actually using these as part of his science fair project this year. on February 22, 2014,Verified Purchase,My 10 year old son and I love the set we've been using since Christmas.  We had the NXT2 and had lots of fun with that over the years, but the look of the pieces and included robot (instructions) in the EV3 set are excellent.  The R3PTAR has especially mesmerized my son.,My one big gripe is the software makes it too easy to skip learning any programming.  When you go to program it gives you two options: Open Finished Program or Follow Step By Step Programming Instructions.  Hmmm.. if you are a 10 year old and can have the instant gratification of not having to spend time programming your robot why bother learning?  I strongly suggest this option be hidden in future releases of the software, so kids will spend the time learning what I think is an excellent intro to programming.  For me the programming justified the price of the kit.  It makes it much more than a typical Lego set. So far I have kept the Finished Program option away from my son and  he has enjoyed the programming, but if he sees he can just run the completed program before he gets the programming ""bug"" I fear it will be ""Game Over"".  Please fix this Lego!  Make a parent mode that can open the finished program (it can be handy) or just bury the option in a menu.,Otherwise it's a great set.  If you buy one and need a storage box (and you will) I recommend to Plano 5231 organizer.  I use them for both NXT2 and EV3 kits.  One of these and a label maker and all your pieces are organized in a durable, compact box. The EV3 book by Daniele Benedettelli is also good if you want to learn more about the EV3 without staring at the computer screen. Some great additional projects as well. on December 20, 2013,Verified Purchase,There is nothing wrong with the unit.  It works well.  However, you need to be aware that there are two versions of the product - a retail and and educational version.  This is the retail version.  The educational version has different firmware and comes with different set of sensors.  So it boils down to what you want from this unit.  According to the Lego representative I talked to, if you are just trying to learn robotics, this unit is fine, very well suited for that.  If you want to delve deeper into robotics, you may find this unit inadequate.,If you have already bought the retail version, and want to explore further, do not buy a new educational version.  Buy the educational programming software instead from Lego.  This allows you to update the firmware on the retail brick.  As to sensors, you can buy them either on the Lego site of maybe on EBay as you need.  That is what I ended up doing.  You will also be missing some of the bricks that come in the educational version, but again, you can get them elsewhere. on October 30, 2013,Verified Purchase,********UPDATE 5 December 2013************,So after a reviewer pointed out that import from brick works for programs built on the brick itself, I updated my words to reflect the fact that it was user error on my part.

The biggest part missing is the ball bearing (referred to as the 'ball pivot' on legoeducation.us).  Other parts are some basic angled connectors (seriously standard parts here), some basic axles of specific sizes (again. . . these are COMMON parts that aren't included) and some bigger wheels.  This is probably the MOST glaring difference between the kit, because these are parts that probably cost pennies.,3- LEGO's promises of the brick not acting up when the battery gets low were false.  I had 6 double A's in, brand new out of the box, and after a couple hours occasional use (we were working on and troubleshooting a line following bot) the brick FLIPPED OUT, during the line follower competition (yes, the competition).  The two robots the 2 teams built have had the same issue (although theirs is rechargeable - I have to take my robot apart to change the batteries, which is a real pain),In conclusion, I think this product line is great.  There is a ton you can do to educate, compete, challenge yourself, or just plain have fun.  The problems I have with it are the price tag considering how little has changed from the previous kit, and the glaring differences between the regular version and the education kit.  It made it uniquely hard, and required extra spending on my part, for me to most effectively help my team(s). on December 30, 2014,Verified Purchase,At first glance, the price was a bit more than I wanted to spend on my son's Christmas gift, so I decided to check out other robotics kits. All I found was babyish ""my first robot"" sets that did nothing more than any motorized Lego set could and had no possibilities for ""free play,"" or $900 kits that require soldering and a PhD. It was the only in-between I could find, so I went for it.,My son has Asperger Syndrome and his ability to create is astounding. He recently solved a puzzle (at school) that no one had solved in nine years! If you can swing it, this set is incredible. In just a few short days he's come up with all kinds of working ""robots,"" my favorite being a scorpion than shot a ball out of his tail every ten seconds. The programming is simple (and easily compatible with OS X), it's almost drag and drop. It allows for him to make what's in his head come to life. My proud parent mind is sure it's part of his path to MIT. :) He's almost 12 and needs zero supervision, no frustration, no tears.,For a child that has difficulty communicating and befriending peers, this is an amazing gift. The neighborhood kids are so impressed, they're all asking for his advice on Legos and other building projects. It's educational and definitely a plus for self-esteem. I've actually choked up a few times watching him. Thanks Lego and Amazon. on September 4, 2014,Verified Purchase,We have purchased a lot of LEGO® MINDSTORMS®  kits from Amazon in the past. My wife who teaches kids grades K5- 8 uses these kits to help them prepare for FIRST LEGO League (FLL) competitions as well as impart knowledge and spark interests in kids who wants to pursue Robotics in the future. These LEGO® MINDSTORMS® kits are must and provides the necessary building blocks for kids to get started with robotics.,The previous model , was popular with kids for several years which is now seen replaced with ,. From my understanding This is the third generation of the LEGO® MINDSTORMS® platform and the ""EV"" stands for evolution, hence EV3 in the product name. The NXT 2.0 seems to have been discontinued by LEGO® but in comparison I think EV3 is an natural evolution of the product as we move forward in sparking interests in kids.,There are some common parts that you need to identify as your child gets into building robots using this LEGO® MINDSTORMS® kits the most important part of this kit is known as ""BRICK"" - The LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Brick is a programmable intelligent Brick that you can refer to as 'The brain' of your robot - This BRICK controls motors and sensors to make it move, walk and talk; as well as provide wireless communication through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It is powered by QTY 6 AA batteries.,There are several other parts that comes with this kit like Building instruction for the starter robot, 'TRACK3R' Connecter cables, 1 USB cable for programming the brick, LEGO Technic Elements: Total of 594 pieces 1 EV3 Brick, 2 Large Interactive Servo Motors, 1 Medium Interactive Servo Motor, 1 Touch Sensor, 1 Color Sensor,  1 Infrared Sensor,  1 Infrared Beacon.,So what can you do with this kit? - There are five robots which you can build straight out of the box - the building instructions along with accompanying programs are available in the EV3 Software. In addition there are many more 'fan-made' bonus robots that can be accessed via the EV3 Software Lobby or via the LEGO website - all additional fan-made designs can be built using the elements from the LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 (31313) set sold here.,Apart from this if your child gets creative then they can make their own design. Also, If your child wants to participate in First Lego League then you must visit FLL website to determine this year's design and build a challenging design to compete with others in the same category. The year 2014's challenge and past years challenges can be found in my comment section.,Please note: The new software for 'EV3' is bloated and runs very slow even on high-end laptops. The previous generation of LEGO product used to use 'NXT' software. As stands, It is not possible to program this new 'EV3' Brick with the old 'NXT' Software which kids & educators still love. However, you can program your old 'NXT' Intelligent Brick using the new LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Home Edition Software.,Having said, as seen in practical classroom uses by kids not all Software features are supported by the old NXT Brick and can be frustrating at times. So we ended up having both the old 'NXT' software and the new 'LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Home Edition' Software side by side and preferably on a different laptops in order to co-exist with the new generation of bricks moving forward.,As far as using The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Sensors with the old NXT kit please be aware that the new sensors are completely digital and therefore will not work with the old NXT Intelligent Brick. However, LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Brick uses the same RJ12 connector cables as the old LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Brick therefore LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Sensors be used together with old NXT Sensors.,If you have a classroom wherein you have a mixture of old and new sets I strongly recommend that you keep them apart in separate storage bins and do not mix match the critical parts. We always purchase , to keep the kits safe after opening them.,Hope this review proves useful to you. on November 21, 2014,Verified Purchase,I'm a second year FLL (First Lego League) coach.  My team scored the highest points last year at the regional (and hope to do so this year too).  We used the NXT (last generation) last year.  We had lots of issues that I don't think the kids need to deal with as they have so much to learn already.  This year, we upgraded to this long-awaited new generation.  I'm sad to report that most of the issues stayed, just in a different form sometimes.  The major gripes I have are (in chronicle order of discovery):,  1. It takes FOREVER to start AND to shut down.  I saw that the memory is astronomical, compared to the NXT.  I don't know why they think kids can create 16MB of embedded code (besides, see a following point); and does it really have to take that long?,  2. With all that computing power, the Human-Machine Interface didn't get better.  The screen is just as small and low resolution; icons did not make any more sense than the NXT; it did not get brighter; there is no improvement to let you see longer names of programs...,  3. As we start to work on competition missions, the project management capability proved not any better than NXT.  It did get away from the useless ""profile"" setup of the NXT, but the new project/program-based setup did not prove to be any more capable of project organization.  I manage an algorithm team at work, but I couldn't find a good way to teach these kids about organizing and collaborating on programing for the EV3.,  4. The programing environment is different. Blocks changes... and it did get better.  However, it's not nearly better enough to make it a good environment.  At times the frustration level is intense, and I feel for the kids.  I had to encourage them and say ""when you become a real engineer, you'll have better tools - trust me!"",  5. As we get closer to competition, it proved difficult just to leave only the useful missions on the brick (and in a specific order) to facilitate quick pit stops.,  6. As we get closer to final programs, which are larger, bugs started showing up.  It took all of MY reverse engineering skills to help the kids find out that those are bugs with the EV3 and find reliable work-arounds.  These only happen when the program gets large.  But then again, I thought they put 16MB in there to let you build large programs.,  7. The on-line community help is slim.  A main reason is many problems people have are similar to what I experienced above - and there is simply no solutions or too hard to even diagnose.  If you're new to programing and embedded control yourself, then there are some good advices in the community to help.,That said, it's not an expensive toy for what it is.  Given the non-existence of competition, it provides a great platform for bringing the kids a LONG way into modern engineering.  Because of the problems I described, it is harder than necessary to reflect what they learned reliably in competition scores.  For that, I would give it a three star.  But this product by itself is not just for FLL, so I find it unfair to not give it an above-average score. LEGO,$19.37,5.0 out of 5 stars,by,LEGO,$15.88,4.8 out of 5 stars,Need customer service?
