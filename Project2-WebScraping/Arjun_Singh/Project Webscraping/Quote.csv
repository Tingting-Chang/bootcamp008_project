And after all of those things converged together, they just went right down the tubes very quickly.",Ben Carson,I've had experiences in my life that leave no doubt in my mind about the fact that God exists.

Too many people there. They can't support themselves - and it's not an inhuman thing to say. It's the case. Until humanity manages to sort itself out and get a coordinated view about the planet it's going to get worse and worse.,David Attenborough,"I don't think we are going to become extinct.

What wild creature is more accessible to our eyes and ears, as close to us and everyone in the world, as universal as a bird?",David Attenborough,"We really need to kick the carbon habit and stop making our energy from burning things.

When I was producing natural history programmes, I didn't use them as vehicles for my own opinion. They were factual programmes.",David Attenborough,"The most extraordinary thing about trying to piece together the missing links in the evolutionary story is that when you do find a missing link and put it in the story, you suddenly need all these other missing links to connect to the new discovery. The gaps and questions actually increase - it's extraordinary.",David Attenborough,It is that range of biodiversity that we must care for - the whole thing - rather than just one or two stars.,David Attenborough,"I've been to Nepal, but I'd like to go to Tibet.

That's why I need to throw curve balls.,David Bowie,I believe that I often bring out the best in somebody's talents.,David Bowie,"I'm in awe of the universe, but I don't necessarily believe there's an intelligence or agent behind it.

But my music does it for me, it really does.",David Bowie,Fame can take interesting men and thrust mediocrity upon them.,David Bowie,"I've started doing book reviews for Barnes & Noble!

You know, what I do is not terribly intellectual. I'm a pop singer for Christ's sake. As a person, I'm fairly uncomplicated.",David Bowie

Second, surround yourself with partners who are better than you are. Third, leave them to go get on with it.",David Ogilvy,I did not feel 'evil' when I wrote advertisements for Puerto Rico. They helped attract industry and tourists to a country which had been living on the edge of starvation for 400 years.,David Ogilvy,"You now have to decide what 'image' you want for your brand.

But we need all we can find. Almost without exception they are disagreeable. Don't destroy them. They lay golden eggs.,David Ogilvy,It strikes me as bad manners for a magazine to accept one of my advertisements and then attack it editorially - like inviting a man to dinner then spitting in his eye.,David Ogilvy,"I have a theory that the best ads come from personal experience. Some of the good ones I have done have really come out of the real experience of my life, and somehow this has come over as true and valid and persuasive.",David Ogilvy,"Advertising is a business of words, but advertising agencies are infested with men and women who cannot write. They cannot write advertisements, and they cannot write plans. They are helpless as deaf mutes on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera.",David Ogilvy,"I don't know the rules of grammar... If you're trying to persuade people to do something, or buy something, it seems to me you should use their language, the language they use every day, the language in which they think.

Everyone is here because he or she has a place to fill, and every piece must fit itself into the big jigsaw puzzle.",Deepak Chopra,"Traditional science assumes, for the most part, that an objective observer independent reality exists; the universe, stars, galaxies, sun, moon and earth would still be there if no one was looking.",Deepak Chopra,"People need to know that they have all the tools within themselves.

One of those ways is that the old paradigm suddenly starts to die.,Deepak Chopra,"You have to think of your brand as a kind of myth.

You're speaking literally.",Deepak Chopra,"For thousands of years, human beings have been obsessed with beauty, truth, love, honor, altruism, courage, social relationships, art, and God.

Jack will spend any amount of money to buy votes but he balks at investing a thousand dollars in a beautiful painting.,Jackie Kennedy,What is sad for women of my generation is that they weren't supposed to work if they had families.

I always decide my vote by taking as careful a look as I can at the actual candidates and issues themselves, no matter what the party label.",Jackie Robinson,"I speak to you only as an American who happens to be an American Negro and one who is proud of that heritage. We ask for nothing special.

That's what I believe, and it was very, very strong in the forest.",Jane Goodall,"It's been proven by quite a few studies that plants are good for our psychological development.

The same God with different names.",Jane Goodall,"What makes us human, I think, is an ability to ask questions, a consequence of our sophisticated spoken language.",Jane Goodall,"I was born in London in England in 1934. I went through, as a child, the horrors of World War II, through a time when food was rationed and we learned to be very careful, and we never had more to eat than what we needed to eat. There was no waste. Everything was used.",Jane Goodall,"I didn't want to become a professor or get tenure or teach or anything.

I got the opportunity to go and learn, not about any animal, but chimpanzees. I was living in my dream world, the forest in Gombe National Park in Tanzania. It was Tanganyika when I began.",Jane Goodall,"Women tend to be more intuitive, or to admit to being intuitive, and maybe the hard science approach isn't so attractive. The way that science is taught is very cold. I would never have become a scientist if I had been taught like that.",Jane Goodall,It was both fascinating and appalling to learn that chimpanzees were capable of hostile and territorial behavior that was not unlike certain forms of primitive human warfare.,Jane Goodall,"I did this book 'Harvest for Hope,' and I learned so much about food. And one thing I learned is that we have the guts not of a carnivore, but of an herbivore. Herbivore guts are very long because they have to get the last bit of nutrition out of leaves and things.",Jane Goodall,"We have language and they do not. Chimps communicate by embracing, patting, looking - all these things. And they have lots of sounds. But they cannot sit and discuss. They cannot teach about things that are not present, as far as we know.",Jane Goodall,"Words can be said in bitterness and anger, and often there seems to be an element of truth in the nastiness. And words don't go away, they just echo around.",Jane Goodall,When I look back over my life it's almost as if there was a plan laid out for me - from the little girl who was so passionate about animals who longed to go to Africa and whose family couldn't afford to put her through college. Everyone laughed at my dreams. I was supposed to be a secretary in Bournemouth.,Jane Goodall,"Chimps can do all sorts of things we thought that only we could do - like tool-making and abstraction and generalisation. They can learn a language - sign language - and they can use the signs. But when you think of our intellects, even the brightest chimp looks like a very small child.",Jane Goodall,"We can't leave people in abject poverty, so we need to raise the standard of living for 80% of the world's people, while bringing it down considerably for the 20% who are destroying our natural resources.",Jane Goodall,Whatever we believe about how we got to be the extraordinary creatures we are today is far less important than bringing our intellect to bear on how do we get together now around the world and get out of the mess that we've made. That's the key thing now. Never mind how we got to be who we are.,Jane Goodall,"The tree I had in the garden as a child, my beech tree, I used to climb up there and spend hours. I took my homework up there, my books, I went up there if I was sad, and it just felt very good to be up there among the green leaves and the birds and the sky.",Jane Goodall,When you meet chimps you meet individual personalities. When a baby chimp looks at you it's just like a human baby. We have a responsibility to them.,Jane Goodall,"There are certain characteristics that define a good chimp mother. She is patient, she is protective but she is not over-protective - that is really important. She is tolerant, but she can impose discipline. She is affectionate. She plays. And the most important of all: she is supportive.",Jane Goodall

One of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out.",Jeff Bezos,What we need to do is always lean into the future; when the world changes around you and when it changes against you - what used to be a tail wind is now a head wind - you have to lean into that and figure out what to do because complaining isn't a strategy.,Jeff Bezos,The one thing that offends me the most is when I walk by a bank and see ads trying to convince people to take out second mortgages on their home so they can go on vacation.

I'm using my resources to put in place heavy lifting infrastructure so the next generation of people can have a dynamic, entrepreneurial explosion into space.",Jeff Bezos,"I know Elon, we're very like minded in many ways. We're not conceptual twins. One thing I want us to do is go to Mars, but for me it's one thing. He's singularly focused on that. I think motivation wise, for me I don't find that Plan B idea motivating. I don't want a plan B for Earth, I want Plan B to make sure Plan A works.",Jeff Bezos,"Millions of people were inspired by the Apollo Program. I was five years old when I watched Apollo 11 unfold on television, and without any doubt it was a big contributor to my passions for science, engineering, and exploration.",Jeff Bezos,"Because, you know, resilience - if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush, then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone. But the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget. Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.",Jeff Bezos,The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb. So the light bulb is what wired the world. And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world. They were really thinking about - they weren't putting electricity into the home. They were putting lighting into the home.,Jeff Bezos,You don't want to negotiate the price of simple things you buy every day.,Jeff Bezos,"I'm a big fan of all-you-can-eat plans, because they're simpler for customers.",Jeff Bezos,"If you're competitor-focused, you have to wait until there is a competitor doing something.

Neither do I believe that the spirit of adventure runs any risk of disappearing in our world.",Marie Curie,"When radium was discovered, no one knew that it would prove useful in hospitals.
