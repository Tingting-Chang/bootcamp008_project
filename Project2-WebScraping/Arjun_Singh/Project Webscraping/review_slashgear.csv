"The universe in which this , unit exists is not one made for a tiny, limited cross-section of creative children and those that want to see their models move. When you see age 10+ on the package for the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3, you are going to need to understand that this does not mean it is excellence is relegated to kids. You are also going to need to recognize immediately that this is not just a toy it is a platform.,The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 was released last year in August, which would normally mean we did be looking for the current year model to review sooner than later. LEGOs do not work like smartphones, however, and the refresh cycle works in an entirely different way.,What you are seeing here is a platform that will be allowing creative individuals of all ages to create interesting and inventive amalgamations of bricks for generations to come. There is a LEGO MINDSTORMS community out there that allows builders to show off their unique creations there you will find models with all three (main) waves of MINDSTORMS base parts.,Back in 2006, the first modern MINDSTORMS NXT unit was released. This was the first programmable robotics kit released by LEGO, followed up by the NXT Educational Version, the NTX 2.0, and the MINDSTORMS EV3. There were robotics LEGO predecessors to MINDSTORMS as well are all leading up to the EV3 we see today.,We have been following this beast for a while. We saw it ,  most recently we have seen it hitting Seattle for the , where a pill-sorting machine was made out of it for the win. This challenge was inspired by a fellow by the name of Shubham Banerjee.,Above you will see Shubham Banerjee, a 12-year-old inventor who took a LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 kit and ,. Bringing 3rd-party elements like a roll of paper into this equation can bring about as you can see as some extraordinary bits of ingenuity.,Most recently you will find LEGO MINDSTORMS taking part in ,. It all comes down to the Intelligent EV3 Brick.,This Intelligent EV3 Brick is the largest piece you will see here in any one build, working with 6 physical buttons and an array of ports. These ports allow you to connect to your computer as well as the excellent cross-section of sensors and motors included in the box.,
2 x Large Interactive Servo Motors,
1 x Medium Interactive Servo Motor,
1 x Color sensor,
1 x Touch Sensor,
1 x Infrared Sensor,
1 x Infrared Beacon,
1 x EV3 Intelligent Brick,
594 LEGO Technic elements,
		
		,You also get a number of LEGO-made modified RJ12 cords to connect your sensors, beacon, and motors to the EV3 Intelligent Brick. These are the strangest bit of the whole as  are expecting that future iterations of the MINDSTORMS setup will include slightly less bulky cords as if any cords at all.,Each of the sensors and motors you receive are relatively large. These sensors certainly are not meant to replicate the super-tiny relatives set in the smartphone you have got in your pocket. They do work, though, and they are quite accurate as for a fact toy,as that is.,With the LEGO Technic pieces you receive in the box, you will be able to make a massive number of remote-controlled and robotic devices. As is implied by the box, this device takes LEGO-centric creativity to the next level.,Above you are seeing a set of LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3-based creations made for presentation at CES 2014. Watch out for those chompers.,The LabView Software for LEGO MINDSTORMS is free. No longer will you need a disk in the box, the download of this software available to anyone with a Mac or Windows PC. Search for LEGO MINDSTORMS Software and it will be the first result.,In this relatively easy to learn software you will be able to program each of the moving parts available in the EV3 kit. Each of the ports you see on the main Intelligent EV3 Brick can be connected to one of the elements included in the pack, all programmable therein.,You are also able to program the EV3 setup to react to certain stimuli as there are sensors here, after all. Program a danger-seeking robot to roll in reverse whenever it sees the color red, if you wish.,The commands you program in the software can be saved for use by any LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 kit. This works extremely well in the LEGO MINDSTORMS community, where users create kits and upload their software, making it available to any other user who would choose to re-create it.,In the box is one simple infra-red connected controller is working with the piece you are recognize as this robots head. With the basic TRACK3R build, this controller allows you to control the forward and backward tracks of the robot as moving the switch in the center changes your control set, allowing you to command the blender.,This system also allows mobile device connectivity. Smart devices, that is as like the iPad you will be seeing in our control demo here.,What you  are seeing here is the most basic, simple setup you are offered in the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 box. This robot is called the TRACK3R, and it is made to present a number of basic functions. ,You will be able to independently control each track, forward and backward, and whatever third element you connect. Here we have got the blender as you can also connect such oddities as a LEGO hammer, ball cannon (several tiny red plastic balls are included in the box as well), and a claw.,The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 build instructions collection made by LEGO itself has expanded since it was first revealed last year. You will now see the following sets: EV3RSTORM, GRIPP3R, R3PTAR SPIK3R, TRACK3R, BANNER PRINT3R, BOBB3E, DINOR3X, EL3CTRIC GUITAR, EV3 GAME, EV3D4 (certainly not R2-D2, but you did be forgiven for making the mistake), EV3MEG KRAZ3, MR B3AM, RAC3 TRUCK, ROBODOZ3R, WACK3M.,
 a selection of images of these builds. These Official LEGO builds have PDF-based instructions available through the MINDSTORMS website as well.,These images barely scrape the surface of the wild amount of builds with fan-made instructions available from the LEGO MINDSTORMS community. Everything from a LEGO mech-monster to a LEGO pile auto-cleaner. Make em all!,I can not emphasize enough the importance of this initiative. The LEGO brand has the ability to inspire as they have got brand power that connects to potential builders on a level unparalleled in our modern world. ,What is more LEGO has done an excellent job of creating this set. They could just as easily have pushed a much simpler setup, relying on their brand to sell sets. Instead I am and we get the sense that LEGO truly wants to push this environment forward. To inspire and enliven creativity in as many people are not just youngsters are as they can.,Now we just need slightly less bulky connections, more sensors, and maybe even some more brand connections. Imagine the build-your-own Star Wars Droid â€“ that is another initiative we had have a difficult time resisting, without a doubt."
