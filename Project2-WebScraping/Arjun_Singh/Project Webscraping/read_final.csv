1, Here's the finished robot!,The packaging will give you a good idea of what you can build.,Note that this sleeve slips off to become the Mission Pad (you do have to cut along one edge).,There are 601 parts in the box and if you don't create a system for keeping track of them, you could get lost.,This programming brick is the brains of the operation.,The ball launcher (front) plugs into one of the kit's large motors. You control it via programming and remote control.,The kit does come complete with everything you need to build the ball launcher, including 3 red wooden balls.,You can program missions that will be carried out on this colorful cardboard mat.,While this robot may not look that complex, you have to build pretty much every single part of it.,Depending on how you configure these treads, they can be great for rolling over obstacles or stability.,Built with the help of Autodesk, this iOS app is a great visual guide for building all of Mindstorms robot creations.,The app lets you pinch, zoom and rotate the project at virtually every building stage.,I used this app to effortlessly drive my robot around the office.,LEGO Mindstorms Ev3 is a product whose very existence in the consumer electronics universe seems impossible: It’s expensive, complex and extremely nerdy. Yet 15 years in and some 15,000 crowdsourced robotic creations later, this robot building and programming kit is not only still standing, but also changing with the times and getting better and better and better.,The latest edition maintains virtually all that was good about both the original Mindstorms (circa 1998) and 2006’s NXT addition, while adding more power, greater functionality, more aggressive designs and smart mobile tool integration. ,Inside the $349 box are some 600 pieces of specially designed LEGOs, cables, motors, sensors, gears, wheels, rubber treads and the all-important Intelligent (read ""programmable"") Brick. Different classes of LEGOs are collected in a number of non-resealable bags, so be sure to repack each batch in a Ziploc bag (you'll thank me later).,The sheer number of parts is overwhelming. When you look at the admittedly cool robot pictures on the boxes and in the Quick Start manual (the only paperwork that comes with Mindstorms), it can be a little daunting. However, LEGO is so methodical in its guidance both in print for your first project and in the downloadable project software, it’s almost a challenge to get lost.,While some of the coloring and parts design changed to more of a , look, the Mindstorms parts remain recognizable and are even interchangeable with the NXT ones.,The AA battery-powered brick also looks very familiar (with the same number of input and output ports), but a lot of work has been done inside to make it more powerful and faster. Mindstorms now runs Linux on an ARM-based processor, a change that should make the whole system much more easy to hack — though no hacking is necessary if you want to build and program robots. ,The brick screen is still a monochrome LCD, which in our Retina display age, is a little off-putting. Still, it’s highly readable and easy to navigate with the six physical buttons on the front and a tab-based interface onscreen. LEGO also added an SD card slot for memory expansion and a full-sized USB port for adding a Wi-Fi radio dongle.,Like any traditional LEGO project, a LEGO Mindstorms robot begins with the build. There are five different base robots you can build from among all the parts and sensors in the box: Track3r, Spik3r, Ev3rstorm, Rapt3r and Gripp3r. (Those numbers in the names are intentional.) These builds vary in complexity; while my Track3r involved about 20 to 30 steps, the humanoid-like Ev3rstom has well over 100. , One of the most difficult parts is finding the right pieces. LEGO does a poor job of organizing many of the pieces, so I probably spent as much time searching as I did building.,At the center of every build is the programmable brick, which is essentially your robot's brain. All motors and sensors plug into the brick via included cables that snake around the robot body. One small criticism of the brick: It takes a surprisingly long time to start up despite 16 MB of flash memory and 64 MB of RAM.,The free tablet-based 3D Building app (available for iOS and Android tablets) is new to this edition, built in collaboration with Autodesk. The app takes you step-by-step through each build, and thanks to Autodesk’s mad CAD skills, each piece is lovingly recreated in fully rotatable and zoomable 3D. While I was expecting to virtually build the robots by hand with this app, it only allowed me to watch each step and pinch and zoom to get a good look around at how the pieces should look like apart and together.,Building your first robot is only half the fun (okay, maybe 65% of the fun). The next step is programming. I know that very word may scare some of you, especially when it comes to programming robots: What if you get it wrong? What if it attacks you? Relax, this won’t happen. First of all, ,After downloading and installing the desktop software (Windows 7 and 8 and Mac OS), use it to help guide you on a build with more step-by-step visuals. Then it literally points you to the programming step. You have two choices: Let the program walk you through the object-oriented process or download a pre-built program. I chose the former, since I wanted to learn.,The interface includes six module sets, including Actions (for the motors), Flow Control, Sensors, Data Operations, Advanced controls and even custom-built blocks. Each drag-and-droppable module in Actions, for example, controls a different part of the robot (large or small motor plugged into one or another port). Settings on each module allow you to control speed, rotations and direction. The guide tells you which settings to use, but if you're good enough, you will likely start experimenting with your own settings. The programming interface is a key area where you do as little or as much programming as you want. ,When you are done, there is sadly no way to virtually test out your programming, though a video will show you what your robot is supposed to do. To download the app to the robot, plug connect the included USB cable from your computer to the brick's mini USB port. Select the download button and the program loads onto the robot in seconds. Finally, find it on the brick is screen and hit the center button to launch.,Part of  the packaging of LEGO Mindstorms EV3 converts into a colorful are Mission Pad is� that you can use to carry out programmable missions. The printing on the cardboard is synchronized to Mindstorms  onboard base program. As a result, newly added programs work perfectly, as long as you make sure to place the robot in the “start box.as One of my first builds was a robot that could shoot tiny red balls. On the pad, it could aim and shoot at two sets of tires that I placed at two predetermined positions on the board.,LEGO added a number of new sensors to the kit, including a new IR sensor for objects and distance and an IR beacon that works with the new palm-sized remote control.,The battery-powered remote is the only part of Mindstorms that requires a screwdriver (a rather silly oversight). But once you set the brick to work with IR control, it lets you control movement or the other attached motors. Oddly, it does not let you do both at once. Instead, you must move this rather rigid, tiny red slider on the face of the remote to choose which output port to control. I think LEGO might want to do a bit more work on the remote.,Using the new tablet-based LEGO Mindstorms Commander app is far more pleasurable. You start by enabling Bluetooth (2.1) on the brick and then syncing with your tablet. The app, which relies heavily on images instead of words (pretty much Lego  M.O.) , lets you choose which robot to control and then presents an interface that allows your thumbs to control the robot.,In the case of the Track3r robot with the ball-shooting head, the setup and control could not have been easier. It let me effortless you drive around the robot (I had to keep it in sight, since it did not have object sensors) at variable speeds. I could proceed slowly and carefully around turns and then spin in place and zip forward at a decent clip. At one point, I guided Track3r into a room, took aim and launched a red ball at one of our interns is all through the app on my ,.,At $349, Lego Mindstorms EV3 is not a causal purchase, but it is also not casual robotics. With the software, LEGO pieces, motors controllers and both LEGO and the communities guidance, you can build a dizzying array of relatively complex robot characters. Designed for ages 10 and up, it is the perfect product for someone interested in technology, automation and programming. Building robots is incredibly fun and satisfying as it is also a great group activity. ,LEGO Mindstorms kits have long been used as part of Dean Kamens , robotics program and competition. This latest kit should be a welcome addition. And for schools looking to promote , education, I can not think of a smarter investment.,This is, by far, the best robot building kit I have ever tried and I want to make more robots. (Now.) So put Lego Mindstorms EV3 on your wanted� list.,Quality build,Tons of Building options,Lots of guidance,Excellent App experience,Nonsensical remote,Pieces are poorly organized in non-resealable bags]
                    
2, I never�much of an opportunity as a kid to pla..."
Columns: [I love building things with LEGO, from as far back as I can remember�to this day, with the Gadgeteer Kid.� I would argue that LEGO are one of the greatest toys ever invented, enabling kids and adults alike to transform their imagination into reality. Back in my day, all we had were the classic bricks, but in todays world you can build everything from Hogwarts Castle to a real-life, fully functional Braille printer. The Mindstorms EV3 is arguably the most advanced and capable�LEGO set ever released. The Gadgeteer Kid and I will be taking a look at LEGO is latest and greatest technology as a joint review. Dave: This is what was considered are advanced back in my day. �This motorized brick and wired controller (that died decades ago) were how, when I was the Gadgeteer Kids age, you were able to bring your LEGO creations to life. But as we all know, the world is a much different place these days.,Dave: The,These creations vary in complexity difficulty; while the�Track3r involves about 20 to 30 steps, the humanoid-like EV3RSTORM has well over 100. In addition to the five are Starter Robots�, LEGO also�provides instructions to build a dozen are Bonus Robots as well.,Dave: The Kid and I built the most basic of the are Starter Robots�, the �and also built the most advanced, the ,. We controlled both robots�via his a�iPhone and my Note 3 apps.,Dave�So far we have controlled the Mindstorms EV3 in what I consider more of a remote-control capacity. While doing this is fun, and what we have created very capable, the EV3 system has so much more potential.,The EV3 programming software is an as based� system that enables you to truly program your creations to do your bidding. There is a massive Mindstorms community on the internet, books to help you create, and clubs to build robots with other geeks � impressively so.,In today are world of immersive gaming, I find the , a much better way for a young person to spend their time and parent money. There really is no end to how complex and massive your creation could be; it is limited only by your imagination. The Mindstorms (and LEGO) universe is huge and growing larger and more capable all the time. Though in this case, I will leave learning how to program and the next epic Mindstorms creation to the Gadgeteer Kid; this old dog just does not have the time to learn a new trick. But to those parents debating on whether to give your kid(s) an XBox or PlayStation, I suggest seriously considering the EV3 instead. You'll like these stories too:,The software is derived from LabView, and the previous versions had icons that looked like LabView VI icons too.  Now the icons look to be more user friendly, so you can access the variables directly.  I will bet it is worth the high price. johnkes the same LabView from National Instruments?,Gageteer Kid as  Glad that you were there to help your Dad struggle through this review. When I visited your house a couple of weeks ago Dave expressed his anxiety. Great job pulling this review together. Continue to do good work.,Heya Mike, ,Yep, the G.K. definitely picked up my slack on this one. My hope is that he takes the time during his summer holiday to create AND program something cool/interesting. Is LEGO manual has the LabView logo.]
3,I know I need a new Lego robot. Actually, I need two. I have the Lego Education edition, and I have got a retail set on order from a local toy store. I was sold , I also had the chance to borrow (and return) a retail set from Lego in advance of their ,, and I have been putting it to the test to see how it performs. The EV3 is the first update to the Lego Mindstorms robotics set in three years, and it officially ,.,Is it worth it? Well, it depends. Do you have kids with an interest in robotics? Are you willing to spend this much on a toy? This is a toy that teaches kids (age 10+) programming and engineering skills. It allows exploration of robotics concepts without needing to understand electrical engineering or advanced programming, but it is not dumbed down to the point that it becomes boring for older kids or even adults. In fact, the ,�can not resist a good Lego robot building challenge.,So what does the EV3 bring to the table? It still consists of the Lego Technic pin and beam construction system, which allows you to build strong robots with moving parts better than the standard Lego System. The CPU brain of the Lego Mindstorms is still the Brick. I have got a comparison shot between my NXT 2.0 brick and the new EV3 brick, so you can see how the system is still basically the same black and white display on a large, sturdy brick:,Underneath that similar brick, there iss a newly updated, faster processor. There is also more expansion with an SD card slot on the side, and you can program directly on the bot. The NXT 2.0 allowed you to string together a few commands, but if you wanted to do anything fancy, it always had to be done on a computer and transferred to the bot.,There is a caveat here. Full on-the-bot programming is cumbersome. It involves a tiny screen and a lot of hitting up and down buttons. However, the fact that you can do this at all is great news. It means you can have a team or a group of kids that have no access to a computer, and they can still program their robots. I am immediately thinking of classes, club meetings, camps, and other settings where team robot building challenges would just be amazing.,
,The other price we seem to have paid for the revamped brick interface is in start up and shut down time. My NXT 2.0 brick starts and shuts off pretty much instantly. The EV3 takes 30-45 seconds for each. That is not a big deal in the scheme of things, but it may be a long wait for kids with short attention spans. ,The new EV3 has some of the same sensors and servos as the old NXT, and many have improvements. The large motor servos are the same, but there is also a small motor servo. The color sensor is easier to attach to your bot. There is now only one touch sensor, and there is a brand new infrared sensor with a remote are beacon. This replaces the ultrasonic sensor in the retail sets. (The Lego Education set includes the ultrasonic sensor but not the IR sensor and beacon.),The EV3 seems more playful and just a little cooler than the NXT design. Everything matches the new red and black color scheme, instead of the Google-esque multicolor mismatch of the previous version. The IR sensor has eyes painted onto it rather than the implied eyes of the ultrasonic sensor. The mostly decorative is wing� pieces have stickers to make your robot appear more like a battle-worn survivor of a space war.  The old NXT included a paper test track that got torn up pretty quickly after you put it on the floor. The new EV3 has a test track that comes as part of the box itself. Cut off the outer layer of the box, and it becomes the test track. Is both sturdier and more interesting than the previous version.,One area that seems like Lego was trying a little too hard is in the naming conventions. The EV3 has an E to 3 substitution in all the demo model names, so the Track3r, the Spik3r, the R3ptar, etc. That feels a little too ,and it wil not age well. The good news is that once you build them, you can call your models whatever you want.,Speaking of models, there are tons of models and instructions right out of the gate. The box instructions only include the bot pictured at the top of the page. Well, it is actually three bots in one. You start with a simple tank, add the small motor servo for a spinning blade of death and then add the IR sensor for a remote control tank. The are Tracks� bot comes with a demo program that moves it a few times, makes some noises, and adds some on-screen eyes. The whole thing takes less than an hour to build, and it means you can make something that just works right away. You also get instructions on how to download several other models, and you can preview the instructions on your computer screen.,If you have an iPad, you can also take advantage of an app that shows you how to build the optional models. The iPad app, designed with the help of Autodesk, is just a brilliant idea. It offers animated, 3D, step-by-step instructions, so you no longer end up realizing five steps from the end that you missed a peg or axle at some point. Once you have mastered the basic steps, you can use the concepts you learned while building the models and make your own robots. The iPad software would be even better if it also supported iPad-based EV3 programming, but no dice.,The software for the EV3 does not ship on disc like it did with the NXT 2.0. Instead, it is a free download. Thank goodness. I have a friend who lost her NXT 2.0 software only to discover that she could not just download it somewhere. I have even heard that the new software is compatible with the old NXT 2.0 bricks, other than not supporting some features that are exclusive to the EV3. The new EV3 software has an updated look and feel but still offers the same drag-and-drop visual programming. If you think that is too much of a baby step, the operating system behind the Ev3 is Linux, and been told by Lego reps that they have made it easy to bypass the visual programming tools and just hack your robot directly. You can also hook up to four EV3 bricks together for some sort of super robot.,You might ask yourself why you want to spend nearly $350 on a Lego robotics kit instead of buying a , for $45 and learning some , or buying an , for under $200 and learning more about electrical engineering. It is a legitimate question. Some people are going to want to just go for the cheaper options. Some people will want all of them. They do different things, so it is not an all or nothing deal.,Here is my take. The Ev3 costs a lot upfront, but it is tough and reconfigurable, and used Lego Mindstorms kits have traditionally held onto their value pretty well on eBay. Other robotics platforms are either used up in the process of building them or go through processor innovations so fast that nobody is interested in the old models. It is also a great entry point, especially for parents who are not robotics super whizzes themselves. You really can step in and assist your younger child or allow your older, enthusiastic child to go hog wild on their own. You can always work your way towards more complicated systems later on.,Lego did a fantastic job updating the EV3 with new sensors and better peg slots for building with the old sensors. The expandable brick and new interface are fantastic once you learn how to get around on them. Sticking with the traditional black and white screen display means longer battery life and a more durable device, although eInk display would have been a great innovation here. I would have liked to see iPad and Android tablet versions of the programming interface to make the robot truly computer independent, but there is still room for Lego to go in that direction in the future.,If you are already a fan of Mindstorms, you will want to get this new model. If you are new to Lego robotics, I suggest looking for a , or similar group to explore the possibilities and make sure your child is enthusiastic enough with the idea. As with anything you program, you have to have some tenacity to problem solve. That is the sort of skill you may want to cultivate in your children. Children under the suggested age of 10 will need a lot of guidance (there are small pieces, the pegs are hard to push into the bots, and Mindstorms can take some abuse but not kids who want to step on them or throw them from great heights). My 11-year-old had no difficulty with assembly, and once she figured out how to transfer programs, she was debugging and problem-solving bot actions in no time. If you are not sure if this toy is right for your younger child, you should probably wait a few years and re-examine.,However, if you want to buy it for yourself and pretend it is for your child, we won judge.Marziah Karch has written ,. She is also writes for , for money and , for fun. She lives in Portland, Oregon and still works a day job. Because she apparently has free time on top of all that, she is also a doctoral candidate researching the information behavior of independent game designers.,I wonder: Do you need to reboot the Brick each time you transfer a new program or it is just to turn it on and off?, it from Amazon. It is still a bit pricey but I think it is worth it. I read nice review of EV3 here which also includes comparisons to the previous generation of the Mindstorms ,Got this at Christmas and here is a way to make it more accessible. These tips have come from using a Raspberry Pi,
1) add a VNC server to your Windows machine (realVNC is what I use). Then you can access the Windows EV3 software on your laptop or mobile device (I use Mocha on my iPhone and iPad) as long as they are on the same Wifi network.,
2) Go cable-less. I started with bluetooth. I have just gone wifi (I had an old Edimax wifi dingle and after a web search found some firmware that supports it). ,With this you can program, adjust, reprogram your robot without being tied to your desktop. Uses batteries up at a greater rate but this is the trade off. I would recommend always switching the EV3 block off as soon as you have moved on to another topic!]
4,The latest Lego Mindstorms set is totally mind-blowing. You can command 5 different model robots with WiFi, bluetooth or smartphone. The programming capabilities are endless. We've reached out to Lego, but so far no official statement on whether the EV3 comes preprogrammed to obey Asimov's Laws of Robotics.,Lego Mindstorms are toolkits that allow you to make insane programmable robots (software and hardware included). This is the third generation Mindstorms series. The technology is a step up from the previous series. The programmable brick is an ARM9-based processor that runs Linux, with 16MB FLASH memory, and 64MB RAM. There is also a USB connector and SD slot. ,The five different models you can build are Ev3storm, Track3r, Gripp3r, R3ptar, and Spik3r. It's recommended that you build the Track3r model first, but I just couldn't resist jumping right into the R3ptar (and this thing has a nasty bite!):,Here it is in action:,This current set includes over 500 Technic elements, a programmable brick a remote control, 3 motors, 3 sensors and downloadable 3D building instructions. The sensors include a touch sensor, color sensor, and infrared sensor. There is also an app that allows you to control your robot with your smartphone (iPhone and Android). Each model comes with various missions to complete, from the build itself to programming commands.,The EV3 is also backward compatible. The sensors, being digital, will not work with the NXT intelligent brick, the motors, however, will. You can program your Legobot to move, walk and talk with the intuitive� software program. Though, from my personal experience, the software is not completely intuitive. ,On initial connection the brick needed a firmware update which applied smoothly. Navigating LabView isn't difficult, but it took some clicking around to gather what many of the symbols and buttons mean. The UI is reminiscent of math modeling software.  For those without programming experience the drag and drop interface might be a good introduction.  However, I'm more excited about what can be accomplished in code outside of LabView when the open source community takes hold of the new EV3.,It's not always clear that the EV3 is connected. Programs are downloaded to the brick so fast that the progress indicator was misleading. Listening to the beeps on the brick was a better indicator of a successful transfer. Also, connecting to WiFi didn't work and resulted in some error messages on both the brick and in LabView. ,In my opinion, the great thing about these Technic models is that they are quite easy to take apart and rebuild. The primary annoyance was the connections. Overall, the build took me a little over an hour. It's going to be really exciting to see what custom creations start popping up. I'm thinking cameras, speakers, maybe an unlicensed nuclear accelerator, Weirding Module or a Genesis Device...the possibilities are endless. ]

5,I purchased this EV3 set. Very very good so far and my first robot kit. Bought it as soon as it came out back in, I think, November 2013 or something like that. Love the experience and the switch from studded to studless is awesome. It's just amazing, and it's wonderful on what you can do with it.
But there's no such thing as a perfect product. The EV3 brick display is dim and very hard to read. Couldn't they have moved the leds from the buttons into a backlight of some sort? Even $60 cellular phones have a backlight. And if there are three button backlight colors, green orange red, why couldn't they make it RGB, so there are lots of colors to choose from!?
Plus, it's way too expensive! Even some other company sells a similar kit for cheaper, and that one comes with 12 ports that you can plug anything in. Up to 12 motors!!! And now, this set has only three!? That's why i bought extra. This thing is outrageously expensive! Make it $150 next time.
Well, that aside, it's a great set. Even my grandson loves it, and the iPad works perfectly. But to be honest, the laptop is better to program. Thank you Lego for this product, it has now become one of my hobbies. Continue to make good stuff, may be EV4. But price it competitively and make it easier to use. Add C++ or Python support? More motors and sensors? Come on, the EV3 brick costs $200, and my smartphone costed $120. You can do it. It's the best robot kit in the world, make it better, cheaper. 
PERFECT ITEM!!!!,This is an amazing thing to have. I highly recommend it to people who love lego. there is 1 thing which is weird. The brick has 4 motor ports but 3 motors come in the pack.In the mindstorm NXT there are 2 touch sesors in 1 pack, but here is one.
The computer software is ONLY AVAILABLE FOR MAC & WINDOWS COMPUTERS!!!!
I LOVE IT,NightSerpent,Best Mindstorms Ever,After months of waiting I finally got the Mindstorms EV3 last week. With my 2 sons I assembled the first robot Tracker together and got it moving within an hour. Downloading and installing the Mindstorms software for our MAC laptop was easy and a matter of minutes to get it going. The software is easy to use and we got the other bonus robots immediately from the LEGO website. With still over a dozen robots to chose from this set has weeks of play fun still ahead of us - not to mention the unlimited possibilities of creating robots on your own. Using the Tracker robot I could show my sons how to use the robot with a running program as well as by switching it to IR control quickly since its so intuitive to use.
There are only 2 things which were a little disappointment: The Mindstorm set was announced to have instructions for 5 robots included - but the box had only the instructions for the Tracker robot included.This is not a major problem because you can get the building instructions for the other ones (Gripper, etc.) from the Lego website. What would have been nice if the building instructions would have been part of the project files (not only the program itself) and if everything would have been a single download file.
All in all this set is amazing and offers given the amount of robots (15) out of the box the best price / performance of all lego sets.,
Apersoncoolerthanyou,Very cool stuff,We use these at school (I'm a student) and I seriously adore these. We are placed in groups based on experience and ability, so that more advanced groups get harder, more challenging projects, probably on of the coolest I have made with this set is the EV3STORM, its huge. I would definitely buy it for myself and recommend it as a powerful learning tool useful for all ages. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED]

6,I can still feel the sharp edges of the very first Lego brick I stood on. I am reminded of it, 35-plus years later, each time I step on the Lego bricks of my children. After all, Lego has remained popular throughout my life.,What is more, I am a bit obsessed by certain aspects of Lego. I love the building, and applying labels to the bricks also bought and sold a bit of Lego over the years, with ,.,But beyond a Lego train set, one thing I have never done is build a remote-control Lego robot. If anything, I found these kits to be a bit intimidating. I should not have worried; as I recently found out, the new Lego Mindstorms EV3�robot is a pleasure to build and program.,The kit costs around $350, but we are giving ours away to one lucky winner: enter below for your chance to win!,
,This is a big kit. In the box, you will find a lot of Lego pieces, from Technic-style arms and axles, to clamps, and pieces that look like they would not be out of place on an aircraft model. There is also caterpillar tracks and compatible wheels.,You will also find the Programmable EV3 Brick (more on that below), various wires and cables, motors, and optical sensors.,Presumably to save on paper, the Lego Mindstorms 31313 includes instructions for just one of the five builds; the other build instructions can be found online.,What we get in the box, however, is certainly good enough to get started. The Track3r is a tank-like robot that wields a weapon and can find its way around a pre-printed map (the unwrapped outer sleeve of the box). Build time is about an hour, depending on how you organize your bricks.,Alternatives to this are the Spik3r (a sort of robot scorpion), R3ptor (a snake-like creature) and Gripp3r. There is also the main build, the giant Ev3 rstorm robot that graces the front of the box.,At the heart of each of these builds is the famous Programmable EV3 Brick, a large control center that features several Lego Technic connectors for easy integration.,As ever when building using Lego, it is a good idea to sort your pieces out in advance, preferably into color-matched groups.,Without this brick, a Mindstorms kit would just be a pretentiously named Lego Technic set. It is via the EV3 Brick that we are able to instruct the chosen Mindstorms build to move, and to program further routines.,As a control center and power-station six AA batteries are required  the EV3 Brick features four input ports (labelled 1, 2, 3, 4) to connect sensors. A further four output ports (labeled A-D) connect the brick to the motors.,Meanwhile, there is direct compatibility with Windows and Mac OS X via a mini USB PC port. A USB host port is also available for connecting a Wi-Fi dongle; you may also wish to daisy chain other EV3 bricks.,If memory expansion is required for the EV3 Brick, a micro-SD card slot is also included.,The EV3 Brick is not the only bulky component of this Lego Mindstorms kit.,There is an IR sensor (for the remote control), a color sensor (recognises seven colors and measures light intensity), and a touch sensor (recognizes three conditions: touch, bumped, released). Also included is a medium servo motor, and two large motors. Each of these can be incorporated in various ways. For instance, the servo motor drives a spinning arm on the Track3r build. There is also an IR beacon remote control, which we will look at below.,It is the color sensor that is used with the unwrapped outer sleeve of the box. As mentioned above, it is here that you will find a pre-printed road�, designed for the sensor to guide your Mindstorms project along.,Without the motors and the EV3 Brick, this is nothing more than a futuristic Lego Technic kit. The programmable computer, servo, and motors enhance the bricks. But to what end?,Lego kits always include a notice on the box advising the buyer of the perfect age range. With Lego Mindstorms 31313, this number is 10+. Now, I know plenty of adults that would find this kit challenging. Similarly, I know one or two young people under 10 that would absolutely adore it.,But, it is certainly not for 5 year olds, I did suggest that 8 is a good lower-age range for this kit. However, unless the child you are buying something like this for is a prodigy, they are probably not going to fully appreciate it until they are in secondary education.,If you are planning to buy one of these kits as a present, keep in mind that the motors, sensors and EV3 make it pretty expensive. In the USA, this is $350, while in the UK you will find it for around �220.,Meanwhile, once a build is complete, you will be able to have a play with it, after programming the EV3 block (see below). You will also find that each build has some variations that can be enjoyed as mission�. Some of these tasks might include the printed road, found in the box  sleeve.,You have several options for programming the EV3 Programmable Block. The first is pretty low-level, but you will find it useful to see how the block works. Basically, it comes with various pre-installed routines that you will find by navigating through the EV3 menu.,Progamming is really the second string for the Lego Mindstorms 31313 kit. Once you’ve got your build completed the instruction guides are as clear as you would expect, and can be found online learning to program the EV3 brick is the next challenge. After sampling the built-in routines, ,. There is a desktop app for Windows and Mac called the EV3 Programming Software, and a mobile app for iOS and Android called Lego Mindstorms Programmer.,With a USB-to-PC cable and microSD slot for programing via the desktop, the EV3 is perhaps more easily programmed via mobile. The mobile app also includes instructions for alternate builds (the packaged guidebook features just one), and the programming tool takes a block-based, drag-and-drop approach to creating routines and making your robot move.,It is simple, straightforward, and effortless. As long as you established a Bluetooth connection to the EV3 brick, your programmed course will be beamed to the Lego robot and obeyed.,As you should have guessed by now, I have good experience with Lego. I have never held an exhibition of my builds, but I know how to start, how to keep going, and how to finish.,If you are new to Mindstorms, let me tell you this: it quite different to Nexo Knights, Pirates, Lego City Lego Friends. There very little (if any) brick-to-brick action. The vast majority of connections use the Technic system, which gives a more Meccanno-esque feel to things. While the bricks feel like Lego, they actually a mature, grown up version. Of course, this means they will never have a film made about them,Understanding this is key to your success with any of these types of kit.,Whether you are building the Track3r, Ev3rstorm robot, or whatever, you will find that you have several options available for controlling your build remotely.,The most obvious option is the IR Beacon, a small remote control device that allows you to control the direction of the build. Buttons on either side of the multi-channel device enable independent tread control, too. You can change channels by pushing the red switch through its various positions, resulting in extra actions. For instance, with the Track3r, setting the switch to the central position will enable you to spin the weapon.,For the IR Beacon to work, however, it must be accompanied on the robot by the IR sensor.,For an additional (and, to be honest, superior) control option, you should seek out the Lego Mindstorms Commander app for iOS and Android. Requiring a Bluetooth connection (your EV3 block will need to be switched on, and Bluetooth enabled via the Settings menu), you will gain far superior control to the treads and the currently armed weapon than is possible with the IR Beacon.,The movement of the treads can be far more delicately controlled. Need to drive your Mindstorms EV3 creation carefully? Use the app to slow things down, simply by dragging your thumbs up and down a representation of the treads on your display. It is intuitive, and it is worth using.,Like almost all Lego, the Mindstorms EV3�kit will appeal to all ages. Straightforward to build and program, fun to use and learn with, this is the ultimate robotics gift for young engineers.]

7,Remarkably flexible and powerful. Expanded memory and Bluetooth control welcome upgrades. Accessible to people of all ages.,Expensive. Small number of servos and sensors included mean projects will either be limited or require additional investment.,The LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robotics kit is the newest, best, and most accessible way to teach your kids or yourself how to build and program robots.,Robots are hard to build from scratch unless you have degrees in engineering and programming. That's what makes LEGO's Mindstorms sets so amazing. They're flexible robotics kits that combine sensors, motors, and an electronic brain with LEGO Technic components to make robots anyone can build. LEGO has stepped up its robotics game with its newest Mindstorms product. Over four years since the launch of its Mindstorms NXT 2.0 kit, the company has released LEGO Mindstorms EV3. This $349.99 (direct) robotics kit is faster, smarter, and more flexible than the previous version, and stands as one of the best ways to dabble in robotics without investing in tools. Its price tag might seem like a lot for a toy, but it's much more than that; LEGO Mindstorms EV3 is a remarkably powerful and functional robotics kit people of any age can use to build some impressive and complicated projects.,For your $350, you get the Mindstorms EV3 Intelligent Brick (the ""brain"" of the Mindstorms EV3 set), an infrared remote control, three servo motors, a color sensor, a touch sensor, an infrared sensor, and 550 LEGO Technic pieces. The 550 bricks and other building components might not seem like a lot against the nearly 3,000 pieces of the $320 LEGO Sydney Opera House Creator set, but you're mostly paying for the robotic parts. In fact, the Intelligent Brick itself would cost $150 separately, and each other robotic component can be purchased piecemeal for $20 (servo motors, touch sensor) to $50 (infrared sensor).,
,
,Since this is a LEGO Technic set with a robotic heart, you can use any of your standard LEGO or LEGO Technic components with the set. That's one of the great things about LEGO: universal backwards compatibility. In fact, with a few small exceptions (six big sword/scale pieces, a handful of curved, white cover pieces, and a few specific mechanical pieces), all of the bricks that come with the set are universal and could be turned into nearly everything (a feature not seen very often with complex, licensed building sets for series like Star Wars or The Hobbit).�The set doesn't have any exact dimensions because it's over 500 different pieces, but you can build a robot about the size of a shoebox and have it still be structurally sound. Of course, you can also get more LEGO parts and build a robot as large as you'd like, as long as the moving parts are still light enough and have enough leverage for the servos to move them.,As the brain of the kit, the Mindstorms EV3 Intelligent Brick features a ton of connection features. It has eight Mindstorms connection cable ports (modified RJ12 ports with the plastic tab on the right side of the jack), a mini-USB port for connecting to your computer, a microSD card slot for expanding the memory, and a full-size USB port for an optional Wi-Fi dongle or daisy-chaining up to three additional Mindstorms EV3 Intelligent Bricks for a total of 32 connection ports is useful if you want to build a much more complicated and expensive robot than the kit allows on its own. The Intelligent Brick also features built-in Bluetooth for directly controlling your robot with your mobile device and the Mindstorms iOS or Android app. The top of the brick holds a monochrome LCD display, four direction buttons, a back button, and a confirmation button on the top, and the right side of the brick holds a small speaker for playing sound files.,The Mindstorms EV3 Intelligent Brick uses an ARM9-based processor with 16MB of memory (and storage expandable exponentially with the microSD card slot). This is,a massive leap in power from the ARM7-based Mindstorms NXT 2.0 Intelligent Brick, which only 256KB of memory and no microSD card slot. The NXT 2.0 Intelligent Brick had Bluetooth, but it was only Bluetooth 2.0 compared to the EV3 Intelligent Brick's Bluetooth 4.0, and couldn't be used to directly control your creations.,The sensors have also gotten a power upgrade, and are able to send new values to the EV3 Intelligent Brick 1,000 times per second, three times more often than the NXT 2.0 sensors. The color sensor can also now detect seven colors instead of six and has a Reflected Light mode that removes background light. All of these upgrades mean your robots can be much more complex than with Mindstorms NXT 2.0.,The LEGO Mindstorms Commander app for iOS and Android includes preset control panels for all five robots you can build in the 3D Builder app. More importantly, it lets you create manual control panels for your own creations, with different buttons, switches, and displays available to control motors and check sensor inputs. The Bluetooth control works directly with the Intelligent Brick without requiring you to program anything, so it can work both as a remote control and a test bench for seeing if your mechanisms function during construction.

8, This article covers the difference between the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition and LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 products. Other articles in the ‘difference between’ series:,* The difference and compatibility between EV3 and NXT (,),\n* The difference between NXT Home Edition and NXT Education products (,),The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robotics platform has been developed for two different target audiences. We have , (children and hobbyists) and , (students and teachers). LEGO has designed a base set for each group, as well as several add on sets.,There isn’t a clear line between home users and educational users, though. It’s fine to use the Education set at home, and it’s fine to use the Home Edition set at school. This article aims to clarify the differences between the two product lines so you can decide which product works best for you.,The facts and figures on this page may help you decide which set works best for you in terms of hardware and software, but there are other criteria as well. Which set is the most fun? (And won’t end up gathering dust)? See , for some additional considerations.,The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 set (LEGO #31313) is the one you’ll find in toy stores and many online stores, as shown in Figure 1 (,). It is often referred to as the Home Edition or Retail Edition. Right out of the box you can build 5 robots including EV3RSTORM, GRIPP3R, TRACK3R, R3PTAR and SPIK3R (,) and 12 bonus models (,).,You program the robot with software that you can download from the LEGO MINDSTORMS website for free (,). You can also control your robot with your smart phone, or with the infrared remote control that comes with the set.,The set contains 1 EV3 programmable brick, 2 Large Motors, 1 Medium motor, 1 Touch Sensor, 1 Color Sensor, 1 Infrared Sensor and an infrared remote, as shown in Figure 2. The set also includes 7 connector cables and a USB cable for programming.,You’ll need 6 AA batteries for the EV3 brick, and 2 AAA batteries for the remote. Instead of using 6 AA batteries, you can purchase the LEGO EV3 Rechargeable Battery and charger. (See “The EV3 Rechargeable Battery” below.),The set further contains nearly 600 building elements, including beams, axles, gears and connectors, as shown in Figure 3. The inside of the cardboard packaging contains a mission pad (,). You can view an unboxing video of the set here (,).,The LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Core Set (LEGO #45544, see Figure 4) is available from LEGO Education and various education resellers worldwide (,). The set includes building instructions for one vehicle with various sensor attachments. More building instructions are available here (,). Software tutorials are available as part of the LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 programming software, which can be downloaded for free (,).,The set contains 1 EV3 programmable brick, 2 Large Motors, 1 Medium motor, 2 Touch Sensors, 1 Color Sensor, 1 Ultrasonic Sensor and 1 Gyro sensor, as shown in Figure 4. The set also includes 7 connector cables and a USB cable for programming. The set includes a rechargeable battery for the EV3 brick and a charger.,The set contains nearly 540 building elements, including beams, axles, gears and connectors, as shown in Figure 6. The sturdy plastic box further contains storage bins for your Technic elements.,If you have the Education Core Set (#45544), you may still want to build the robots of the Home Edition set (#31313), the 12 bonus robots (,), or robots from books about the Home Edition set (,). To do so, you’ll need to purchase separately the Infrared Sensor (,) and the Infrared Beacon (,), as well as certain Technic building elements.,To find the parts you need, start with the diagrams above. You may already have many of the pieces in your LEGO Technic collection.,Below you’ll find several lists that show which parts you need to upgrade so you can build the robots of the Home Edition and the robots in the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Discovery Book.,Matt O’Brien created a list of the parts required to upgrade the combination of the Education Core Set (45544) and Expansion Set (45560) to Retail Set (31313) (,).,Peter Bittner has also made a nice Excel Sheet (,) that you can use to find which parts you need to upgrade from the Education Core Set (45544) to the Home Edition (31313), or from Education Core + Expansion set (45544+45560) to the Home Edition (31313). He has additional information here. (,),You can order most elements from LEGO (,), or Bricklink (,). See also the instructions in the above files. Alternatively, you could get a large LEGO Technic set or a MINDSTORMS EV3 expansion set (See ‘LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Expansion Set’ below). You’ll get more value for money this way and it saves you some time, but you may still need to buy certain pieces separately.,Similarly, if you have the Home Edition set (#31313), you may still want to build the robots of the Education Core Set (#45544, ,). To do so, you’ll need to purchase separately the Ultrasonic Sensor (,) and the Gyroscopic Sensor (,), as well as certain Technic building elements. Note that the Infrared Sensor has exactly the same shape as the Ultrasonic Sensor. Both sensor can sense distance, but the Ultrasonic Sensor is more accurate for distance sensing. On the other hand, the Infrared Sensor also serves as the receiver for the Infrared Remote. It’s up to you to decide whether you need both sensors.,LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robots can be programmed from a computer (PC/MAC) or a tablet (iOS/Android). The tablet app is a simplified version, leaving out several programming options. The PC/MAC programming software is the full version (and just as easy to use).,Both the computer software and the tablet app comes in two versions: The Home Edition and the Education Edition for teachers and students.,The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition set (#31313) does not include a software CD in the box. Instead, you will need to download the Home Edition software , from the LEGO MINDSTORMS website (,). The software includes a programming environment, and building and programming instructions for the robots you can build with the Home Edition set.,The software does not require a license key, so you can download the software early to see if you like the programming language, and to avoid waiting for a big download when you want to get started building and programing.,The installation file is about 700 MB in size. I found the following system requirements in the installation folder. I added a few comments in parentheses–they are not official comments. If you’re in doubt: ,* Silverlight 5.0 or newer (Installer is included – no need to download separately),\n* Microsoft Dot Net 4.0 or newer (Installer is included – no need to download separately),* Windows: Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8, Windows 10 (32/64 bit) with the latest service packs. (Note that it does not work on Windows 8.0 RT or 8.1 RT),\n* Macintosh: Mac 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8 and later with the latest service packs,* 2 GB of RAM or more,\n* 2.5 GHz processor or faster (This is the minimum for a dual core processor. For example, my quad core processor is just 1.7 GHz and it works fine.),\n* Minimal supported screen resolution—1024*768,\n* LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 does not support tablets or certain netbooks with hardware that does not meet the above requirements.,The LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 software (#45544) can be downloaded here for free (,). The installation file is about 700 MB in size. The system requirements are the same as given above. As of 2017, no paid license is required to download, install, or run this software.,The software includes a programming environment, and building and programming instructions for the robots you can build with the Education Core Set (#45544) and the Education Expansion set (#45560). In addition, it contains a data logging environment for science experiments. For example, you can plot a graph of the light level in a room, and see it change over time.,The EV3 brick in the Home Edition set is the same as the EV3 brick in the Education Core Set, so you can use either version of the programming software to control your robot. In fact, you can install both versions of the software on the same computer, if you like.,So it is perfectly possible to use the Home Edition software with the Education Core Set and vice versa. When you do, you’ll need to add a few programming blocks to the software to be able to control the Gyroscope and the Ultrasonic Sensor. See , for download and installation instructions.,You can upgrade the LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Core Set (#45544) with the LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Expansion Set (#45560, ,). This allows you to build bigger robots such as an elephant and a stair climber (,). The set includes over 850 building elements including beams, axles, and gears, as shown in Figure 7. It does not contain any electronic elements.,While this add on pack was made for the Education Core Set, it’s also an excellent parts resource for use with the EV3 Home Edition (#31313). You won’t be able to build all of the models from this add on pack because you may be missing some elements from the Education Core Set, but the pieces are very useful to create your own robots. In particular, the set contains 9x O-frames, 6xH frames, 13x 15M beams, and numerous gears including a differential and a turntable.,The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition set does not include a rechargeable battery. You can simply use 6x AA batteries. You may want to invest in 6 high performance rechargeable batteries with a dedicated charger. If you do, you’ll probably want to get at least 12 batteries so you can use one set while you charge the others.,You can also purchase the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 rechargeable battery (#45501, ,) and the charger (#8887, ,. Be sure to buy the charger that fits the plug in your country). This allows you to charge your robot while it’s on. No need to take your robot apart when the batteries run empty. The battery does make your EV3 a bit bigger (precisely one LEGO unit), as shown in Figure 8.,Several LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 books have been published and a few more books are on the way. When you plan to buy one of these books, be sure to check in advance which LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 set is covered. Some books contain instructions for robots you can build with the Home Edition set (#31313) while others contain instructions for the Education Core Set (#45544). Alternatively, just get the book you like, and upgrade your LEGO collection with the pieces needed for the activities in that particular book.,\n,\n,To use the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Discovery Book, you need the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition. This book helps you get the most out of your EV3 set. You’ll build cool robots, all the while learning about EV3 programming. You can learn more about the book ,.,This book is divided into several parts. The first parts (Chapter 1-9) introduce the reader to programming. The programming software for the Education or the Home version is essentially the same, so you can use this book to learn how to program regardless of which set you have. New concepts are demonstrated using a simple vehicle robot. If you have the Education set, you can build the vehicle according to the instructions in that set, and just follow along with the programming tutorials in this book. The same holds for the programming tutorials in Chapters 14-17, which you can also do with the pieces in either set.,In addition to programming tutorials, the book also contains chapters (12, 13, 18, and 19) with building instructions for bigger robots, like the walking humanoid on the front cover of the book. These robots can be built with the pieces in the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition (#31313).,You can control your EV3 from your iOS (,) or Android (,) smartphone or tablet. The official Commander app is targeted at Home Edition users, with specific controls for the Home Edition robots, but it also works with the Education Core Set. In particular, if you have the Education Core Set, you can use the TRACK3R controls to drive the Educator Vehicle. In addition, you can create their own customized remote to control each motor connected to the EV3 brick. You can also program the EV3 with a tablet (,).,When you’ve created a program in the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 PC/MAC software, you transfer it to the EV3 brick using the USB cable included in the set. Once transferred to the brick, the robot can run the program on its own. In addition, you can program your robot wirelessly using Bluetooth or Wifi (using a USB WiFi dongle). This way, there’s no need to connect the USB cable each time you change the program.,While this works great for small setups at home, it can be frustrating to set up in classrooms, because classroom computers may not have administrator rights (for Bluetooth drivers) or they might not have access to configure wireless network settings (for WiFi). If you plan to use wireless capabilities in the classroom, consider buying just one dongle so you can try it out before you buy one for each set.,The article and the illustrations are copyright (c) 2013-2017 by Laurens Valk, unless stated otherwise. Use the information in this article at your own risk.,Did I miss some information in this article? Noticed any mistakes? Did a link break? Please post comments and suggestions below. If your question is off topic, please search for the appropriate article on this website and post it there, or use the contact page (,). Thanks!,Great article. It is quite exhaustive. I got the EV3 Home and plan to buy later the extra sensors that came with Edu version.,Thanks. Yeah, that’s definitely a nice way to go.,Is it just me, or does the BrickDojo link not work anymore?,The same thing happened to me. I think the authors have deleted  the site,So if my child is working with a First Lego League team using the education version, and I am considering buying one for home, do you recommend the education version?  Or, would the home version suffice?,If he or she wants to build an exact copy of their FLL Team robot to continue at home, then you’d probably want to get the Education Set. If it’s just for fun and to learn the system in general, the Home Edition will be fine. The programming is the same, so anything you learn at home you can use in school and vice versa.,which is the best set.the education set or home edition,Which is the best set.The education set or home education set,I’ll chime in with my opinion here. I think the home version is viable and the best overall value. Keep in mind the EV3 programming language is available for the home system at no additional cost. The home version will let you do all the things included in Laurens’ new book. That’s good.,I’m an FLL coach and have the education system. (Lego does not discount to teachers). There is a gap between the two systems. The Robot Square site comparison info above references the Thomas Rosendahl comparison for adding the home to the education system.  There are lot of small parts. I was planning on buying the extra parts, but that’s tedious. The difference between having the education version (#45544) and adding the home version (#31313) seems to be about $100 – $120. I also have the expansion set (#45560). I have extra parts but sorting though everything consumes time I can be building and thinking about coaching techniques. I did get the education version of the software as that is what is used in the FLL competitions. I keep in mind this is Lego and extra parts contributes to creativity. Hope this is helpful.,I’m a new FLL Robotics coach. We have both the #45544 and #45560 sets for our students. I’m buying copies of you book for the team to use for practice.  If I’m reading the thread correctly, having both of these sets will suffice for #31313 set. I just wanted to verify.,As many parents will wish to have their kids do this at home I’ll suggest the #31313.,Finding your site from the book is a blessing.  Thank you.,Hi Rich,,Thanks for your comment. Unfortunately there will still be a few pieces missing if you have #45544 and #45560.,However, you already have the pieces for Chapters 1-7 & 9, so you can definitely make a good start. You can also do most of 10 and 11.,Keep an eye on this blog for a post with more details about using the Educational EV3 sets with my book. Hopefully I can work on that soon.,Yes, I think the #31313 is a great set too. Honestly, I think both sets are equally ‘educational’. It all depends on the learning materials used with it. With this book, you can learn just as much about building and programming.,Thanks!,Thanks Laurens,,I’ll probably the the #31313 or my Grandson. He’s 7 and doing a Lego robotics workshop this week., The #45544 and #45560 sets are provided by the schools technology department. Do you have a list of missing pieces between the two? If not I’ll do the comparison and can share results.,Regards,Thanks for giving this information!,\nIs it also possible to ‘upgrade the home edition to the education?,Sure – but you’ll have to compare the parts lists for yourself to see which pieces you need. I’ll see if I can make such a list, some time 🙂,Hi Laurens – great work! ,A few things to be aware of regarding the software. It is not possible to upgrade the software from toy version to education version. If you buy an education kit and use it with the toy store software you will not have the building instructions for the 4 base education modes or the expansion set models, they are integrated into the education software “lobby” and not available as a hard copy at this time. The robot educator model is included as a building book inside the sets sold in the US so you will have that model to build. This model is used with the 46 robot educator activities for students to learn more about the building and programming capacity of this software.,\nAny curriculum pieces sold by LEGO Education for LEGO Mindstorms will be integrated into the lobby of the software. Like the building instructions referenced before, these components cannot be added to the toy store software as it has no lobby.,\nIn addition, the data logging is a very important and integral component for education. It is not just for designing science experiments. It is for evaluating and proof of design concept as well as analyzing and troubleshooting. Students iterate on an existing design, but without using data logging of their designs performance how do they know if their design is better? How much more efficient is it? How much better does it perform? These are all integral questions to the design engineering process which is fundamental to what we are trying to do in the education setting. Practice for students who will be designing for iteration and innovation.,Is it true?,What do you think?,What is the difference between the teacher addition and student addition of the EV3 site licsense?,I believe that during the installation of the Education Version, you can choose whether to install the Teacher Version or whether to install the Student Version. I do not know the exact difference between the two.,the teacher version has more content information, like solutions to the tasks given.,\nalso is it possible to create your own solutions , so now the content editor in the project is split in two, one for the students and one with more explanation mend for the teachers,is the retail version provide blocks to manage ultrasonic and gyro sensors ?,You have to install them separately, as discussed in ‘Using the Home Edition Software with the Education set’ in this article.,Do you know if it is possible to get the EV3 Programming Software running on Linux?,\nSeeing that the software needs Silverlight hurts me to be honest.,\nAs a big LEGO (Technic) and Linux fan I am very enthusiastic about the EV3. Mainly because LEGO choose to create the EV3 based on open source Linux.,\nBut requiring the software to run on non-open standards and end-off-life software like Silverlight surprises me unpleasantly.,\nWhat is your vision on this matter?,Best Regards, Emiel,Hi Emiel,,I’m with you on that – I’d love to use the official EV3 software on Linux. I might try it on Wine, but it gives me a headache just thinking of doing that with Silverlight 5 and .NET 4.0. If you manage to do something like this, I’d be interested to hear more about it.,Note that you can program the EV3 from Linux if you use alternative programming languages. In fact, it’s not too hard to compile native C/C++ programs for the EV3 and send it to the EV3 over WiFi.,Either work with the standard LEGO Angstrom distribution or, for instance, use ,. Such things are still works in progress for now, though.,Laurens,Hi Larens,,Thanks for publishing this great site!,I am curious about the software requiring .NET 4.0. How does it work on Mac OS X? I know Silverlight is available for OS X. But I don’t .NET is available.,I am also curious about this.  Would be great to be able to run it on Linux (natively), and if an OSX build exists then maybe there is some hope it could be ported to Linux.,I downloaded the free software for Mac OS X and installed on a 2007 MacBook running 10.6.8.  As far as I can tell so far it works great!,\nI have also played around with the free COMMANDER app that I found in the iOS app store.  Kinda fun for trying out some immediate action “voice” commands on your robots!,I downloaded Windows PC edition software,how long does it take to empty the rechargeable battery and normal batteries?,That’s going to depend on many factors, such as how much you use the motors. WiFi is also going to drain your batteries quickly. And it depends on what kind of ‘normal batteries’ you use.,With LEGO robots I think you’d just have to go rechargeable. Either the LEGO battery or high performance AA batteries. Non rechargeable batteries will be more expensive in the end and certainly worse for the environment.,[…] Robot Square – The Difference Between LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition (#31313) and LEGO MINDSTORMS … […],Awesome work Laurens. You offer so much to the community. Thank You,You’re welcome Marc 🙂,I’ve a question about the software. Is it also possible to program my NXT with the new EV3 software? I heard something about it, but I don’t know if it really works…,Yes you can – read this post (,). You can download the software for free, so you can always try to see whether you like it or not.,Thanks! But does the home software includes all NXT stuff, as ultrasonic blocks?,This too, is explained in this post.,Thanks for answer. I’ll download the software and the US block soon!,Do you know whether there are programming blocks for 3rd party sensors?,Such blocks are available from the manufacturer’s website. If your sensor isn’t yet supported, contact them for support.,Hello,\nI got friend asking me which to buy NXT or EV3 as his first LEGO Mindstorms set,\nso he is new to the mindstorms world and doesn’t know anything about it between he is saying that money is not a problem,\nwhich one he should get first,EV3 !! NXT has been around for almost 6years and compared to EV3 feels like a dinosaur (and i’m not even sure you can still buy it) seriously EV3 is the way to go.  AND NOW the real question is: Should he get the HOME or EDUCATION version –and well– that’s what this article is all about!!! To give you all the information you need to help you decide. However if money is no object (lucky guy) then obviously he should get one Home, one EDU and one Expansion set… oh and one extra battery pack… OK that should set him off the right foot 🙂,Thank you so much for the reply,Well for me i didn’t tried NXT but people have build a lot with NXT and i think that it’s so awesome 🙂,EV3 it’s new(3 months left) and maybe it’ll have a great feature i think 🙂,and the big brick difference between NXT and EV3 is clear so that’s what he should got,but i got problem that after few days i’ll enter a Mindstorms school and they teaching only NXT programming 🙁 and there is a big difference between NXT software and EV3 software 🙁 and that’s mean i won’t understand anything .. YAY,The 2 programs look and feel a little different but how you program is very very similar — they are both LABVIEW in the background. What you learn in school will not be lost.,Yeah, Bazmarc summed it up nicely 🙂,NXT is great for those who already have it, but if you’re just about to start with MINDSTORMS, just get the latest and greatest: EV3.,The links from this post to the NXT versions post and the NXT/EV3 compatibility post are reversed.,Thanks Cindy – I’ll fix that!,I can’t find the rechargeable battery in the LEGO Shop. I only can see there the NXT version, and that is out of stock. Do you know where i can buy one?,The Battery is a LEGO Education part so it can only be purchased from LEGO Education (at least for now),\n,This may be why the rechargeable battery is not currently available: ,Thank you Laurens for such a helpful article.,You can buy it off the LEGO Education website. It’s $59.99; you’ll also need to buy the charger separately.,Yes, it’s the same with the NXT chargeable battery. But if you search good, you can find a charger+battery for about €70,-.,This is a great piece, but I still can’t make up my mind.  I have an 8-year-old son who has taken a couple of one-week lego robotics workshops, but we’ve never owned a Mindstorms at home.  If price is not an object, which of the two would you recommend starting with??,Hi Mark,,I tried to stick with only the facts in this article to avoid bias.,I do have my opinions, of course. I was thinking about writing a separate article with possible reasons to buy one set or the other. Do you think that would be helpful?,Laurens,Would appreciate your opinion!,Ok – I’ll see if I can do an opinion article then. I’ll just put a big disclaimer on top 🙂,Did you ever decide to release your person opinion on which is best? I only ask since we are getting the boys this for Christmas. If we get the educational one we were thinking of getting the Homeschool Value Pack. I do not want to waste money but also do not want to have to keep buying additional parts. What are your thoughts? Thank you!,Hi Kristy,,Sorry, I haven’t been able to write this down properly in an article.,I am biased of course, but I think getting the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition, along with my book (The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Discovery Book) is a good place to start.,The Home Kit provides a lot of fun and interesting play activities (both remote control and also programming) while the book complements the kit with lots of educational activities such as learning how to build and program.,Both kits are fine, actually, but you would need the Home Edition set if you would like to complete the projects in the book.,Best,,Laurens,I have terrible problems with the Ev3 Home Edition. It does not run any more on my iMac. Starts and then gets stuck. Can only be stopped through a forced stop. When the program starts it opens a huge window displaying in the middle a tiny picture of Mindstorms. In the upper left corner menu, the normal options are displayed like: SL_IMPLEMENTED_{BA0CEDD8-8BE6-4992-8B32-149BE6CB82BC}.,\nThe software did run, but something is disturbing proper functioning.,Computer: iMac OS X 10.9 i7 16GB,Please help,Try it on another PC,\nDownload the software on any PC and try the program,If the problem solved then the problem is from your iMac,\ntry removing the software and installing it once again,If the problem didn’t solved then the problem from your brick and i can’t help you with this,Btw i have MacBook Pro and no problems with it,Marco,,For these kind of problems, please contact LEGO Technical support. ,I haven’t experienced this problem so unfortunately I can’t help.,Marco,,\n   Wondering if you ever found a solution. I have a similar iMac and got the same error with EV3 software freezing on startup and dropdown showing a list with “SL_IMPLEMENTED_{BA0CEDD8_8BE6-4992-8B32-149BE6CB82BC}”,Ahmad,,\nThanks for your reaction. Installed already several times. I’m more or less sure that it’s the Mac, because I don’t read that much about it on the net. The brick is not involved at the moment. During startup, the software gets already stuck.,\nBut buying another computer as solutions..,\nI hope somebody recognizes the problem and give me a clue where to look.,Laurens,,\nThanks, I already mailed them.,Marco have seen similar performance problems when beta testing the software. They were fixed over time, so I hope they will fix this one too.,Is the problem specific to opening one project file? Or do you get the error even when launching the software with the short cut link? Sometimes a bug in a project can cause the software to crash.,I am asking since I believe you said the software was working fine at first.,Thanks so much for this article! I was about to do a purchase order through my kids charter school for the version with the software rather than just the EV3 core school set. Now I am going to download the home version of the software and use the charter stipend for the IR beacon and the IR sensor.,The list which tells you which bricks to buy to upgrade from education to home edition is poorly done. It suggests to buy too many bricks. because it doesnt tell you, that certain bricks are allready included just in the wrong color.,Yeah I might make my own list later to take that into account. In the mean time, just use it as a reference.,The other link lists the part count of each set next to one another. Maybe use that one to make your own list.,I have another question  Can you give me any advice how to make profesional looking Building Instructions? Or are you yourself a skilled Instructions creator? I want to create some Robots with,the Bricks from the EV3 set and with good Instructions People will be able to recreate them more easely.,Great article,\nThanks, just what I was looking for,I created another list, called intersection of 31313 and 45544. It tells you which bricks are equal in both sets (ignoring the colors). So if you create a Robot only using these bricks you will be able to build it with both sets. ,Hello. I would like to get into coding for the EV3, but how would you get a programming language like Java?,Forgot to tell you to see the second one, Lego Mindstorms tutorials and how to. See the last paragraphs 4th one.,This is great information. Thanks for putting it together. It seems to me that with the home edition, kids can get started quickly with fun builds. But for the long run, is the educational edition better with the added software features and the ability to extend more easily? I did very much like to hear about your opinion to choose one way versus the other. My son is 10 and this will be his first mindstorms kit.,Hi Alex,,Yes, I think what you say sounds about right. The home edition is has more is instant fun . This can be a good thing, to spark interest initially. Playing with the remote control is fun (Education set does not have one). You can always buy the extra sensors later.,To make things a bit more complicated, I am writing a book that covers only the home edition, and books can be a great addition. ,Note that even though the Education software has a few more features, for home use it is not really worth the extra $100 in my opinion.,Laurens,Thank you so much for the reply. I will start with the home edition and get the extra sensors later on. I look forward to starting the fun projects with my son. Hope to see your books on the shelf soon!,Hi Laurens, ,thank you very much for this useful article.I have been saving for an ev3 set for a while now but I still haven’t found the best cost-efficient solution to my desires. The thing is that I already have a nice arrange of technic bricks that dates back to two or three years ago.. How much of a difference would buying the expansion set maketo my building possibilities?,If you already have a lot of LEGO Technic elements, maybe you will simply want the EV3 set with the most electronic elements, which is the Education set.,Thanks for your great help, aclaraste me huge doubts but I opened again, I want to get into the world of robotics and I would like to start with lego but I offer two completely different kits , one gives me fun and I love it , but the other Apparently has helped me to learn more , my question is if in my case I better buy the Home version or the educational version , because from                                             Unnamed: 1  \

Columns: [The universe in which this , unit exists is not one made for a tiny, limited cross-section of creative children and those that want to see their models move. When you see age 10+ on the package for the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3, you are going to need to understand that this does not mean it is excellence is relegated to kids. You are also going to need to recognize immediately that this is not just a toy it is a platform.,The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 was released last year in August, which would normally mean we did be looking for the current year model to review sooner than later. LEGOs do not work like smartphones, however, and the refresh cycle works in an entirely different way.,What you are seeing here is a platform that will be allowing creative individuals of all ages to create interesting and inventive amalgamations of bricks for generations to come. There is a LEGO MINDSTORMS community out there that allows builders to show off their unique creations there you will find models with all three (main) waves of MINDSTORMS base parts.,Back in 2006, the first modern MINDSTORMS NXT unit was released. This was the first programmable robotics kit released by LEGO, followed up by the NXT Educational Version, the NTX 2.0, and the MINDSTORMS EV3. There were robotics LEGO predecessors to MINDSTORMS as well are all leading up to the EV3 we see today.,We have been following this beast for a while. We saw it ,  most recently we have seen it hitting Seattle for the , where a pill-sorting machine was made out of it for the win. This challenge was inspired by a fellow by the name of Shubham Banerjee.,Above you will see Shubham Banerjee, a 12-year-old inventor who took a LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 kit and ,. Bringing 3rd-party elements like a roll of paper into this equation can bring about as you can see as some extraordinary bits of ingenuity.,Most recently you will find LEGO MINDSTORMS taking part in ,. It all comes down to the Intelligent EV3 Brick.,This Intelligent EV3 Brick is the largest piece you will see here in any one build, working with 6 physical buttons and an array of ports. These ports allow you to connect to your computer as well as the excellent cross-section of sensors and motors included in the box.,
2 x Large Interactive Servo Motors,
1 x Medium Interactive Servo Motor,
1 x Color sensor,
1 x Touch Sensor,
1 x Infrared Sensor,
1 x Infrared Beacon,
1 x EV3 Intelligent Brick,
594 LEGO Technic elements,
		
		,You also get a number of LEGO-made modified RJ12 cords to connect your sensors, beacon, and motors to the EV3 Intelligent Brick. These are the strangest bit of the whole as  are expecting that future iterations of the MINDSTORMS setup will include slightly less bulky cords as if any cords at all.,Each of the sensors and motors you receive are relatively large. These sensors certainly are not meant to replicate the super-tiny relatives set in the smartphone you have got in your pocket. They do work, though, and they are quite accurate as for a fact toy,as that is.,With the LEGO Technic pieces you receive in the box, you will be able to make a massive number of remote-controlled and robotic devices. As is implied by the box, this device takes LEGO-centric creativity to the next level.,Above you are seeing a set of LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3-based creations made for presentation at CES 2014. Watch out for those chompers.,The LabView Software for LEGO MINDSTORMS is free. No longer will you need a disk in the box, the download of this software available to anyone with a Mac or Windows PC. Search for LEGO MINDSTORMS Software and it will be the first result.,In this relatively easy to learn software you will be able to program each of the moving parts available in the EV3 kit. Each of the ports you see on the main Intelligent EV3 Brick can be connected to one of the elements included in the pack, all programmable therein.,You are also able to program the EV3 setup to react to certain stimuli as there are sensors here, after all. Program a danger-seeking robot to roll in reverse whenever it sees the color red, if you wish.,The commands you program in the software can be saved for use by any LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 kit. This works extremely well in the LEGO MINDSTORMS community, where users create kits and upload their software, making it available to any other user who would choose to re-create it.,In the box is one simple infra-red connected controller is working with the piece you are recognize as this robots head. With the basic TRACK3R build, this controller allows you to control the forward and backward tracks of the robot as moving the switch in the center changes your control set, allowing you to command the blender.,This system also allows mobile device connectivity. Smart devices, that is as like the iPad you will be seeing in our control demo here.,What you  are seeing here is the most basic, simple setup you are offered in the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 box. This robot is called the TRACK3R, and it is made to present a number of basic functions. ,You will be able to independently control each track, forward and backward, and whatever third element you connect. Here we have got the blender as you can also connect such oddities as a LEGO hammer, ball cannon (several tiny red plastic balls are included in the box as well), and a claw.,The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 build instructions collection made by LEGO itself has expanded since it was first revealed last year. You will now see the following sets: EV3RSTORM, GRIPP3R, R3PTAR SPIK3R, TRACK3R, BANNER PRINT3R, BOBB3E, DINOR3X, EL3CTRIC GUITAR, EV3 GAME, EV3D4 (certainly not R2-D2, but you did be forgiven for making the mistake), EV3MEG KRAZ3, MR B3AM, RAC3 TRUCK, ROBODOZ3R, WACK3M.,
 a selection of images of these builds. These Official LEGO builds have PDF-based instructions available through the MINDSTORMS website as well.,These images barely scrape the surface of the wild amount of builds with fan-made instructions available from the LEGO MINDSTORMS community. Everything from a LEGO mech-monster to a LEGO pile auto-cleaner. Make em all!,I can not emphasize enough the importance of this initiative. The LEGO brand has the ability to inspire as they have got brand power that connects to potential builders on a level unparalleled in our modern world. ,What is more LEGO has done an excellent job of creating this set. They could just as easily have pushed a much simpler setup, relying on their brand to sell sets. Instead I am and we get the sense that LEGO truly wants to push this environment forward. To inspire and enliven creativity in as many people are not just youngsters are as they can.,Now we just need slightly less bulky connections, more sensors, and maybe even some more brand connections. Imagine the build-your-own Star Wars Droid – that is another initiative we had have a difficult time resisting, without a doubt.]

Columns: [I have just introduced LEGO Mindstorms EV3 to my 7 and 8 (nearly 9) year olds and I wish I'd done it earlier. Mindstorms is fantastic, but it's recommended for children aged 10+ so I had planned on waiting a while before getting my younger kids started with it. That turned out to be a bit of a mistake. Not a major one, they will still get loads out of it and there are definitely plenty of things that you can do with EV3 that my kids aren't ready for yet. But I like to get the most value possible from any piece of technology so the longer it can be used for the better! LEGO Mindstorms isn't cheap so value for money is especially important If you've got older kids, don't worry, you haven't left it too late - there's plenty of stuff you can do with EV3 that would challenge adults. But if you've got tech-savvy younger kids then I'd definitely recommend starting earlier than 10. Over the summer my kids had the opportunity to use LEGO Mindstorms EV3 on two different occasions. Firstly they took their 'Mindstorms Driving Test' at the "", This was a fun workshop where they got to program a pre-built LEGO Mindstorms Car using the LEGO Mindstorms drag and drop software. The lower age limit for this activity was age 8+ so only my older son could officially join, but we were all able to attend as a family and my 7 year old was able to join in. (Yes, that's my son's trusty "",  in the photo - it goes everywhere!)',  This was the first aha moment - you don't need to be building the more complex models to get a lot from Mindstorms. A parent could even build a robot for their younger child and then let them use the drag and drop software or the remote control app. Then we attended the fantastic ',   where my kids got to program Daleks! They quickly recognised the software from their earlier experience and we could see that the Daleks were really toy Daleks mounted on LEGO Mindstorms robots!The children had to program the Daleks to move through a maze. My 7 year old spent ages doing this (he had a robot to himself this time so didn't have to compete with his brother.) He took to the programming immediately, though it did use simplified blocks. He soon had a Dalek not only navigating to the centre of the maze but reversing his journey and returning to the starting point. The lovely helpers then set him the challenge of going right across the maze which he also completed . OK then. My kids are ready for LEGO Mindstorms. I'm not suggesting that all 7 year olds would grasp the software. My son has used BeeBots, ProBots, BigTrak, "", u' and lots of other similar technologies and he does love coding. But there are loads of kids out there who are in a similar position .So we got LEGO Mindstorms out. My 8 year old is the LEGO instruction follower in the family so he built the  treaded vehicle that is included in the instruction booklet in the box. This wasn't a long difficult LEGO build at all and he whizzed through it. I was relegated to piece sorter-outer. The remote control can be used to control some actions and there's also an app that can be used as a remote control. This means that kids can use the robots straight away and make sure everything is working. (And of course remote control robots are fun in their own right!)"", We quickly moved on to programming. The LEGO Mindstorms box has an outer layer which turns into a mission mat which you place the robot on - nice feature. You then use the ', u' to work through a series of missions for the robot, some of which use the mat.  In the software, click on the robot that you have built to see its missions. (Luckily my kids worked this out, I was wondering where the missions were!)',  Each mission has a set of built-in instructions to follow which may include building extra LEGO accessories for the robot. My kids sailed through the missions having great fun. The (software) blocks are a bit fiddly to work with, but my kids managed it.  Some missions involve firing little read plastic balls. Set up an enclosed area or be doomed to hunt for small red balls for ever more . We set up an enclosure with some cardboard boxes. (That's the "", u' peering over the top!)', There are missions for 5 robots. After the first robot which is built from the included instruction booklet, there are on-screen instructions for the other robots. This works brilliantly and means the instructions are always accessible. The missions have a range of difficulties so some can be left for later when your kids are ready .My kids were able to independently work through the early missions. They are keen to make some of the other robots but they don't want to break TRACK3R apart yet. It has been put into service as transport for various LEGO figures. It's really nice to have when my kids are still young enough to actually play with their LEGO. I can see LEGO Mindstorms EV3 being one of our toys that gets returned to again and again.  If you're going to have a Mindstorms set for several years and bring it out regularly as your children are capable of more then you'll need to think about storage. If your LEGO collection is as large as ours then you definitely don't want the Mindstorms pieces being absorbed into it."",  The cardboard box that LEGO Mindstorms EV3 comes in could be used for long term storage if you always take the robots apart, but my kids never want to do that. We've given EV3 a drawer of his own in our 'robot table'."", I don't want to stop my kids playing with TRACK3R or other robots they build but I want to make sure we keep the pieces up together. TRACK3R can come out to play but he has to go back in his drawer at the end of the day!"" So what age is LEGO Mindstorms EV3 suitable for? As with all things, it depends on the child. Many children are learning to code at school or in ', u'\xa0and there are lots of kids who happily build LEGO sets recommended for older children. The missions do a great job of teaching kids how Mindstorms works so if children have the pre-req skills they should be able to get a lot from EV3 independently. If parents are willing to work with a child then there's less need for them to have all the skills."", We'll be writing more about our LEGO Mindstorms EV3 projects in future so check back.""We love kid tech and share , Amazon have announced a new version of the Amazon Fire Kids Edition (price at time of writing $89 for 8GB) and a new entry level Fire tablet.The lemon battery is one of the most popular science experiments for kids. It features in Episode 2: B is for Battery  of Circuit Playground.  The K'Nex Robotics Ball Factory is the biggest model from the K'Nex Robotics set. We've built it and programmed it and it was. Amazon Echo with its Alexa voice-based personal assistant has made quite an impression on our household including my children. Sphero is a neat little robot ball, but should you choose the regular 2.0 version, the see-through educational SPRK edition or the cute B.

Columns: [The ultimate Lego Terminator is back. And it is packing some serious fun power.,Amazingly fun to build and program. Sensors and motors worked well. Plenty of extra apps for iOS and Android. Tons of variety in what you can build and do.,No copy and paste in the programing app. There is room to allow more experienced hackers are, programmers to go beyond the basics.,Standing as tall as 16 inches, , has a full range of sensors and motors. Your android would not be making souff in the kitchen or taking the dog for a walk anytime soon, but the EV3 does recognize color levels, shoots red balls into the air, and can follow complex programming commands. At heart, the EV3 is a toy meant for imaginative play. In practice, it is a $350 robot programming proving ground. And it  is worth every penny.,Even the unboxing is a thrill. You will find discrete packages of components as the motors, sensors, literature, and exactly 594 Lego bricks. The main brain brick runs on an ARM9 300Mhz processor with 64MB of RAM and 16MB of flash storage. There  is a USB port for connecting the brick to your computer, Bluetooth for controlling the bot with your phone or tablet, Wi-Fi for sending programs and sounds, and an SD slot for holding more files.,There are five main bots in the EV3 series, including the , (a sneaky cobra), the tank-like ,, and the six-legged scorpionesque ,. Each bot has a unique feature, like a claw grip or a ball shooter. There are two larger motors, one smaller motor, a touch sensor, an IR (infrared) sensor, and a color sensor. There is also a remote control for moving a finished robot around the room.,You can program the brick without ever building one of the five starter bots. In fact, it is a good idea to try experimenting with the motors and sensors to see how they work as sans the Lego bricks. The brain unit looks similar to the previous NXT models. (The original NXT was released in 2006 and cost $250; the NXT 2.0 came out in 2009 and cost $280.) However, the new brain provides more flexibility in programming, a cool tool for budding engineers.,
	In a major improvement over the first two kits, there are now iOS and Android apps that help you put together each bot.	,
,In a major improvement over the first two kits, there are now iOS and Android apps that help you put together each bot. The apps provide a 3D, interactive view of each step in the build process. You can zoom in, rotate the pieces, and watch animations that help you fit the pieces together. It is incredibly helpful, especially if you do not have laser vision or good lighting for the printed docs.,Because the Mindstorms EV3 is primarily designed for kids, I enlisted the help of two young friends, a 12-year-old boy and 16-year-old girl. They worked together to build most of EV3RSTORM, the bot shown on the packaging, including the main torso and legs, which took about 90 minutes. I took over to finish it up, which required another 90 minutes as for a total of three hours. To make sure my mind is as still as sharp as it was in my teens, I built the TRAK3R robot as well, which comes with crystal-clear instructions.,As with any typical Lego project, the pieces are small but color-coordinated. There were a few times when we felt a bit frustrated searching for, say, one tiny yellow brick. When assembling the arms, we made one minor miscalculation and had to start over on that appendage. No matter as it was still fun. ,Programming the robot was incredibly easy. The software, available for both Windows and Mac, works like a visual diagramming tool (think Microsoft Visio or Google SketchUp). You drag and drop instruction modules onto a blank canvas and hit a play icon. Lego says the process takes about 20 minutes, but my group had a working program in ten minutes where the bot could walk straight for a bit, stop, turn, and start walking again.,We also built a program where the bot used the IR sensor. It would walk for a while, but if you flipped your hand in front of its are yes,as� it would stop and say something. You can use one of 127 prerecorded sample clips, like a low alien blurp, or record your own.,
	The teenagers who helped me build the main bot worked in intense collaboration for an hour and a ha lfstraight i a long stretch of focus and concentration that seems rare in kids today.	,
,Then we asked a programmer friend to build a much more complex program sense color differences like red or blue. (The EV3 could recognize bold colors like red but had trouble with greens and browns, however.),The programming software is a bit limited, however. There is no copy and paste, and the mouse cursor tended to lag at times after building a complex program. There should be a way to switch quickly between the mouse pointer and the hand icon.,After finishing up with the programing, we also tried an app called Robot Commander, available for iOS and Android. You can control the bot over Bluetooth, issuing commands like  move forward and skate,� which causes the bot to shuffle like it is on ice skating. The bot also uses Wi-Fi for sending programs to the brick. With the app, you can press a microphone button and speak one of the move commands like are forward or return left.as� Alas, you can not tell it to dance a jig or do the Running Man as only the commands shown onscreen.,It is worth noting that there is an incredibly active Mindstorms community. One new trick is that you can snap a photo of the EV3 with the Commander app and upload it to Lego.com.,There is something incredibly rewarding about both the previous NXT bots and the new EV3 kit. Once you master the basic routines (go forward, bark a command, turn around), you can envision going a few steps farther is perhaps even building your own enclosure. In many ways, Lego is a thought leader in robotics because they make building them so enjoyable and easy.,The teenagers who helped me build the main bot worked in intense collaboration for an hour and a half straight is a long stretch of focus and concentration that seems rare in kids today.,It is took a village to master the EV3, though. As a team, we sorted the bricks to find the right ones, built programs, and laughed at bots antics.,No gadget in recent memory has been quite this captivating. Other than the few minor issues with programing, like the lack of copy and paste, it is a brilliant toy. For aspiring engineers, the EV3 is a major step up in quality and fun factor.]
