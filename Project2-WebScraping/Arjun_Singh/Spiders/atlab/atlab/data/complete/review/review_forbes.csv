As a girl, the world steered me towards toys that fostered imaginary play: dolls, miniature furniture with pots and pans, a handful of stale Cheerios that doubled up as donuts. ,Nowadays girls are getting a little more encouragement to dabble in machines, with engineering games like GoldieBlox and a louder , about engaging them in STEM. ,LEGO brought out its third generation robot kit just over year ago. Anyone over the age of 10 can use it to create whatever their imagination throws at them, breathing life into their own machine with the magic of a programmable “brick” and six AA batteries. ,The brick is the best part. It's the brain of the machine. Containing an ARM A-9 processor with with 16 MB or memory, it would set you back $150 by itself. Crucially, you can program the brick by hooking it up via a USB cable to your computer, using downloadable software from LEGO that uses a simple-to-understand interface. ,The brick itself also has an interface on its front for some basic programming, such as to stop after sensing an object within a certain distance. The whole kit comes with a handful of sensors for detecting touch, color and infrared light, and there’s an option to buy an extra gyro sensor or ultrasonic sensor from third parties or LEGO itself.  ,Here are some of the robots you can make with all the  pieces that come in the LEGO Windstorm EV3: ,: Basically a foot-tall version of the Johnny Five robot from ,, with blades for hair and “grippers” that allow it to lift objects. ,: A six-legged scorpion creature with jagged legs that snaps at objects and swishes its tail,  depending on how you configure the sensors. ,: Fashion the LEGO Technic pieces into a cobra-like robot (with fangs!) that will quickly lash out at anyone who comes nearby to induce a mini-heart attack.    ,The kit comes with instructions for seven robots like the ones above, which LEGO claims can be made within about an hour, plus guides to make 12 more on the LEGO website. Once you’re familiar enough with the bricks, sensors and building components, who needs instructions? One 12-year-old , his EV3 to create a cheap braille printer for the blind.,The EV3 has been getting rave reviews from technology press and Amazon users, so while the price tag might be a little painful there’s a lot of fun (and learning) to be had by whoever uses it. ,LEGO hasn’t said how well the robot has been selling but it already looks like another niche success for the Danish toy maker whose sales have been growing at a steady pace for the last few years. On the back of the mega-successful LEGO movie earlier this year, it's recently been planting its flag across the world with a handful of new international offices. Flush with revenue, we can probably expect a new line of robot kits in the next year or so.     ,My only nagging concern is with how much LEGO will race to target that comfortably profitable market (boys) at the expense of encouraging another that’s been conditioned to ask for dolls at Christmas (girls). That doesn’t mean paint the EV3 pink. But maybe use some clever marketing to coax the girls that there is fun to be had with taking some control over machines, not least the kind that could be running their lives in the next few decades.  ,In the meantime I’d be happy do my bit and put the robot together with my young daughter - once I’ve played with it myself of course. ,is post is part of a series called “Gadgets We Love,” where Forbes’ staff and contributors write about the gadget they’re wishing for this holiday season.
