310 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product that sparks the imagination,By,H. Chan,on September 7, 2013,The LEGO Mindstorms EV3 (31313) is my first mindstorms product that I have ever owned so I can't compare it with the previous generations.  After playing with it for 6 days and building 4 of 5 the default models, I am simply left amazed, inspired and smiling from ear to ear.,The set comes in a large flat box with a removable outer sleeve that you can cut out to use as an obstacle course (the 1st basic EV3 model you build utilizes this).  When you open the box, the contents are contained in several plastic bags with the main computer brick (P-Brick) in a white cardboard box and instruction booklet and stickers in another plastic bag with cardboard backing.,Unfortunately, it doesn't come with any bins or boxes to store/organize the pieces.  So I suggest buying some storage organizer or if you happen to have the LEGO Mindstorms Education EV3 Core Set (45544) you can combine BOTH sets into the Education Core Set storage bin for one beefy development kit!! (more on that later),The instruction booklet gives you instructions on building the basic robot model and instructions for writing the program directly into the P-Brick to get you started.  The instruction booklet will point you to LEGO website to download the FREE ""EV3 Software"" which will comes with detailed instructions to build and program the other 4 standard models as well as 12 more models from the Mindstorms community.  The download is rather large (about 603MB download for the windows version) so you can download and try it out now and experiment before deciding to put down your money.,Once you download and install the EV3 software, you'll be guided through an intuitive interface that guides you to building the selected models.  Once you select the model, you will go over a series of missions that goes over building the Lego Model and Programming.  You can scan the QR code with your Android or iOS Tablet to download the free android/iOs app (Large 142 MB, so download it over wifi!!) called ""LEGO Mindstorms 3D Builder"" for your Android Tablet or iPad that gives you the build instructions in 3D (i.e. pan and rotate the LEGO pieces on a Tablet) or you can also view it through your web browser.,In each mission, you go through the build instructions and then the step-by-step programming instructions (or you load the completed program) and download it to the P-Brick over USB.  So far each model has taken me on average 1 - 3 hours to build (not counting programming) and about 1/2 hour to take apart.  As you build each model, you will learn the various design techniques and patterns in building your robot model.,After you program you robot model, the robot will either interact with you through the various sensors, running a simple loop or control it thorough the included IR Beacon/Remote.  You can also enabled the Bluetooth on the P-Brick and download the Android/iOS app called ""Lego Mindstorms Robot Commander"" and control the 5 basic models or custom model over bluetooth. My 4 year-old son loves interacting with R3PTAR model.,For the more advance user:,This is a great platform for learning linux (which is the main reason why I got it).  The P-Brick runs Linux on a ARM9 processor with 64MB RAM and 16MB Flash + up to 32GB of external storage via microSD.  You can communicate with it over wifi dongle via telnet (only supports Netgear WNA 1100) and the Linux source code is available and well documented.,As I have previously hinted, I have also purchased the ""LEGO Mindstorms Education EV3 Core Set 45544"" when it came out in Sept 1, 2013.  However it was designed to go with the Education EV3 software which costs extra ($99).  Fortunately the P-Bricks are the same in both kits and thus works with the Free EV3 software.  The education kit does contain some different sensors (e.g. ultrasonic and gyro sensor) and technic parts as well as a rechargeable DC battery and storage tray/bin which is large enough to contain both ""Retail"" and ""Education"" Sets in one box.  The Retail EV3 Software can support the ultrasonic and gyro sensors from the Education set if you enable a trick that you can find off of ""google"".,With these 2 sets you can daisy chain the 2 P-Bricks which will allow you to build more complex achines.,In summary, I'm am really happy that I got this fabulous and amazing EV3 mindstorms set.  It is easy to use, has a large community of users and has a large eco system (i.e compatible with the older NXT parts and 3rd party devices).  Its a bit pricey but for all the things that you can do with it, so its easy to justify its value.  Its a great way to introduce your kids to programming while having FUN!!,76 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,slight facelift, slow software, glaring difference(s),By,MahaRex,on October 30, 2013,********UPDATE 5 December 2013************,So after a reviewer pointed out that import from brick works for programs built on the brick itself, I updated my words to reflect the fact that it was user error on my part.  I'd still like to be able to use that function on programs written in the software that were sent to the brick though, although a PC-less brock to brick send with bluetooth is a neat feature and I'll have to see if that might be a workaround, although the teams robots are just different enough that a code written for one won't instantly work for the other; they would definitely need the ability to pull it into the software to make minor tweaks,********UPDATE 30 November 2013***********,I've changed my writeup below to reflect that you CAN easily download a module from the EV3 website that lets you use the gyro sensor for the home edition software.  After giving it some thought, I'll stick with 3-stars for now due to the other reasons listed.  If I could give this a 3.4, I would,******************************************,Original Writeup:,I purchased this kit because I regularly mentor a First Lego League (FLL) team (well 2 teams, from the same school) and wanted to be able to work on things from home without having to borrow their equipment (they have 2 new EV3 Education kits).  Not being an educator (in the formal sense) I purchased this version (i.e. not the education version) and figured that the biggest difference would be the data logging portion of the software not being part of the home edition.  I realize that with a little research, I might/should have known what I was getting (or not getting as it were) but at the end of the day some of the `deltas' between the Education version and this version are just so glaring, that I can't be satisfied with my purchase.,To start off positive, First, the things I like about EV3:,1 - I like the look of the new software, and some of the changes.  (see below),  A - One good example is how less brain power is involved in connecting data wires between certain types of blocks.  The effort it took to convert a number to text, although minor, seemed unnecessary to me in NXT; its much easier now in EV3 (although ironically I had to look up some info to make a basic motor test code because I was expecting to have to do extra steps),  B - I like that there are arrows on the sides and top/bottom of the screen so that you can scroll left, right, up, down without having to change to the `hand' cursor and click and drag the screen over (or zoom out/in, or do a click drag sort of deal which isn't possible on all peripherals).,  C - I like that you now have a project, and then tabbed programs as part of one overall project.  This makes organizing the codes we have for each task much easier.  (on the brick menu, you open a project folder, then the programs are listed underneath).,2 - I like the new look of the brick display(s) - the tabbed browsing and way that everything is displayed is much more intuitive, and space efficient,3 - I love the motor control, and port view functions on the EV3 - I was able to do a lot of good teaching about how the sensors work to the kids just by using a brick, wire and sensor (assembled robot not required),4 - Its great that there are now 4 motor control ports (versus 3 on the NXT).  This opened up the possibility of 4 motors in an FLL match, which increased the kids options in bots and assemblies that they build.,5 - SD card slot and USB - good, common sense add-ons,Now, my issues with it:,1 - The Software,  A - Its super bloated and slow!  I have a dual, dual core Xeon server board, velociraptor hard drive, nVidia GTX 265 with 1GB memory, 8 GB of RAM, and windows 7 64 bit ultimate, and it still lags for me!  I realize that my Xeon 5200 series CPU isn't quite `with the times' but that should be more than enough computing power to run this thing effortlessly.  I suppose Lego only has LabView to blame in this case. . . ., *******UPDATE*******,Part B below is no longer true - you can download a module from the Ev3 website that lets you control a gyro sensor using the home edition software.  I'll leave what I originally wrote below,**********************, B - Even if I buy a gyro sensor, the home edition software can't control it!  I can see not including this sensor in the kit, but I would think that's a bad business practice limiting the sale of a gyro sensor to ONLY the education kits?,  C - you can't open NXT programs in the EV3 software, and to my knowledge, there is no conversion available.  This is a problem, because the NXT community is well defined with lots of codes available to help the kids learn, and work their game board.  Having to transpose codes over, when you consider the differences mentioned above (data wires and such) won't necessarily be a drag and drop situation.,*********UPDATE**********,I've tweaked part D below after becoming aware that import from brick didn't do what I assumed it did(user error),*************************,  D - ""Import from Brick"" only works for programs that you wrote on the brick itself (as opposed to on the PC using the software).  I had high hopes for this so that we could easily share programs between our 2 teams, but when I tried it the only program that was available to import was the demo.  Although sending from brick to brick by bluetooth might be a workaround or sorts, the teams really need to be able to make a minor tweaks to the code to adjust for minor differences between their robots, so simply moving the program over to the other robot won't quite get the job done.,2 - You can't build the basic 'tribot' with the parts included.  The biggest part missing is the ball bearing (referred to as the 'ball pivot' on legoeducation.us).  Other parts are some basic angled connectors (seriously standard parts here), some basic axles of specific sizes (again. . . these are COMMON parts that aren't included) and some bigger wheels.  This is probably the MOST glaring difference between the kit, because these are parts that probably cost pennies.,3- LEGO's promises of the brick not acting up when the battery gets low were false.  I had 6 double A's in, brand new out of the box, and after a couple hours occasional use (we were working on and troubleshooting a line following bot) the brick FLIPPED OUT, during the line follower competition (yes, the competition).  The two robots the 2 teams built have had the same issue (although theirs is rechargeable - I have to take my robot apart to change the batteries, which is a real pain),In conclusion, I think this product line is great.  There is a ton you can do to educate, compete, challenge yourself, or just plain have fun.  The problems I have with it are the price tag considering how little has changed from the previous kit, and the glaring differences between the regular version and the education kit.  It made it uniquely hard, and required extra spending on my part, for me to most effectively help my team , Verified purchase only,All stars,Search,Showing 1-10 of 530 reviews,(Verified Purchases).
    ,5.0 out of 5 stars,By,on November 7, 2013,Verified Purchase,I am a seasoned RC vehicle veteran.  Over the last several years I've owned and operated nearly 50 different RC vehicles, ranging from basic starter trucks all the way up to $500+ vehicles.  My experience with RC vehicles led me to a Parrot AR.Drone, which has a few features on it that allow it to fly somewhat autonomously.  These autonomous features made me start looking into ways to make a regular RC truck more autonomous, which of course led me to start looking into robotics.,Years ago, when the very first LEGO Mindstorms set was released, I actually purchased one.  Upon getting it home, I decided that it was probably too advanced for me, and I ended up returning it.  Fast forward to this year.  While looking into ways to start getting into robotics, I headed to the store to buy a Robosapien X.  Although basic, the Robosapien X seemed like a good place to start with robotics, as it had a basic way of being programmed, and it had some options for modifying it to add features and accessories.  While at the store, I saw the Mindstorms EV3 set.  I was immediately in awe, as the box just draws you in.  I liked the looks of the models that it was showing, and knowing LEGO quality I knew it would be a product that functioned as good as it looked.  It was a bit pricey for me, so I passed on it initially.,A few days later, I kept thinking about the EV3 set, so I just went ahead and ordered one on Amazon.  It arrived quickly, as is the case for most of the things shipped from Amazon, and I was all set to get started.,Upon opening the packaging, you quickly realize that the outside sleeve is a ""course"" for the robots that you are going to build to navigate on.  It's a nice feature, and a good way to include something like this.  The cardboard is more sturdy than just a poster that folds up, so it seems like it will last longer than if it was made out of regular paper and included in the box.,After getting the box open, I started inspecting the things that were included.  Lots of parts, the motors, sensors, and that all important ""brain"" type of brick.  The instructions included are for building the first model, which is called Track3r.,I set about following the instructions to get the Track3r built.  It was a fairly quick build, with no real issues that popped up.  As is always the case the instructions were clear and concise and didn't leave me guessing at any point.  After getting the model built, I headed to my PC to download the EV3 software, which installed quickly and easily.  I then went about following the instructions for setting up my first program.,Now, I'm pretty tech savvy...however, I've never really tried any kind of computer programming.  This was the part of the Mindstorms EV3 kit that had me a bit concerned, as I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to wrap my head around it.,Luckily, the LEGO programming method is extremely easy to use.  It's a graphic system where you drag and drop ""blocks"" that serve as the commands, and then in those blocks you change settings in order to change what the robot will do when it reaches that portion of the program.,In a matter of minutes I had the first program written and installed, and the robot very quickly did exactly what it was supposed to do...it moved forward, spun a blade and knocked a tire off of a spot, then moved back to the starting point.,I was impressed.  I had managed to program a robot all by myself, and it didn't even seem to frustrate at all.,Over the next several days, I continued using the EV3 software to progress through the different models and ""missions"" that went with the Track3r.  I continued to not have many problems with the programming, and by about the third mission I realized something...the LEGO EV3 software was slowly, subtly, but surely TEACHING me programming.  Each mission was bringing new variables to the table that required different programming blocks and options.  It was so subtle that at first you don't even realize that you're being taught something, and to me this is ingenious.  Any time learning can be disguised as fun, I feel that it's something that will be more easily recalled and will be something that people WANT to continue to do.,After the first four missions, before even progressing to the final mission with the Track3r, I decided to give it a go at creating a program completely from scratch.  What I wanted to do was effectively ""reverse"" the Track3r, so that it's back was it's front and it's front was it's back, so that it could use the IR sensor as an ""eye.""  I then wanted the Track3r to move around on it's own, and when it came into a certain proximity of an object it would back up and turn around, then continue going.,It took me a little while to figure out a couple of the functions, mainly because I wanted the speed it reversed and the amount it turned to be ""random,"" but with the help of the great Mindstorms Community on LEGO's site, I was able to figure it out...and in fact, I figured it out while waiting for a response from that site, but then used the response just to check my own work.,After about a night worth of work, I had managed to create a program that had the Track3r roam about on it's own.  Whenever it would get within about 8"" of an object, it would back up (at a random speed), growl, turn around (a random amount at a random speed) and then move forward again.  With this program, the Track3r is effectively able to just autonomously roam around the room and not get stuck on anything.,Success!!!  I had built a robot, and programmed it myself with a program that I had built from the ground up.,I've had so much fun tweaking and adjusting this program that I've made, that I haven't really felt a need to move on to any more of the models.  That's not to say I'm not looking forward to moving on to those other models, I am, and I probably will start a new one this next week...but the ways I've been able to slowly tweak my program to do EXACTLY what I wanted it to do has been a lot of fun for me.,I believe that even though I've only gone through a small portion of what this set has to offer, I'm already convinced of this set's awesomeness.  This is, without a doubt, the best LEGO set I've ever had...and, dare I say, one of the best products I've ever bought, period.  Is it pricey??  Absolutely, but I believe it is worth every penny.  I've had so much fun with the first set of builds for the Track3r that I feel I've already gotten value out of the kit...and the fact that I have a ton of stuff left to do before I even start moving on to ground up models with ground up programs just says to me that this kit's value is through the roof.,Highly, highly recommended!September 8, 2013,Verified Purchase,My kids and I have played with the new EV3 for a whole weekend.  We've only built two robots and have otherwise experimented with the set.,Pros:,- Android interface is very good.  Not only can you control any of the five stock robots out of the box there is a nice interface for building controls for your own creations.  This means no figuring out how to control things!  It just works.,- Easy to build with a good selection of parts,- Nice techy look.  My kids built some spaceships while I built one of the harder, non-stock robots.,- Easy to program.  We used one of the downloadable extra robots and its code, but then used that to make our own modifications.  That makes it easy to start off with someone else's code and then later try to do all your own.,- Bluetooth works relatively easily.  I had troubles at first but now it works fine.  Don't mistakenly tick the box for iPhone thinking they mean any phone.  Leave that unticked if you're using Android.,- After your initial five robots there are several great downloadable robot instruction sets.,Cons:,- No built-in wifi.  This really should have been built in.,- Cable is mini USB instead of micro USB.,- Long bootup and shutdown time.  This is likely because the brick runs a full Linux build running on a slower chipset.  Takes time.,I have a five year old who likes to play with the original Mindstorms and an eight year old who prefers normal lego.  They were both interested in the look and style of the new set.  The younger one built something with interlocking gears and the older one used the new wing shapes to make some cool ships.,Once you get the lay of the land you'll find that this is very easy to use.  You have to download the software from the website - there is no CD.  However I tend to throw away CDs and do that anyway.  The book only covers the first basic tracked robot but that is fine.  All the rest of the builds require a computer.  You'll likely have a computer anyway to use this so that is fine.  However I find that it excels if you use a phone.  The EV3 app makes control a snap.,I've not tried to program from the brick yet.  It looks difficult and a bit confusing.  To program from a PC, if you've not done it before, you may want to purchase a book to learn what to do.  There are some videos online to help learn how to program too.October 3, 2013,Verified Purchase,I remember asking my mom for this type robot kit 25 years ago. It has finally arrived, albeit a bit late, this time for my son and I.,Lego has put together a very nice collection of pieces, motors, sensors, and a control brick that allows for lots of creativity. I was initially concerned that there wouldn't be enough pieces included build our own creations, but have been pleasantly surprised by the flexibility in the variety Lego has included. It would have been great to have gotten another medium motor or the gyro sensor, but I didn't want to pay more either. These are available from the Lego site.,The Tracker, the robot included on the paper instructions in the box, took less than an hour to build. You need to download the software as well as the models from the mindstorms site onto a computer to load the program into the brick. This is a fairly straightforward process, but isn't without its pitfalls. The graphical programming interface on the computer is nice and my 8-year-old son took to the basics pretty easily. We haven't tried the on-brick programming yet.,Overall this is a great set. My daughter and I participated in First Lego League last year with the previous generation of Mindstorms and had a good time with it. This set is definitely an improvement on a great product.,I attached a quick video review my son and I did along with some stills. Sorry for a few fuzzy parts, I guess the iPhone 5s' camera isn't that good with autofocus on robots. on October 22, 2015,Verified Purchase,I have waited for two years to write this review. There's a good reason for it.,I first bought these as a Christmas gift for my son when he was nine/fourth grade. The reason was that we had sent him to a day camp for a week that same year, and this was what they were using. EDIT: I did not know at the time that there was a difference in the ""retail"" vs. ""educational"" kits, and my son was getting frustrated over some of the things that he could not get the mindstorms to do that he could do at camp. If you get/got these after a Lego robotics camp, it's important to keep that in mind. END EDIT. He was initially ecstatic about them. He and my husband built a few things, and although my son is really focused on science and math, trying to build something on his own was intimidating for him. He didn't really want to build anything unless my husband could guide him. That wasn't what we were going for - my husband is a great dad and spends a lot of time with our son, but our goal was for my son to use his imagination and start creating things himself. We installed the software on my laptop, but as I was working from home at the time, that situation led to issues with trying to get things to work.,I found myself really resenting that I shelled out SO much money for toys that were just sitting there. We would find ourselves saying, ""Why don't you go do something with your mindstorms?"" and he'd look at us like he was being punished.,Over the course of the next year, he would build a few things, but only sporadically.,Fast forward to sixth grade/age 11. He's matured a bit (as much as one can expect of an 11-year-old). But I mean he's got more initiative and can create things without feeling the need to have dad with him. He does have a low-end smartphone, and we said he should get the mindstorms app so he doesn't have to rely on my laptop. He's creating all kinds of things, sending them into the living room to show us while he's in his room.,I think that even for a kid who was so geared toward things like this at age nine, he needed more time to really get into these. He's never been one to just build a lego set and keep it that way; he always pulls them apart to create things on his own, and those are usually pretty cool. I guess I thought that he would have been the same way with these, but perhaps the mindstorms were a little overwhelming. I'm not really sure, but I think my tip for anyone is that if their kid doesn't fully get into these right away, give it time. My son is actually using these as part of his science fair project this year. on February 22, 2014,Verified Purchase,My 10 year old son and I love the set we've been using since Christmas.  We had the NXT2 and had lots of fun with that over the years, but the look of the pieces and included robot (instructions) in the EV3 set are excellent.  The R3PTAR has especially mesmerized my son.,My one big gripe is the software makes it too easy to skip learning any programming.  When you go to program it gives you two options: Open Finished Program or Follow Step By Step Programming Instructions.  Hmmm.. if you are a 10 year old and can have the instant gratification of not having to spend time programming your robot why bother learning?  I strongly suggest this option be hidden in future releases of the software, so kids will spend the time learning what I think is an excellent intro to programming.  For me the programming justified the price of the kit.  It makes it much more than a typical Lego set. So far I have kept the Finished Program option away from my son and  he has enjoyed the programming, but if he sees he can just run the completed program before he gets the programming ""bug"" I fear it will be ""Game Over"".  Please fix this Lego!  Make a parent mode that can open the finished program (it can be handy) or just bury the option in a menu.,Otherwise it's a great set.  If you buy one and need a storage box (and you will) I recommend to Plano 5231 organizer.  I use them for both NXT2 and EV3 kits.  One of these and a label maker and all your pieces are organized in a durable, compact box. The EV3 book by Daniele Benedettelli is also good if you want to learn more about the EV3 without staring at the computer screen. Some great additional projects as well. on December 20, 2013,Verified Purchase,There is nothing wrong with the unit.  It works well.  However, you need to be aware that there are two versions of the product - a retail and and educational version.  This is the retail version.  The educational version has different firmware and comes with different set of sensors.  So it boils down to what you want from this unit.  According to the Lego representative I talked to, if you are just trying to learn robotics, this unit is fine, very well suited for that.  If you want to delve deeper into robotics, you may find this unit inadequate.,If you have already bought the retail version, and want to explore further, do not buy a new educational version.  Buy the educational programming software instead from Lego.  This allows you to update the firmware on the retail brick.  As to sensors, you can buy them either on the Lego site of maybe on EBay as you need.  That is what I ended up doing.  You will also be missing some of the bricks that come in the educational version, but again, you can get them elsewhere. on October 30, 2013,Verified Purchase,********UPDATE 5 December 2013************,So after a reviewer pointed out that import from brick works for programs built on the brick itself, I updated my words to reflect the fact that it was user error on my part.

The biggest part missing is the ball bearing (referred to as the 'ball pivot' on legoeducation.us).  Other parts are some basic angled connectors (seriously standard parts here), some basic axles of specific sizes (again. . . these are COMMON parts that aren't included) and some bigger wheels.  This is probably the MOST glaring difference between the kit, because these are parts that probably cost pennies.,3- LEGO's promises of the brick not acting up when the battery gets low were false.  I had 6 double A's in, brand new out of the box, and after a couple hours occasional use (we were working on and troubleshooting a line following bot) the brick FLIPPED OUT, during the line follower competition (yes, the competition).  The two robots the 2 teams built have had the same issue (although theirs is rechargeable - I have to take my robot apart to change the batteries, which is a real pain),In conclusion, I think this product line is great.  There is a ton you can do to educate, compete, challenge yourself, or just plain have fun.  The problems I have with it are the price tag considering how little has changed from the previous kit, and the glaring differences between the regular version and the education kit.  It made it uniquely hard, and required extra spending on my part, for me to most effectively help my team(s). on December 30, 2014,Verified Purchase,At first glance, the price was a bit more than I wanted to spend on my son's Christmas gift, so I decided to check out other robotics kits. All I found was babyish ""my first robot"" sets that did nothing more than any motorized Lego set could and had no possibilities for ""free play,"" or $900 kits that require soldering and a PhD. It was the only in-between I could find, so I went for it.,My son has Asperger Syndrome and his ability to create is astounding. He recently solved a puzzle (at school) that no one had solved in nine years! If you can swing it, this set is incredible. In just a few short days he's come up with all kinds of working ""robots,"" my favorite being a scorpion than shot a ball out of his tail every ten seconds. The programming is simple (and easily compatible with OS X), it's almost drag and drop. It allows for him to make what's in his head come to life. My proud parent mind is sure it's part of his path to MIT. :) He's almost 12 and needs zero supervision, no frustration, no tears.,For a child that has difficulty communicating and befriending peers, this is an amazing gift. The neighborhood kids are so impressed, they're all asking for his advice on Legos and other building projects. It's educational and definitely a plus for self-esteem. I've actually choked up a few times watching him. Thanks Lego and Amazon. on September 4, 2014,Verified Purchase,We have purchased a lot of LEGO® MINDSTORMS®  kits from Amazon in the past. My wife who teaches kids grades K5- 8 uses these kits to help them prepare for FIRST LEGO League (FLL) competitions as well as impart knowledge and spark interests in kids who wants to pursue Robotics in the future. These LEGO® MINDSTORMS® kits are must and provides the necessary building blocks for kids to get started with robotics.,The previous model , was popular with kids for several years which is now seen replaced with ,. From my understanding This is the third generation of the LEGO® MINDSTORMS® platform and the ""EV"" stands for evolution, hence EV3 in the product name. The NXT 2.0 seems to have been discontinued by LEGO® but in comparison I think EV3 is an natural evolution of the product as we move forward in sparking interests in kids.,There are some common parts that you need to identify as your child gets into building robots using this LEGO® MINDSTORMS® kits the most important part of this kit is known as ""BRICK"" - The LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Brick is a programmable intelligent Brick that you can refer to as 'The brain' of your robot - This BRICK controls motors and sensors to make it move, walk and talk; as well as provide wireless communication through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It is powered by QTY 6 AA batteries.,There are several other parts that comes with this kit like Building instruction for the starter robot, 'TRACK3R' Connecter cables, 1 USB cable for programming the brick, LEGO Technic Elements: Total of 594 pieces 1 EV3 Brick, 2 Large Interactive Servo Motors, 1 Medium Interactive Servo Motor, 1 Touch Sensor, 1 Color Sensor,  1 Infrared Sensor,  1 Infrared Beacon.,So what can you do with this kit? - There are five robots which you can build straight out of the box - the building instructions along with accompanying programs are available in the EV3 Software. In addition there are many more 'fan-made' bonus robots that can be accessed via the EV3 Software Lobby or via the LEGO website - all additional fan-made designs can be built using the elements from the LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 (31313) set sold here.,Apart from this if your child gets creative then they can make their own design. Also, If your child wants to participate in First Lego League then you must visit FLL website to determine this year's design and build a challenging design to compete with others in the same category. The year 2014's challenge and past years challenges can be found in my comment section.,Please note: The new software for 'EV3' is bloated and runs very slow even on high-end laptops. The previous generation of LEGO product used to use 'NXT' software. As stands, It is not possible to program this new 'EV3' Brick with the old 'NXT' Software which kids & educators still love. However, you can program your old 'NXT' Intelligent Brick using the new LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Home Edition Software.,Having said, as seen in practical classroom uses by kids not all Software features are supported by the old NXT Brick and can be frustrating at times. So we ended up having both the old 'NXT' software and the new 'LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Home Edition' Software side by side and preferably on a different laptops in order to co-exist with the new generation of bricks moving forward.,As far as using The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Sensors with the old NXT kit please be aware that the new sensors are completely digital and therefore will not work with the old NXT Intelligent Brick. However, LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Brick uses the same RJ12 connector cables as the old LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Brick therefore LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Sensors be used together with old NXT Sensors.,If you have a classroom wherein you have a mixture of old and new sets I strongly recommend that you keep them apart in separate storage bins and do not mix match the critical parts. We always purchase , to keep the kits safe after opening them.,Hope this review proves useful to you. on November 21, 2014,Verified Purchase,I'm a second year FLL (First Lego League) coach.  My team scored the highest points last year at the regional (and hope to do so this year too).  We used the NXT (last generation) last year.  We had lots of issues that I don't think the kids need to deal with as they have so much to learn already.  This year, we upgraded to this long-awaited new generation.  I'm sad to report that most of the issues stayed, just in a different form sometimes.  The major gripes I have are (in chronicle order of discovery):,  1. It takes FOREVER to start AND to shut down.  I saw that the memory is astronomical, compared to the NXT.  I don't know why they think kids can create 16MB of embedded code (besides, see a following point); and does it really have to take that long?,  2. With all that computing power, the Human-Machine Interface didn't get better.  The screen is just as small and low resolution; icons did not make any more sense than the NXT; it did not get brighter; there is no improvement to let you see longer names of programs...,  3. As we start to work on competition missions, the project management capability proved not any better than NXT.  It did get away from the useless ""profile"" setup of the NXT, but the new project/program-based setup did not prove to be any more capable of project organization.  I manage an algorithm team at work, but I couldn't find a good way to teach these kids about organizing and collaborating on programing for the EV3.,  4. The programing environment is different. Blocks changes... and it did get better.  However, it's not nearly better enough to make it a good environment.  At times the frustration level is intense, and I feel for the kids.  I had to encourage them and say ""when you become a real engineer, you'll have better tools - trust me!"",  5. As we get closer to competition, it proved difficult just to leave only the useful missions on the brick (and in a specific order) to facilitate quick pit stops.,  6. As we get closer to final programs, which are larger, bugs started showing up.  It took all of MY reverse engineering skills to help the kids find out that those are bugs with the EV3 and find reliable work-arounds.  These only happen when the program gets large.  But then again, I thought they put 16MB in there to let you build large programs.,  7. The on-line community help is slim.  A main reason is many problems people have are similar to what I experienced above - and there is simply no solutions or too hard to even diagnose.  If you're new to programing and embedded control yourself, then there are some good advices in the community to help.,That said, it's not an expensive toy for what it is.  Given the non-existence of competition, it provides a great platform for bringing the kids a LONG way into modern engineering.  Because of the problems I described, it is harder than necessary to reflect what they learned reliably in competition scores.  For that, I would give it a three star.  But this product by itself is not just for FLL, so I find it unfair to not give it an above-average score. LEGO,$19.37,5.0 out of 5 stars,by,LEGO,$15.88,4.8 out of 5 stars,Need customer service?

"I never much of an opportunity as a kid to play with mechanical engineering toys or anything remotely to do with robots. As a girl, the world steered me towards toys that fostered imaginary play: dolls, miniature furniture with pots and pans, a handful of stale Cheerios that doubled up as donuts. ,Nowadays girls are getting a little more encouragement to dabble in machines, with engineering games like GoldieBlox and a louder , about engaging them in STEM. ,LEGO brought out its third generation robot kit just over year ago. Anyone over the age of 10 can use it to create whatever their imagination throwsÂ at them, breathing life into their own machine with the magic of a programmable are brick and six AA batteries. ,The brick is the best part. It's the brain of the machine. Containing an ARM A-9 processor with with 16 MB or memory, it would set you back $150 by itself. Crucially, you can program the brick by hooking it up via a USB cable to your computer, using downloadable software from LEGO that uses a simple-to-understand interface. ,The brick itself also has an interface on its front forÂ some basic programming, such as to stop after sensing an object within a certain distance. The whole kit comes with a handful of sensors for detecting touch, color and infrared light, and there is an option toÂ buy an extra gyro sensor or ultrasonic sensor from third parties or LEGO itself.  ,Here are some of the robots you can make with all the  pieces that come in the LEGO Windstorm EV3 . Basically a foot-tall version of the Johnny Five robot from ,, with blades for hair and grippers's that allow it to lift objects, A six-legged scorpion creature with jagged legs that snaps at objects and swishes its tail, depending on how you configure the sensors. ,: Fashion the LEGO Technic pieces into a cobra-like robot (with fangs!) that will quickly lash out at anyone who comes nearby to induce a mini-heart attack.  ,The kit comes with instructions for sevenÂ robots like the ones above, which LEGO claims can be made within about an hour, plus guides to make 12 more on the LEGO website. Once you Are familiar enough with the bricks, sensors and building components, who needs instructions? One 12-year-old , his EV3 to create a cheap braille printer for the blind.,The EV3 has been getting rave reviews from technology press and Amazon users, so while the price tag's might be a little painful there are a lot of fun (and learning) to be had by whoever uses it. ,LEGO has not said how well the robot has been selling but it alreadyÂ looks likeÂ another niche success for the Danish toy maker whose sales have been growing at a steady pace for the last few years. OnÂ the back ofÂ the mega-successful LEGO movie earlier this year, it's recently beenÂ planting its flag's across the world with a handful ofÂ new international offices. Flush with revenue, we can probablyÂ expect a new line of robot kits in theÂ next year or so , My only nagging concern is with how much LEGO will race to target that comfortably profitable market (boys) at the expense of encouraging another that is been conditioned to ask for dolls at Christmas (girls). That does not mean paint the EV3 pink. But maybe use some clever marketing to coax the girls that there is fun to be had with taking some control over machines, not least the kind that couldÂ be running their lives in the next few decades. In the meantime Iâ€™d be happy do my bit and put the robot together with my young daughter - once played with it myself of course.Â ,is post is part of a series called Gadgets We Love,as where Forbes staff and contributors write about the gadget they are wishing for this holiday season."

"I love building things with LEGO, from as far back as I can remember to this day, with the Gadgeteer Kid.  I would argue that LEGO are one of the greatest toys ever invented, enabling kids and adults alike to transform their imagination into reality. Back in my day, all we had were the classic bricks, but in todays world you can build everything from Hogwarts Castle to a real-life, fully functional Braille printer. The Mindstorms EV3 is arguably the most advanced and capable LEGO set ever released. The Gadgeteer Kid and I will be taking a look at LEGO is latest and greatest technology as a joint review. Dave: This is what was considered are advanced back in my day.  This motorized brick and wired controller (that died decades ago) were how, when I was the Gadgeteer Kids age, you were able to bring your LEGO creations to life. But as we all know, the world is a much different place these days.,Dave: The,These creations vary in complexity difficulty; while the Track3r involves about 20 to 30 steps, the humanoid-like EV3RSTORM has well over 100. In addition to the five are Starter Robots, LEGO also provides instructions to build a dozen are Bonus Robots as well.,Dave: The Kid and I built the most basic of the are Starter Robots, the  and also built the most advanced, the ,. We controlled both robots via his a iPhone and my Note 3 apps.,Dave So far we have controlled the Mindstorms EV3 in what I consider more of a remote-control capacity. While doing this is fun, and what we have created very capable, the EV3 system has so much more potential.,The EV3 programming software is an as based system that enables you to truly program your creations to do your bidding. There is a massive Mindstorms community on the internet, books to help you create, and clubs to build robots with other geeks “ impressively so.,In today are world of immersive gaming, I find the , a much better way for a young person to spend their time and parent money. There really is no end to how complex and massive your creation could be; it is limited only by your imagination. The Mindstorms (and LEGO) universe is huge and growing larger and more capable all the time. Though in this case, I will leave learning how to program and the next epic Mindstorms creation to the Gadgeteer Kid; this old dog just does not have the time to learn a new trick. But to those parents debating on whether to give your kid(s) an XBox or PlayStation, I suggest seriously considering the EV3 instead. You'll like these stories too:,The software is derived from LabView, and the previous versions had icons that looked like LabView VI icons too.  Now the icons look to be more user friendly, so you can access the variables directly.  I will bet it is worth the high price. johnkes the same LabView from National Instruments?,Gageteer Kid as  Glad that you were there to help your Dad struggle through this review. When I visited your house a couple of weeks ago Dave expressed his anxiety. Great job pulling this review together. Continue to do good work.,Heya Mike, ,Yep, the G.K. definitely picked up my slack on this one. My hope is that he takes the time during his summer holiday to create AND program something cool/interesting. Is LEGO manual has the LabView logo."

"I know I need a new Lego robot. Actually, I need two. I have the Lego Education edition, and I have got a retail set on order from a local toy store. I was sold , I also had the chance to borrow (and return) a retail set from Lego in advance of their ,, and I have been putting it to the test to see how it performs. The EV3 is the first update to the Lego Mindstorms robotics set in three years, and it officially ,.,Is it worth it? Well, it depends. Do you have kids with an interest in robotics? Are you willing to spend this much on a toy? This is a toy that teaches kids (age 10+) programming and engineering skills. It allows exploration of robotics concepts without needing to understand electrical engineering or advanced programming, but it is not dumbed down to the point that it becomes boring for older kids or even adults. In fact, the , can not resist a good Lego robot building challenge.,So what does the EV3 bring to the table? It still consists of the Lego Technic pin and beam construction system, which allows you to build strong robots with moving parts better than the standard Lego System. The CPU brain of the Lego Mindstorms is still the Brick. I have got a comparison shot between my NXT 2.0 brick and the new EV3 brick, so you can see how the system is still basically the same black and white display on a large, sturdy brick:,Underneath that similar brick, there iss a newly updated, faster processor. There is also more expansion with an SD card slot on the side, and you can program directly on the bot. The NXT 2.0 allowed you to string together a few commands, but if you wanted to do anything fancy, it always had to be done on a computer and transferred to the bot.,There is a caveat here. Full on-the-bot programming is cumbersome. It involves a tiny screen and a lot of hitting up and down buttons. However, the fact that you can do this at all is great news. It means you can have a team or a group of kids that have no access to a computer, and they can still program their robots. I am immediately thinking of classes, club meetings, camps, and other settings where team robot building challenges would just be amazing.,
,The other price we seem to have paid for the revamped brick interface is in start up and shut down time. My NXT 2.0 brick starts and shuts off pretty much instantly. The EV3 takes 30-45 seconds for each. That is not a big deal in the scheme of things, but it may be a long wait for kids with short attention spans. ,The new EV3 has some of the same sensors and servos as the old NXT, and many have improvements. The large motor servos are the same, but there is also a small motor servo. The color sensor is easier to attach to your bot. There is now only one touch sensor, and there is a brand new infrared sensor with a remote are beacon. This replaces the ultrasonic sensor in the retail sets. (The Lego Education set includes the ultrasonic sensor but not the IR sensor and beacon.),The EV3 seems more playful and just a little cooler than the NXT design. Everything matches the new red and black color scheme, instead of the Google-esque multicolor mismatch of the previous version. The IR sensor has eyes painted onto it rather than the implied eyes of the ultrasonic sensor. The mostly decorative is wing pieces have stickers to make your robot appear more like a battle-worn survivor of a space war. Â The old NXT included a paper test track that got torn up pretty quickly after you put it on the floor. The new EV3 has a test track that comes as part of the box itself. Cut off the outer layer of the box, and it becomes the test track. Is both sturdier and more interesting than the previous version.,One area that seems like Lego was trying a little too hard is in the naming conventions. The EV3 has an E to 3 substitution in all the demo model names, so the Track3r, the Spik3r, the R3ptar, etc. That feels a little too ,and it wil not age well. The good news is that once you build them, you can call your models whatever you want.,Speaking of models, there are tons of models and instructions right out of the gate. The box instructions only include the bot pictured at the top of the page. Well, it is actually three bots in one. You start with a simple tank, add the small motor servo for a spinning blade of death and then add the IR sensor for a remote control tank. The are Tracks bot comes with a demo program that moves it a few times, makes some noises, and adds some on-screen eyes. The whole thing takes less than an hour to build, and it means you can make something that just works right away. You also get instructions on how to download several other models, and you can preview the instructions on your computer screen.,If you have an iPad, you can also take advantage of an app that shows you how to build the optional models. The iPad app, designed with the help of Autodesk, is just a brilliant idea. It offers animated, 3D, step-by-step instructions, so you no longer end up realizing five steps from the end that you missed a peg or axle at some point. Once you have mastered the basic steps, you can use the concepts you learned while building the models and make your own robots. The iPad software would be even better if it also supported iPad-based EV3 programming, but no dice.,The software for the EV3 does not ship on disc like it did with the NXT 2.0. Instead, it is a free download. Thank goodness. I have a friend who lost her NXT 2.0 software only to discover that she could not just download it somewhere. I have even heard that the new software is compatible with the old NXT 2.0 bricks, other than not supporting some features that are exclusive to the EV3. The new EV3 software has an updated look and feel but still offers the same drag-and-drop visual programming. If you think that is too much of a baby step, the operating system behind the Ev3 is Linux, and been told by Lego reps that they have made it easy to bypass the visual programming tools and just hack your robot directly. You can also hook up to four EV3 bricks together for some sort of super robot.,You might ask yourself why you want to spend nearly $350 on a Lego robotics kit instead of buying a , for $45 and learning some , or buying an , for under $200 and learning more about electrical engineering. It is a legitimate question. Some people are going to want to just go for the cheaper options. Some people will want all of them. They do different things, so it is not an all or nothing deal.,Here is my take. The Ev3 costs a lot upfront, but it is tough and reconfigurable, and used Lego Mindstorms kits have traditionally held onto their value pretty well on eBay. Other robotics platforms are either used up in the process of building them or go through processor innovations so fast that nobody is interested in the old models. It is also a great entry point, especially for parents who are not robotics super whizzes themselves. You really can step in and assist your younger child or allow your older, enthusiastic child to go hog wild on their own. You can always work your way towards more complicated systems later on.,Lego did a fantastic job updating the EV3 with new sensors and better peg slots for building with the old sensors. The expandable brick and new interface are fantastic once you learn how to get around on them. Sticking with the traditional black and white screen display means longer battery life and a more durable device, although eInk display would have been a great innovation here. I would have liked to see iPad and Android tablet versions of the programming interface to make the robot truly computer independent, but there is still room for Lego to go in that direction in the future.,If you are already a fan of Mindstorms, you will want to get this new model. If you are new to Lego robotics, I suggest looking for a , or similar group to explore the possibilities and make sure your child is enthusiastic enough with the idea. As with anything you program, you have to have some tenacity to problem solve. That is the sort of skill you may want to cultivate in your children. Children under the suggested age of 10 will need a lot of guidance (there are small pieces, the pegs are hard to push into the bots, and Mindstorms can take some abuse but not kids who want to step on them or throw them from great heights). My 11-year-old had no difficulty with assembly, and once she figured out how to transfer programs, she was debugging and problem-solving bot actions in no time. If you are not sure if this toy is right for your younger child, you should probably wait a few years and re-examine.,However, if you want to buy it for yourself and pretend it is for your child, we won judge.Marziah Karch has written ,. She is also writes for , for money and , for fun. She lives in Portland, Oregon and still works a day job. Because she apparently has free time on top of all that, she is also a doctoral candidate researching the information behavior of independent game designers.,I wonder: Do you need to reboot the Brick each time you transfer a new program or it is just to turn it on and off?, it from Amazon. It is still a bit pricey but I think it is worth it. I read nice review of EV3 here which also includes comparisons to the previous generation of the Mindstorms ,Got this at Christmas and here is a way to make it more accessible. These tips have come from using a Raspberry Pi,
1) add a VNC server to your Windows machine (realVNC is what I use). Then you can access the Windows EV3 software on your laptop or mobile device (I use Mocha on my iPhone and iPad) as long as they are on the same Wifi network.,
2) Go cable-less. I started with bluetooth. I have just gone wifi (I had an old Edimax wifi dingle and after a web search found some firmware that supports it). ,With this you can program, adjust, reprogram your robot without being tied to your desktop. Uses batteries up at a greater rate but this is the trade off. I would recommend always switching the EV3 block off as soon as you have moved on to another topic!"

"The latest Lego Mindstorms set is totally mind-blowing. You can command 5 different model robots with WiFi, bluetooth or smartphone. The programming capabilities are endless. We've reached out to Lego, but so far no official statement on whether the EV3 comes preprogrammed to obey Asimov's Laws of Robotics.,Lego Mindstorms are toolkits that allow you to make insane programmable robots (software and hardware included). This is the third generation Mindstorms series. The technology is a step up from the previous series. The programmable brick is an ARM9-based processor that runs Linux, with 16MB FLASH memory, and 64MB RAM. There is also a USB connector and SD slot. ,The five different models you can build are Ev3storm, Track3r, Gripp3r, R3ptar, and Spik3r. It's recommended that you build the Track3r model first, but I just couldn't resist jumping right into the R3ptar (and this thing has a nasty bite!):,Here it is in action:,This current set includes over 500 Technic elements, a programmable brick a remote control, 3 motors, 3 sensors and downloadable 3D building instructions. The sensors include a touch sensor, color sensor, and infrared sensor. There is also an app that allows you to control your robot with your smartphone (iPhone and Android). Each model comes with various missions to complete, from the build itself to programming commands.,The EV3 is also backward compatible. The sensors, being digital, will not work with the NXT intelligent brick, the motors, however, will. You can program your Legobot to move, walk and talk with the intuitive software program. Though, from my personal experience, the software is not completely intuitive. ,On initial connection the brick needed a firmware update which applied smoothly. Navigating LabView isn't difficult, but it took some clicking around to gather what many of the symbols and buttons mean. The UI is reminiscent of math modeling software.  For those without programming experience the drag and drop interface might be a good introduction.  However, I'm more excited about what can be accomplished in code outside of LabView when the open source community takes hold of the new EV3.,It's not always clear that the EV3 is connected. Programs are downloaded to the brick so fast that the progress indicator was misleading. Listening to the beeps on the brick was a better indicator of a successful transfer. Also, connecting to WiFi didn't work and resulted in some error messages on both the brick and in LabView. ,In my opinion, the great thing about these Technic models is that they are quite easy to take apart and rebuild. The primary annoyance was the connections. Overall, the build took me a little over an hour. It's going to be really exciting to see what custom creations start popping up. I'm thinking cameras, speakers, maybe an unlicensed nuclear accelerator, Weirding Module or a Genesis Device...the possibilities are endless. "

"I purchased this EV3 set. Very very good so far and my first robot kit. Bought it as soon as it came out back in, I think, November 2013 or something like that. Love the experience and the switch from studded to studless is awesome. It's just amazing, and it's wonderful on what you can do with it.
But there's no such thing as a perfect product. The EV3 brick display is dim and very hard to read. Couldn't they have moved the leds from the buttons into a backlight of some sort? Even $60 cellular phones have a backlight. And if there are three button backlight colors, green orange red, why couldn't they make it RGB, so there are lots of colors to choose from!?
Plus, it's way too expensive! Even some other company sells a similar kit for cheaper, and that one comes with 12 ports that you can plug anything in. Up to 12 motors!!! And now, this set has only three!? That's why i bought extra. This thing is outrageously expensive! Make it $150 next time.
Well, that aside, it's a great set. Even my grandson loves it, and the iPad works perfectly. But to be honest, the laptop is better to program. Thank you Lego for this product, it has now become one of my hobbies. Continue to make good stuff, may be EV4. But price it competitively and make it easier to use. Add C++ or Python support? More motors and sensors? Come on, the EV3 brick costs $200, and my smartphone costed $120. You can do it. It's the best robot kit in the world, make it better, cheaper. 
PERFECT ITEM!!!!,This is an amazing thing to have. I highly recommend it to people who love lego. there is 1 thing which is weird. The brick has 4 motor ports but 3 motors come in the pack.In the mindstorm NXT there are 2 touch sesors in 1 pack, but here is one.
The computer software is ONLY AVAILABLE FOR MAC & WINDOWS COMPUTERS!!!!
I LOVE IT,NightSerpent,Best Mindstorms Ever,After months of waiting I finally got the Mindstorms EV3 last week. With my 2 sons I assembled the first robot Tracker together and got it moving within an hour. Downloading and installing the Mindstorms software for our MAC laptop was easy and a matter of minutes to get it going. The software is easy to use and we got the other bonus robots immediately from the LEGO website. With still over a dozen robots to chose from this set has weeks of play fun still ahead of us - not to mention the unlimited possibilities of creating robots on your own. Using the Tracker robot I could show my sons how to use the robot with a running program as well as by switching it to IR control quickly since its so intuitive to use.
There are only 2 things which were a little disappointment: The Mindstorm set was announced to have instructions for 5 robots included - but the box had only the instructions for the Tracker robot included.This is not a major problem because you can get the building instructions for the other ones (Gripper, etc.) from the Lego website. What would have been nice if the building instructions would have been part of the project files (not only the program itself) and if everything would have been a single download file.
All in all this set is amazing and offers given the amount of robots (15) out of the box the best price / performance of all lego sets.,
Apersoncoolerthanyou,Very cool stuff,We use these at school (I'm a student) and I seriously adore these. We are placed in groups based on experience and ability, so that more advanced groups get harder, more challenging projects, probably on of the coolest I have made with this set is the EV3STORM, its huge. I would definitely buy it for myself and recommend it as a powerful learning tool useful for all ages. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

"I can still feel the sharp edges of the very first Lego brick I stood on. I am reminded of it, 35-plus years later, each time I step on the Lego bricks of my children. After all, Lego has remained popular throughout my life.,What is more, I am a bit obsessed by certain aspects of Lego. I love the building, and applying labels to the bricks also bought and sold a bit of Lego over the years, with ,.,But beyond a Lego train set, one thing I have never done is build a remote-control Lego robot. If anything, I found these kits to be a bit intimidating. I should not have worried; as I recently found out, the new Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot is a pleasure to build and program.,The kit costs around $350, but we are giving ours away to one lucky winner: enter below for your chance to win!,
,This is a big kit. In the box, you will find a lot of Lego pieces, from Technic-style arms and axles, to clamps, and pieces that look like they would not be out of place on an aircraft model. There is also caterpillar tracks and compatible wheels.,You will also find the Programmable EV3 Brick (more on that below), various wires and cables, motors, and optical sensors.,Presumably to save on paper, the Lego Mindstorms 31313 includes instructions for just one of the five builds; the other build instructions can be found online.,What we get in the box, however, is certainly good enough to get started. The Track3r is a tank-like robot that wields a weapon and can find its way around a pre-printed map (the unwrapped outer sleeve of the box). Build time is about an hour, depending on how you organize your bricks.,Alternatives to this are the Spik3r (a sort of robot scorpion), R3ptor (a snake-like creature) and Gripp3r. There is also the main build, the giant Ev3 rstorm robot that graces the front of the box.,At the heart of each of these builds is the famous Programmable EV3 Brick, a large control center that features several Lego Technic connectors for easy integration.,As ever when building using Lego, it is a good idea to sort your pieces out in advance, preferably into color-matched groups.,Without this brick, a Mindstorms kit would just be a pretentiously named Lego Technic set. It is via the EV3 Brick that we are able to instruct the chosen Mindstorms build to move, and to program further routines.,As a control center and power-station six AA batteries are required  the EV3 Brick features four input ports (labelled 1, 2, 3, 4) to connect sensors. A further four output ports (labeled A-D) connect the brick to the motors.,Meanwhile, there is direct compatibility with Windows and Mac OS X via a mini USB PC port. A USB host port is also available for connecting a Wi-Fi dongle; you may also wish to daisy chain other EV3 bricks.,If memory expansion is required for the EV3 Brick, a micro-SD card slot is also included.,The EV3 Brick is not the only bulky component of this Lego Mindstorms kit.,There is an IR sensor (for the remote control), a color sensor (recognises seven colors and measures light intensity), and a touch sensor (recognizes three conditions: touch, bumped, released). Also included is a medium servo motor, and two large motors. Each of these can be incorporated in various ways. For instance, the servo motor drives a spinning arm on the Track3r build. There is also an IR beacon remote control, which we will look at below.,It is the color sensor that is used with the unwrapped outer sleeve of the box. As mentioned above, it is here that you will find a pre-printed road, designed for the sensor to guide your Mindstorms project along.,Without the motors and the EV3 Brick, this is nothing more than a futuristic Lego Technic kit. The programmable computer, servo, and motors enhance the bricks. But to what end?,Lego kits always include a notice on the box advising the buyer of the perfect age range. With Lego Mindstorms 31313, this number is 10+. Now, I know plenty of adults that would find this kit challenging. Similarly, I know one or two young people under 10 that would absolutely adore it.,But, it is certainly not for 5 year olds, I did suggest that 8 is a good lower-age range for this kit. However, unless the child you are buying something like this for is a prodigy, they are probably not going to fully appreciate it until they are in secondary education.,If you are planning to buy one of these kits as a present, keep in mind that the motors, sensors and EV3 make it pretty expensive. In the USA, this is $350, while in the UK you will find it for around £220.,Meanwhile, once a build is complete, you will be able to have a play with it, after programming the EV3 block (see below). You will also find that each build has some variations that can be enjoyed as mission. Some of these tasks might include the printed road, found in the box  sleeve.,You have several options for programming the EV3 Programmable Block. The first is pretty low-level, but you will find it useful to see how the block works. Basically, it comes with various pre-installed routines that you will find by navigating through the EV3 menu.,Progamming is really the second string for the Lego Mindstorms 31313 kit. Once youâ€™ve got your build completed the instruction guides are as clear as you would expect, and can be found online learning to program the EV3 brick is the next challenge. After sampling the built-in routines, ,. There is a desktop app for Windows and Mac called the EV3 Programming Software, and a mobile app for iOS and Android called Lego Mindstorms Programmer.,With a USB-to-PC cable and microSD slot for programing via the desktop, the EV3 is perhaps more easily programmed via mobile. The mobile app also includes instructions for alternate builds (the packaged guidebook features just one), and the programming tool takes a block-based, drag-and-drop approach to creating routines and making your robot move.,It is simple, straightforward, and effortless. As long as you established a Bluetooth connection to the EV3 brick, your programmed course will be beamed to the Lego robot and obeyed.,As you should have guessed by now, I have good experience with Lego. I have never held an exhibition of my builds, but I know how to start, how to keep going, and how to finish.,If you are new to Mindstorms, let me tell you this: it quite different to Nexo Knights, Pirates, Lego City Lego Friends. There very little (if any) brick-to-brick action. The vast majority of connections use the Technic system, which gives a more Meccanno-esque feel to things. While the bricks feel like Lego, they actually a mature, grown up version. Of course, this means they will never have a film made about them,Understanding this is key to your success with any of these types of kit.,Whether you are building the Track3r, Ev3rstorm robot, or whatever, you will find that you have several options available for controlling your build remotely.,The most obvious option is the IR Beacon, a small remote control device that allows you to control the direction of the build. Buttons on either side of the multi-channel device enable independent tread control, too. You can change channels by pushing the red switch through its various positions, resulting in extra actions. For instance, with the Track3r, setting the switch to the central position will enable you to spin the weapon.,For the IR Beacon to work, however, it must be accompanied on the robot by the IR sensor.,For an additional (and, to be honest, superior) control option, you should seek out the Lego Mindstorms Commander app for iOS and Android. Requiring a Bluetooth connection (your EV3 block will need to be switched on, and Bluetooth enabled via the Settings menu), you will gain far superior control to the treads and the currently armed weapon than is possible with the IR Beacon.,The movement of the treads can be far more delicately controlled. Need to drive your Mindstorms EV3 creation carefully? Use the app to slow things down, simply by dragging your thumbs up and down a representation of the treads on your display. It is intuitive, and it is worth using.,Like almost all Lego, the Mindstorms EV3 kit will appeal to all ages. Straightforward to build and program, fun to use and learn with, this is the ultimate robotics gift for young engineers."

"Remarkably flexible and powerful. Expanded memory and Bluetooth control welcome upgrades. Accessible to people of all ages.,Expensive. Small number of servos and sensors included mean projects will either be limited or require additional investment.,The LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robotics kit is the newest, best, and most accessible way to teach your kids or yourself how to build and program robots.,Robots are hard to build from scratch unless you have degrees in engineering and programming. That's what makes LEGO's Mindstorms sets so amazing. They're flexible robotics kits that combine sensors, motors, and an electronic brain with LEGO Technic components to make robots anyone can build. LEGO has stepped up its robotics game with its newest Mindstorms product. Over four years since the launch of its Mindstorms NXT 2.0 kit, the company has released LEGO Mindstorms EV3. This $349.99 (direct) robotics kit is faster, smarter, and more flexible than the previous version, and stands as one of the best ways to dabble in robotics without investing in tools. Its price tag might seem like a lot for a toy, but it's much more than that; LEGO Mindstorms EV3 is a remarkably powerful and functional robotics kit people of any age can use to build some impressive and complicated projects.,For your $350, you get the Mindstorms EV3 Intelligent Brick (the ""brain"" of the Mindstorms EV3 set), an infrared remote control, three servo motors, a color sensor, a touch sensor, an infrared sensor, and 550 LEGO Technic pieces. The 550 bricks and other building components might not seem like a lot against the nearly 3,000 pieces of the $320 LEGO Sydney Opera House Creator set, but you're mostly paying for the robotic parts. In fact, the Intelligent Brick itself would cost $150 separately, and each other robotic component can be purchased piecemeal for $20 (servo motors, touch sensor) to $50 (infrared sensor).,
,
,Since this is a LEGO Technic set with a robotic heart, you can use any of your standard LEGO or LEGO Technic components with the set. That's one of the great things about LEGO: universal backwards compatibility. In fact, with a few small exceptions (six big sword/scale pieces, a handful of curved, white cover pieces, and a few specific mechanical pieces), all of the bricks that come with the set are universal and could be turned into nearly everything (a feature not seen very often with complex, licensed building sets for series like Star Wars or The Hobbit). The set doesn't have any exact dimensions because it's over 500 different pieces, but you can build a robot about the size of a shoebox and have it still be structurally sound. Of course, you can also get more LEGO parts and build a robot as large as you'd like, as long as the moving parts are still light enough and have enough leverage for the servos to move them.,As the brain of the kit, the Mindstorms EV3 Intelligent Brick features a ton of connection features. It has eight Mindstorms connection cable ports (modified RJ12 ports with the plastic tab on the right side of the jack), a mini-USB port for connecting to your computer, a microSD card slot for expanding the memory, and a full-size USB port for an optional Wi-Fi dongle or daisy-chaining up to three additional Mindstorms EV3 Intelligent Bricks for a total of 32 connection ports is useful if you want to build a much more complicated and expensive robot than the kit allows on its own. The Intelligent Brick also features built-in Bluetooth for directly controlling your robot with your mobile device and the Mindstorms iOS or Android app. The top of the brick holds a monochrome LCD display, four direction buttons, a back button, and a confirmation button on the top, and the right side of the brick holds a small speaker for playing sound files.,The Mindstorms EV3 Intelligent Brick uses an ARM9-based processor with 16MB of memory (and storage expandable exponentially with the microSD card slot). This is,a massive leap in power from the ARM7-based Mindstorms NXT 2.0 Intelligent Brick, which only 256KB of memory and no microSD card slot. The NXT 2.0 Intelligent Brick had Bluetooth, but it was only Bluetooth 2.0 compared to the EV3 Intelligent Brick's Bluetooth 4.0, and couldn't be used to directly control your creations.,The sensors have also gotten a power upgrade, and are able to send new values to the EV3 Intelligent Brick 1,000 times per second, three times more often than the NXT 2.0 sensors. The color sensor can also now detect seven colors instead of six and has a Reflected Light mode that removes background light. All of these upgrades mean your robots can be much more complex than with Mindstorms NXT 2.0.,The LEGO Mindstorms Commander app for iOS and Android includes preset control panels for all five robots you can build in the 3D Builder app. More importantly, it lets you create manual control panels for your own creations, with different buttons, switches, and displays available to control motors and check sensor inputs. The Bluetooth control works directly with the Intelligent Brick without requiring you to program anything, so it can work both as a remote control and a test bench for seeing if your mechanisms function during construction.

"This article covers the difference between the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition and LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 products. Other articles in the â€˜difference betweenâ€™ series:,* The difference and compatibility between EV3 and NXT (,),
* The difference between NXT Home Edition and NXT Education products (,),The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robotics platform has been developed for two different target audiences. We have , (children and hobbyists) and , (students and teachers). LEGO has designed a base set for each group, as well as several add on sets.,There isnâ€™t a clear line between home users and educational users, though. Itâ€™s fine to use the Education set at home, and itâ€™s fine to use the Home Edition set at school. This article aims to clarify the differences between the two product lines so you can decide which product works best for you.,The facts and figures on this page may help you decide which set works best for you in terms of hardware and software, but there are other criteria as well. Which set is the most fun? (And wonâ€™t end up gathering dust)? See , for some additional considerations.,The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 set (LEGO #31313) is the one youâ€™ll find in toy stores and many online stores, as shown in Figure 1 (,). It is often referred to as the Home Edition or Retail Edition. Right out of the box you can build 5 robots including EV3RSTORM, GRIPP3R, TRACK3R, R3PTAR and SPIK3R (,) and 12 bonus models (,).,You program the robot with software that you can download from the LEGO MINDSTORMS website for free (,). You can also control your robot with your smart phone, or with the infrared remote control that comes with the set.,The set contains 1 EV3 programmable brick, 2 Large Motors, 1 Medium motor, 1 Touch Sensor, 1 Color Sensor, 1 Infrared Sensor and an infrared remote, as shown in Figure 2. The set also includes 7 connector cables and a USB cable for programming.,Youâ€™ll need 6 AA batteries for the EV3 brick, and 2 AAA batteries for the remote. Instead of using 6 AA batteries, you can purchase the LEGO EV3 Rechargeable Battery and charger. (See â€œThe EV3 Rechargeable Batteryâ€ below.),The set further contains nearly 600 building elements, including beams, axles, gears and connectors, as shown in Figure 3. The inside of the cardboard packaging contains a mission pad (,). You can view an unboxing video of the set here (,).,The LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Core Set (LEGO #45544, see Figure 4) is available from LEGO Education and various education resellers worldwide (,). The set includes building instructions for one vehicle with various sensor attachments. More building instructions are available here (,). Software tutorials are available as part of the LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 programming software, which can be downloaded for free (,).,The set contains 1 EV3 programmable brick, 2 Large Motors, 1 Medium motor, 2 Touch Sensors, 1 Color Sensor, 1 Ultrasonic Sensor and 1 Gyro sensor, as shown in Figure 4. The set also includes 7 connector cables and a USB cable for programming. The set includes a rechargeable battery for the EV3 brick and a charger.,The set contains nearly 540 building elements, including beams, axles, gears and connectors, as shown in Figure 6. The sturdy plastic box further contains storage bins for your Technic elements.,If you have the Education Core Set (#45544), you may still want to build the robots of the Home Edition set (#31313), the 12 bonus robots (,), or robots from books about the Home Edition set (,). To do so, youâ€™ll need to purchase separately the Infrared Sensor (,) and the Infrared Beacon (,), as well as certain Technic building elements.,To find the parts you need, start with the diagrams above. You may already have many of the pieces in your LEGO Technic collection.,Below youâ€™ll find severalÂ lists that show which parts you need to upgrade so you can build the robots of the Home Edition and the robots in the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Discovery Book.,Matt Oâ€™Brien created a list of the parts required to upgrade the combination of the Education Core Set (45544) and Expansion Set (45560) to Retail Set (31313) (,).,Peter Bittner has also made a nice Excel Sheet (,) that you can use to find which parts you need to upgrade from the Education Core Set (45544) to the Home Edition (31313), or from Education Core + Expansion set (45544+45560) to the Home Edition (31313). He has additional information here. (,),You can order most elements from LEGO (,), or Bricklink (,). See also the instructions in the above files. Alternatively, you could get a large LEGO Technic set or a MINDSTORMS EV3 expansion set (See â€˜LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Expansion Setâ€™ below). Youâ€™ll get more value for money this way and it saves you some time, but you may still need to buy certain pieces separately.,Similarly, if you have the Home Edition set (#31313), you may still want to build the robots of the Education Core Set (#45544, ,). To do so, youâ€™ll need to purchase separately the Ultrasonic Sensor (,) and the Gyroscopic Sensor (,), as well as certain Technic building elements. Note that the Infrared Sensor has exactly the same shape as the Ultrasonic Sensor. Both sensor can sense distance, but the Ultrasonic Sensor is more accurate for distance sensing. On the other hand, the Infrared Sensor also serves as the receiver for the Infrared Remote. Itâ€™s up to you to decide whether you need both sensors.,LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robots canÂ be programmed from a computer (PC/MAC) or a tablet (iOS/Android). The tablet appÂ is a simplified version, leaving out several programming options.Â The PC/MACÂ programming software is the full version (and just as easy to use).,Both the computer software and the tablet app comes in two versions: The Home Edition and the Education Edition for teachers and students.,The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition set (#31313) does not include a software CD in the box. Instead, you will need to download the Home Edition software , from the LEGO MINDSTORMS website (,). The software includes a programming environment, and building and programming instructions for the robots you can build with the Home Edition set.,The software does not require a license key, so you can download the software early to see if you like the programming language, and to avoid waiting for a big download when you want to get started building and programing.,The installation file is about 700 MB in size. I found the following system requirements in the installation folder. I added a few comments in parenthesesâ€“they are not official comments. If youâ€™re in doubt: ,* Silverlight 5.0 or newer (Installer is included â€“ no need to download separately),
* Microsoft Dot Net 4.0 or newer (Installer is included â€“ no need to download separately),* Windows: Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8, Windows 10 (32/64 bit) with the latest service packs. (Note that it does not work on Windows 8.0 RT or 8.1 RT),
* Macintosh: Mac 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8 and later with the latest service packs,* 2 GB of RAM or more,
* 2.5 GHz processor or faster (This is the minimum for a dual core processor. For example, my quad core processor is just 1.7 GHz and it works fine.),
* Minimal supported screen resolutionâ€”1024*768,
* LEGOÂ® MINDSTORMSÂ® EV3 does not support tablets or certain netbooks with hardware that does not meet the above requirements.,The LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 software (#45544) can be downloaded here for free (,). The installation file is about 700 MB in size. The system requirements are the same as given above. As of 2017, no paid license is required to download, install, or run this software.,The software includes a programming environment, and building and programming instructions for the robots you can build with the Education Core Set (#45544) and the Education Expansion set (#45560). In addition, it contains a data logging environment for science experiments. For example, you can plot a graph of the light level in a room, and see it change over time.,The EV3 brick in the Home Edition set is the same as the EV3 brick in the Education Core Set, so you can use either version of the programming software to control your robot. In fact, you can install both versions of the software on the same computer, if you like.,So itÂ is perfectlyÂ possible to use the Home Edition software with the Education Core Set and vice versa. When you do, youâ€™ll need to add a few programming blocks to the software to be able to control the Gyroscope and the Ultrasonic Sensor. See , for download and installation instructions.,You can upgrade the LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Core Set (#45544) with the LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Expansion Set (#45560, ,). This allows you to build bigger robots such as an elephant and a stair climber (,). The set includes over 850 building elements including beams, axles, and gears, as shown in Figure 7. It does not contain any electronic elements.,While this add on pack was made for the Education Core Set, itâ€™s also an excellent parts resource for use with the EV3 Home Edition (#31313). You wonâ€™t be able to build all of the models from this add on pack because you may be missing some elements from the Education Core Set, but the pieces are very useful to create your own robots. In particular, the set contains 9x O-frames, 6xH frames, 13x 15M beams, and numerous gears including a differential and a turntable.,The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition set does not include a rechargeable battery. You can simply use 6x AA batteries. You may want to invest in 6 high performance rechargeable batteries with a dedicated charger. If you do, youâ€™ll probably want to get at least 12 batteries so you can use one set while you charge the others.,You can also purchase the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 rechargeable battery (#45501, ,) and the charger (#8887, ,. Be sure to buy the charger that fits the plug in your country). This allows you to charge your robot while itâ€™s on. No need to take your robot apart when the batteries run empty. The battery does make your EV3 a bit bigger (precisely one LEGO unit), as shown in Figure 8.,Several LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 books have been published and a few more books are on the way. When you plan to buy one of these books, be sure to check in advance which LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 set is covered. Some books contain instructions for robots you can build with the Home Edition set (#31313) while others contain instructions for the Education Core Set (#45544). Alternatively, just get the book you like, and upgrade your LEGO collection with the pieces needed for the activities in that particular book.,
,
,To use the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Discovery Book, you need the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition. This book helps you get the most out of your EV3 set. Youâ€™ll build cool robots, all the while learning about EV3 programming. You can learn more about the book ,.,This book is divided into several parts. The first parts (Chapter 1-9) introduce the reader to programming. The programming software for the Education or the Home version is essentially the same, so you can use this book to learn how to program regardless of which set you have. New concepts are demonstrated using a simple vehicle robot. If you have the Education set, you can build the vehicle according to the instructions in that set, and just follow along with the programming tutorials in this book. The same holds for the programming tutorials in Chapters 14-17, which you can also do with the pieces in either set.,In addition to programming tutorials, the book also contains chapters (12, 13, 18, and 19) with building instructions for bigger robots, like the walking humanoid on the front cover of the book. These robots can be built with the pieces in the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition (#31313).,You can control your EV3 from your iOS (,) or Android (,) smartphone or tablet. The official Commander app is targeted at Home Edition users, with specific controls for the Home Edition robots, but it also works with the Education Core Set. In particular, if you have the Education Core Set, you can use the TRACK3R controls to drive the Educator Vehicle. In addition, you can create their own customized remote to control each motor connected to the EV3 brick. You can also program the EV3 with a tablet (,).,When youâ€™ve created a program in the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 PC/MAC software, you transfer it to the EV3 brick using the USB cable included in the set. Once transferred to the brick, the robot can run the program on its own. In addition, you can program your robot wirelessly using Bluetooth or Wifi (using a USB WiFi dongle). This way, thereâ€™s no need to connect the USB cable each time you change the program.,While this works great for small setups at home, it can be frustrating to set up in classrooms, because classroom computers may not have administrator rights (for Bluetooth drivers) or they might not have access to configure wireless network settings (for WiFi). If you plan to use wireless capabilities in the classroom, consider buying just one dongle so you can try it out before you buy one for each set.,The article and the illustrations are copyright (c) 2013-2017 by Laurens Valk, unless stated otherwise. Use the information in this article at your own risk.,Did I miss some information in this article? Noticed any mistakes? Did a link break? Please post comments and suggestions below. If your question is off topic, please search for the appropriate article on this website and post it there, or use the contact page (,). Thanks!,Great article. It is quite exhaustive. I got the EV3 Home and plan to buy later the extra sensors that came with Edu version.,Thanks. Yeah, thatâ€™s definitely a nice way to go.,Is it just me, or does the BrickDojo link not work anymore?,The same thing happened to me. I think the authors have deleted  the site,So if my child is working with a First Lego League team using the education version, and I am considering buying one for home, do you recommend the education version?  Or, would the home version suffice?,If he or she wants to build an exact copy of their FLL Team robot to continue at home, then youâ€™d probably want to get the Education Set. If itâ€™s just for fun and to learn the system in general, the Home Edition will be fine. The programming is the same, so anything you learn at home you can use in school and vice versa.,which is the best set.the education set or home edition,Which is the best set.The education set or home education set,Iâ€™ll chime in with my opinion here. I think the home version is viable and the best overall value. Keep in mind the EV3 programming language is available for the home system at no additional cost. The home version will let you do all the things included in Laurensâ€™ new book. Thatâ€™s good.,Iâ€™m an FLL coach and have the education system. (Lego does not discount to teachers). There is a gap between the two systems. The Robot Square site comparison info above references the Thomas Rosendahl comparison for adding the home to the education system.  There are lot of small parts. I was planning on buying the extra parts, but thatâ€™s tedious. The difference between having the education version (#45544) and adding the home version (#31313) seems to be about $100 â€“ $120. I also have the expansion set (#45560). I have extra parts but sorting though everything consumes time I can be building and thinking about coaching techniques. I did get the education version of the software as that is what is used in the FLL competitions. I keep in mind this is Lego and extra parts contributes to creativity. Hope this is helpful.,Iâ€™m a new FLL Robotics coach. We have both the #45544 and #45560 sets for our students. Iâ€™m buying copies of you book for the team to use for practice.  If Iâ€™m reading the thread correctly, having both of these sets will suffice for #31313 set. I just wanted to verify.,As many parents will wish to have their kids do this at home Iâ€™ll suggest the #31313.,Finding your site from the book is a blessing.  Thank you.,Hi Rich,,Thanks for your comment. Unfortunately there will still be a few pieces missing if you have #45544 and #45560.,However, you already have the pieces for Chapters 1-7 & 9, so you can definitely make a good start. You can also do most of 10 and 11.,Keep an eye on this blog for a post with more details about using the Educational EV3 sets with my book. Hopefully I can work on that soon.,Yes, I think the #31313 is a great set too. Honestly, I think both sets are equally â€˜educationalâ€™. It all depends on the learning materials used with it. With this book, you can learn just as much about building and programming.,Thanks!,Thanks Laurens,,Iâ€™ll probably the the #31313 or my Grandson. Heâ€™s 7 and doing a Lego robotics workshop this week., The #45544 and #45560 sets are provided by the schools technology department. Do you have a list of missing pieces between the two? If not Iâ€™ll do the comparison and can share results.,Regards,Thanks for giving this information!,
Is it also possible to â€˜upgrade the home edition to the education?,Sure â€“ but youâ€™ll have to compare the parts lists for yourself to see which pieces you need. Iâ€™ll see if I can make such a list, some time ðŸ™‚,Hi Laurens â€“ great work! ,A few things to be aware of regarding the software. It is not possible to upgrade the software from toy version to education version. If you buy an education kit and use it with the toy store software you will not have the building instructions for the 4 base education modes or the expansion set models, they are integrated into the education software â€œlobbyâ€ and not available as a hard copy at this time. The robot educator model is included as a building book inside the sets sold in the US so you will have that model to build. This model is used with the 46 robot educator activities for students to learn more about the building and programming capacity of this software.,
Any curriculum pieces sold by LEGO Education for LEGO Mindstorms will be integrated into the lobby of the software. Like the building instructions referenced before, these components cannot be added to the toy store software as it has no lobby.,
In addition, the data logging is a very important and integral component for education. It is not just for designing science experiments. It is for evaluating and proof of design concept as well as analyzing and troubleshooting. Students iterate on an existing design, but without using data logging of their designs performance how do they know if their design is better? How much more efficient is it? How much better does it perform? These are all integral questions to the design engineering process which is fundamental to what we are trying to do in the education setting. Practice for students who will be designing for iteration and innovation.,Is it true?,What do you think?,What is the difference between the teacher addition and student addition of the EV3 site licsense?,I believe that during the installation of the Education Version, you can choose whether to install the Teacher Version or whether to install the Student Version. I do not know the exact difference between the two.,the teacher version has more content information, like solutions to the tasks given.,
also is it possible to create your own solutions , so now the content editor in the project is split in two, one for the students and one with more explanation mend for the teachers,is the retail version provide blocks to manage ultrasonic and gyro sensors ?,You have to install them separately, as discussed in â€˜Using the Home Edition Software with the Education setâ€™ in this article.,Do you know if it is possible to get the EV3 Programming Software running on Linux?,
Seeing that the software needs Silverlight hurts me to be honest.,
As a big LEGO (Technic) and Linux fan I am very enthusiastic about the EV3. Mainly because LEGO choose to create the EV3 based on open source Linux.,
But requiring the software to run on non-open standards and end-off-life software like Silverlight surprises me unpleasantly.,
What is your vision on this matter?,Best Regards, Emiel,Hi Emiel,,Iâ€™m with you on that â€“ Iâ€™d love to use the official EV3 software on Linux. I might try it on Wine, but it gives me a headache just thinking of doing that with Silverlight 5 and .NET 4.0. If you manage to do something like this, Iâ€™d be interested to hear more about it.,Note that you can program the EV3 from Linux if you use alternative programming languages. In fact, itâ€™s not too hard to compile native C/C++ programs for the EV3 and send it to the EV3 over WiFi.,Either work with the standard LEGO Angstrom distribution or, for instance, use ,. Such things are still works in progress for now, though.,Laurens,Hi Larens,,Thanks for publishing this great site!,I am curious about the software requiring .NET 4.0. How does it work on Mac OS X? I know Silverlight is available for OS X. But I donâ€™t .NET is available.,I am also curious about this.  Would be great to be able to run it on Linux (natively), and if an OSX build exists then maybe there is some hope it could be ported to Linux.,I downloaded the free software for Mac OS X and installed on a 2007 MacBook running 10.6.8.  As far as I can tell so far it works great!,
I have also played around with the free COMMANDER app that I found in the iOS app store.  Kinda fun for trying out some immediate action â€œvoiceâ€ commands on your robots!,I downloaded Windows PC edition software,how long does it take to empty the rechargeable battery and normal batteries?,Thatâ€™s going to depend on many factors, such as how much you use the motors. WiFi is also going to drain your batteries quickly. And it depends on what kind of â€˜normal batteriesâ€™ you use.,With LEGO robots I think youâ€™d just have to go rechargeable. Either the LEGO battery or high performance AA batteries. Non rechargeable batteries will be more expensive in the end and certainly worse for the environment.,[â€¦] Robot Square â€“ The Difference Between LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition (#31313) and LEGO MINDSTORMS â€¦ [â€¦],Awesome work Laurens. You offer so much to the community. Thank You,Youâ€™re welcome Marc ðŸ™‚,Iâ€™ve a question about the software. Is it also possible to program my NXT with the new EV3 software? I heard something about it, but I donâ€™t know if it really worksâ€¦,Yes you can â€“ read this post (,). You can download the software for free, so you can always try to see whether you like it or not.,Thanks! But does the home software includes all NXT stuff, as ultrasonic blocks?,This too, is explained in this post.,Thanks for answer. Iâ€™ll download the software and the US block soon!,Do you know whether there are programming blocks for 3rd party sensors?,Such blocks are available from the manufacturerâ€™s website. If your sensor isnâ€™t yet supported, contact them for support.,Hello,
I got friend asking me which to buy NXT or EV3 as his first LEGO Mindstorms set,
so he is new to the mindstorms world and doesnâ€™t know anything about it between he is saying that money is not a problem,
which one he should get first,EV3 !! NXT has been around for almost 6years and compared to EV3 feels like a dinosaur (and iâ€™m not even sure you can still buy it) seriously EV3 is the way to go.  AND NOW the real question is: Should he get the HOME or EDUCATION version â€“and wellâ€“ thatâ€™s what this article is all about!!! To give you all the information you need to help you decide. However if money is no object (lucky guy) then obviously he should get one Home, one EDU and one Expansion setâ€¦ oh and one extra battery packâ€¦ OK that should set him off the right foot ðŸ™‚,Thank you so much for the reply,Well for me i didnâ€™t tried NXT but people have build a lot with NXT and i think that itâ€™s so awesome ðŸ™‚,EV3 itâ€™s new(3 months left) and maybe itâ€™ll have a great feature i think ðŸ™‚,and the big brick difference between NXT and EV3 is clear so thatâ€™s what he should got,but i got problem that after few days iâ€™ll enter a Mindstorms school and they teaching only NXT programming ðŸ™ and there is a big difference between NXT software and EV3 software ðŸ™ and thatâ€™s mean i wonâ€™t understand anything .. YAY,The 2 programs look and feel a little different but how you program is very very similar â€” they are both LABVIEW in the background. What you learn in school will not be lost.,Yeah, Bazmarc summed it up nicely ðŸ™‚,NXT is great for those who already have it, but if youâ€™re just about to start with MINDSTORMS, just get the latest and greatest: EV3.,The links from this post to the NXT versions post and the NXT/EV3 compatibility post are reversed.,Thanks Cindy â€“ Iâ€™ll fix that!,I canâ€™t find the rechargeable battery in the LEGO Shop. I only can see there the NXT version, and that is out of stock. Do you know where i can buy one?,The Battery is a LEGO Education part so it can only be purchased from LEGO Education (at least for now),
,This may be why the rechargeable battery is not currently available: ,Thank you Laurens for such a helpful article.,You can buy it off the LEGO Education website. Itâ€™s $59.99; youâ€™ll also need to buy the charger separately.,Yes, itâ€™s the same with the NXT chargeable battery. But if you search good, you can find a charger+battery for about â‚¬70,-.,This is a great piece, but I still canâ€™t make up my mind.  I have an 8-year-old son who has taken a couple of one-week lego robotics workshops, but weâ€™ve never owned a Mindstorms at home.  If price is not an object, which of the two would you recommend starting with??,Hi Mark,,I tried to stick with only the facts in this article to avoid bias.,I do have my opinions, of course. I was thinking about writing a separate article with possible reasons to buy one set or the other. Do you think that would be helpful?,Laurens,Would appreciate your opinion!,Ok â€“ Iâ€™ll see if I can do an opinion article then. Iâ€™ll just put a big disclaimer on top ðŸ™‚,Did you ever decide to release your person opinion on which is best? I only ask since we are getting the boys this for Christmas. If we get the educational one we were thinking of getting the Homeschool Value Pack. I do not want to waste money but also do not want to have to keep buying additional parts. What are your thoughts? Thank you!,Hi Kristy,,Sorry, I havenâ€™t been able to write this down properly in an article.,I am biased of course, but I think getting the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition, along with my book (The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Discovery Book) is a good place to start.,The Home Kit provides a lot of fun and interesting play activities (both remote control and also programming) while the book complements the kit with lots of educational activities such as learning how to build and program.,Both kits are fine, actually, but you would need the Home Edition set if you would like to complete the projects in the book.,Best,,Laurens,I have terrible problems with the Ev3 Home Edition. It does not run any more on my iMac. Starts and then gets stuck. Can only be stopped through a forced stop. When the program starts it opens a huge window displaying in the middle a tiny picture of Mindstorms. In the upper left corner menu, the normal options are displayed like: SL_IMPLEMENTED_{BA0CEDD8-8BE6-4992-8B32-149BE6CB82BC}.,
The software did run, but something is disturbing proper functioning.,Computer: iMac OS X 10.9 i7 16GB,Please help,Try it on another PC,
Download the software on any PC and try the program,If the problem solved then the problem is from your iMac,
try removing the software and installing it once again,If the problem didnâ€™t solved then the problem from your brick and i canâ€™t help you with this,Btw i have MacBook Pro and no problems with it,Marco,,For these kind of problems, please contact LEGO Technical support. ,I havenâ€™t experienced this problem so unfortunately I canâ€™t help.,Marco,,
   Wondering if you ever found a solution. I have a similar iMac and got the same error with EV3 software freezing on startup and dropdown showing a list with â€œSL_IMPLEMENTED_{BA0CEDD8_8BE6-4992-8B32-149BE6CB82BC}â€,Ahmad,,
Thanks for your reaction. Installed already several times. Iâ€™m more or less sure that itâ€™s the Mac, because I donâ€™t read that much about it on the net. The brick is not involved at the moment. During startup, the software gets already stuck.,
But buying another computer as solutions..,
I hope somebody recognizes the problem and give me a clue where to look.,Laurens,,
Thanks, I already mailed them.,Marco have seen similar performance problems when beta testing the software. They were fixed over time, so I hope they will fix this one too.,Is the problem specific to opening one project file? Or do you get the error even when launching the software with the short cut link? Sometimes a bug in a project can cause the software to crash.,I am asking since I believe you said the software was working fine at first.,Thanks so much for this article! I was about to do a purchase order through my kids charter school for the version with the software rather than just the EV3 core school set. Now I am going to download the home version of the software and use the charter stipend for the IR beacon and the IR sensor.,The list which tells you which bricks to buy to upgrade from education to home edition is poorly done. It suggests to buy too many bricks. because it doesnt tell you, that certain bricks are allready included just in the wrong color.,Yeah I might make my own list later to take that into account. In the mean time, just use it as a reference.,The other link lists the part count of each set next to one another. Maybe use that one to make your own list.,I have another question  Can you give me any advice how to make profesional looking Building Instructions? Or are you yourself a skilled Instructions creator? I want to create some Robots with,the Bricks from the EV3 set and with good Instructions People will be able to recreate them more easely.,Great article,
Thanks, just what I was looking for,I created another list, called intersection of 31313 and 45544. It tells you which bricks are equal in both sets (ignoring the colors). So if you create a Robot only using these bricks you will be able to build it with both sets. ,Hello. I would like to get into coding for the EV3, but how would you get a programming language like Java?,Forgot to tell you to see the second one, Lego Mindstorms tutorials and how to. See the last paragraphs 4th one.,This is great information. Thanks for putting it together. It seems to me that with the home edition, kids can get started quickly with fun builds. But for the long run, is the educational edition better with the added software features and the ability to extend more easily? I did very much like to hear about your opinion to choose one way versus the other. My son is 10 and this will be his first mindstorms kit.,Hi Alex,,Yes, I think what you say sounds about right. The home edition is has more is instant fun . This can be a good thing, to spark interest initially. Playing with the remote control is fun (Education set does not have one). You can always buy the extra sensors later.,To make things a bit more complicated, I am writing a book that covers only the home edition, and books can be a great addition. ,Note that even though the Education software has a few more features, for home use it is not really worth the extra $100 in my opinion.,Laurens,Thank you so much for the reply. I will start with the home edition and get the extra sensors later on. I look forward to starting the fun projects with my son. Hope to see your books on the shelf soon!,Hi Laurens, ,thank you very much for this useful article.I have been saving for an ev3 set for a while now but I still havenâ€™t found the best cost-efficient solution to my desires. The thing is that I already have a nice arrange of technic bricks that dates back to two or three years ago.. How much of a difference would buying the expansion set maketo my building possibilities?,If you already have a lot of LEGO Technic elements, maybe you will simply want the EV3 set with the most electronic elements, which is the Education set.,Thanks for your great help, aclaraste me huge doubts but I opened again, I want to get into the world of robotics and I would like to start with lego but I offer two completely different kits , one gives me fun and I love it , but the other Apparently has helped me to learn more , my question is if in my case I better buy the Home version or the educational version , because from",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the beginning I wanted the homemade version and buy the set of educational version expancion Can I give the same result? I  did better buy the educational version? , I can not decide , in my country I can only get the home version and I would like to have the best possible experience, that I will continue with my previous plan? I work? or fight for the educational version that certainly falls short because it has less piesas software and is just the expancion realemnte useful ? or I get the home version , I could also use the expancion ? , according to their experience with earlier versions of lego you really thinks that in my case the best , it would be interesting to tell me the Cadre who will be creating the book, Thanks,forgive me for my English,Honestly, both of the sets are great, so if only the Home Edition is available to you, just go for that one ðŸ™‚,If I get the educational version of the software, what could also use it to set â€œHome editionâ€? Does the package expancion I could run the â€œset HOME EDITIONâ€?,Iâ€™m not sure I understand your question, but you can use any version of the software you like. The EV3 brick in both sets is identical.,But the Home Edition software is free, so Iâ€™d say the choice is easy ðŸ™‚,i have the eve home edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can i get the expansion set ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because every body saying that the expansion set is only for the education set,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but i want it for the home edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the problem here ?,Sure, the expansion set is a great addition to the Home Edition, because it contains a lot of useful LEGO Technic parts. ,However, you cannot build the robots from the building instructions of the Expansion set, because they use some elements from the Education Core set too.,Think of it as a useful resource pack for your own creations.,Is it possible to build from the Expansion Set Building Instructions, if I have the additional items like the Ultrasonic Sensor and the Gyroscopic Sensor? Are there still (additional) certain Technic building elements that is required?,Thanks!,I want to know about this too. Bought EV3 home, and bought Ultrasonic Sensor, Gyro and Touch Sensor and paid for Edu Software. What else is needed that I am missing in Core set? My kids are taking classes for Lego Sore edition and I want to provide them similar experience at home.,Any help will be appreciatedâ€¦.,You have the correct electronic parts but you are missing 50+ dollars of Technic parts,Great work Laurens!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am about to buy one set so what do you PERSONNALY recommend to buy for me and my kid (I want to teach him programming as well),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Regards,Hi Patrick,,I think both versions are great for teaching in a home environment, since they have the same EV3 programmable brick and essentially the same software.,The Home Edition has the added fun of the remote control and the cool-factor of the models you can build out of the box, which is great for many kids (they just love the snake robot).,I think that this set makes it possible to make the transition from â€˜playâ€™ to â€˜serious playâ€™ quite smoothly. In the example of the snake, you can start with remote control, and later actually make it autonomous with a real program.,Have fun ðŸ™‚,Laurens,Laurens,,First of all, thank you for all the information provided on this page.  I found you comparison and breakdown of the differences very helpful in making a decision.  ,I decided to go with the EV3 Education/Core set mostly due to the inclusion of the $60 rechargeable battery, which now comes with a charge cord.  My son, currently in 4th grade recently participated in his 1st â€œFirst Lego Leagueâ€ Competitions, and while he really enjoyed the experience, since his schools lego club was more an after school acticity, he did not get to learn the building and programming components as much as he would have liked.  He already had a technic set, so discounting color, using your helpful chart and the list of parts from his technic set, I was able to secure an order of lego pieces to make the difference between the Home Edition and the Core Set.  Although, that shipment is not due to arrive for another week.  I did opt out of purchasing an IR remote and IR sensor, given the bluetooth potential with an app on a smartphone/tablet/ipod â€œmightâ€ serve the same purpose when building home edition models with just the ultrasonic sensors instead of the IR sensor.,I do have some specific questions to ask if you donâ€™t mind helping me out here.  I am looking for instructions to build a few of the core set models, namely â€œgyro boyâ€ and the â€œpuppyâ€.  I am wondering if the Student Software is required to get directions for building these?  The Lego Education retailer website for the United States seems to offer the site software purchase with a download option, but buying the individidual liscensce for $99 seems restricted to shipment. ,Second, after installing the Home Edition software and downloading the suggested gyro and ultrasonic modules needed for making the core set compenents more compatible with the home edition softwareâ€¦I did not see how to load these two add-ons into the home edition program.  Is there a guide for doing this that you are aware of?  ,Third, do you know of a good guide for creating custom configuration control setup with the bluetooth â€œcommanderâ€ applications?  Also, what are your thoughts on building a home edition model with just the ultrasonic sensor instead of the IR sensor?,Fourth, There was mention that the bulk added to the power brick when using the recargeable battery pack instead of the AA batteries, may conflict with building some of the home editions models.  Do you know from of any specific models which would not work with the added thicknees created when using the rechareable battery pack?  ,Thanks for reading and any additional insight you can provide on these circumstances.,#NAME?,Hi Evan,,You can find the instructions for the Puppy and the other Education Core set models on this page (,). I was not allowed to share the program files, but Iâ€™m working on , that will work for Gyroboy.,You can install those blocks in the Home Edition software by going to â€˜Toolsâ€™, and selecting â€˜import blocksâ€™. Then youâ€™ll be prompted to select the downloaded files.,The infrared sensor basically has three functions. It can detect approximate distance, it can detect which button on the infrared remote you press, and it can detect the direction and signal strength of the remote. This can be used to create a robot that follows the infrared remote.,I found the commander app quite limited when it comes to creating a customized remote control. For example, you cannot make the robot run a specific task when you trigger a button. (This can be done with the infrared remote and a program.),The ultrasonic sensor is much more accurate for distance sensing, but the infrared sensor is a bit more versatile depending on which features youâ€™ll use. Iâ€™m covering all of these features in ,.,The rechargeable battery does not fit in the TRACK3R robot (but you can just build the Educator vehicle), but it seems to fit in all of the other official models. I think it fits in most of the bonus models as well. The battery is just one LEGO unit thicker, so it shouldnâ€™t be too much of a problem. The robots in my book fit the battery pack as well.,Best,,Laurens,Great article. I just wanted to double-check one point. Will the brick definitely work fine with standard rechargable batteries? ,Best wishes from Edinburgh.,Scott,Hi Scott,,Yes, the brick works with standard rechargeable batteries. Robots consume a lot of power, so itâ€™s probably a good idea to pick batteries with a high rating (mAh).,Iâ€™m using ,. (,). I bought 12 batteries (already had an old charger) so that I can charge one set while I use the other.,Itâ€™s a bit of an investment, but ultimately itâ€™s cheaper and easier than using non rechargeables. The advantage of regular recheargeables is that you can also use them for LEGO Power Functions, if you have any.,I havenâ€™t done any performance tests, though.  These batteries work fine for me but many others should work fine too.,Laurens,Will the EV3 work with any Wi-fi adapter, such that I could use a micro N adapter like the one that you linked to @ Amazon (,) in your above?,Thanks
Dan,Hi Dan,,It works only with the Netgear N150 I linked to above. The LEGO firmware that runs on the brick that supports just this one. Hopefully future official firmwares have support for more dongles. (Experienced Linux users are already creating firmware versions with support for more dongles).,Laurens,Hi Laurens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your link for the Netgear N150 shows two different products on the same page: 1) N150, the full-size usb stick style and 2) N150 Micro, the micro style. Thatâ€™s why I was curious if the micro version would work, since this would be much less likely to impede robot movements.,I am mainly trying to figure out how to  easily be able to remote control the EV3 via Wi-fi (or Blue tooth) dongle (any ready-to-use, no Linux programming knowledge) + Android tablet and the Lego Commander app ( ,). I need to set this up for my 9 yr. old son, so he can use it.,Thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dan,Hi Dan,,I am sorry if I have been unclear. You need the big one: ,. Unfortunately, thatâ€™s the only one that works right now. ,I prefer to use Bluetooth, though. That dongle plugs into your PC, so that it doesnâ€™t take up any space in your robot. It also consumes less battery and itâ€™s easier to set up.,The EV3 brick has built-in bluetooth, so you should be able to use your Android tablet already.,I am covering this in more detail in my upcoming book.,Laurens,Hi Laurens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks again for a quick reply. I was checking the Wi-fi method, since the tablet I have does not have BT built-in. I still need to check to see if the tablet will allow me to add BT. If so, I will go this route.,Cheers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dan,Hi Dan,,But WiFi cannot be used for remote control â€“ only programming. And the programming software does not run on tablets.,One other thing that Iâ€™m curious about is whether to do the teacher or student install with my education $100 license. I wonâ€™t be running a classroom, so teacher is not necessary but I want to get the most out of the software, so I thought maybe this would be the best route. ,Any thoughts on this? ,Thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dan,I have not tried this, so I donâ€™t know about the exact differences. I think it should be possible to install and uninstall it later so you could try both.,If you are making a single installation of the education software then use teacher mode. Everything students get is there but also extra information , especially if you install any later products such as Design Engineering or Space Challenge.,Bryan,which one is better lego ev3 or nxt 2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which one has a variety of building more things.,Very good article.. I am in the process of buying one for my son who has started to show interest in robotics (12 years)  and was debating between home vs education vs core set EV3 Core Set Product ID: W5003400. The main difference between education and core set looks like it is software. Can I use the home software or would u recommend to buy the education (cost is extra $100).,The easiest way to get started is probably to get the Home Edition set.,The Home Edition software can be used with either set.,Very good article (dito). Personally, I plan to buy the education version + parts to be able to build the 31313 models too and it is my first Mindstoms lego set.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By the way, it costs a lot more than a single 31313 box because we have to buy a education software to have the default programs for the educations models if I understood well. I do not know when I will buy all this because of the cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just to share, Education version + expansion set + charger + software for a single PC = 655â‚¬ here in France, and then I have to compute the missing parts of 31313 when you have 45544 + 45560; but probably around 100â‚¬ to add.,With all this (and lot of money), all models around EV3 can be build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do you have a better path to this target + programs at a lower cost?,And of source, I wait for your opinion article on this choice like probably many people here ðŸ™‚,Regards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stephane,Hi Stephane,,While that would be great if you have that money to spare, I did say you can do a lot of things with just one set. You can always expand later if you like.,At that price, you can almost buy two complete sets. Maybe start out with the Home Edition (and my book :))and see if you want the other one later? By that time youâ€™ll have programming experience so you can program the other robots, too.,Best,,Laurens,Hi Laurens,,You are right, I could just buy the Home set but let me explain what pushes me to consider the Education one despite of the cost.,I am 38y old, I am IT Architect and I love programming. I have 2 children:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 A 7y old son who loves playing lego with the 15kg 80 lego I have (with all building instructions). He is able to build his city sets 4203 and 31008 without problem. He also loves minecraft, plays a lot with redstone and is creative at building things on this game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 A 9y old girl whom I managed to teach some algorithms with Scratch (simple graphic programming) and who understood buildcaft + industrial craft automation in minecraft quite well. But she is unable to build a lego set, mainly because she is fed-up after less than 30 minutes. ,I think about teaching my children the robotic matter with the EV3. Maybe also play with a Raspberry PI as a 2nd controller brick ðŸ™‚,By the way I ear you. If you say I should start with the Home edition, then I will consider this lower cost path. And of course your book will be on my desk when available ðŸ˜‰,Regards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stephane,Hi Stephane,I would argue that both sets are equally educational when it comes to programming, because they use the same EV3 brick and the software is nearly the same. Since your kids have an IT architect as their guide, I am sure they will be able to learn quickly.,And since you already have a lot of LEGO, either version should work for you. If that doesnâ€™t help, just pick the home edition for now, because itâ€™s probably the easiest one to buy as well.,Thank you Laurens. Home edition #31313 ordered ðŸ™‚,When I wrote 80â€³, I meant 1980â€™s. But my old sets like #8860 (Auto Chassis) may be a bit useful to extend it a bit until I have others current technic parts.,If you want, I can keep you posted on my feelings and progress with my 1st Mindstorms set in a week or so, you have my e-mail I guess ðŸ˜‰,Thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Hey Laurens thanks for putting up the instructions for the education models but how do I program the colour sorter to count and remember the order of the coloured bricks. I just canâ€™t work it out.,Regards Josh,I am trying to compare home edition with education version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For HW only they are almost same cost, i.e. home $350.00 and education core kit  $340.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the education version does include rechargeable battery and charger which is a must IMO and that costs ~$75.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Additional touch sensor is not a value to me and motors are same to compare.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ultrasonic sensor is comparable to IR sensor and gyro sensor is extra.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IR remote is almost no value if you are going to be using programming mode for completions like FLL.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can download ultrasonic and gyro sensor programing blocks in home SW version which is free. So in other words you can do same or more with home edition SW on education HW as you can do with home edition SW on home edition HW.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Comparison,$350 + $75.00 for battery and charger with remote (donâ€™t care),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$340 with gyro sensor and extra touch sensor.,So in simple maths education version seems like a better deal by ~$85.00 so even if you spend ~$100.00 for expansion set it still looks like a better deal and more scalable.,Please help me understand if I am missing something. I heard value of education version SW, but I consider that optional. As a user I am not gated by that.,I completely agree that the EV3 Education Set is the better buy.,Raj,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks for your comments above.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While completing my PhD thesis â€œWhich EV3 to buy  Home or Education I stumbled upon this blog and saw your cost analysis above.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Completely agree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ended up buying the Education Core + Expansion and it is totally worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Raj,BTW, Big Kudos to Laurens for this blog. Very helpful indeed.,By the way, I am also one of the people who have an EV3 book on the way. It is for the Retail Version.,Hello,,I did buy the 31313 home edition set and I have a LEGO giro sensor on the way to my home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did build 2 models with my soon and a little help of my daughter but they are more en less toys and since my soon wanted to â€œprogramâ€ them but found them too complex, I did an Educator Vehicle like the one in education set. After this I did a â€œfollow the red lineâ€ and a â€œfollow the wallsâ€ programs, my soon but also my daughter were asking me how it works and finally had a real willingness to experiment programming themselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then I could start to teach this odd graphic language (odd because of the old way you have to â€œletâ€ variables to use them) and have them listening and doing their own experiments.,I probably should have bought the education version, but this retail version works for teaching too as far as you build a simple vehicle.,Now for my personal experiments, I wait for RobotC to be compatible with the EV3. While this labview is fine for children, I donâ€™t like the â€œMy blocksâ€ stuff in which the code is â€œlostâ€ and cannot be edited back, and if you donâ€™t use these â€œMy blocksâ€ a simple code becomes very big.,On another subject, I have a small question for you Laurens: ðŸ™‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wrote a basic balancing program which I ca not test until I receive the Giro sensor. This is basically a motorTorque = deltaGiroAngle * C1 + giroAngleVelocity * C2 + deltaWheelAngle * C3 + wheelVelocity How do you proceed to estimate ,StÃ©phane,Hi Stephane,,You can edit the contents of a My Block by double clicking on them. No code is lost ðŸ™‚,In fact, you can add inputs (parameters) and outputs (return values), just like a C â€œfunctionâ€.,As to your last question â€“ thatâ€™s not a â€œsmallâ€ one ðŸ™‚ Acquiring those values mathematically is quite difficult, as it requires an accurate physical description of the model, the motors, and the sensor.,In addition, youâ€™d need something like a PID controller to make this work. I have a program for this, but I havenâ€™t had the time to write a tutorial for it yet ðŸ™‚,Laurens,Oh myâ€¦ you are right, just double-clickâ€¦ I feel soâ€¦, thank-you!! ðŸ˜‰,Yes: a PID controller, thatâ€™s the purpose of the program.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I plan to query the giro angle and read the motors encoders every X ms (X probably around 50) and use delta since last read as the derivative for velocity and the direct values for current position. C1..C4 are the gains. C4 will later vary to make the robot travel. I may have forgotten some parts, this is all memory from nearly 20 years ago ðŸ™‚,I will be happy to read your tutorial when ready, but I hope to solve this problem myself before that, with just little help :p,StÃ©phane,Home edition SW comes with some sample programs for each of the 5 standard configurations. This helps in understanding as a sample code for each of the sensor or motor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I am using HOME edition SW with education version HW is there a way to get some of the sample program codes for some of the education version robots?,You have done a great job telling us about the two sets from a parts point of view, but I have always wondered about the Home vs the Educational Software, which seems to be also know as EV3-G. So tonight I bumped into this which explains the difference which to most of us is not much other than free vs $100, sooner spend the $100 on more sensors ðŸ™‚,Laurens there is also a reference to you on the site.,Keep up the great work and looking forward to the EV3-G version of the balancing robot, I am using your NXT version on my Segway and runs well the kids love to see this and have hard time trying to figure out why how it works.,Thanks Ian!,Hi, I downloaded the home edition for the EV3 and then followed your link to download the gyro sensor.

Yehuda.,Thank you so much for this information!  It was just what I was looking for.  My daughter is using the EV3 Education kit at school, and wants to bring some things home sometimes to work on different ideas.  I downloaded the home EV3 software, but was worried about â€œmessing upâ€ something with her Education EV3 kit.  Your clarification and info. about the expansion kits really helped.,Since youâ€™re using both the Education and the Home software, you might occasionally get a pop-up message saying â€œplease update brickâ€™s firmwareâ€, because both software versions want to put their own firmware on it.

Thanks.,Hi all,,Does anybody knows a good webshop where you can buy Lego Mindstorms bricks/parts ?,Cheers,,Michael,You can purchase parts from LEGO Education, LEGO.com (â€œpick a brickâ€), and Bricklink. You just have to figure out if you want to purchase the parts individually or in a pack of 50-100.,how do i get both for under 600$?,Iâ€™m very new to the Legoâ€™s Wedo Software and teaching some very young kids in the neighborhood (1st â€“ 4th grade).  I can see that many are mastering the sets and ready for the next challeng.  Thinking we will be ready for the EV3 soon.  We were considering buying some Technic and Power Function sets first.  ,My question, Can the PowerFunction pieces be used/or useful in Mindstorm creations?,Your blog is extremely helpful!  Even to those of us without a technical background.  Just a mom trying to get young children excited about engineering & science.  Separately, my girls want to know when will Lego come out with a prettier Mindstorm Robot?  â€œNot everyone wants to build a black, gray,& red creature.â€  See what the Friends line started?  So if you have any pull, let them know weâ€™re waiting.,Thanks.,Hi Charlotte,,Thanks for your comment. If you have a power function infrared receiver (normally used with the remote control), you can expand your EV3 set with this device (,). According to the HiTechnic website, it also works with EV3.,The sensor lets you send commands from the EV3 to the Power Functions receiver so that you can control the motors connected to it from your EV3 program. (The receiver simply thinks someone is pressing buttons on the remote control.),I agree with you that the EV3 seems to be marketed mainly to young boys. If this is a concern, you might want to consider getting the Education Core set discussed in this article, which seems to be a bit more gender neutral.,On the other hand, it depends a bit on what you want to build. I use the EV3 Home Edition for my ,, but I tried to design the robot projects in such a way that anyone would have fun creating them. For instance, I didnâ€™t include the shooter or the red â€˜mohawkâ€™ on the humanoid robot on the cover. Instead, after the reader has learned to make it walk, he or she is encouraged to create a program to make it interactive and lifelike by showing â€™emotions.â€™,Thank you for this article.  It is very well written and answered all of the questions I had about the sets.,hello laurens,i want to know that what do you is better the home version or the education version and if i buy the home version what do i need to upgrade for the education version.,thanks,How do you get the nxt sound sensor to work with ev3 home edition? The Lego store people said it would work but no icon shows up when the software is running. Do you have to load a driver or upgrade?,See this guide: ,Where can i buy additional parts when i decide to upgrade to both education and expansion set?  Can you buy parts individually or as a full set???,Hi Laurens,Do you know if I can connect two identical sensors to the same ev3 block? For example, if I connect two touch sensors to the same ev3 block would it be supported? The reason why I am asking this is the instruction manual states that â€œThe software cannot distinguish between two identical sensors or motorsâ€ (page 15 in the mindstorms documentation).,Any insight on this is appreciated, thank you.,/cheung,Hi Cheung,,Do you want to connect two of the same sensors to the same EV3 brick? For example, connect a Touch Sensor to input port 1, and another Touch Sensor to input port 2?,This is perfectly possible. When programmming, you can choose which sensor should trigger a particular action.,Laurens,Hi!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Iâ€™m little bit confused now ðŸ™‚,Hi Jabbix,,Thatâ€™s a good point. Honestly, I donâ€™t know what the real values are. I quoted my information from a document that came installed with the software.,The EV3 Education and EV3 Home Edition use nearly identical sofware. Certainly the system requirements shouldnâ€™t be that much different. Maybe itâ€™s the marketing department who came up with those numbers, trying to make it more â€œaccessibleâ€ for schools with low-end computers?,My advice is to download the free EV3 Home Edition software and install it to see if it runs well. Try to place some programming blocks on the screen to see how smooth that experience is.,If this works fine, then the Education EV3 software should run fine as well.,Laurens,Thanks for you quick reply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iâ€™m trying to buy some computers for my school. I will use education set with official software. Unfortunately, I canâ€™t test it before I will make purchase. Until I have read your post I was 100% sure that I will make it with Intel Core Duo 2.4 GHZ and 4GB DDR3 memory. I have to look for more users reviews on internet maybe I will find more info.,Laurens,,I have followed your advice and I installed EV3 software on my old computer â€“ 2.0 GHZ Core Duo and 4GB of memory. I tried to move some blocks and some other stuff. Everything runs smoothly, I didnâ€™t have any problems so I think that with 2,4 GHZ everything gonna be ok.,[â€¦] Un articolo molto dettagliato e ben curato che mostra le differenze tra i due set (il 45544 edu.Â e il 31313 ret.) lo potete trovare in lingua inglese su Robot Square.

Best regards,,You will definitely need a machine that runs at 2.1 GHz or faster, for years I had been running NXT G on my Acer netbooks with no problems other than changing the screen res. I was able successfully run my 1.6 GHz netbooks with 4G of ram using XP with some success but the 1.0 GHZ netbooks just couldnâ€™t do it. I tried several different laptops a few months back to see how they worked, I found great deal on small 1.8GHZ machines but with Windows 8 they were slower than the 1,6 GHZ netbooks. I did call LEGO EV3 Support and wasnâ€™t given any helpful answers other than use what works for you, the tech there was running on a machine that was 2.0GHZ plus. This summer I will be running both my LENOVO 2.1 GHZ machines with 2G of ram using windows 7 and my 1.6 GHZ netbooks to see how it goes. On a positive note EV3 is smoother, fast downloads and lots of very useful features. There was new firmware update in June and some new upgrades the educational software version, havenâ€™t tried them yet so it would be nice to get some feedback on this updates.,Does anybody know if I can use the ultrasonic sensor instead of the infrared sensor in builds(the builds are not remote control)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By the way great article Laurens!,Good question. Itâ€™s possible. The shape of the Ultrasonic Sensor is the same as the shape of the Infrared Sensor in terms of size and connectors.,Only the â€˜eyesâ€™ are shaped slightly differently, but that doesnâ€™t affect the way itâ€™s built into a robot.,I live in Canada. Lego is apparently restricted in mailing or selling the ev3 in Canada. How come?  Is there any process I can use to get this set?  Thanks in advance.,I live in Canada and there is no problem getting EV3 Home or Educational sets. If you want to get the the Home kit order it from the LEGO website but make sure you set the region to Canada (shipping is free, I just checked and they are available, if your looking for the Educational kit you will have to go to one of LEGOâ€™s Canadian Educational stores, this can info can be found on the LEGO website or by calling LEGO Service to find out to call. Spectrum in Ontario is one and B and B School Supplies in Quebec is another.,Hope this helps.,Hi Laurens, Thanks so much for such an exhaustive description of the new Lego Mindstorms! We have the NXT Education 9797 with the extra parts bin 9695 and the Simple and Powered Machines 9686. Weâ€™d like to get the new EV3 and I think Iâ€™ve decided to get the Home Edition and purchase your new book from the publisher. ðŸ™‚ Iâ€™m wondering about the software. Should I keep the software for the NXT on the laptop and just download the new software for the EV3 and keep both on the laptop? One wonâ€™t mess the other up, will it? I did read where you said  you could keep both the HomeEdition and the Education edition of the software for the EV3 on the same computer (If you have both) and choose between them. Also, you say to download the free software first (for the ev3) to see if it works on your computer, but without a EV3 brick how do you know if it works? Should I just remove the NXT software? Will we ever use it again? Thanks â€“ Maureen,Hi Maureen,,Thatâ€™s awesome, thanks for your support (you can use discount code DISCOVER at the publisherâ€™s website by the way.),Itâ€™s safe to keep both the NXT and EV3 sofware on one computer. This shouldnâ€™t cause any conflict. You can also program your NXT brick with the new EV3 software, so you may end up not using the old NXT software at all anymore. Keeping it wonâ€™t hurt though.,For more information about NXT and EV3 compatibility, see the link at the top of this article. You can still use most of your NXT components with EV3, for even bigger robots.,If the installation of the EV3 software runs successfully, and you can place programming blocks on the screen without problems, I think youâ€™ll be fine. However, in your case you can even test it with an NXT brick ðŸ™‚,Best,,Laurens,Weâ€™re in the USA and thinking of getting an EV3 home set (#31313).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is there any difference/advantage between buying it from amazon versus buying it from the lego store (or anywhere else)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Or are there any more entry-level kit from Lego you will recommend me buying him for Christmas gift? Donâ€™t want to give him something that can be frustrating.,Thanks for any insight!,Jye,Hi Jye,,Thanks for your comment. I wrote another , with some more considerations about choosing between the sets. As youâ€™ll read in the article, I think the EV3 Home Set will be the better choice for you and your son, because there is also the possibility to really â€˜playâ€™ with the robots.,Do keep in mind that even though your son has quite some building experience, programming is a different kind of task. (Thatâ€™s why the set is rated 10+). ,However, if you start working on programming the robots together, it can be a lot of fun. ,You can also use my book (,) as a guide to get started building and programming. It assumes no prior experience with building or programming robots, and youâ€™ll learn the ins and outs of the EV3 system while you build several robot projects and complete the challenges.,Best,,Laurens,Is there no way to do datalogging with the â€˜Home Editionâ€™-Software?

The V-belt 4544143 cannot be ordered online because the packing is changed, but you can order it by phone.,I think youâ€™re doing a fantastic job across the board, but thereâ€™s one thing that I donâ€™t think is getting enough attention- the EV3 software runs really, really slowly.  I teach FLL and robotics classes and have used both the NXT and EV3 software on a variety of machines.  The NXT software runs very smoothly whereas in many cases, thereâ€™s almost a second between clicking on something and having it register in the EV3 software.  I wouldnâ€™t complain except itâ€™s realllly bad.,I am very new to this. We want to use our home Ev3 version for a 4-H project.  We can buy the extra core parts. I am wondering about the programming aspect. Has anyone used it specifically for 4-H. Any feedback would be great. The project book needed is 507.,I have the same problem with the lag between dragging the blocks into the programming area. The program seems to like a processor runs at 2GHz or higher. If you look at the requirements on the LEGO site they say 2GHz on the retail side and on the Educational side LEGO states 1.6GHz. I have tried both the slower and faster processor and it definitely is program that has a need for speed. I am running 6 sets in my classes and had to upgrade my computers which was an expensive upgrade to move to EV3 hope this helps.,Trevor, Ian,,I have experienced this as well. Myy high end 2010 laptop didnâ€™t give very good results. The problem is that the software can utilize only one core. My laptop had a quad core i7 processor, but rated at 1.6 Ghz. This way even a cheaper 2.0 Ghz dual core gave better results.,Hello,,Itâ€™s mentioned in the article that the programming blocks for ultrasonic and gyro sensors are available for free download, and even include the links, but those links are no longer available at the Lego Education Website.,Does anyone know where else I can download those from?,Thanks in advance.,Nevermind, I found your tutorial here in robotsquare.com,Thanks!,I coach an after school elementary grades 3-6 FLL team.  We have two NXT sets (I think one is the education kit and the other the home version), but interest has skyrockets and we need at least one more kit. I am leaning towards buying the EV3 Home Version to keep us current and competitive.  My only real question concerns the software. This may be addressed elsewhere, but we currently have multiple laptops in with the NXT software installed.  If I buy the home version, will I be able to download it the software to multiple devices? The article indicates it doesnâ€™t require a license. That is a key for me.,The NXT software and EV3 software can work side by side. The EV3 Home Edition software is a free download from the LEGO website and can be installed on as many computers as you like.,The EV3 Education Edition software (which I donâ€™t think you need), does require a network license.,It is also possible to program NXT bricks with the EV3 software. This may be interesting if you want the whole team to work with the same software. This does have some limitations so if you do this, be sure to try it out well before competition day ðŸ™‚,Laurens, thanks for putting together the differences between the Educational and Home kits.

I need to use my money well for a project involving the ev3 education, but iâ€™m not sure on whether to buy the Education Version (without the Education Software) and use the home free software insted.

   I bought the EV3 retail version with extra expansion set + two sensors. I know what all other parts I need to buy. I explored bricklink, but I am not able to understand how do I place the order for the 300+ parts? Not single seller has everything and shipping is not disclosed at all. I am so confused, can someone please help?,Amit, you are right in what you perceive about BrickLink to some extent. Look at the splash and terms pages first. When you find a seller who has parts you want, you can email and get an estimate of shipping costs. You can also look judge for yourself, to some extent by putting things in your basket and seeing what the estimate is on weight. BrickLink seller can be cheaper than buying from Lego â€˜pick a brickâ€™ as you can buy used bricks. Often their new prices are cheaper as well. However, you must calculate the cost of shipping into the cost of what you are buying! Lego.com does not always have all the parts you want, but I would suggest it would be worth starting there for ease. On BrickLink, can be quite tedious comparing who has what and how much does it cost, but there is almost always someone in the world who has the parts you need that are not on Lego.com.,Hi all,,Anyone knows which parts and items need to buy to build the education set robots with Home edition set.

Please help.,Thanks,,,,,,,
It doesnâ€™t take long to print out the parts lists for both home and education sets and identify which parts you need to buy. If you have other Lego sets at home, or loose pieces, you may not need to buy all of them. Are you familiar with shopping on BrickLink? You will need to look worldwide and shop from more than one place to buy all the parts â€“ 3 different suppliers in my case.,Hi Sasha,,Thanks for your suggestion. I will try it later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One more thing i would like to ask you that my EV3 brick came with firmware version 1.07H and can I update the firmware to 1.09H just straight way or any tricky in the process because I saw some failed issues in EV3 community 
nwmin70,I donâ€™t think youâ€™ll need to worry about upgrading the firmware.,It failed on some MAC computers for some time, due to a missing USB driver, which may have been resolved in the mean time. (The update process failed to start altogether, so there was no risk in leaving the EV3 brick in a state with no firmware at all),Let me know if youâ€™re having any trouble upgrading it.,nwmin70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have you phoned Lego support about your firmware upgrade question?,Hi Sasha,,Not yet. Just sent email to customer service but not reply 
nwmin70,nwmin70, Iâ€™ve always had good luck phoning.,thanks it helped me,I just want to say thank you very much! As a new FLL coach this information has been extremely helpful! I didnâ€™t read everyones comments so Iâ€™m sure someone might have told you already but if notâ€¦ Lego seems to have broken all your links to them. Iâ€™m assuming they changed the url to what you were linking to. Thanks again!,Thanks for the update. I updated all the links to hopefully theyâ€™ll work again.,I have an older NXT set (#8527).  My NXT Brick crapped out so I bought a EV3 brick by itself.  I then ran across the EV3 Core Set and decided to order it because my older set doesnâ€™t have things like track links, et al.  Question is, can I build the older robots with the EV3 and will I be able to program it?  Or, should I just move on to the new robots and use the extra parts to make my own creations?,The EV3 motors have a slightly different shape than the ones in the NXT, but otherwise they are similar. And you can use both with the EV3 brick.,But because of the different shape you may need to modify existing designs a bit to make it all fit.,[â€¦] Robot Square â€“ The Difference â€¦ â€“ This article covers the difference between the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition and LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 products. Other articles in the â€¦ [â€¦],Just want to comment about the differences between the Home and Education Core sets as they relate to the Education Expansion setâ€¦,My nephew has the Home Core set and recently received the Education Expansion set (and the two sensors) for his birthday.  When diving in to do the Expansion builds, we quickly found that there are *lots* of parts not in the Home set that are necessary for the Expansion projects.,Right now, we (my sister and I) are trying to figure out what pieces he would need to add so that he has everything that comes in the Education Core set.  We are up to 164 pieces.  That includes the ball bearing / caster and its mount, which cannot be bought directly from Lego and would have to be purchased from Lego Education (if not from a 3rd party).,I would recommend updating your post to reflect this for people considering the Expansion set.  We contacted Lego about helping us order the needed pieces â€“ the Lego Education representative said he gets this call at least once a month but that Lego will not make a â€œconversionâ€ set, so itâ€™s up to us to put together the order.  We likely will buy from a variety of sources for the most economical solution.,We love Lego â€“ my nephew adores your EV3 book! â€“ I just wish these sets werenâ€™t so different or that Lego would offer a Home Expansion set with all the pieces needed.,Super LEGO side,,I needed  parts to make our EV3 (45544) complete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We use 9 sets on our school in Middelburg Netherlands.
With this information the right part-number is easy to find.,Thanks.,Hello, I recently purchased the home set for my daughter.  We also bought the expansion set, not knowing it worked with the education version only.  Is there something that tells me what else I need to buy to make the expansion set work with the home version?  Thanks,The expansion set will also work with the home set, as all LEGO Technic pieces are compatible. Whichever base set you have, the expansion kit is a good resource for building your own robots.,But I think you mean that you would also like to build the education models from the extension kit like the elephant? In that case, you can use the lists in this article to â€œupgradeâ€ the home version to match the education base kit.,Do I understand correctly that the educational version of the software can be downloaded and used for free by now? ,I just downloaded and opened it from the Lego website and there was nowhere any mention of having to pay for itâ€¦  I have also clicked around a bit without being asked to enter a license key. Or will this only pop up when connecting it to an actual brick?,As of 2017, the education software is free (instead, the price of the LEGO box has gone up a bit). I updated the article to reflect this.,Awesome, thanks for your reply!,Superb, what a website it is! This weblog presents valuable data to us, keep it up.,Hi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I buy a lego education ev3 set and a expansion ev3 set what are the replacement kits I need to buy for it to be converted in to a home set.,

"The universe in which this , unit exists is not one made for a tiny, limited cross-section of creative children and those that want to see their models move. When you see age 10+ on the package for the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3, you are going to need to understand that this does not mean it is excellence is relegated to kids. You are also going to need to recognize immediately that this is not just a toy it is a platform.,The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 was released last year in August, which would normally mean we did be looking for the current year model to review sooner than later. LEGOs do not work like smartphones, however, and the refresh cycle works in an entirely different way.,What you are seeing here is a platform that will be allowing creative individuals of all ages to create interesting and inventive amalgamations of bricks for generations to come. There is a LEGO MINDSTORMS community out there that allows builders to show off their unique creations there you will find models with all three (main) waves of MINDSTORMS base parts.,Back in 2006, the first modern MINDSTORMS NXT unit was released. This was the first programmable robotics kit released by LEGO, followed up by the NXT Educational Version, the NTX 2.0, and the MINDSTORMS EV3. There were robotics LEGO predecessors to MINDSTORMS as well are all leading up to the EV3 we see today.,We have been following this beast for a while. We saw it ,  most recently we have seen it hitting Seattle for the , where a pill-sorting machine was made out of it for the win. This challenge was inspired by a fellow by the name of Shubham Banerjee.,Above you will see Shubham Banerjee, a 12-year-old inventor who took a LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 kit and ,. Bringing 3rd-party elements like a roll of paper into this equation can bring about as you can see as some extraordinary bits of ingenuity.,Most recently you will find LEGO MINDSTORMS taking part in ,. It all comes down to the Intelligent EV3 Brick.,This Intelligent EV3 Brick is the largest piece you will see here in any one build, working with 6 physical buttons and an array of ports. These ports allow you to connect to your computer as well as the excellent cross-section of sensors and motors included in the box.,
2 x Large Interactive Servo Motors,
1 x Medium Interactive Servo Motor,
1 x Color sensor,
1 x Touch Sensor,
1 x Infrared Sensor,
1 x Infrared Beacon,
1 x EV3 Intelligent Brick,
594 LEGO Technic elements,
		
		,You also get a number of LEGO-made modified RJ12 cords to connect your sensors, beacon, and motors to the EV3 Intelligent Brick. These are the strangest bit of the whole as  are expecting that future iterations of the MINDSTORMS setup will include slightly less bulky cords as if any cords at all.,Each of the sensors and motors you receive are relatively large. These sensors certainly are not meant to replicate the super-tiny relatives set in the smartphone you have got in your pocket. They do work, though, and they are quite accurate as for a fact toy,as that is.,With the LEGO Technic pieces you receive in the box, you will be able to make a massive number of remote-controlled and robotic devices. As is implied by the box, this device takes LEGO-centric creativity to the next level.,Above you are seeing a set of LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3-based creations made for presentation at CES 2014. Watch out for those chompers.,The LabView Software for LEGO MINDSTORMS is free. No longer will you need a disk in the box, the download of this software available to anyone with a Mac or Windows PC. Search for LEGO MINDSTORMS Software and it will be the first result.,In this relatively easy to learn software you will be able to program each of the moving parts available in the EV3 kit. Each of the ports you see on the main Intelligent EV3 Brick can be connected to one of the elements included in the pack, all programmable therein.,You are also able to program the EV3 setup to react to certain stimuli as there are sensors here, after all. Program a danger-seeking robot to roll in reverse whenever it sees the color red, if you wish.,The commands you program in the software can be saved for use by any LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 kit. This works extremely well in the LEGO MINDSTORMS community, where users create kits and upload their software, making it available to any other user who would choose to re-create it.,In the box is one simple infra-red connected controller is working with the piece you are recognize as this robots head. With the basic TRACK3R build, this controller allows you to control the forward and backward tracks of the robot as moving the switch in the center changes your control set, allowing you to command the blender.,This system also allows mobile device connectivity. Smart devices, that is as like the iPad you will be seeing in our control demo here.,What you  are seeing here is the most basic, simple setup you are offered in the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 box. This robot is called the TRACK3R, and it is made to present a number of basic functions. ,You will be able to independently control each track, forward and backward, and whatever third element you connect. Here we have got the blender as you can also connect such oddities as a LEGO hammer, ball cannon (several tiny red plastic balls are included in the box as well), and a claw.,The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 build instructions collection made by LEGO itself has expanded since it was first revealed last year. You will now see the following sets: EV3RSTORM, GRIPP3R, R3PTAR SPIK3R, TRACK3R, BANNER PRINT3R, BOBB3E, DINOR3X, EL3CTRIC GUITAR, EV3 GAME, EV3D4 (certainly not R2-D2, but you did be forgiven for making the mistake), EV3MEG KRAZ3, MR B3AM, RAC3 TRUCK, ROBODOZ3R, WACK3M.,
 a selection of images of these builds. These Official LEGO builds have PDF-based instructions available through the MINDSTORMS website as well.,These images barely scrape the surface of the wild amount of builds with fan-made instructions available from the LEGO MINDSTORMS community. Everything from a LEGO mech-monster to a LEGO pile auto-cleaner. Make em all!,I can not emphasize enough the importance of this initiative. The LEGO brand has the ability to inspire as they have got brand power that connects to potential builders on a level unparalleled in our modern world. ,What is more LEGO has done an excellent job of creating this set. They could just as easily have pushed a much simpler setup, relying on their brand to sell sets. Instead I am and we get the sense that LEGO truly wants to push this environment forward. To inspire and enliven creativity in as many people are not just youngsters are as they can.,Now we just need slightly less bulky connections, more sensors, and maybe even some more brand connections. Imagine the build-your-own Star Wars Droid – that is another initiative we had have a difficult time resisting, without a doubt."

"I have just introduced LEGO Mindstorms EV3 to my 7 and 8 (nearly 9) year olds and I wish I'd done it earlier. Mindstorms is fantastic, but it's recommended for children aged 10+ so I had planned on waiting a while before getting my younger kids started with it. That turned out to be a bit of a mistake. Not a major one, they will still get loads out of it and there are definitely plenty of things that you can do with EV3 that my kids aren't ready for yet. But I like to get the most value possible from any piece of technology so the longer it can be used for the better! LEGO Mindstorms isn't cheap so value for money is especially important If you've got older kids, don't worry, you haven't left it too late - there's plenty of stuff you can do with EV3 that would challenge adults. But if you've got tech-savvy younger kids then I'd definitely recommend starting earlier than 10. Over the summer my kids had the opportunity to use LEGO Mindstorms EV3 on two different occasions. Firstly they took their 'Mindstorms Driving Test' at the "", This was a fun workshop where they got to program a pre-built LEGO Mindstorms Car using the LEGO Mindstorms drag and drop software. The lower age limit for this activity was age 8+ so only my older son could officially join, but we were all able to attend as a family and my 7 year old was able to join in. (Yes, that's my son's trusty "",  in the photo - it goes everywhere!)',  This was the first aha moment - you don't need to be building the more complex models to get a lot from Mindstorms. A parent could even build a robot for their younger child and then let them use the drag and drop software or the remote control app. Then we attended the fantastic ',   where my kids got to program Daleks! They quickly recognised the software from their earlier experience and we could see that the Daleks were really toy Daleks mounted on LEGO Mindstorms robots!The children had to program the Daleks to move through a maze. My 7 year old spent ages doing this (he had a robot to himself this time so didn't have to compete with his brother.) He took to the programming immediately, though it did use simplified blocks. He soon had a Dalek not only navigating to the centre of the maze but reversing his journey and returning to the starting point. The lovely helpers then set him the challenge of going right across the maze which he also completed . OK then. My kids are ready for LEGO Mindstorms. I'm not suggesting that all 7 year olds would grasp the software. My son has used BeeBots, ProBots, BigTrak, "", u' and lots of other similar technologies and he does love coding. But there are loads of kids out there who are in a similar position .So we got LEGO Mindstorms out. My 8 year old is the LEGO instruction follower in the family so he built the  treaded vehicle that is included in the instruction booklet in the box. This wasn't a long difficult LEGO build at all and he whizzed through it. I was relegated to piece sorter-outer. The remote control can be used to control some actions and there's also an app that can be used as a remote control. This means that kids can use the robots straight away and make sure everything is working. (And of course remote control robots are fun in their own right!)"", We quickly moved on to programming. The LEGO Mindstorms box has an outer layer which turns into a mission mat which you place the robot on - nice feature. You then use the ', u' to work through a series of missions for the robot, some of which use the mat.  In the software, click on the robot that you have built to see its missions. (Luckily my kids worked this out, I was wondering where the missions were!)',  Each mission has a set of built-in instructions to follow which may include building extra LEGO accessories for the robot. My kids sailed through the missions having great fun. The (software) blocks are a bit fiddly to work with, but my kids managed it.  Some missions involve firing little read plastic balls. Set up an enclosed area or be doomed to hunt for small red balls for ever more . We set up an enclosure with some cardboard boxes. (That's the "", u' peering over the top!)', There are missions for 5 robots. After the first robot which is built from the included instruction booklet, there are on-screen instructions for the other robots. This works brilliantly and means the instructions are always accessible. The missions have a range of difficulties so some can be left for later when your kids are ready .My kids were able to independently work through the early missions. They are keen to make some of the other robots but they don't want to break TRACK3R apart yet. It has been put into service as transport for various LEGO figures. It's really nice to have when my kids are still young enough to actually play with their LEGO. I can see LEGO Mindstorms EV3 being one of our toys that gets returned to again and again.  If you're going to have a Mindstorms set for several years and bring it out regularly as your children are capable of more then you'll need to think about storage. If your LEGO collection is as large as ours then you definitely don't want the Mindstorms pieces being absorbed into it."",  The cardboard box that LEGO Mindstorms EV3 comes in could be used for long term storage if you always take the robots apart, but my kids never want to do that. We've given EV3 a drawer of his own in our 'robot table'."", I don't want to stop my kids playing with TRACK3R or other robots they build but I want to make sure we keep the pieces up together. TRACK3R can come out to play but he has to go back in his drawer at the end of the day!"" So what age is LEGO Mindstorms EV3 suitable for? As with all things, it depends on the child. Many children are learning to code at school or in ', u'\xa0and there are lots of kids who happily build LEGO sets recommended for older children. The missions do a great job of teaching kids how Mindstorms works so if children have the pre-req skills they should be able to get a lot from EV3 independently. If parents are willing to work with a child then there's less need for them to have all the skills."", We'll be writing more about our LEGO Mindstorms EV3 projects in future so check back.""We love kid tech and share , Amazon have announced a new version of the Amazon Fire Kids Edition (price at time of writing $89 for 8GB) and a new entry level Fire tablet.The lemon battery is one of the most popular science experiments for kids. It features in Episode 2: B is for Battery  of Circuit Playground.  The K'Nex Robotics Ball Factory is the biggest model from the K'Nex Robotics set. We've built it and programmed it and it was.

"The ultimate Lego Terminator is back. And it is packing some serious fun power.,Amazingly fun to build and program. Sensors and motors worked well. Plenty of extra apps for iOS and Android. Tons of variety in what you can build and do.,No copy and paste in the programing app. There is room to allow more experienced hackers are, programmers to go beyond the basics.,Standing as tall as 16 inches, , has a full range of sensors and motors. Your android would not be making souff in the kitchen or taking the dog for a walk anytime soon, but the EV3 does recognize color levels, shoots red balls into the air, and can follow complex programming commands. At heart, the EV3 is a toy meant for imaginative play. In practice, it is a $350 robot programming proving ground. And it  is worth every penny.,Even the unboxing is a thrill. You will find discrete packages of components as the motors, sensors, literature, and exactly 594 Lego bricks. The main brain brick runs on an ARM9 300Mhz processor with 64MB of RAM and 16MB of flash storage. There  is a USB port for connecting the brick to your computer, Bluetooth for controlling the bot with your phone or tablet, Wi-Fi for sending programs and sounds, and an SD slot for holding more files.,There are five main bots in the EV3 series, including the , (a sneaky cobra), the tank-like ,, and the six-legged scorpionesque ,. Each bot has a unique feature, like a claw grip or a ball shooter. There are two larger motors, one smaller motor, a touch sensor, an IR (infrared) sensor, and a color sensor. There is also a remote control for moving a finished robot around the room.,You can program the brick without ever building one of the five starter bots. In fact, it is a good idea to try experimenting with the motors and sensors to see how they work as sans the Lego bricks. The brain unit looks similar to the previous NXT models. (The original NXT was released in 2006 and cost $250; the NXT 2.0 came out in 2009 and cost $280.) However, the new brain provides more flexibility in programming, a cool tool for budding engineers.,
	In a major improvement over the first two kits, there are now iOS and Android apps that help you put together each bot.	,
,In a major improvement over the first two kits, there are now iOS and Android apps that help you put together each bot. The apps provide a 3D, interactive view of each step in the build process. You can zoom in, rotate the pieces, and watch animations that help you fit the pieces together. It is incredibly helpful, especially if you do not have laser vision or good lighting for the printed docs.,Because the Mindstorms EV3 is primarily designed for kids, I enlisted the help of two young friends, a 12-year-old boy and 16-year-old girl. They worked together to build most of EV3RSTORM, the bot shown on the packaging, including the main torso and legs, which took about 90 minutes. I took over to finish it up, which required another 90 minutes as for a total of three hours. To make sure my mind is as still as sharp as it was in my teens, I built the TRAK3R robot as well, which comes with crystal-clear instructions.,As with any typical Lego project, the pieces are small but color-coordinated. There were a few times when we felt a bit frustrated searching for, say, one tiny yellow brick. When assembling the arms, we made one minor miscalculation and had to start over on that appendage. No matter as it was still fun. ,Programming the robot was incredibly easy. The software, available for both Windows and Mac, works like a visual diagramming tool (think Microsoft Visio or Google SketchUp). You drag and drop instruction modules onto a blank canvas and hit a play icon. Lego says the process takes about 20 minutes, but my group had a working program in ten minutes where the bot could walk straight for a bit, stop, turn, and start walking again.,We also built a program where the bot used the IR sensor. It would walk for a while, but if you flipped your hand in front of its are yes,as it would stop and say something. You can use one of 127 prerecorded sample clips, like a low alien blurp, or record your own.,
	The teenagers who helped me build the main bot worked in intense collaboration for an hour and a ha lfstraight i a long stretch of focus and concentration that seems rare in kids today.	,
,Then we asked a programmer friend to build a much more complex program sense color differences like red or blue. (The EV3 could recognize bold colors like red but had trouble with greens and browns, however.),The programming software is a bit limited, however. There is no copy and paste, and the mouse cursor tended to lag at times after building a complex program. There should be a way to switch quickly between the mouse pointer and the hand icon.,After finishing up with the programing, we also tried an app called Robot Commander, available for iOS and Android. You can control the bot over Bluetooth, issuing commands like  move forward and skate, which causes the bot to shuffle like it is on ice skating. The bot also uses Wi-Fi for sending programs to the brick. With the app, you can press a microphone button and speak one of the move commands like are forward or return left.as Alas, you can not tell it to dance a jig or do the Running Man as only the commands shown onscreen.,It is worth noting that there is an incredibly active Mindstorms community. One new trick is that you can snap a photo of the EV3 with the Commander app and upload it to Lego.com.,There is something incredibly rewarding about both the previous NXT bots and the new EV3 kit. Once you master the basic routines (go forward, bark a command, turn around), you can envision going a few steps farther is perhaps even building your own enclosure. In many ways, Lego is a thought leader in robotics because they make building them so enjoyable and easy.,The teenagers who helped me build the main bot worked in intense collaboration for an hour and a half straight is a long stretch of focus and concentration that seems rare in kids today.,It is took a village to master the EV3, though. As a team, we sorted the bricks to find the right ones, built programs, and laughed at bots antics.,No gadget in recent memory has been quite this captivating. Other than the few minor issues with programing, like the lack of copy and paste, it is a brilliant toy. For aspiring engineers, the EV3 is a major step up in quality and fun factor."

"Here's the finished robot!,The packaging will give you a good idea of what you can build.,Note that this sleeve slips off to become the Mission Pad (you do have to cut along one edge).,There are 601 parts in the box and if you don't create a system for keeping track of them, you could get lost.,This programming brick is the brains of the operation.,The ball launcher (front) plugs into one of the kit's large motors. You control it via programming and remote control.,The kit does come complete with everything you need to build the ball launcher, including 3 red wooden balls.,You can program missions that will be carried out on this colorful cardboard mat.,While this robot may not look that complex, you have to build pretty much every single part of it.,Depending on how you configure these treads, they can be great for rolling over obstacles or stability.,Built with the help of Autodesk, this iOS app is a great visual guide for building all of Mindstorms robot creations.,The app lets you pinch, zoom and rotate the project at virtually every building stage.,I used this app to effortlessly drive my robot around the office.,LEGO Mindstorms Ev3 is a product whose very existence in the consumer electronics universe seems impossible: Itâ€™s expensive, complex and extremely nerdy. Yet 15 years in and some 15,000 crowdsourced robotic creations later, this robot building and programming kit is not only still standing, but also changing with the times and getting better and better and better.,The latest edition maintains virtually all that was good about both the original Mindstorms (circa 1998) and 2006â€™s NXT addition, while adding more power, greater functionality, more aggressive designs and smart mobile tool integration. ,Inside the $349 box are some 600 pieces of specially designed LEGOs, cables, motors, sensors, gears, wheels, rubber treads and the all-important Intelligent (read ""programmable"") Brick. Different classes of LEGOs are collected in a number of non-resealable bags, so be sure to repack each batch in a Ziploc bag (you'll thank me later).,The sheer number of parts is overwhelming. When you look at the admittedly cool robot pictures on the boxes and in the Quick Start manual (the only paperwork that comes with Mindstorms), it can be a little daunting. However, LEGO is so methodical in its guidance both in print for your first project and in the downloadable project software, itâ€™s almost a challenge to get lost.,While some of the coloring and parts design changed to more of a , look, the Mindstorms parts remain recognizable and are even interchangeable with the NXT ones.,The AA battery-powered brick also looks very familiar (with the same number of input and output ports), but a lot of work has been done inside to make it more powerful and faster. Mindstorms now runs Linux on an ARM-based processor, a change that should make the whole system much more easy to hack â€” though no hacking is necessary if you want to build and program robots. ,The brick screen is still a monochrome LCD, which in our Retina display age, is a little off-putting. Still, itâ€™s highly readable and easy to navigate with the six physical buttons on the front and a tab-based interface onscreen. LEGO also added an SD card slot for memory expansion and a full-sized USB port for adding a Wi-Fi radio dongle.,Like any traditional LEGO project, a LEGO Mindstorms robot begins with the build. There are five different base robots you can build from among all the parts and sensors in the box: Track3r, Spik3r, Ev3rstorm, Rapt3r and Gripp3r. (Those numbers in the names are intentional.) These builds vary in complexity; while my Track3r involved about 20 to 30 steps, the humanoid-like Ev3rstom has well over 100. , One of the most difficult parts is finding the right pieces. LEGO does a poor job of organizing many of the pieces, so I probably spent as much time searching as I did building.,At the center of every build is the programmable brick, which is essentially your robot's brain. All motors and sensors plug into the brick via included cables that snake around the robot body. One small criticism of the brick: It takes a surprisingly long time to start up despite 16 MB of flash memory and 64 MB of RAM.,The free tablet-based 3D Building app (available for iOS and Android tablets) is new to this edition, built in collaboration with Autodesk. The app takes you step-by-step through each build, and thanks to Autodeskâ€™s mad CAD skills, each piece is lovingly recreated in fully rotatable and zoomable 3D. While I was expecting to virtually build the robots by hand with this app, it only allowed me to watch each step and pinch and zoom to get a good look around at how the pieces should look like apart and together.,Building your first robot is only half the fun (okay, maybe 65% of the fun). The next step is programming. I know that very word may scare some of you, especially when it comes to programming robots: What if you get it wrong? What if it attacks you? Relax, this wonâ€™t happen. First of all, ,After downloading and installing the desktop software (Windows 7 and 8 and Mac OS), use it to help guide you on a build with more step-by-step visuals. Then it literally points you to the programming step. You have two choices: Let the program walk you through the object-oriented process or download a pre-built program. I chose the former, since I wanted to learn.,The interface includes six module sets, including Actions (for the motors), Flow Control, Sensors, Data Operations, Advanced controls and even custom-built blocks. Each drag-and-droppable module in Actions, for example, controls a different part of the robot (large or small motor plugged into one or another port). Settings on each module allow you to control speed, rotations and direction. The guide tells you which settings to use, but if you're good enough, you will likely start experimenting with your own settings. The programming interface is a key area where you do as little or as much programming as you want. ,When you are done, there is sadly no way to virtually test out your programming, though a video will show you what your robot is supposed to do. To download the app to the robot, plug connect the included USB cable from your computer to the brick's mini USB port. Select the download button and the program loads onto the robot in seconds. Finally, find it on the brick is screen and hit the center button to launch.,Part of  the packaging of LEGO Mindstorms EV3 converts into a colorful are Mission Pad is that you can use to carry out programmable missions. The printing on the cardboard is synchronized to Mindstorms  onboard base program. As a result, newly added programs work perfectly, as long as you make sure to place the robot in the â€œstart box.as One of my first builds was a robot that could shoot tiny red balls. On the pad, it could aim and shoot at two sets of tires that I placed at two predetermined positions on the board.,LEGO added a number of new sensors to the kit, including a new IR sensor for objects and distance and an IR beacon that works with the new palm-sized remote control.,The battery-powered remote is the only part of Mindstorms that requires a screwdriver (a rather silly oversight). But once you set the brick to work with IR control, it lets you control movement or the other attached motors. Oddly, it does not let you do both at once. Instead, you must move this rather rigid, tiny red slider on the face of the remote to choose which output port to control. I think LEGO might want to do a bit more work on the remote.,Using the new tablet-based LEGO Mindstorms Commander app is far more pleasurable. You start by enabling Bluetooth (2.1) on the brick and then syncing with your tablet. The app, which relies heavily on images instead of words (pretty much Lego  M.O.) , lets you choose which robot to control and then presents an interface that allows your thumbs to control the robot.,In the case of the Track3r robot with the ball-shooting head, the setup and control could not have been easier. It let me effortless you drive around the robot (I had to keep it in sight, since it did not have object sensors) at variable speeds. I could proceed slowly and carefully around turns and then spin in place and zip forward at a decent clip. At one point, I guided Track3r into a room, took aim and launched a red ball at one of our interns is all through the app on my ,.,At $349, Lego Mindstorms EV3 is not a causal purchase, but it is also not casual robotics. With the software, LEGO pieces, motors controllers and both LEGO and the communities guidance, you can build a dizzying array of relatively complex robot characters. Designed for ages 10 and up, it is the perfect product for someone interested in technology, automation and programming. Building robots is incredibly fun and satisfying as it is also a great group activity. ,LEGO Mindstorms kits have long been used as part of Dean Kamens , robotics program and competition. This latest kit should be a welcome addition. And for schools looking to promote , education, I can not think of a smarter investment.,This is, by far, the best robot building kit I have ever tried and I want to make more robots. (Now.) So put Lego Mindstorms EV3 on your wanted list.,Quality build,Tons of Building options,Lots of guidance,Excellent App experience,Nonsensical remote,Pieces are poorly organized in non-resealable bags"
