Great book!!!,Oren,"on March 23, 2016",Was studying to be a data analyst and this book was literally like a cookbook. Really easy to maneuver through and really informative. Easy to use.

A High Quality Book On R Programming!,Kelly Maurice,"on August 19, 2015","This is an excellent book. I read it from cover to cover. I did not try out the examples however. I found the writing to be very good and the book, although a cookbook, actually provides a great way to get an in depth overview of R. The R packages facilitate the use of the book examples by providing test data in the packages. The book is organized well, especially the file I/O and data structures, as well as the statistics sections."
