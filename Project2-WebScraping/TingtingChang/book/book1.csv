Good introduction to R - recommended for those who are new to R,Yuki,"on August 28, 2016","I bought this book to learn basics of R, and I am pretty satisfied with the book. This book covers many topics without being encyclopedic. If you follow the book and run the codes, you will be familiar with many functions of R. I definitely recommend this book for R beginners."

Five Stars,Dominick Currier,"on June 6, 2016",Great cookbook with great recipes!
A great book written very clearly,Amazon Customer,"on May 22, 2016",A great book written very clearly. Most of these technical books are difficult for me to understand and become confusing. This book does not fit the mold. It is very easy to understand and follow. There are useful examples and it comes in handy as a quick reference. My only complaint is that the book didn't really discuss functions or loops as much as I would have liked. Everything else I have needed I have been able to find except for these topics
