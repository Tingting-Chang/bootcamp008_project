Excelsior," April 18, 2016",Lucero Solórzano, Hákonarson delivers an honest story about two men and their relationship with nature. [Full review in Spanish]
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," April 14, 2016",Josef Braun," It is Rams' two-legged antagonists, to be sure, that are locking horns here. Theirs is a primal struggle, wisely left unspecified -- all the better to activate our imaginations."
Rip It Up," April 12, 2016",David 'Mad Dog' Bradley, A pleasingly modest and sometimes incredibly moving film.
Sydney Morning Herald," April 6, 2016",Paul Byrnes," This powerful volcanic landscape needs a complimentary style and Hakonarson brings one: long takes with little camera movement, almost a series of tableaux. It's similar to documentary but with a more poetic touch."
Sydney Morning Herald," April 6, 2016",Sandra Hall, The shafts of humour don't shine nearly as brightly as they should.
Urban Cinefile," April 3, 2016",Andrew L. Urban," Deceptively seductive in its veracity and subtlety, Rams engages us, intrigues us and finally moves us beyond our expectations"
Urban Cinefile," April 3, 2016",Louise Keller," It's a story about sheep, estranged brothers and following rules - or not. The story may be simple, but the sentiments are not - we are fascinated, horrified, amused and greatly moved"
The Australian," April 1, 2016",Stephen Romei," This is a film that allows you space to think, to make connections -- and to wonder what is going on and why. The actors are often silent; they are like people we might meet at any time, and being with them is challenging and rewarding."
Salt Lake Tribune," March 25, 2016",Sean P. Means," Sigurjónsson's quiet, soulful performance illuminates the loneliness of a man living in a cold and remote valley, with no one but his worst enemy and dozens of sheep in the vicinity."
Philadelphia Inquirer," March 18, 2016",Steven Rea, Resonant and surprisingly affecting ...
Reeling Reviews," March 14, 2016",Laura Clifford," Steeped in a specific regional culture, you never know quite where ""Rams"" is headed."
Reeling Reviews," March 11, 2016",Robin Clifford, I felt that I was sharing my time with real people with a real story.
Boston Globe," March 10, 2016",Ty Burr," In its attentive and hushed way, the movie is about collision: between stubborn farmers and the government veterinary board, between ancient ways and modern times, between two old, hardheaded brothers."
Irish Times," March 6, 2016",Donald Clarke, Here is a most unusual comic drama from Iceland that plays some very clever games with tone.
Blu-ray.com," March 2, 2016",Brian Orndorf," A confidently observed drama that bathes in behavior, adding bits of comedy and tragedy to help underline pleasing idiosyncrasy. "
Willamette Week," February 23, 2016",Zach Middleton," Despite living within a stone's throw of each other, the two haven't spoken in 40 years. Granted, there's not much dialogue between anyone in this almost comically minimalist Scandinavian film."
"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," February 19, 2016",Robert Horton," The film has less of the dark humor Icelandic films are known for, and an ending that elevates the material."
Seattle Times," February 18, 2016",Michael Upchurch," Sigurjónsson's Gummi, with his quiet canniness and his fearful, conflicted feelings about his belligerent brother, is the best reason to watch ""Rams."""
HeyUGuys," February 17, 2016",Stefan Pape," An amiable, if frustratingly undemanding piece of cinema."
Killer Movie Reviews," February 13, 2016",Andrea Chase," it is through Gummi's eloquent silence, and even more eloquent expressions, that the emotional tension and the relief find their expression"
Film Ireland Magazine," January 3, 2017",Colm Quinn," Hákonarson doesn't lessen the harshness of the characters or the landscape, but still manages to find beauty in the way they are."
Financial Times," December 27, 2016",Nigel Andrews," After grim comedy comes the threat of grim tragedy. The ending is a do-or-die confrontation with the elements, powerfully presented."
Sunday Times (UK)," December 18, 2016",Edward Porter," It never becomes deep, but its tender view of its richly drawn characters makes it beguiling to the end."
MovieMail," December 13, 2016",Mike McCahill," It's a delight to encounter a film that quietly, gradually creeps up on you; which, without seeming to expand a huge amount of effort in so doing, puts a smile on your face."
Brooklyn Magazine," November 15, 2016",Keith Uhlich," Gummi and Kiddi's interactions tend toward the comical, but the rock-steady widescreen cinematography by Sturla Brandth Grøvlen lends the proceedings a deadpan aura."
Total Film," October 12, 2016",Tom Dawson," Deadpan Scandi-humour runs through writer/director Grímur Hákonarson's carefully crafted tale, and there's no doubting the film's empathy for its protagonists. Shame, then, that the final-reel shift into tragedy feels misplaced."
LarsenOnFilm," August 30, 2016",Josh Larsen," ...takes place at the end of the world, but it's a place that means all the world to the two brothers at its center."
New Zealand Herald," August 4, 2016",Peter Calder," Hakonarson taps into something almost mythical: the bearded brothers, who could have stepped off the set of an Old Testament epic, may hate each other, but they share a fierce pride in their flocks' pure and ancient bloodline."
Antagony & Ecstasy," July 10, 2016",Tim Brayton, The quirkiness that seems omnipresent in much of the film falls away to reveal something hard and brutally meaningful.
The Young Folks," May 29, 2016",Gary Shannon," With so many wild ideas tackled at once, perhaps it's Rams' modest realism that ultimately holds it back from the tragicomic tour de force that it wants to be."
Georgia Straight," May 18, 2016",Ken Eisner, he superb film's ending is so primordial you'll know it's about far more than livestock and sibling rivalry.
Madison Movie," May 6, 2016",Rob Thomas," Rams is a very strange film, but it's one that takes us to the top of the world to find people that, sure enough, we recognize as ourselves."
Flavorwire," May 3, 2016",Jason Bailey," This small, peculiar story becomes strangely involving; it's a movie that sneaks up on you, right up to the bursting-dam emotion of its extraordinary closing scenes."
El Fanzine," April 29, 2016",Gonzalo Lira Galván," With a simple and everyday premise, Hákornason not only creates a touching study of a fractured family dynamic, but also makes a commentary about the necessity to unite as a society in the face of adversity. [Full review in Spanish] "
Cine Vértigo," April 28, 2016",Ernesto Diezmartinez, Hákonarson know exactly how to navigate between a customs comedy and an endearing family drama. [Full review in Spanish]
Cinexcepción," April 28, 2016",Hugo Hernández Valdivia, Hákonarson explores fraternity with great warmth and illustrates how we can unite when adversity comes. [Full review in Spanish]
Cinema Movil," April 22, 2016",Gonzalo Lira Galván," Rams is an almost silent film, a slow burn if you will, that never sacrifices the thrills and comedy. [Full review in Spanish]"
Cinemanía (Spain)," April 21, 2016",Manuel Piñón," A film where sheep and rams have more dialogues that the main characters, yet somehow it's as fun and heart warming as a brothers embrace in the snow. [Full review in Spanish]"
Concrete Playground," April 19, 2016",Sarah Ward," There's little about this perceptive examination of the bonds of blood, the struggles of farming life, and the importance of finding hope and humour in even the bleakest of circumstances, that feels routine or overly familiar."
Herald Sun (Australia)," April 19, 2016",Leigh Paatsch," The remote rural setting plays a key part in the success of Rams, as do the rustically endearing lead performances of Sigurjonsson, Juliusson and their ovine co-stars."
The Skinny," January 28, 2016",Patrick Gamble, Its combination of visual lyricism and naturalism allows Rams to transcend its parochial surroundings and posit universal questions about globalisation.
El Pais (Spain)," November 12, 2015",Jordi Costa, Shines a light on a particular lifestyle desinged to be as a well oiled machine. [Full review in Spanish]
La Jornada," November 9, 2015",Carlos Bonfil," Simple, but its sociological and moral deviations are many and very suggesting. [Full review in Spanish]"
Cinegarage," November 3, 2015",Erick Estrada, One of the best metaphorical films in years and at the same time an emotional bomb capable of shutting up even the loudest movie out there. [Full review in Spanish]
En Filme," October 26, 2015",Luis Fernando Galván, Fully captures the lifestyle of these rural communities where people sacrifice everything for their cattle. [Full review in Spanish]
Film Freak Central," October 4, 2015",Walter Chaw, It's an elegant film full incongruously of low humour.
ScreenAnarchy," October 4, 2015",Jason Gorber, A film that's emotionally complex and moving and using the best of its storytelling elements and sublime environment to tell this lovely narrative.
Screen International," September 15, 2015",Allan Hunter, Rams may sound bleak and unforgiving but it has a generous spirit and wit that make it entirely accessible.
Hollywood Reporter," September 15, 2015",Todd McCarthy, A small story about two old estranged brothers and their animals gently morphs from gentle near-absurdist comedy to something close to tragedy.
Variety," September 15, 2015",Alissa Simon, Rams is a touching humanist drama set in a remote farming valley where two estranged brothers must come together to save what's dearest to them: their sheep.
NOW Toronto," September 15, 2015",Paul Ennis," Sigurdur Sigurjónsson's and Theodór Júlíusson's acting is exemplary, with Sigurjónsson's understated realism the key to the film's deep emotional resonance."
CraveOnline," September 9, 2015",Fred Topel," Rams really could have been about anything. The heart of the story is two brothers in the same business and how that business divides them. But they say ""write what you know"" and in Iceland they know sheep, so Rams is about two sheepherders. "
Guardian," September 7, 2015",Caspar Llewellyn Smith, Rams is as curiously captivating as the bleak landscape in which the two protagonists site themselves.
Independent (UK)," February 4, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab, Hákonarson has an eye both for the forbidding beauty of the landscapes and for comic detail. 
Sight and Sound," February 4, 2016",Trevor Johnston," To find another film whose straightforward, almost homespun simplicity masks a director in truly confident control of his material you'd probably have to go back to David Lynch's The Straight Story."
Times (UK)," February 4, 2016",Kevin Maher," Rams is a gorgeous, tender and unexpectedly moving film about the most unlikely of subjects: sheep farming in the northern valleys of Iceland."
New Statesman," February 4, 2016",Ryan Gilbey," Rams fits in to a melancholy Nordic tradition -- think of Kitchen Stories, Of Horses and Men or the hangdog comedies of Aki Kaurismäki -- where whimsy is forever being elbowed aside by despair. "
Wall Street Journal," February 4, 2016",John Anderson," For all its intrinsic Nordic absurdity, Chaplinesque pathos and unsettling use of vastness, writer-director Grímur Hákonarson's ""Rams"" is also a moving, deftly told tale about various kinds of loss."
NPR," February 4, 2016",Ella Taylor," If the movie touches on universal issues of sibling rivalry, the psychological insight is almost incidental in what is an intensely particular and roughly tender tone piece."
Guardian," February 4, 2016",Leslie Felperin, Highly recommended.
Empire Magazine," February 4, 2016",David Parkinson," Switching from dour humour to humanist drama without seeming contrived, this is a masterclass in combining character and landscape that is played with deceptive poignancy by the excellent leads."
AV Club," February 4, 2016",Mike D'Angelo," Sigurjónsson and Júlíusson build on this in their distinct performances (one's angry, the other more sorrowful), silently conveying the weight of whatever long-ago betrayal led to their estrangement."
ColeSmithey.com," February 4, 2016",Cole Smithey, [VIDEO ESSAY] an eloquent character and social study of tortured souls at the mercy of nature's volatile whims.
ReelTalk Movie Reviews," February 3, 2016",Donald J. Levit," 'Rams' is quiet, measured and charming. "
New York Post," February 3, 2016",Farran Smith Nehme," Director Grímur Hákonarson excels at building tension through long takes, and the actors are excellent. Sigurjónsson offers a world of meaning in a grunt or a lift of the shoulders."
RogerEbert.com," February 3, 2016",Matt Zoller Seitz," You spend a rather long time during this movie simply watching characters exist. That's something mainstream American films almost never do, and there's something quietly riveting about it ..."
New York Times," February 3, 2016",A.O. Scott," Despite its affection for the quirks of its characters and their milieu, the film is most memorable for its gravity, for the almost tragic nobility it finds in sad and silly circumstances."
Film Journal International," February 2, 2016",Daniel Eagan," A critical favorite at Cannes, where it won the Prize Un Certain Regard, Rams will find an art-house audience among fans of Roy Andersson and Per Petterson."
Village Voice," February 2, 2016",Alan Scherstuhl, It's the rare international shepherd drama that feels urgently connected to contemporary American politics.
Hollywood & Fine," February 2, 2016",Marshall Fine, A melancholy charmer that will make you laugh and bring you to tears.
Slant Magazine," February 1, 2016",Chuck Bowen, Every moment in writer-director Grímur Hákonarson's strange and wonderful film is imbued with mystery and revealing dignity.
The List," February 1, 2016",Emma Simmonds," Hákonarson's film evolves into something increasingly compassionate, with matters culminating on a sincere, surprisingly moving note, that's both tender and tragic."
Salt Lake City Weekly," January 29, 2016",Scott Renshaw, A solidly effective story at the core of Grímur Hákonarson's off-beat comedy drama.
National Post," February 12, 2016",Chris Knight," At its heart it's a tender story with a fuzzy exterior; a sheep in sheep's clothing, if you will."
San Francisco Examiner," February 12, 2016",Anita Katz, This Icelandic dramedy is droll and truthful.
Globe and Mail," February 12, 2016",Kate Taylor," There's lots of wisdom here, but in the Icelandic barrens, good cheer has sometimes gone missing. Yes, there's a price to pay for being stubborn."
Toronto Star," February 12, 2016",Linda Barnard, A lovely film that will stay with you.
San Francisco Chronicle," February 11, 2016",G. Allen Johnson," If you are determined to enjoy it, Hakonarson will throw every challenge in your path."
SF Weekly," February 11, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly, Alternately witty and moody.
NOW Toronto," February 10, 2016",Norman Wilner, Writer/director Grímur Hákonarson starts his movie as an observational absurdist comedy but develops it into something far richer. 
Entertainment Weekly," February 9, 2016",Joe McGovern, The film's touching final scene is imbued with the raw truth of a prairie fable told among shepherds over the centuries.
Daily Express (UK)," February 7, 2016",Allan Hunter, Deadpan comedy and a sense of compassion mark this as a film to seek out and treasure.
Observer (UK)," February 7, 2016",Mark Kermode, Sigurður Sigurjónsson and Theodór Júlíusson are utterly convincing as the battling brothers whose alienation is expressed more through morosely bearded gesture than drunken buckshot dialogue.
Film-Forward.com," February 5, 2016",Kent Turner," Deceptively unassuming storytelling (understated acting and the rhythm of the long takes) gives way to a slow thaw, beguiling the viewer without overstaying its welcome (at a precise 93 minutes). "
NPR," February 5, 2016",Bob Mondello," A drama that offers a portrait of dedication and alienation, as well as of an unspoken, honored-entirely-in-the-breach bond between brothers who've spent a lifetime butting heads near the top of the world."
Flick Filosopher," February 5, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson, Exists on the spectrum between 'fascinating and unclassifiably odd' and 'could almost be a parody of an arthouse film except it's too moving to be a joke.'
NYC Movie Guru," February 5, 2016",Avi Offer," Mesmerizing, breathtaking and quietly poignant with a delicate blend of drama and comic relief."
Spirituality and Practice," February 5, 2016",Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, A satisfying and quirky slice-of-life film set in rural Iceland.
Metro," February 5, 2016",Matt Prigge," Slowly, inevitably, things turn tender, but the slide comes naturally, too, and things end on a note of unexpected seriousness that feels earned, even though next to nothing has been said."
Little White Lies," February 5, 2016",David Jenkins," Though it's fairly obvious how the film is going to play out (and, sadly, it plays out exactly as expected), Rams spends far too long dawdling when it comes to the matter of settling on its tone."
Radio Times," February 4, 2016",Karen Krizanovich," Credible, hilarious and poignant by turns, Rams is a keenly detailed, well-paced and entertaining tale of family dynamics ..."
Christian Science Monitor," February 4, 2016",Peter Rainer, Two estranged fraternal Icelandic sheep farmers might not seem like the most promising of movie subjects. Think again.
Los Angeles Times," February 4, 2016",Kenneth Turan," Serious and moving but also with a bleaker than bleak Scandinavian sense of humor, ""Rams"" is so much its own film that figuring out where its unusual, unpredictable plot will end up is difficult if not impossible."
