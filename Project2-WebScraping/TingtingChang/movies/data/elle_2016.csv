Cinetvymas.cl," December 13, 2016",Felipe Tapia," A very crude, sordid, well told and entertaining drama that has a bit of comedy. [Full review in Spanish]"
The ARTery," December 9, 2016",Sean Burns, Elle is an unholy mingling of rape-revenge fantasies with a fusty French bedroom farce. I've never seen anything quite like it.
Film Inquiry," December 5, 2016",Laura Birnbaum," Elle is a bewitching film that wishes to engage with its audience, provoking both disquieted gasps and uncomfortable laughter in the most untimely and opportunistic moments."
Punch Drunk Critics," December 2, 2016",Travis Hopson, Will offend and intrigue in equal measure by defying cultural norms in just about every respect.
The New Republic," November 30, 2016",Miriam Bale," Elle is clean, deep, and uncomfortable."
NYC Movie Guru," November 27, 2016",Avi Offer," A smart, sophisticated and riveting psychological thriller for adults. Isabelle Hupper's best role since The Piano Teacher!"
Cinemalogue.com," November 25, 2016",Todd Jorgenson," The twisty screenplay is both subversive and provocative, and even perversely humorous as it pushes boundaries and genre conventions."
Philadelphia Inquirer," November 22, 2016",Tirdad Derakhshani," Like its heroine, the film shocks by lunging back and forth between comedy and tragedy."
Ex-Press.com," November 22, 2016",Jay Stone, It's not a movie about a troubled woman. It's a movie about troubled filmmakers.
One Guy's Opinion," November 22, 2016",Frank Swietek," An intoxicating blend of sex, mystery, and violence about an indelible character you'll find it difficult to forget-but would probably prefer never to meet in real life."
Boston Globe," November 22, 2016",Ty Burr," Huppert is phenomenal in her most unnerving performance since Michael Haneke's ""The Piano Teacher."""
New Yorker," November 21, 2016",Richard Brody, It doesn't exist except as a pile of tropes and clichés that have neither a material nor a symbolic identity but solely a string of simplistic causes and programmed responses.
Reeling Reviews," November 20, 2016",Robin Clifford," Isabelle Huppert is an acting force to be reckoned with every time I see her. Here, as Elle, she may be diminutive in stature but her force of will cannot be matched."
Concrete Playground," November 20, 2016",Sarah Ward," Huppert clearly relishes the loaded territory she's playing in, and proves the real reason Elle demands attention."
Kaplan vs. Kaplan," November 18, 2016",Jeanne Kaplan," ""Elle"" is an intriguing French thriller --- but not suitable for everyone. "
Kaplan vs. Kaplan," November 18, 2016",David Kaplan," This movie has a little bit of everything, much of it perverse, all of it mesmerizing. "
Aisle Seat," November 18, 2016",Mike McGranaghan, A darkly compelling look at what a tortured soul can do. Isabelle Huppert is superb. 
Reeling Reviews," November 18, 2016",Laura Clifford," ""Elle,"" like its heroine, is an enigma, but Huppert's monumental talent is crystal clear."
San Diego Reader," November 18, 2016",Scott Marks, Ultimately the identity of the masked attacker is moot: in [director] Verhoeven's eyes every man is capable of rape.
Globe and Mail," November 18, 2016",Kate Taylor," In the end, Michèle's entire persona and all her actions are a reaction to the behaviour of the men around her and her character becomes flatter and less intriguing the more her own sociopathy is exposed."
Las Vegas Weekly," January 11, 2017",Josh Bell," A fascinating and unexpected character study, balancing playful titillation with serious questions that linger long after the final inscrutable moment."
Georgia Straight," January 11, 2017",Ken Eisner," Paul Verhoeven, the former bad boy of Dutch cinema, is back with a deliciously refined vengeance after years in the wilderness."
Willamette Week," January 11, 2017",Walker MacMurdo, Verhoeven and Huppert have crafted a grimly humorous but life-affirming portrait of strength and survivorship.
"Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)"," January 11, 2017",Bob Bloom," (Director Paul) Verhoeven continually upends expectations and keeps you involved through suspense, not so much on who attacked Michelle, but on her method for eventually exacting her revenge."
NUVO Newsweekly," January 10, 2017",Edward Johnson-Ott," Elle is the best of Paul Verhoeven's movies. With flashing warning signs, I highly recommend it."
Cleveland Plain Dealer," January 5, 2017",Michael Heaton, The core of this story is little more than a nasty piece of lurid misogyny masquerading as a tale of women's empowerment.
Black Girl Nerds," January 5, 2017",Jacqueline Coley," Paul Verhoeven returns to European cinema, with French cinematic icon Isabelle Huppert, and gives us modern-day psychological crime thriller that is as dark as it is brilliant."
Film Experience," January 2, 2017",Nathaniel Rogers," I urge you to not read any reviews before seeing it, including this one. It's not that the film has twists that can spoil the experience if they're known ahead of time so much as it's in the way the movie is itself twisted."
Washington City Paper," January 1, 2017",Tricia Olszewski," Its third act may leave you sickened instead of surprised. Elle is not for the closed-minded. Michèle's home and lifestyle may project a sense of chicness, but it never completely obscures the ugliness underneath."
Film International," January 1, 2017",Elias Savada," There is a brazen, dangerous atmosphere floating about the French-language feature Elle, a dramatic thriller with much to admire but, depending on your sensibilities, not as much to like. "
Cinema Movil," December 28, 2016",Oscar Uriel," A disturbing film from beginning to end, it's difficult to imagine vestiges of humor with a topic like this, but Verhoeven does it without detracting from its significance. [Full review in Spanish]"
East Bay Express," December 27, 2016",Kelly Vance, The indignities and mishaps are so numerous that they become comical.
Austin Chronicle," December 22, 2016",Marjorie Baumgarten," One of the best films of the year, Elle is a gripping psychological thriller, something of a Hitchcockian whodunit but with a feminist protagonist. Riveting yet puzzling, the film is guaranteed to provoke reactions -- and not all of them sympathetic."
New Zealand Herald," December 22, 2016",Francesca Rudkin, Elle is a twisted little number that's weirdly entertaining.
Seattle Times," December 22, 2016",Moira MacDonald," There are several ways you can watch ""Elle,"" only one of which is mildly enjoyable."
St. Louis Post-Dispatch," December 22, 2016",Calvin Wilson, Get over your subtitle phobia and check out one of the best films of the year.
Blu-ray.com," December 22, 2016",Brian Orndorf," It's a strange feature, but one doesn't want Verhoeven any other way, and he delivers a unique viewing experience as the story touches on some truly disturbing events."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," December 22, 2016",Colin Covert," ""Elle"" is a mysterious puzzle, not mainly about whodunit plot points, but the far more titillating question of who people truly are and what they're capable of."
Portland Mercury," December 21, 2016",Andrew Wright," A breathtakingly twisted piece of work ... that bridges some markedly taboo fault lines concerning power and sexuality. And somehow the damned thing is also funny, usually at the least opportune moments."
leonardmaltin.com," December 15, 2016",Leonard Maltin, Elle is an outrageous mix of psychological thriller and character study in which that character is a mass of contradictions. Only an actress as skillful as Huppert could play her to the hilt and not repel us
Letras Libres," February 9, 2017",Fernanda Solórzano," Paul Verhoeven breaks with the Hollywood conventions of filmmaking and creates an intelligent and transgressive film, where Isabelle Huppert plays her most complex and enjoyable character so far. [Full review in Spanish]"
El Universal," February 8, 2017",Alonso Díaz de la Vega," Elle is not an attempt to humanize fetishes or condemn them, but it's a brilliant achievement in admitting and ridiculing them. [Full review in Spanish]"
Excelsior," February 8, 2017",Lucero Solórzano, A strong film for a single actress who truly takes over the scene because of her enormous talent and personality. Highly recommend. [Full review in Spanish]
Q Network Film Desk," February 6, 2017",James Kendrick," Had Verhoeven made something more self-consciously garish or darkly comical, the material might have worked, but Elle suffers from something of a split personality, with Verhoeven gleefully shocking us while also reaching for art-film bona fides."
Cine Premiere," February 1, 2017",Carlos Jesús González," A very contemporary film in which its protagonist is capable of transmitting compassion, rejection, empathy and excitement. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Straits Times (Singapore)," February 1, 2017",John Lui," Really, what sticks in the mind is Michele's quiet stoicism, at once sad and unsettling."
ReelViews," February 1, 2017",James Berardinelli, Elle's moral ambiguity and controversial content are its strengths.

Detroit News," January 20, 2017",Adam Graham," ""Elle"" never pulls any punches, and Verhoeven titillates right until the end."
Common Sense Media," January 19, 2017",Jeffrey M. Anderson," Director Paul Verhoeven's first movie in French features an elegant, powerful Isabelle Huppert; she adds weight to what's really a pretty basic, stretched-out story filled with sex and violence. "
Cinencuentro," January 18, 2017",Carlos Esquives," An irreverent film worthy of those of its generation as Brian De Palma or David Cronenberg, to who seems to pay tribute. [Full review in Spanish]"
It's Just Movies," January 17, 2017",Ron Wilkinson," A violent story and a violent performance even by Isabelle Huppert's standards twists and turns its way to acceptance, if not redemption"
Cinemixtape," January 16, 2017",J. Olson, Verhoeven's first film in ten years - and his first deliriously twisted one in much longer - is quite a rebirth for a filmmaker long assumed lost.
FilmsInReview.com," January 14, 2017",Victoria Alexander, Verhoeven is back thanks to the magnificent performance by Huppert. She deserves the Best Actress Academy Award for her fearless performance.
Salt Lake Tribune," January 12, 2017",Sean P. Means," It's challenging material, with elements of dark comedy and misogyny, that's intriguing even when David Birke's screenplay goes off the rails in the end."
Sacramento News & Review," January 12, 2017",Daniel Barnes," Huppert is practically incapable of falseness, the perfect star for a film obsessed with ugly truths."
Columbus Alive," January 12, 2017",Brad Keefe," Calling it bold is an understatement, and it is what elevates the film to one worth the controversy, albeit only for equally bold audiences."
Movie Nation," January 12, 2017",Roger Moore," Verhoeven, a chilly, efficient director of arms-length sexually-charged thrillers, doesn't want you to fall for the heroine. He wants you to almost pity the assailant. "
La Jornada," May 23, 2016",Leonardo Garcia Tsao," Those who expect a conventional thriller of female revenge, do not know Verhoeven's filmography. [Full review in Spanish]"
Time Out," May 23, 2016",Catherine Bray, Takes constant delight in venturing where the vast majority of filmmakers would fear to tread.

Screen International," May 22, 2016",Lisa Nesselson, Suspenseful and unsettling from first frame to last ...
Hollywood Reporter," May 22, 2016",Jordan Mintzer, A beautiful dark twisted French fantasy.
Guardian," May 22, 2016",Xan Brooks," A film that runs boldly up and down the tonal bandwidth, zig-zagging from pitch-black horror to devilish satire to light domestic comedy and then back again."
Variety," May 22, 2016",Guy Lodge," High-risk material yields unexpected rewards in this remarkable rape-revenge drama, a possible career high for Paul Verhoeven."

Rolling Stone Mexico," September 14, 2016",Arturo Aguilar, A film as provocative as curious and uncomfortably funny. [Full review in Spanish]
Vox," September 13, 2016",Todd VanDerWerff," I'm not sure Elle completely adds up... but I appreciated how epic its scope was for a film that is, ultimately, about a few weeks in the life of a middle-aged woman."

Movie Mezzanine," September 9, 2016",Kenji Fujishima," To watch Elle is to be perpetually unsure of how to take its alternately sympathetic and unfathomable main character. In other words, it's Paul Verhoeven at the height of his artistic powers."
NOW Toronto," September 9, 2016",Susan G. Cole," Doubtless, defenders will be legion, touting its arty pretensions and ""brave"" approach to essential issues. Count me out."
BBC.com," September 9, 2016",Sam Adams," Directors in their later years often settle comfortably into their preoccupations, doodling happily around the edges of their previous careers. Verhoeven is still trying to make masterpieces, and with Elle, he comes awfully close."
Collider," September 9, 2016",Phil Brown," Michele is a fascinatingly complex character and her response is highly personal, rooted in a lifetime of emotional callousness. The character works thanks to Isabelle Huppert, in one of her finest performances. "
JoBlo's Movie Emporium," September 9, 2016",Chris Bumbray, A strong return-to-form for Verhoeven and a potentially award-worthy performance by Huppert.

Film-Forward.com," June 17, 2016",Kent Turner," Though rife with sexual violence and graphic dialogue, Paul Verhoeven's blunt, button-pushing, and stinging comedy was the most elegantly made entry in the Cannes Film Festival's competition. "
ColeSmithey.com," June 6, 2016",Cole Smithey," [CANNES 2016] Daring, ribald, and scathing on every level, ""Elle"" is a movie that sets a standard that 21st century cinema should aspire to. It kicks Hollywood in the teeth without lifting a finger. Glory."
Cinema em Cena," June 3, 2016",Pablo Villaça, The new Verhoeven is a genre exercise that also has the ambition of a character study. [Full review in Portuguese.]
London Evening Standard," May 29, 2016",David Sexton," Elle is outrageous, funny and shocking, exhilarating and original."
BuzzFeed News," May 26, 2016",Alison Willmore, Essentially a startlingly enjoyable character study with an extraordinarily difficult starting point.
ScreenAnarchy," May 26, 2016",Jason Gorber," Elle is a masterwork by a master filmmaker, while Huppert's performance reminds the world once again what a treasure she is."
The Film Stage," May 25, 2016",Giovanni Marchini Camia," Elle would be unimaginable without Huppert, who delivers a performance of such virtuosity that she turns what is essentially a raving sociopath into one of the most alluring protagonists in recent memory."
Sight and Sound," May 23, 2016",Geoff Andrew," With such a poised and meticulously detailed lead performance at its heart, rich in ambiguities and resonant overtones, the film is not only consistently compelling but pleasingly thought-provoking."

Blog de cine," October 20, 2016",Alberto Abuín," A film that has a precise rhythm, a great combination of genres and an extreme moral hardness that doesn't judge anyone. [Full review in Spanish]"
Chicago Reader," October 20, 2016",Leah Pickett," Verhoeven masterfully stretches the suspense, and his gallows humor lands most of the time. His attempts at edginess slide into exploitation, though."
AwardsCircuit.com," October 20, 2016",Clayton Davis," Driven by a tremendous and powerhouse performance from Isabelle Huppert, ""Elle"" electrifies in its slick and throwback call to the '90s thriller."
Den of Geek," October 17, 2016",David Crow," Elle gleefully jumps into its taboos again and again, mistaking deeper levels of incredulous plotting as actual depth."
The Arts Desk," October 14, 2016",Nick Hasted," Funny and tense, it's a film that grows in the mind."
The Skinny," October 14, 2016",Ian Mantagni," A study of victimhood without sentimentality, of iconic strength without forced sass... and of determinedly staking a claim over one's own life against manipulative forces. "
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," October 12, 2016",Josef Braun," This is a difficult, complex, flawed, trigger-laden and ferociously entertaining work with lots to unpack."
Dazed and Confused," October 12, 2016",Patrik Sandberg, The fact that it's the funniest movie I've seen this year is mindblowing.
HeyUGuys," October 11, 2016",Luke Channell," A multi-faceted, endlessly engaging, masterful success."
The List," October 11, 2016",Nikki Baughan," While the film proves a challenging watch it ultimately works because it recognises, and fully embraces, the fact that there is not one stock response to such an assault."

Cinemanía (Spain)," September 28, 2016",Yago García," Elle warns that its director is more brash than ever, and more eager to get into trouble, since the good old days of Basic Instinct and Showgirls, when a gullible Hollywood still had room for morbidness. [Full review in Spanish]"

ComingSoon.net," September 26, 2016",Alan Cerny," Thought-provoking, powerful, and brutal, and those who are uneasy about material dealing with rape should probably steer clear."
Sensacine," September 21, 2016",Carlos Reviriego, An insuperable masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish]
Maclean's Magazine," September 19, 2016",Brian D. Johnson," Isabelle Huppert is devastating as the blasé power broker who cuts her male subordinates off at the knees, while being drawn to the danger of her mysterious assailant. She's the proto-feminist avenger that feminism never asked for."
Slant Magazine," September 19, 2016",Diego Semerene, Paul Verhoeven's film isn't afraid to inhabit the maddening ambivalence of pleasure.
NPR," November 10, 2016",Ella Taylor," A provocateur to his core, Verhoeven wades breezily into hot-potato territory, all the while refusing moral judgment."

TIME Magazine," November 10, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," Part thriller, part obsidian-black comedy, part cerebral firebomb, it's confrontational, terrible and glorious."
Newark Star-Ledger," November 10, 2016",Stephen Whitty," Huppert is brilliant. She's long combined a roiling emotional reservoir with careful technique; feelings play across her delicate, almost translucent face like clouds reflected in a windowpane."
AV Club," November 10, 2016",Ignatiy Vishnevetsky," Elle is a challenging film, but challenging precisely because it's entertaining, because it's laugh-out-loud funny, because it indulges its kinks."
Film Journal International," November 9, 2016",Simi Horwitz," Though fundamentally absurd, with a hodgepodge of genres to boot, Elle is an engaging and thought-provoking film."
New York Observer," November 9, 2016",Rex Reed," It's too twisted and implausible to be everybody's cup of tea, but it keeps you glued to the screen from beginning to end."
Compuserve," November 2, 2016",Harvey S. Karten," A revenge tale, but one done in the sophisticated European style rather than the simpler Hollywood treatment."
Sydney Morning Herald," November 2, 2016",Sandra Hall," In the end, the absurdity of it all is too much even for Huppert to carry off. She may be fearless, but this time around it's fearlessness without a cause."
The Age (Australia)," November 2, 2016",Jake Wilson," Michele Leblanc (Isabelle Huppert), the heroine of Paul Verhoeven's terrific new thriller, Elle, is not a typical movie heroine."
Junkee," November 2, 2016",Mel Campbell," It asks us to consider how our emotional responses to the narrative depiction of sexual violence are themselves conditioned by rape culture. Catlike, Elle lands softly and lightly -- with its intriguing antiheroine firmly on her feet."
The Australian," October 28, 2016",David Stratton," This dark and sometimes grimly amusing film has been compared to the work of Brian de Palma, but to me it seems more like a blending of Hitchcock and Luis Bunuel."
ABC Radio (Australia)," October 28, 2016",CJ Johnson," A mesmerizing, frenzied abomination, a thrilling, propulsively lurid provocation that is simultaneously classy and grotesque, refined and coarse, arthouse and grindhouse. "
Herald Sun (Australia)," October 26, 2016",Leigh Paatsch," This film could easily be written off as a stylishly callous provocation, were it not for the imperious precision with which a brilliant Huppert controls every scene."
Daily Telegraph (Australia)," October 26, 2016",Vicky Roach," Elle is not a particularly deep exploration of rape and its surrounding trauma, power relationships and fantasies. But it does raise some intriguing questions."
EricDSnider.com," October 26, 2016",Eric D. Snider," Audacious and savvy, carried by Huppert's champion performance as a strong, imperious, and vulnerable woman."
FILMINK (Australia)," October 24, 2016",Chris Bright, ...one of the best films of the year...
Urban Cinefile," October 22, 2016",Louise Keller," Dark themes of violence, sex, fantasy and guilt are intertwined in Paul Verhoeven's mesmerising drama about twisted minds and relationships... This is Verhoeven at his best, showcasing Huppert at hers"
SF Weekly," November 17, 2016",Jeffrey Edalatpour," By the end of the film, the camera has come to feel much like a male intruder: unwelcome, unwanted, and better now that the screen has faded to black."
Toronto Star," November 17, 2016",Peter Howell," Equal parts sexploitation drama, social satire and empowerment fantasy, Elle leaves us unsure of what we're watching and how we should respond."
Washington Post," November 17, 2016",Ann Hornaday," ""Elle"" would be too clever by half - not to mention fatally offensive - were it not for Huppert, who in her portrayal of Michèle owns the movie from its opening moments to its bizarre, but not entirely surprising, denouement."
AtHomeInHollywood.com," November 17, 2016",Staci Layne Wilson," Elle feels like a few different movies, but it does present an intriguing question of what consent really means and how past and present experiences shape the mind, body and soul."

Newcity," November 15, 2016",Ray Pride," [A]ssured, savage comedy and it is shocking and thrilling and oh so funny... The reversals, the revelations of character, the implications of behavior, and yes, the level of behavioral authenticity, surprise again and again. "
Tolucan Times," November 14, 2016",Tony Medley," I loved the dialogue and the conversations. There is quite a lot of nudity and many violent scenes, but they were necessary and non-exploitive. This is a thinking person's thriller, a movie to be seen and discussed, not written about."
New Yorker," November 14, 2016",Anthony Lane," The question of whether ""Elle"" is pernicious nonsense or an excruciating black comedy is brushed aside in Huppert's demonstration of sangfroid."
Slate," November 12, 2016",Dana Stevens," For people who enjoy coming out of movies unsettled, a little riled up, bursting with questions, and spoiling for a debate, see Elle."
amNewYork," November 11, 2016",Robert Levin, It consistently defies expectations in terms of how a narrative in this vein typically plays out.
Associated Press," November 11, 2016",Jake Coyle, Few could pull off the unapologetically demented nature of Elle like Verhoeven.

Brooklyn Magazine," November 11, 2016",Emma Myers," At once a perverse psycho-sexual thriller and a venomous comedy of manners, Elle boldly wears its contractions on its sleeve."
FilmDrunk," November 11, 2016",Vincent Mancini," Elle is entertaining enough, and provocative, but it doesn't seem to have much to say beyond ""aren't I naughty?"" "
RogerEbert.com," November 11, 2016",Sheila O'Malley," Watching Elle feels like climbing Mt. Everest without an oxygen tank. The air is dizzyingly clear up there. And dangerous, too."
Nerdist," November 11, 2016",Kristy Puchko," Verhoeven's adaptation of Philippe Djian's novel offers a bleak world where men are petty, bitter, and power-hungry, and ball-busting Michelle is their ultimate foil and fascination."
Rolling Stone," November 11, 2016",Peter Travers, Verhoeven creates a bonfire of a movie that scrutinizes and satirizes the unholy alliance between sex and violence. You can't take your eyes off the fearless Isabelle Huppert.
Contactmusic.com," November 10, 2016",Rich Cline, There's a boldly comical tone to this outrageous thriller that can't help but unnerve audiences right the way through to a chilling climax.
Vanity Fair," November 10, 2016",Jordan Hoffman," I can't exactly call Elle a movie I feel good about liking, but I can't get it out of my head, either."
