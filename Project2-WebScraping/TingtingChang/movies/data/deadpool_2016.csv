Washington City Paper," January 2, 2017",Alan Zilberman," A more rebellious Deadpool would comment on how its climax looks just like every other Marvel climax, but instead there's safety to the tone that veers only from amusing to dull."
MetroActive," December 31, 2016",Richard von Busack," There isn't an aspect of superhero lore that isn't rubbished by the Apatow-meets-Spider-Man comedy Deadpool. By the lights of this decade's movie making, that's a lot of rubbishing."
Salt Lake Tribune," December 30, 2016",Sean P. Means," Things drag in the movie's overly serious middle section, but Reynolds' gift for rapid-fire putdowns adds spice to the frenetic action."

Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," November 14, 2016",Dan Lybarger," Starting with a sarcastic run of opening credits and consistently infused with the title character's vitriolic outbursts, the first solo outing for Marvel's ""Merc with a Mouth"" gets by strictly on attitude."
The Vine," October 7, 2016",David Ross," An entertaining, refreshing action flick with enough genuine laughs to fill out the forgiving 108-minute run time."

Antagony & Ecstasy," July 10, 2016",Tim Brayton, The thing you walk into it expecting it to be is completely and in all ways the thing that it is. This can be taken as both a good thing and a bad thing.

Cinema em Cena," February 6, 2016",Pablo Villaça," Next to Deadpool, Tony Stark is that annoying uncle who loves to tell old knock-knock jokes. [Full review in Portuguese.]"
TheWrap," February 6, 2016",Alonso Duralde," It's a film that's amused with itself, but thanks to a screwball screenplay by Rhett Rheese and Paul Wernick and a charmingly snarky lead turn by Ryan Reynolds, that amusement is both thoroughly earned and completely contagious. "
HitFix," February 6, 2016",Drew McWeeny, I'll just marvel at the fact that Fox finally grew the jooblies to let this film happen.
Slant Magazine," February 6, 2016",Kenji Fujishima, The whiplash contrasts between snideness and sincerity are deeply rooted in the main character's psychology.

Village Voice," February 7, 2016",Alan Scherstuhl," Deadpool benefits from an intimate story with more heart than you would expect, but also a go-for-broke zeal, edging at times into Naked Gun-style parody."

FromTheBalcony," February 7, 2016",Bill Clark," Profane, hyper-violent, and never hesitant to take things a step or two beyond overkill, Deadpool is just the swift kick to the junk the genre needs."
Empire Magazine," February 7, 2016",Jonathan Pile," A fun, if patchy, alternative to the glut of 'the world is about to end unless we do something' comic-book films."

Hollywood Reporter," February 7, 2016",Todd McCarthy," A really raunchy, very dirty and pretty funny goof on the entire superhero ethos, as well as the first Marvel film to irreverently trash the brand."
Nerdist," February 6, 2016",Luke Y. Thompson," Ryan Reynolds, who played a misbegotten faux-Deadpool in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and has nobly spent the subsequent six years trying to atone by doing it right, may finally have found his defining role"
Daily Star," February 6, 2016",Andy Lea," Anarchic, outrageous and filthily funny, this tongue-in-cheek X-Men movie tears up the superhero rulebook from within. "

Screen International," February 6, 2016",Tim Grierson," In its foul-mouthed, aggressively violent way, ""Deadpool"" proves to be nasty fun, casting a snotty Ryan Reynolds as a vengeance-seeking jerk who may have mutant powers but never acquired the stoicism or valor of the X-Men. "
Urban Cinefile," February 6, 2016",Andrew L. Urban," It may not be original, but what the film lacks in freshness it makes up in cinematic bravura, from 'breaking the fourth wall' (talking to the audience) to self referential nonsense amidst violent mayhem"
Examiner.com," February 9, 2016",Chris Sawin," Deadpool is the bloodiest, darkest, most violent, and most hysterical comic book film to ever be released. Vulgarity hasn't been utilized this proficiently since the South Park film was released in theaters nearly two decades ago."
RedEye," February 9, 2016",Matt Pais, As funny and charming as tearing a toenail.

Movie Guys with Jeff & Dave," February 8, 2016",Jeffrey K. Howard," Deadpool is over-the-top funny, very bloody, violent and the best Marvel movie that's made for adults ! Not bad for an anti-hero that wears a mask, swings ninja swords and cannot die. "

CraveOnline," February 8, 2016",William Bibbiani," In many respects it's the best X-Men movie yet, because it seems to care less about 'world building' and 'big ideas' than about a single interesting character with a unique voice, joking his way through a satisfying, albeit conventional story."
Film Journal International," February 8, 2016",Ethan Alter," Early on, Deadpool teases audiences that it's going to lead a comedy-laced comic-book movie revolution, but it ends up joining the superhero establishment."
Lyles' Movie Files," February 8, 2016",Jeffrey Lyles, You'd be hard-pressed to find a comic book film so faithful to the tone of its source material and absolutely nailing it. Cue Deadpool winking at the double entendre.
Metro," February 8, 2016",Matt Prigge," A Marvel movie for those who think they're sick of Marvel movies but aren't really, it's as epically pleased with itself as Ryan Reynolds' lead performance. "

FILMINK (Australia)," February 7, 2016",Anthony O'Connor," ""Deadpool fans will be gratified to see their meta merc smirking, stabbing and snarking his way through his foes, stopping long enough to make a bunch of dick jokes, before it's back to the action."""

Under the Radar," February 10, 2016",Stephen Danay, Deadpool is arguably the most faithful and entertaining cinematic interpretation of the character that fans are likely to see.
Tribune News Service," February 10, 2016",Katie Walsh," ""Deadpool"" might feel innovative, but the story itself is standard-issue."
Consequence of Sound," February 10, 2016",Dominick Mayer," Deadpool is very good at what it sets out to do some of the time, and it's going to do exceedingly well because of this."
Times-Picayune," February 10, 2016",Mike Scott," Profane, violent and deliciously depraved, it's one of the most start-to-finish enjoyable comic-book movie this side of 2008's original Iron Man."
RogerEbert.com," February 10, 2016",Brian Tallerico," ""Deadpool"" fails to live up to the potential of its beloved source material, subverting its own agenda by becoming a remarkably generic, by-the-numbers man-in-tights flick."
Groucho Reviews," February 10, 2016",Peter Canavese," May not be wildly fresh, but it does wriggle against its genre straightjacket, and if it doesn't quite escape, it puts on a great show in the process."
Irish Times," February 10, 2016",Donald Clarke, Deadpool plays like a dim 15-year-old's impression of what a grown-up superhero film might look like.
Chicago Tribune," February 10, 2016",Michael Phillips, Reynolds is entertaining; it's rather sweet to see this eternally not-quite-a-star get closer than usual to justifying star billing.
New York Daily News," February 10, 2016",Ethan Sacks," The politically incorrect material suits Ryan Reynolds as snugly as Marvel's tight red costume, giving the Canadian actor a chance to work out his mutant power for hurling snarky one-liners."
The Skinny," February 10, 2016",Josh Slater-Williams," Reynolds' giddiness at playing this insane, virtually indestructible mercenary has an infectious quality about it, and helps the gags that do hit to soar."
Sci-Fi Movie Page," February 9, 2016",Rob Vaux," If it doesn't grab you with the opening credits, you're in the wrong movie. "
USA Today," February 9, 2016",Brian Truitt," Deadpool avoids enough pitfalls to both embrace and flambé the superhero genre while also finding time for romance, doling out equal handfuls of bullets, barbs and warm fuzzies."
The Daily Beast," February 9, 2016",Jen Yamato," Deadpool is at once a welcome antidote to the played out superhero universe and an anomaly, destined to be trapped in its spandexed outliers. "
Forbes," February 9, 2016",Mark Hughes," Deadpool is like Die Hard with Bruce Willis' character David Addison from his TV series Moonlighting, if he wore a mask & cursed more... It's silly, swaggering, & obscene, but I mean all of those words in the best possible way."
Flick Filosopher," February 9, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson," Callous, crass, unpleasantly smug. Supposes it's being edgy because its protagonist swears a lot, but it's like a child saying bad words just to be naughty."
Little White Lies," February 9, 2016",Adam Woodward," If Deadpool is the ultimate anti-hero, then this is the ultimate anti-movie."
The List," February 9, 2016",Emma Simmonds," It extends its middle finger to the concept of suspension of disbelief with repeated fourth wall breaks, while the references come thick, fast and proudly unsubtle."
TIME Magazine," February 11, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," Deadpool, intended as a spiky antidote to superhero oversaturation, ends up impaling only itself."
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," February 11, 2016",Cary Darling," Deadpool succeeds where other irreverent send-ups of the genre failed... [But] the over-the-top mayhem, do-you-kiss-your-mother-with-that-mouth trash talk, and jokey cynicism can't stop [it] from hurtling toward predictability."
Blu-ray.com," February 11, 2016",Brian Orndorf," ""Deadpool"" made not be known to a wider audience, and he's certainly not a courageous figure, but his debut is one of the better ones in the Marvel universe, adding some needed filth to the superhero routine."
Seattle Times," February 11, 2016",Soren Anderson," Maximally cheeky. Perversely potty-mouthed. Riotously funny. Insanely violent. Uneven as all get out. And fun, fun, fun."
Arizona Republic," February 11, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," It takes a strong stomach for extreme violence and over-the-top obscenity, but if you're willing to roll with that, ""Deadpool"" is a hoot."
Las Vegas Weekly," February 11, 2016",Josh Bell," The story is nothing special, but Reynolds and Miller make it fun by sheer force of their enthusiasm for the material. "
The Standard," February 11, 2016",Matt Neal, A wonderfully puerile claret-soaked swear-fest (and) hands down the funniest superhero movie ever.
Junkee," February 10, 2016",Mel Campbell," Given how feebly some superhero films struggle under their own weight, Deadpool is impressively nimble. And it pulls off its relentless self-reference with a confidence that's solidly entertaining, even if it isn't always endearing."

Sydney Morning Herald," February 10, 2016",Paul Byrnes," DP is a lot more fun than most superheroes, but the film is barely able to take advantage."
NOW Toronto," February 10, 2016",Norman Wilner," Mostly Reynolds is really funny, joyfully debasing himself and putting everything he has into making this the giddiest, most enjoyable Deadpool movie imaginable."
Playboy Online," February 10, 2016",Stephen Rebello," [Deadpool] is filthy, degenerate and seriously pervy, and Reynolds -- decked out in red and black spandex, sporting two katanas and white canvas where eyes should be -- is every bit as flip, funny, nasty and self-deprecating as you'd want."
Associated Press," February 10, 2016",Lindsey Bahr," In the end, it's hard to shake the feeling that they've made a movie for boys that only adults are allowed to see. For the future sleepover party where some open-minded parent allows a screening, it'll surely be a blast."
Tulsa World," February 10, 2016",Michael Smith," Deadpool has arrived, and the comic-book movie will never be the same. That's a good thing. Sameness is just one element of the genre that this exceptionally bonkers, hyper-violent, hilarious film pokes a hole in."
NUVO Newsweekly," February 10, 2016",Edward Johnson-Ott, Deadpool is funny -- frequently hilarious.
Vox," February 10, 2016",Alex Abad-Santos, Deadpool is essentially the world's first superhero fan movie.

Ex-Press.com," February 10, 2016",Katherine Monk," The plot is tragically tedious and predictable... But the denouement is a complete delight thanks to Reynolds, who acrobatically defies the gravitas of Superman while letting his natural charm ooze through the suit."
IGN Movies," February 10, 2016",Daniel Krupa," Weak villains and an unsatisfying revenge plot ultimately hold it back from being something more distinctive, but Deadpool delivers a large dose of unwholesome fun."
Thrillist," February 10, 2016",Matt Patches, [Reynolds] brings a ton of compassion and manic energy ... [but Deadpool] is a cartoon in the real world that never goes crazy enough.
AllMovie," February 11, 2016",Violet LeVoit, A too-cool thrill ride filled with all of the saturated fats of shameless '80s trash . . . as satisfying as a bacon double cheeseburger with a side of crack. 
Boston Globe," February 11, 2016",Tom Russo," Imagine Spider-Man with legitimately funny quips, waaay less angst, and a bug-eyed getup that's lethally accessorized."
Austin Chronicle," February 11, 2016",Marjorie Baumgarten," The film is as postmodernly self-referential as it can get, which should be a hoot for the average viewer and nirvana for connoisseurs of the Marvel Universe."
Chicago Reader," February 11, 2016",Leah Pickett," Fans of X-Men will gobble it up, especially lewd teenage boys; newcomers to the Marvel Universe may miss some of the best zingers. "
New York Times," February 11, 2016",Manohla Dargis," The filmmakers do a lot of winking and rib poking; they sell ""Deadpool"" so hard that you might wonder if Marvel has started to pay on commission."
Kansas City Star," February 11, 2016",Jon Niccum, (Reynolds) delivers a perfect combination of kick-ass and smart-ass.
Fort Worth Weekly," February 11, 2016",Kristian M. Lin, The dirtiness that Deadpool injects into the squeaky-clean Marvel universe makes it into an energizing and eminently quotable blast.

Showbiz Junkies," February 11, 2016",Rebecca Murray," Director Tim Miller and star Ryan Reynolds embrace this flawed hero, delivering an irreverent - and graphic - comedy that ranks as one of the best Marvel films to date."
One Guy's Opinion," February 11, 2016",Frank Swietek, An exercise in following established formula while pretending to subvert it by slyly pointing out its absurdities and adding all sorts of nasty pop culture references and profane asides to the mix.
Parade Magazine," February 11, 2016",Neil Pond," Just what a lot of fans have been waiting for---especially if they've been waiting for a superhero who swears, farts, babbles, jokes, listens to Wham!, loves unicorns and enjoys rough sex."
St. Louis Post-Dispatch," February 11, 2016",Calvin Wilson," Smart, sexy and outrageous, ""Deadpool"" delivers."
Radio Times," February 11, 2016",Stella Papamichael," Deadpool is certainly rough around the edges, but that's his - and the film's - charm."
San Diego Reader," February 11, 2016",Matthew Lickona, An anti-superhero movie (or maybe a super-antihero movie) that might have worked if it had the courage of its lack of convictions.
Charlotte Observer," February 11, 2016",Lawrence Toppman," ""Deadpool"" gives the superhero genre a kick in its pearly white teeth - and, for good measure, every other square inch of its pumped-up body."
Dallas Morning News," February 11, 2016",Britton Peele," Calling Deadpool ""just another comic book movie"" would do injustice to a film that makes a strong effort to deliver something different."
Washington Post," February 11, 2016",Michael O'Sullivan," It's a voraciously self-aware comedy, one that dines out on the inherent inanity of its own premise as much as it does the movies it's competing with."
San Francisco Chronicle," February 11, 2016",Mick LaSalle," This is bad, borderline garbage, but disturbing, too, in that it's just the kind of fake-clever awfulness that might be cinema's future."
The Sun (UK)," February 11, 2016",Alex Zane," Ryan Reynolds hasn't had the best luck with superhero cinema. So I'm happy to report that Deadpool is an insane, anarchic riot of a movie."
Indie London," February 11, 2016",Rob Carnevale," It's a guilty pleasure of a superhero movie that feels as naughty and as reckless as its central character intends. In that regard, it's mission more than accomplished."
Independent (UK)," February 11, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab," For all the creakiness of its plotting, this is a Marvel adaptation mercifully shorn of bombast. There is far more bite in its humour than in last year's Ant-Man. Reynolds plays the lead role in an enjoyably freewheeling fashion."
Los Angeles Times," February 11, 2016",Kenneth Turan," You're initially jazzed by his effrontery, but Deadpool, with his relentlessly glib, nothing-sacred attitude, is not an individual who wears particularly well."
SciFiNow," February 11, 2016",Poppy-Jay Palmer," Most importantly of all, the film is bloody hilarious."
Starburst," February 11, 2016",Iain McNally, The movie delivers... in bloody spades.
Times (UK)," February 11, 2016",Kevin Maher, Deadpool was supposed to be a satirical masterpiece that pilloried the absurdities of the comic-book movie universe. It's not.
Flicks.co.nz," February 11, 2016",Tony Stamp," Going all-in on its outrageous content means Deadpool does stand out from the horde of superhero movies, mostly for its potty mouth..."
Rolling Stone," February 11, 2016",Peter Travers," this movie's junky feel is part of its charm. Sure it goes on too long and repetition dulls its initial cleverness. Still, Deadpool is party time for action junkies and Reynolds may just have found the role that makes his career. "
New York Magazine/Vulture," February 11, 2016",David Edelstein," It's not subversive - it's meant to elasticize and enhance the superhero genre, to flatter the audience for being hip enough to get all of those in-jokes. And I was flattered."
TheShiznit.co.uk," February 11, 2016",Ali Gray," Deadpool is the 'edgy' stand-up hired to play the corporate gig: make the company laugh, but don't make the company mad. "
NPR," February 11, 2016",Bob Mondello, Deadpool ... has the singular virtue of being funnier than we've been led to believe a superhero film can be.
New York Post," February 11, 2016",Kyle Smith," There aren't many superhero movies that exploit the liberating effects of the hard-R rating. But to me, the mock opening credits are the only detail that is fresh - sophomoric, but fresh."

Philadelphia Inquirer," February 11, 2016",Tirdad Derakhshani," Deadpool is, on the whole, a big bowl of fun filled with great stunts, gory fight scenes, and sexy poses."
Fresno Bee," February 11, 2016",Rick Bentley," If you are willing to accept a superpowered character who spits at superhero conventions, then Deadpool is a (expletive deleted) good time."
Reeling Reviews," February 11, 2016",Laura Clifford," This R-rated, pop culture riffing, wisecracking subversive antihero is a hell of a lot of fun to hang out with, which is a good thing because the jokes fly so fast and furiously you'll probably have to watch ""Deadpool"" multiple times to catch them all."
Film Racket," February 11, 2016",Bill Gibron, The winter movie doldrums finally got their wake-up call - and it's a crank. 
The Young Folks," February 12, 2016",Evan Griffin, My mom loved it.
Screen It!," February 12, 2016",Jim Judy," ""Deadpool"" surprised me a lot by how much irreverent fun it actually is. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)"
Houston Press," February 12, 2016",Pete Vonder Haar, It's a welcome palate cleanser in a world where comic book flicks are increasingly ponderous and repetitive (see: the latest Batman v Superman: Rise of the Chins trailer). 
ABC Tucson," February 12, 2016",Phil Villarreal," If ever an actor was born to play a motormouthed, juvenile masked creep, it was Ryan Reynolds to play Deadpool."
HollywoodInToto.com," February 12, 2016",Christian Toto, Deadpool delivers on its gleefully profane promise within the first five seconds of the film.
The Federalist," February 12, 2016",Rebecca Cusey," ""Deadpool"" is not so much a movie as an extended inside joke with a movie wrapped around it, plus an abject apology for Green Lantern. "
Reason Online," February 12, 2016",Kurt Loder," Dizzyingly scabrous, borderline offensive (alright!) and wonderfully refreshing. "
Fat Guys at the Movies," February 12, 2016",Kevin Carr, kudos to Fox for having the stones to give this one the full inappropriate R-rated treatment.
WaffleMovies.com," February 12, 2016",Willie Waffle," Right from the opening credits, the audience realizes they are in for something a bit twisted and lacking any reverence (and that's a good thing)."
Globe and Mail," February 12, 2016",Barry Hertz," Deadpool is everything that Hollywood has raised audiences to believe heroes are not: crass, selfish and with a vocabulary that would have made George Carlin blush."
Detroit News," February 12, 2016",Adam Graham," Reynolds has never meshed as well with a character or found a better outlet for his smirking, smart aleck persona."
San Diego Union-Tribune," February 12, 2016",Anders Wright," It's bloody good fun, kicking off with a tremendous opening-credits sequence and a terrifically entertaining action set piece. Reynolds is wonderfully fun. He's a chiseled movie star, to be sure, but he's always best when he can goof on the part."
The Mercury," February 11, 2016",Tim Martain," He swears like a sailor, he fills every conversation with sexual innuendo and generally behaves like a hyperactive teenager. But utterly oozing with charisma."
"Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)"," February 11, 2016",Bob Bloom," Much more so than Marvel's ""Guardian of the Galaxy,"" ""Deadpool"" is a film propelled by swagger, humor and action."
New England Movies Weekly," February 11, 2016",Daniel M. Kimmel," Much of the success in bringing it off is due to Ryan Reynolds, whose film career often seen him trapped in roles that didn't make good use of his talents..."
ReelViews," February 11, 2016",James Berardinelli," This is a different kind of movie. The only rule it adheres to is that tropes are made to be eviscerated, turned on their heads, and trampled over."
Daily Mail (UK)," February 11, 2016",Brian Viner," Behind all the glibness, all the gore, Deadpool is actually a rather poignant romance. I quite liked it, although it's not nearly as funny as its debutant director Tim Miller seems to think it is."
The Verge," February 11, 2016",Tasha Robinson," Deadpool's relentless pace is refreshing, and so is the sense that viewers will be able to keep up."
indieWire," February 11, 2016",Kate Erbland," In a landscape where superhero roles are too often seen as paycheck parts, Reynolds breaks the mold. Too bad his film doesn't."
Sky Movies," February 11, 2016",Tim Evans," A welcome acid corrective to the machine-tooled, marketing-driven product lapped up by the multiplex masses."
Butaca Ancha," February 12, 2016",Erick Ortiz," It's still a superhero movie that has the 'hero' protagonist, the big baddie and lots of romance. But it also goes surprisingly beyond the usual tropes of action. [Full review in Spanish]"
Salt Lake City Weekly," February 12, 2016",Scott Renshaw," This one's got attitude. If only it weren't quite so self-satisfied with that attitude. And not entirely justified in it, either."
BuzzFeed News," February 12, 2016",Alison Willmore," It's fun for a while, and then it all becomes deeply disheartening, because calling attention to the more businesslike mechanics of superheroics isn't subversive when you're also playing right into them."
Paste Magazine," February 12, 2016",Brogan Morris," If it were a regular R-rated comedy, Deadpool's ""taboo"" ingredients wouldn't be considered boundary-breaking at all. But in a superhero movie, this stuff feels revolutionary."
National Post," February 12, 2016",David Berry," Watching Deadpool feels a bit like downing a shot of something stiff, while simultaneously having the same again thrown in your face. It's bracing, and if you're not ready for it, it can rock you back on your heels."
Christian Science Monitor," February 12, 2016",Peter Rainer, It seems less irreverent than self-congratulatory.
Daily Record (UK)," February 12, 2016",Garry McConnachie," Thankfully, amid the sweaty mayhem there's a particularly sweet love story. Baccarin takes the role of Vanessa and clearly has a ball early doors as she matches Reynolds stride for stride."
BBC.com," February 12, 2016",Owen Gleiberman," Deadpool hooks you into Wade's trauma, but mostly it's content to skate along on the cheekiness of his death-sport attitude. The film's airy cynicism says: he's not the hero we dream of, he's just the one we deserve."
ScreenRant," February 12, 2016",Ben Kendrick," Deadpool, much like its source material, is an irreverent, bloody, and riotous twist on the superhero genre - a must-see comic book movie experience."
Las Vegas Review-Journal," February 12, 2016",Christopher Lawrence," Deadpool may not be the superhero movie we deserve. But, after an onslaught of increasingly formulaic big-screen adventures with ever-escalating stakes, it just might be the superhero movie we need."
Cambridge Day," February 12, 2016",Tom Meek," It's a tangy olio that lacks substance and consistency, and despite that, its in-your-face moxie comes at you in all the right ways, gripping you by the gunny sack with a big glorious joker smile and never letting go."
NY1-TV," February 12, 2016",Neil Rosen," There are dozens of entertaining pop culture references, and even the opening credits have a self-mocking tone. It starts off flat, but then, about 20 minutes in, takes off. The end result is surprising and a lot of fun."
Toledo Blade," February 12, 2016",Kirk Baird," While the ""Merc with a Mouth"" is a novel and undeniably funny superhero film, like a relentless case of the runs, Deadpool's torrent of inappropriate/​smart-aleck jokes and pop culture references can be exhausting."
The Australian," February 12, 2016",Stephen Romei, By the end of Deadpool I was left with the feeling that it probably was more fun to make than it is to watch.
Tri-City Herald," February 12, 2016",Gary Wolcott, Deadpool had me laughing from the clever opening credits to Ryan Reynolds' just as clever credit roll outtake. This is what Spider-man's two franchises should have been.

The Newnan Times-Herald," February 12, 2016",Jonathan W. Hickman," Sharing more in common with ""Kick-Ass 2"" than ""Kick-Ass,"" the long gestating ""Deadpool"" comic adaptation pulls no punches. "
Crikey," February 13, 2016",Luke Buckmaster, The casting of a hunk to play the hero and a hunk to play the villain is indicative of a film that wants to appear to take risks while not really taking any at all.
Creative Loafing," February 13, 2016",Matt Brunson," A superhero romp that threatened to be smug, smarmy and self-satisfied is -- well, yes, it's occasionally all those things. But it's also fresh, funny and absolutely kick-ass."
Suburban Journals of St. Louis," February 13, 2016",Mathew DeKinder," Smart-aleck, teenage boys now have their ""Citizen Kane."""
SSG Syndicate," February 13, 2016",Susan Granger," Scornful, satirical and surprislingly snarky - with two, teasing post-credit sequences."
Movie Talk," February 13, 2016",Jason Best," Bursting at the seams with dick jokes, boob shots and larky splatter, Deadpool is simultaneously the most 'adult' Marvel movie to date and the most supremely juvenile."
Cinemalogue.com," February 12, 2016",Todd Jorgenson," For a film obviously positioned as a franchise starter, its sardonic antihero takes a new path during his origin story, and his big-screen debut stands capably on its own."

The New Republic," February 12, 2016",Will Leitch, Deadpool is obnoxious and puerile and infantile and has an irritating meta tone so snide that it's constantly in danger of nullifying the entire movie -- and I still got a pretty big kick out of it.
Q Network Film Desk," February 16, 2016",James Kendrick," However much the raunchy humor and postmodern genre disemboweling works, what I appreciated most about Deadpool is that the stakes were decidedly personal-intimate, even."

Scotsman," February 14, 2016",Alistair Harkness," The film's emphasis on deconstruction rather than destruction does mean that everything - from the action to the character beats - operates on a smaller scale. In an age of boring spectacle, that seems more radical than anything else."
