Cinemaphile.org," February 3, 2017",David Keyes," The story is an echo of that ever-so-familiar journey in which young heroines become restless with the grind of their routines and wander beyond the borders of their world, usually against the wishes of strict parental figures."

Cinema Sight," December 31, 2016",Wesley Lovell," A song score that's far weaker than the great animated musicals of the 1990s, this Disney princess film has all the charm one would expect from the Mouse House, without the feeling of urgency."

The Mary Sue," December 30, 2016",Teresa Jusino, I'd highly recommend taking the whole family to see Moana this weekend. It's exactly the kind of Disney movie we should be encouraging.
The Standard," December 29, 2016",Matt Neal, Moana ticks all the boxes required to make a great modern Disney princess movie and does so without ever feeling like it's a Disney princess movie.
"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," December 27, 2016",John Beifuss," Although the film lacks a swoony love story, its Freudian implications aren't particularly feminist, as Moana works to elevate the demigod's ego, diminished by the unreliablility of his damaged magical fishhook..."

SciFiNow," November 17, 2016",Poppy-Jay Palmer," It's a basic Point-A-to-Point-B adventure film, but with so much life, energy and emotion. It's perfectly cast, and the animation -- particularly the parts with the ocean in them, which is almost all of it -- is jaw dropping."
Movie Nation," November 17, 2016",Roger Moore, Pixar who?

The Film Stage," November 15, 2016",Dan Schindel, It feels less like a truly Polynesian story than it does a generic Disney story slotted into a new setting.

Guardian," November 7, 2016",Steve Rose," Its cultural setting is fresh; its storytelling, less so. It navigates the reefs but it doesn't discover a whole new world."
Entertainment Weekly," November 7, 2016",Devan Coggan," Moana has a lot of the hallmarks of your classic Disney adventure - the goofy animal sidekicks, the feel-good messages - but its heroine is something new, a smart and fiery deviation from your standard European lovestruck princesses."
Variety," November 7, 2016",Peter Debruge," ""Moana"" keeps with the tradition that made Disney the leader in animated fairy and folk tales, and yet, showing a thoroughly modern touch, it's the first to do so without so much as suggesting a love interest."
TheWrap," November 7, 2016",Alonso Duralde," Much to its credit, the screenplay makes Moana an interesting, self-actualized character. She's not waiting around for a prince, and there's no question that her gender will stand in the way of inheriting the title of chief."

Seattle Times," November 21, 2016",Soren Anderson, Moana is a joy.
Chicago Sun-Times," November 21, 2016",Richard Roeper," Temuera Morrison and Nicole Scherzinger are terrific voicing Moana's loving parents. Dwayne Johnson shines as Maui.

Slate," November 21, 2016",Dan Kois," If its heroine, despite her spunkiness, is a little milquetoasty, at least she doesn't pine for a guy-though how dumb is it that in 2016 we still have to compliment a kids' movie for that?"

Village Voice," November 18, 2016",Bilge Ebiri," It's funny, joyful, and sweet, and yet down below, running beneath everything, is a sad counter-narrative about how the world always throws obstacles in your way, and how you could just turn your back and retreat."
We Got This Covered," November 18, 2016",Matt Donato, Moana beats the drum of female empowerment for so many young girls who deserve it now more than ever.
RedEye," November 18, 2016",Shelbie Lynn Bostedt, I'll be real with you. It made me cry twice. Go see it.
Blu-ray.com," November 18, 2016",Brian Orndorf," Pure eye candy, but there's a journey here that holds attention, offering cultural flair, lively characterizations, and a charming way with myth and family. It's a charmer."
Nerdist," November 17, 2016",Michael Arbeiter," No, these things don't all blend together well, but if you can follow Moana's island society's lead and just roll with it, you'll enjoy them one by one."
Chicago Tribune," November 22, 2016",Michael Phillips," The film is bright, busy, enjoyable, progressive without being insufferable."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," November 22, 2016",Colin Covert," ""Moana"" is a case of inspired visual and musical forms packaging wishy-washy substance. It's good generic comfort food, never cringeworthy, merely routine."
Tribune News Service," November 22, 2016",Katie Walsh," The film is richer for its attention to heritage, going far beyond surface aesthetics, building the foundation of ""Moana"" on the values and beliefs that make up this culture."
Consequence of Sound," November 22, 2016",Dominick Mayer," It's a traditional kind of Disney movie, a crowd pleaser with a few earworms on its soundtrack and an endearing pair of mismatched leads on an impeccably animated adventure."
New York Post," November 22, 2016",Sara Stewart, It's so transporting it will have your kids begging you to book the next flight to the islands.

Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," November 22, 2016",Maricar Estrella," Moana pays homage to Pacific Islanders by introducing us to a strong female character unlike any we've seen in mainstream films - a hero who is both smart and sympathetic, strong and compassionate, independent yet belongs to a group.

Reeling Reviews," November 22, 2016",Laura Clifford," a movie that follows the Disney playbook, for sure, but does it so well, even winking at it, that it is transcendentally delightful from start to finish...the best Disney animation to come down the pike since 2011's undervalued ""Winnie the Pooh."""
Slant Magazine," November 22, 2016",Jake Cole," Compared to your average Disney princesses, Moana is neither selfishly rebellious nor simplistically innocent. "

Flick Filosopher," November 22, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson," A wonderful mythology of demons and demigods. A heroine who embodies the bold spirit of her people. Another sweet, funny, exciting triumph from Disney."
Eye for Film," November 22, 2016",Anton Bitel," That is Moana in a nutshell (or at least in a sea conch): smart about what it does, and easy on the eye, but at base the very Disney princess movie that it half-heartedly resists being - until, at least, its full heart is restored."

Charlotte Observer," November 22, 2016",Lawrence Toppman," Cravalho shows spunk and a generically lovely voice, though she's saddled with assembly-line anthems Disney has done better elsewhere. Johnson has exuberance, deft timing and a passable singing voice."

Vanity Fair," November 22, 2016",Richard Lawson," Moana will be a big, happy hit, and I'll forever want to live in its glorious and vibrant environs. But hard as she may paddle, Moana can't quite get past the cluttered reef of merch and other branded interests that keeps her film penned in."

San Diego Reader," December 1, 2016",Matthew Lickona," This is Disney's way of having its formulaic cake and eating it, too: ""We know what we're doing here, and we know that you know it, too. So please stop fretting and enjoy while the pieces fall into place."""
Sight and Sound," December 1, 2016",Vadim Rizov," No matter who wrote the songs, there was always going to be a line about listening to your 'inner voice' - it's pretty much Disney company policy."
Chicago Reader," December 1, 2016",Leah Pickett," The narrative is a fairly predictable hero's journey -- Maui even calls her ""The Chosen One"" -- but the movie is refreshing for its lack of a love interest; instead Moana learns how to chart her own course."
Financial Times," December 1, 2016",Nigel Andrews," There could be umpteen charges of kitsch, political incorrectness and mongrelised cultural history. Yet this South Seas hurricane of a film blows us away, scattering our faculties and effects and substituting its own."
Total Film," December 1, 2016",Kate Stables," Despite Dwayne Johnson's solid scene-stealing, the wave-taming Moana gets a true hero's journey in this South Seas stunner."
Paste Magazine," November 30, 2016",Andy Crump," Ultimately, it's this blend of character and quest -- infused throughout with an overriding warmth -- that makes Moana impossible to resist. "
Sensacine," November 30, 2016",Xavi S√°nchez Pons," Although it lacks a little humor, this film has a young Polynesian who's courageously seeking her place in the world instead of a prince charming, . [Full review in Spanish]"
The National (UAE)," November 30, 2016",Chris Newbould," The story is familiar, but the impressive animation and music should ensure that even the most jaded of viewers goes home with smiles on their faces."
RT√â (Ireland)," November 30, 2016",Harry Guerin, Don't be surprised if you're singing -- badly -- all the way home.
Cineman√≠a (Spain)," November 30, 2016",David Bernal," Moana's animation and soundtrack are masterful, the best that the studio have done in two decades. [Full review in Spanish]"
San Francisco Examiner," November 30, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," ""Moana"" sails straight and true, effortlessly, and with a great deal of joy and delight. It's perhaps not as clever or funny as this year's earlier Disney offering, ""Zootopia,"" but it's wonderful in its own island way."
Independent (UK)," November 30, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab," What impresses most here is the way the filmmakers combine the traditional Disney elements -- the sentimentality, the slapstick and the iridescent animation -- with a storyline rooted in South Sea island myth and culture."
Tampa Bay Times," November 30, 2016",Steve Persall," We can now agree that Johnson is not only the Sexiest Man Alive but also our strongest, lifting Moana on his character's beefy shoulders, carrying it like other hits before. No movie left behind."
Tulsa World," November 29, 2016",Michael Smith," If you don't walk out of Moana feeling a little better about the world in general, check your pulse. You might be dead inside."
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," November 29, 2016",Dan Lybarger," Maui isn't the only visual delight in Moana, but he's easily the standout. The lush 3-D depictions of the South Pacific actually make wearing the glasses and shelling out a few extra bucks worthwhile."
El Pais (Spain)," December 5, 2016",Jordi Costa, A film that reformulated the classic mythology of Disney princesses in stories of emancipation and female self-assertion. [Full review in Spanish]
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," December 5, 2016",Aine O'Connor," The literal and metaphorical journey is predictable but fun, funny and beautiful. It's got a lovely score and a great tone, ye parents of wee daughters might finally be able to let Frozen go."
Irish Independent," December 4, 2016",Paul Whitington," Dwayne Johnson does a wonderful job of voicing the conceited Maui, and if the storyline is not entirely satisfying, I could watch those gently undulating animated oceans forever."
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 4, 2016",Tim Brayton," It's no masterpiece, but it's all extremely pleasant, and in Moana herself, the film boasts Disney's most interesting and complex protagonist in several years."
London Evening Standard," December 4, 2016",Charlotte O'Sullivan," In the next election, can I just vote Disney?"
Daily Express (UK)," December 4, 2016",Henry Fitzherbert, A gloriously exuberant and colourful adventure set in Polynesia which is both pleasingly traditional (there are songs and a plucky heroine!) and wittily modern (no handsome prince required).
Daily Mail (UK)," December 4, 2016",Brian Viner," There is much to relish in this animated Disney film, but I appreciated it as much for what it lacks as for what it contains."
Observer (UK)," December 4, 2016",Mark Kermode," Directors Ron Clements and John Musker here segue seamlessly into their first CG feature, embracing the malleable magic of digital animation while retaining the clear lines that underpinned their previous work."
Flavorwire," December 3, 2016",Jason Bailey," It's a treat, for family audiences and musical theater geeks alike."
Maven's Nest," December 3, 2016",Nora Lee Mandel," Mines proto-Polynesian Oceania culture's carefully researched legends, myths and traditions to joyfully bring us a feisty new Hollywood teenage rebel princess."
MediaMikes," December 2, 2016",Michael A. Smith," Both brilliant and breathtaking, ""Moana"" is sure to be the next Disney classic. The characters are beautifully established and the actors behind them are pitch perfect."
Contactmusic.com," December 2, 2016",Rich Cline," We never doubt for a second that Moana and Maui will complete their mission, but at least the story and animation have some lovely surprises in store along the way, especially in the spectacular climactic encounter."
Laramie Movie Scope," December 2, 2016",Robert Roten," This is a very solid Disney feature, that looks good in 3D, featuring excellent voice talents. The songs are O.K., but not up there with the Disney classics. This is a good, but not great Disney animated feature."
Times (UK)," December 2, 2016",Kate Muir," In Disney's latest refreshing take on the princess genre, Moana is a feisty, sea-voyaging chieftain's daughter without any pink satin in sight."
Indie London," December 2, 2016",Rob Carnevale," Visually stunning but narratively basic, Disney's Moana is nevertheless a highly enjoyable family movie that doesn't suffer too much from adhering to formula."
Cine Premiere," December 2, 2016",Carlos Del R√≠o," Moana offers something for every viewer, regardless of age. Adventure, humor, music and, of course, messages about identity, maturity, generational transition or the environment. [Full review in Spanish]"
Blog de cine," December 2, 2016",Mikel Zorrilla, Disney's new animated gem and a reminder that possibly the company is currently going through the best years of its history. [Full review in Spanish]

Sky Movies," December 1, 2016",Tim Evans, A nautical yarn that leaves lesser children's fare all at sea.
The Sun (UK)," December 1, 2016",Jamie East," Truly wonderful stuff. If you don't enjoy this, I'd check your pulse as your heart must be missing."

Reel Film Reviews," December 22, 2016",David Nusair, ...one of Disney's least entertaining efforts in years...
News.com.au," December 22, 2016",Wenlei Ma," Perhaps the most encouraging part of Moana's feminism is its subtlety. It presents female agency as nothing out of the ordinary - it doesn't comment on it, there is no patriarchy she's fighting back against and there's no love story. "
CineVue," December 20, 2016",Ben Nicholson," Moana is a toe-tapping, heart-stealing adventure packed with laughs and featuring a kick-ass princess with nary a love interest on the horizon."
Sunday Times (UK)," December 17, 2016",Camilla Long," A gentle, sun-soaked mythological Disney romp around the volcanic islands of Polynesia."

The Young Folks," December 12, 2016",Mae Abdulbaki, ... Moana is visually beautiful and narratively engaging.
Urban Cinefile," December 10, 2016",Andrew L. Urban," We are so spoilt by the amazing achievements of animation we hardly notice when something special comes along, unless we look out for it. Moana makes us look"
Starburst," December 9, 2016",Jack Bottomley, Moana is a gorgeous offering by Disney that uses the magnificence of our planet to tell a simple but effective girl meets demigod sea-set story.
Cine V√©rtigo," December 8, 2016",Ernesto Diezmartinez," A film that is far from being a disaster but at this point in the game, one expects something more from the Disney. And this time it didn't manage to meet expectations. [Full review in Spanish]"
Film Ireland Magazine," December 7, 2016",Ellen Murray," Well, if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Herald Sun (Australia)," December 7, 2016",Leigh Paatsch," Though not without a few flat spots, this intelligently scripted and accessible fare is blessed with spellbinding marine visuals and esoteric earworms aplenty from composer-of-the-moment Lin-Manuel Miranda."
Film Freak Central," December 6, 2016",Walter Chaw, What works best about Moana are its moments of cultural peculiarity.
MovieCrypt.com," December 6, 2016",Kevin A. Ranson," While Moana is the title character, it's Dwayne Johnson's Maui who steals the show - because he can. "
Film Inquiry," December 5, 2016",Mike Daringer," Though Moana delivers plucky entertainment and some colorful characters, it plays the narrative too safely by relying on commonplace machinations."
Cin√©filoz," December 5, 2016",Emmanuel B√°ez," Moana is one of Disney's best films, and undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and emotional of the year. [Full review in Spanish]"
