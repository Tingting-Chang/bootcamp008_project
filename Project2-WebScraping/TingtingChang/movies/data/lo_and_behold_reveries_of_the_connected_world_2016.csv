FILMINK (Australia)," January 31, 2017",Chris Bright, Werner Herzog investigates the internet in his own entertaining and idiosyncratic way.
Columbus Alive," December 31, 2016",Brad Keefe," It could have easily been turned into a Ken Burns-style mini-series, but instead the mind-blowing concepts come at you in rapid-fire succession, all wrapped in a healthy layer of the Herzog we know and love."
MetroActive," December 31, 2016",Richard von Busack, Our genial German director-flaneur comments on what he sees -- in a famous voice that is as even-tempered under pressure as a Western movie sheriff. It's a calm under which compassion is barely audible yet easy to sense.
Cinemaphile.org," December 30, 2016",David Keyes," No one, not even a skilled professional, asks these kinds of questions with the same distinctive slant as Werner Herzog."
Cinetvymas.cl," December 20, 2016",Felipe Tapia," An extremely professional work, anyone who is interested in learning more about technology should take the time to watch this documentary. [Full review in Spanish]"
Sunday Times (UK)," December 17, 2016",Camilla Long, Werner Herzog's ode to the internet is both fascinating and probing.
Eye for Film," December 15, 2016",Jennie Kermode," Lo And Behold is beautifully shot, its outdoor landscapes so vibrant and verdant one can almost smell them, its indoor spaces cool and shining yet welcoming as Kubrick made them."
Otroscines.com," December 13, 2016",Diego Battle," Even though its structure is little conventional, the film never ceases to be fascinating. [Full review in Spanish]"
Film Inquiry," December 8, 2016",Arlin Golden, Lo and Behold is the most beautifully constructed and fully realized documentary I've had the pleasure of watching so far this year.
La Nación (Argentina)," December 8, 2016",Alejandro Lingenti," Dynamic, provocative, enthralling. The film combines irony, scientific arguments and sociological reflections that are Herzog's trademark. [Full review in Spanish]"
EscribiendoCine," December 7, 2016",Benjamín Harguindey, The type of film that aims to produce in the viewer as many questions as possible rather than answer them. [Full review in Spanish]
Flick Filosopher," November 29, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson, Skips away every time it seems like it's about to delve deeply into something odd and fascinating. Feels like teases from a slew of other Herzog films.
Laramie Movie Scope," November 23, 2016",Robert Roten," The film jumps from the horrors of the trolls who lurk online, to the sublime visions of idealists who hope for a better future because of our increasing interconnectedness."
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," November 8, 2016",Dennis Schwartz, The talking head presentation gets a bit much if trying to comprehend it all in one sitting.
Film Ireland Magazine," November 4, 2016",Steven Galvin," It's a mammoth undertaking, something Herzog is akin to, but his subject is a beast that can't be tamed, leaving him awe-inspired but at a loss for words."
Empire Magazine," November 2, 2016",Dan Jolin," A lesser Werner, but still worth dipping your brain into."
RTÉ (Ireland)," November 2, 2016",Paddy Kehoe, A cautionary film about the uncharted future for the internet -- and scientists in essence know little about how that future will roll out.
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," November 1, 2016",Hilary A White, Required viewing.
Observer (UK)," October 30, 2016",Wendy Ide, It's a sporadically fascinating film that dips its toe into many different themes where perhaps it should have chosen to immerse itself in just one or two.
MovieMail," October 28, 2016",Mike McCahill," [It's] worth catching, but only in its final chapters -- pondering what's coming down the wires -- do you feel Herzog delving deep. What goes before is all a bit too ZOMG to provoke much in the way of serious reflection."
Christianity Today," June 18, 2016",Alissa Wilkinson," It's absolutely essential watching for anyone who wants to think about the human side-the business, the politics, the science, the art-of living in our connected world."
Slant Magazine," June 15, 2016",Chuck Bowen," It offers no conclusions, routinely alternating between episodes that contrast exhilaration with exploitation and damnation."
Flavorwire," April 27, 2016",Jason Bailey," Less a disciplined documentary than a free-form essay film about connectivity, less a comprehensive history or analysis than a casual exploration."
La Jornada," April 11, 2016",Carlos Bonfil," It might not be Herzog's most rounded documentary, but it is probably the most relevant and effective. [Full review in Spanish]"
Chicago Reader," April 7, 2016",Dmitry Samarov, The film explores the horrors and the wonders of our current way of life.
El Universal," April 6, 2016",Alonso Díaz de la Vega, Herzog contemplates a world were the internet becomes self aware and questions humans relation to it. [Full review in Spanish]
The Film Stage," February 19, 2016",Jordan Raup, A rapidly entertaining ride through the rise of technology [although] certain sections might feel thematically underdeveloped.
The Young Folks," February 4, 2016",Josh Cabrita," ...Herzog is more concerned with the feelings and impact of the digital age, the insight provided by conversations... Each talking head is a person, not a robot to mechanically spew out information. "
Suite101.com," February 4, 2016",Fred Topel," Goes full Herzog into the abstract and esoteric, and that's what we love about Herzog."
"Deseret News, Salt Lake City"," January 29, 2016",Josh Terry, Herzog's wit has an amusing way of holding his documentary together.
The Verge," January 29, 2016",Chris Plante," There's little refuting Herzog's gift as a documentarian. Even condensed, his interviews manage to squeeze fresh stories from people and technology exhaustively covered by books and media."
Nerdist," January 28, 2016",Kyle Anderson," Herzog narrates it himself and allows his own question-asking off-camera to be part of the film's narrative, and that personal touch is why it succeeds. W"
Consequence of Sound," January 26, 2016",Dominick Mayer," Lo and Behold is no Luddite's screed. With Herzog's signature mix of dry humor and searching interviews, he simply takes our world at face value and uses the Internet to investigate the imperfections of the people who created it."
Hollywood Reporter," January 24, 2016",Todd McCarthy," A quizzical, spry, modestly illuminating consideration of where human beings currently stand vis-a-vis the invention that is changing the world in as-yet unimaginable ways."
Variety," January 24, 2016",Justin Chang," These discrete ""reveries of the connected world"" represent the latest of Herzog's heady explorations of what it means to be human (and even post-human), rendered in his characteristically personal, decidedly analog style."
Guardian," January 24, 2016",Lanre Bakare," Via a coterie of charming, if sometimes awkward boffins and geeks interviewed in labs or their own garages, Herzog weaves a fantastical tale that tries to explain the online world inhabited by about 3 billion people."
The Playlist," January 23, 2016",Nick Schager," Suggesting that modern cinema's most prescient work may be ""Terminator,"" Werner Herzog's ""Lo and Behold"" takes a simultaneously curious, awe-struck and terrified look at the origins and future of the web and the interconnected reality it's begat."
San Francisco Chronicle," August 18, 2016",G. Allen Johnson," Are we doomed? Or will we conquer all? Whatever the outcome, Herzog argues that mass connectivity marks a beginning of a shift in our morals, and indeed, in what it means to be human."
AV Club," August 18, 2016",A.A. Dowd," Lo And Behold approaches the internet with the same mixture of wonder and dread that the director previously applied to pitiless nature, but the subject matter is inherently less cinematic."
Blu-ray.com," August 17, 2016",Brian Orndorf," Builds a perspective on internet usage, power, and possibility that educates and horrifies, playing into the director's filmmaking interests as he once again sets out to dissect and celebrate the wonders of the world."
Willamette Week," August 17, 2016",Zach Middleton," Herzog films aren't really about criticism, though. They are about Herzog's sense of wonder, the existentialist angst that guides his inquiry and his ability to find unique and memorable characters in interesting situations."
The New Republic," August 17, 2016",Sven Birkerts, If only Herzog could give this idea of full embeddedness the attention it very badly needs. But the director holds off from making the kind of visionary statement that would burn through the epical thickness of techno-chaff and touch the old questions.
Metro," August 17, 2016",Matt Prigge," This isn't a smug broadside against the global village. Much as Herzog mourns (in that voice) over the dark side, he's also smitten with the possibilities in a future we have no way of predicting. "
Village Voice," August 17, 2016",Aaron Hillis," Herzog smartly takes a broad, bird's-eye perspective of our early techno-evolution."
Killer Movie Reviews," August 16, 2016",Andrea Chase, As revelatory as it is disconcerting.
Film Experience," August 16, 2016",Glenn Dunks," [The film] comes off at once as both too little and too much with Herzog somewhat adrift, surrounded by a sea of overwrought zeal."
Compuserve," August 13, 2016",Harvey S. Karten, Werner Herzog takes a nuanced view of the wonders of the digital revolution.
Reeling Reviews," August 12, 2016",Robin Clifford," For many, ""Lo and Behold"" will be an interesting history lesson and look into the future of the Internet, including the colonization of Mars."
Globe and Mail," August 12, 2016",Kate Taylor, [A] fascinating but alarmist film ...
Toronto Star," August 11, 2016",Peter Howell," Herzog regards the online world with a mixture of wonder, humour and horror, observing that the ingenuity of people to build machines is outdone only by their capacity to misuse them."
In These Times," August 10, 2016",Michael Atkinson," [Herzog's] new film, Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World, is a new order of business, an awed tour of human life shaped by the internet, from a filmmaker whose passions have always sought out the primordial and pre-technological."
NOW Toronto," August 10, 2016",Norman Wilner, It's entertaining but not exactly illuminating -- the sort of essay film that's best watched with knowledgeable friends who can reframe its -stories in a less apocalyptic context.
ColeSmithey.com," August 5, 2016",Cole Smithey," ""Lo and Behold"" is everything the film promises to be, entertaining, informative, insightful, and peppered with Herzog's distinctive voice."
Ex-Press.com," August 5, 2016",Jay Stone, Both intriguing and beside the point.
Georgia Straight," August 4, 2016",Ken Eisner," Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World is just the kind of offbeat treatise you'd expect from Werner Herzog, asked to ponder the main elements of how we communicate today."
Movie Nation," July 18, 2016",Roger Moore," A bit of a wander, but the cinema's most curious filmmaker is the right guy to ponder the wonders of the Internet Age, and its perils. "
rec.arts.movies.reviews," July 16, 2016",Louis Proyect," Werner Herzog is always in search of the obsessed oddball, either a German-American inspired to become a pilot after seeing allied bombers destroying his village or now computer engineers. There is only one Werner Herzog, god bless him."
Tribune News Service," August 19, 2016",Katie Walsh," Herzog breaks the internet, cracks it open to carefully examine the insides - the glorious possibilities and the devastating potential pitfalls. "
Paste Magazine," August 19, 2016",Andy Crump," Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World makes no predictions about where the internet will take us, and only offers that we must take the bad with the good."
San Francisco Examiner," August 19, 2016",Anita Katz," Herzog provides no shockers. The film is less penetrating, fascinating and affecting than his movies Grizzly Man and Cave of Forgotten Dreams. Still, he's incapable of being shallow or uninteresting."
Film Journal International," August 19, 2016",Doris Toumarkine," Werner Herzog brings his considerable strengths of wry humor, unbounded curiosity, taste for the morbid and gift for drama to [Lo and Behold]."
RogerEbert.com," August 19, 2016",Matt Zoller Seitz," The film is saved from mere competence by that Herzogian feeling, at once grandiose and self-deprecating. "
Brooklyn Magazine," August 19, 2016",Benjamin Mercer, Who better than a proudly idiosyncratic and restlessly sage human to ponder the sort of user experience that-for better or worse-the internet has enabled our lives to become?
Reeling Reviews," August 19, 2016",Laura Clifford," It's far from all encompassing, but delightful in its playfulness. And 'The corridors here look repulsive' may be my favorite movie line of 2016."
Philadelphia Inquirer," August 19, 2016",Tirdad Derakhshani, An elegant survey of the origins of the information revolution and a shrewd analysis of how the internet has reshaped the world.
Time Out," August 18, 2016",Joshua Rothkopf, We want the rambling Werner Herzog to follow his muse into strange corners -- let lesser documentary filmmakers stick to virtues like coherence. 
New York Times," August 18, 2016",A.O. Scott," [A] captivating, uneven film ..."
Salt Lake Tribune," August 18, 2016",Sean P. Means," Herzog ultimately sounds optimistic about humanity's hyperlinked future, even as he highlights the many dangers on the road ahead."
Wall Street Journal," August 18, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," Mr. Herzog's film may not be a model of organization, but I loved every meandering minute."
Los Angeles Times," August 18, 2016",Robert Abele," Just the kind of percolating, wry probe we need into this fast-moving, digitally monopolizing age."
Under the Radar," August 18, 2016",Charles Steinberg," In his new documentary about the pervasiveness of the Internet in modern society, Werner Herzog employs his familiar unfiltered treatment of subject matter."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," August 18, 2016",Colin Covert, This is a bigger mouthful than even a master like Herzog can digest.
TheWrap," August 18, 2016",Sam Adams," If it had half the segments, and they were twice as long, the movie might be able to get beneath the surface and find the monomaniacal characters Herzog is often so great at exploring."
Seattle Weekly," August 18, 2016",Robert Horton," These factoids would be interesting if they were arranged in 60 Minutes segments, but with Herzog narrating and asking piercing questions, they become something more."
Boston Globe," August 18, 2016",Mark Feeney," Obviously, this is a large and daunting subject. What's the German word for ""daunt""? It appears never to have entered Herzog's vocabulary."
Washington Post," August 18, 2016",Ann Hornaday," ""Lo and Behold"" may not be Herzog's most artistically ambitious film, but it's an intriguing, even important one nonetheless."
Seattle Times," August 18, 2016",John Hartl," [A] chatty, mostly fascinating talkathon about the impact of the internet."
The Nation," August 29, 2016",Stuart Klawans," ﻿[﻿Herzog's] commentary is the center, however provisional, of a world that has become a directionless network. His voice is the sound, still present, of human contact."
National Review," August 29, 2016",Armond White," Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World is an alarum about the Internet, a prophecy about man's self-annihilating instincts as shown through interviews with awed scientists and skeptical victims of technology."
San Diego Reader," August 27, 2016",Matthew Lickona, The unsparing eye feels a little more sparing than usual.
Newcity," August 26, 2016",Ray Pride," Herzog's observations, however, are steeped in optimism, an embrace of the mystic, and, even, good humor. "
Common Sense Media," August 26, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," This documentary is one of Herzog's best; it's thoughtful yet entertaining, amusing yet heartbreaking, and sometimes simply beautiful. "
Mark Reviews Movies," August 26, 2016",Mark Dujsik," One of the great, underappreciated joys of a documentary by Werner Herzog is having the opportunity simply to catch a glimpse into the workings of the man's mind."
The Newnan Times-Herald," August 26, 2016",Jonathan W. Hickman, A film worth sharing with everyone in your network. 
Detroit News," August 26, 2016",Tom Long," It's fascinating, scary (so scary), interesting stuff."
The Straits Times (Singapore)," August 25, 2016",John Lui," Herzog's loopy, pessimistic perspective keeps things interesting and his signature narration, its Germanic consonants cracking like thunder, is in itself a thing to behold."
SF Weekly," August 25, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," Herzog being Herzog, he still Herzogs up the joint, such as wondering whether the internet dreams of itself. (The answer may surprise you.)"
One Guy's Opinion," August 25, 2016",Frank Swietek," It might ramble, but you're always willing to follow Herzog's zigzag course, even if it reaches no definitive destination."
The New Republic," August 22, 2016",Will Leitch, It's increasingly possible that the meme of Werner Herzog is surpassing the man. I found myself spending much of Lo and Behold hoping Herzog would get out of the way.
New Yorker," August 22, 2016",Anthony Lane," The shape of things to come is a subject very dear to the hearts of the high-tech evangelists Herzog talks to, and it accounts for the pulse of freakish comedy that beats through ""Lo and Behold."""
Washington City Paper," August 20, 2016",Noah Gittell, Herzog's comfort with life's uncertainties allows him to crawl deep into his dread and tickle the most ferocious beasts
The Patriot Ledger," August 20, 2016",Al Alexander," Herzog's format is well-organized, and his array of talking heads interesting, but they're pretty much telling us what we already know. "
Rolling Stone," August 20, 2016",David Fear, The Existential Pondering-ometer goes into the red zone. There will be robots.
Cinemalogue.com," August 19, 2016",Todd Jorgenson, ... a provocative glimpse into technology and the power of innovation that shows both the endless benefits and the inherent dangers of constant connectivity.
Cambridge Day," August 19, 2016",Tom Meek, The filmmaker's laid-back yet probing style and quest for getting at the human condition and effects of a digital sphere enveloping society is nothing short of infectious.
Uproxx," August 19, 2016",Keith Phipps," Any of its ten chapters could probably have sustained features of their own. But an overarching vision emerges anyway, even if it's one Herzog never states explicitly."
leonardmaltin.com," August 19, 2016",Leonard Maltin, An absorbing visual treatise on technology and the internet... Documentarian Herzog explores the effect on individual lives to the interconnectedness of the planet.
Radio Times," October 28, 2016",David Parkinson," While Herzog is right to express concerns about the possibility of civilisation being taken over by machines, he is most worried about humanity's capacity for collective folly and the abnegation of responsibility for its very future."
Times (UK)," October 27, 2016",Ed Potton," He specialises in stories about impossible dreams and defying nature and for his latest film Werner Herzog turns to the most ambitious, abominable creation of them all: the internet."
Sky Movies," October 27, 2016",Tim Evans, Fragmented yet fascinating ...
Scotsman," October 27, 2016",Alistair Harkness, This exploration of the birth and development of the internet is nothing if not entertaining.
The Spectator," October 27, 2016",Bryan Appleyard," As ever, Herzog leaves us as anxious and uncertain as we are thrilled."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," October 27, 2016",Tim Robey," It's Herzog's uncertainty as a tourist in the field that gives the film its enticing charge, as surely as his wanderings in the Antarctic, or gropings in the dark to find the world's oldest cave paintings."
Guardian," October 27, 2016",Peter Bradshaw," A thorough, thoughtful piece of work from Herzog, but slightly ho-hum in its fence-sitting tendencies ..."
Independent (UK)," October 27, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab, This is an intriguing and provocative film which explores its subject from many different angles. What it lacks is a point of view.
Little White Lies," October 25, 2016",Sophie Monks Kaufman," Herzog plays intellectual explorer, notching up points of view like a kid in a cerebral candy store."
Total Film," October 24, 2016",Kevin Harley," Herzog reaches parts of the web other filmmakers wouldn't think to poke in this diligent, droll docu-browse."
The List," October 24, 2016",Eddie Harrison," 'Do you think the internet can dream of itself?' is the kind of gnarly enquiry Herzog puts to his experts, and their detailed answers are recorded with friendly gravitas."
HeyUGuys," October 13, 2016",Stefan Pape," It's incredibly easy to take for granted that the way we live has been so heavily informed, and dictated by a series of insanely intelligent people, as we're so consumed by actually using the internet we forget where it came from."
Letras Libres," September 27, 2016",Fernanda Solórzano," With this film, the director tries to amaze the viewer; strip the internet of the familiarity with which we treat it and restore its mystery. [Full review in Spanish]"

Spirituality and Practice," September 16, 2016",Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, A bold and multidimensional documentary about the glories and the drawbacks of the Internet.
MLive.com," September 9, 2016",John Serba," It's frequently warm and wondrous; just as frequently, it's chilly and troubling. If Herzog's work isn't an acute reflection of life itself, then nothing is."
Graffiti With Punctuation," September 8, 2016",Blake Howard," Herzog has poetry in his approach; in his interactions with participants, even down to his perspective that never fails to be able to take the interview subjects to places that are unexpected."
Christian Science Monitor," September 2, 2016",Peter Rainer," As long as Herzog continues to mouth his mysterioso epiphanies, it can't be all bad."
Austin Chronicle," September 1, 2016",Kimberley Jones," If [Herzog's] closing image of a campfire reads a touch obvious, you can't really argue with his point, or its poetic justice."
It's Just Movies," August 30, 2016",Ron Wilkinson, Not worried about the Internet? You should be. Herzog is in far over his head on this one.
