Total Film," January 2, 2017",Matt Glasby," For a film that repeatedly questions the legitimacy of its punk rocker heroes, Saulnier's second salvo is the real deal: a ferocious siege movie that cuts straight to the bone."
Seven Days," January 1, 2017",Margot Harrison," The setting is claustrophobia inducing, the shooting artful, and the tension unremitting."
MetroActive," December 31, 2016",Richard von Busack, Green Room is a strangely involving as any movie contained by the bloody hillbilly-attack genre.

Sunday Times (UK)," December 17, 2016",Edward Porter," The performances are good, and the punks' squabbles and mistakes are an extra source of unpredictability in the film's piecemeal but generally effective series of bloodthirsty tussles."

Projected Figures," November 6, 2015",Anton Bitel, A siege film with believable characters & witty dialogue... shows regular folk just trying to get by in impossible circumstances. It also slyly exposes the low motives underlying some of the more extreme ideologies in America's culture wars.

CraveOnline," September 11, 2015",Inkoo Kang," Th[e] naturalistic Confederate Gothic atmosphere is the most distinctive element of the film, an effective if largely predictable nightmare (in a vindication-of-the-formula sort of way). "
Consequence of Sound," September 11, 2015",Sarah Kurchak, Green Room proves playfully unpredictable to the very last frame. Perhaps the only thing more exciting than waiting to see what transpires is waiting to see what Saulnier does next.
Irish Times," May 22, 2015",Tara Brady," What begins as a nail-biting thriller effortlessly segues into carnage, replete with ripped throats and wounds that seek to redefine the word 'gaping'."
Guardian," May 18, 2015",Benjamin Lee," There's also a thick vein of dark humour that runs through the film which never turns it into a comedy but keeps some of the nastier moments (and boy, are they nasty) from turning it into torture porn."
indieWire," May 18, 2015",Jason Gorber," Littered with clever dialogue, a beautifully constructed narrative, as well as moments that shift between the energizing and sheer terror, there are a slew of endearing qualities worth sifting through."

Salon.com," April 13, 2016",Andrew O'Hehir," Only a limited number of things can happen in this kind of movie, of course, but Saulnier manages pace, tone and storytelling so adroitly that you won't quite expect any of them to happen when they do, or even how."

Entertainment Weekly," April 12, 2016",Chris Nashawaty," What makes Green Room more than just a giddy, gory slice of gonzo B-movie mayhem ... is both its ace cast and the vise-tightening mastery of the man pulling the strings behind the camera."

Film Comment Magazine," March 17, 2016",David Fear," [In] Jeremy Saulnier's near-perfect nugget of a siege thriller...[g]raphic scenes of carnage are doled out sparingly but unflinchingly, while cinematographer Sean Porter gives each high-stakes encounter...a palpable sense of vintage nastiness."
Daily Record (UK)," February 26, 2016",Garry McConnachie," This is masterful film-making and Green Room doesn't pull any punches. In fact, it'll grab you by the throat and refuse to let go until the credits roll."
WOW247," February 25, 2016",Matthew Turner," Stylishly directed and impressively acted, this is a gripping, grisly, gory gift for genre fans. Saulnier's next film can't come soon enough."

The Film Stage," February 21, 2016",Giovanni Marchini Camia," While Green Room features a number of ingeniously crafted set pieces, it quickly winds up as an excessive, borderline pornographic revelry in extreme violence."

The Skinny," February 17, 2016",Josh Slater-Williams," With its tight, economic storytelling, Green Room keeps things simple and scary."
TheFrightFile.com," January 27, 2016",Dustin Putman," [Sundance 2016] A film of poisonous lineages and the evil that good men and beasts learn, ""Green Room"" has something more to say beyond being a bloodily decisive genre work."

Collider," April 14, 2016",Perri Nemiroff, The 95 minutes are so enthralling and fly by so fast that it's got a rollercoaster effect. It's hard to come down from the adrenaline rush and think of anything else besides experiencing it again.

Film Comment Magazine," April 14, 2016",Michael Sragow," Although Green Room has more scope and technical ambition than Blue Ruin, artistically it takes a giant step back."
New York Post," April 14, 2016",Lou Lumenick, Saulnier gets lots of laughs and builds plenty of suspense in this effective (if gory) little tongue-in-cheek sleeper.
The New Republic," April 14, 2016",Tim Grierson, Good lord is it tense.

The Verge," April 13, 2016",Emily Yoshida," The outsized circumstances end up making it funnier, too -- the film has a kind of locked-jaw sardonic sense of humor that is the perfect counterbalance to its moody camerawork and soundtrack."
New York Observer," April 21, 2016",Rex Reed, About as thrilling as a fried grasshopper canapé.
Seattle Times," April 21, 2016",Soren Anderson," ""Green Room"" is one nasty piece of work. And I mean that in a good way."
Reeling Reviews," April 20, 2016",Laura Clifford," Saulnier doesn't shy away from some teeth-clenching, peek-through-the-fingers, savagery, but the film excels in how he's laid out his game."

Brooklyn Magazine," April 19, 2016",Jesse Hassenger, an extended knife-twist at a screw-turning pace
Vox," April 18, 2016",Todd VanDerWerff," Somewhere in its black little heart, it has something interesting to say about human resiliency and the reckless moral code of youth. And at just over 90 minutes, it never overstays its welcome."
New Yorker," April 18, 2016",Richard Brody," One screenplay riff, on the taking of good advice, is piquantly memorable, but Saulnier's clever methods are insubstantial and the movie's stakes, though mortal, seem slight."
The Young Folks," April 16, 2016",Yasmin Kleinbart, Green Room is more than just a torture porn film; it's a hardcore punk show.
Cinemalogue.com," April 15, 2016",Todd Jorgenson, A lack of character depth and narrative surprise renders it a well-acted genre exercise.
Slate," April 15, 2016",Jeffrey Bloomer," Green Room proves to be an exquisitely crafted love letter to John Carpenter, and the rare horror ensemble that gives as much care to the villains as to the victims."
rec.arts.movies.reviews," April 15, 2016",Louis Proyect," Totally brilliant. Like an episode of ""The Walking Dead"" directed by Akira Kurosawa or Sam Peckinpah."

Newark Star-Ledger," April 15, 2016",Stephen Whitty," Unlike other genre directors, Saulnier takes his time setting things up, so we get to know the characters first - particularly Alia Shawkat as Sam, and Anton Yelchin as Pat."

"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," April 22, 2016",Robert Horton," Although this film's subject matter may be scruffy and disreputable, Green Room does engage ideas about trust and cooperation and improvisational thinking. All of which should put you near the edge of your seat as you watch this gripping thriller."
Austin American-Statesman," April 22, 2016",Joe Gross," This smart, stomach-turning look at what happens when you find yourself way over your head will go down as a well-deserved, punk rock classic."

Chicago Daily Herald," April 21, 2016",Dann Gire," Saulnier gave us the sharply detailed, offbeat art house thriller Blue Ruin in 2013. Here, he replaces complex character motivation with simple survival instincts, and winds up in a room far more red than green."

Chicago Reader," April 21, 2016",Leah Pickett," The characters are picked off in predictable order, and a neo-Nazi angle leads to a dead end. Patrick Stewart is miscast as the skinheads' leader, his theatricality clashing with the other actors' realism. "

Philadelphia Inquirer," April 28, 2016",Steven Rea," [Saulnier does] everything right: the cast, the music, the editing, the way he leads you one way and then clobbers you (and some of his ill-fated characters) when you (and they) are least expecting it."
ReelViews," April 28, 2016",James Berardinelli," The production doesn't offer much in the way of originality but it's a tense 90-minute ride that will result in elevated pulses, increased respiration, and white knuckles."

One Guy's Opinion," April 28, 2016",Frank Swietek," Compared to Saulnier's superior 'Blue Ruin,' this is a bit of a disappointment... another violent thriller, but compared to the former film it's curiously simple in terms of narrative, and the director's solemn approach works less effectively as a result."
Bullz-Eye.com," April 28, 2016",Jack Giroux," Green Room has a raw, unflinching spirit to it - one that's always exciting to watch, despite the brutality of it all."

Creative Loafing," April 30, 2016",Matt Brunson," Short on depth but long on visceral thrills, it's Old Testament moviemaking, with the adage about an eye for an eye expanding to also include arms, legs, torsos and, once killer dogs are introduced, even jugulars."

Globe and Mail," April 29, 2016",Barry Hertz," It's a delightfully cruel work of high tension, perfect in just how quickly and easily it gets under your skin."

Examiner.com," April 28, 2016",Chris Sawin, Green Room launches you into this grungy world of punk music filled with Nazis and fuses it with the viciousness found in The Grey along with the dilapidated ambiance of SLC Punk for an experience that is terrifically unforgettable. 
Toronto Star," April 28, 2016",Bruce Demara," It doesn't take a big budget and loads of special effects to create a genuinely scary movie. It just takes - as writer/director Jeremy Saulnier ably demonstrates in Green Room - an intriguing premise, a taut, sinewy script and a solid cast."
San Diego Union-Tribune," April 28, 2016",Anders Wright," The violence is intense and visceral. And while it may be a familiar formula, Saulnier's cast is top-notch, his writing is sharp, and it isn't long before you realize that no one's survival is guaranteed."
National Post," April 28, 2016",Chris Knight, Saulnier crafts a gruesome setup as simple as is it inevitable.

Starburst," May 13, 2016",Joel Harley," Like being trapped in a mosh pit full of demented punk rockers, Green Room will kick your ass, leaving you beaten, changed and a little bit traumatised. You'll have had a hell of a time, though."

The Australian," May 13, 2016",David Stratton, Saulnier's undoubted skills as a director just about outweigh his fondness for gore.
The Big Issue," May 13, 2016",Edward Lawrenson," Green Room is a nasty, cold-hearted, claustrophobic film with moments of gratuitous violence and sick comedy. I liked it much more than Almost Famous."
Daily Express (UK)," May 13, 2016",Allan Hunter," In its best moments Green Room reminds you of the sweaty, tightly controlled tension that John Carpenter achieved in early films like Assault On Precinct 13."
The Sun (UK)," May 12, 2016",Jamie East," While Green Room goes slightly daft towards the end, the brutality and adrenaline you experience along the way more than make up for it."
Sky Movies," May 12, 2016",Andy Psyllides, Destined to become a Friday night favourite.
Radio Times," May 12, 2016",Jeremy Aspinall," The contrast between the pastoral setting and shocking blood-letting creates lots of breathless tension, putting Green Room in good company with down-and-dirty siege flicks like Assault on Precinct 13 and especially Straw Dogs."
BBC.com," May 12, 2016",Owen Gleiberman," [A] dourly aggressive, in-your-face thriller."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," May 12, 2016",Patrick Smith," A pulverising piece of Seventies-style grindhouse exploitation, stitched together from the body parts of John Boorman's classic Deliverance and John Carpenter's siege thriller Assault on Precinct 13."
Indie London," May 12, 2016",Rob Carnevale," This is a powerhouse piece of indie cinema: tense, gripping, intelligent and gut wrenchingly violent."
The Age (Australia)," May 12, 2016",Jake Wilson," For all the shock value of the explicit gore, the horror isn't the kind that lingers. Still, it's fun while it lasts -- that is, presuming you have a reasonably morbid idea of fun."
CineVue," May 11, 2016",Ben Nicholson," Nasty, nerve-wracking and not for the squeamish."
MLive.com," May 10, 2016",John Serba," A grueling experience, viscerally suspenseful, inspiring in me a mighty clench in my seat."

The Atlantic," May 5, 2016",Lenika Cruz," Scrape off the scum, and you'll find Green Room full of visual artistry, dark humor, smart writing, and glints of humanity. "
Washington Free Beacon," July 14, 2016",Sonny Bunch," Green Room is unsparing in its brutality and unsentimental in its treatment of its protagonists. When the violence finally gets going, things get ugly, quickly."

El Pais (Spain)," June 17, 2016",Javier Ocaña," In the first minutes you can tell there's energy, pleasure, rage and mistery. This is the work of a director that know how to make you feel something. [Full review in Spanish]"

Q Network Film Desk," May 24, 2016",James Kendrick, Saulnier revels in the primal nastiness of what the will to live looks like in the most dire of circumstances while also infusing the film with a level of visual artistry and black humor that suggests he is capable of much more. 
The Arts Desk," May 19, 2016",Nick Hasted," Where Blue Ruin announced Saulnier, Green Room is his career breakthrough. "
The Sunday Age," May 17, 2016",Craig Mathieson," Saulnier's quiet dynamic ratchets up the tension before bursts of horror-like mayhem make clear that they are fighting merely to stay alive, not to make a point."
ABC Radio (Australia)," May 17, 2016",CJ Johnson," Joins the canon of ""under siege"" movies ... not with louder bangs, scarier invaders or more bloodshed but with originality, wit and subversion."

Scotsman," May 15, 2016",Alistair Harkness," An intense siege movie that gives familiar tropes a blistering makeover courtesy of a precision-engineered plot, a thorough understanding of the world in which it's set and a gnarly and uncompromising approach to violence."
London Evening Standard," May 15, 2016",Charlotte O'Sullivan," How can you resist a film that, metaphorically, throws Simon & Garfunkel, Fugazi and Slayer into the same moshpit?"
