Little White Lies," February 9, 2017",David Jenkins," Washington is customarily magnetic, but this is Davis' film."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," February 9, 2017",Tim Robey," The great coup Washington delivers, beyond framing his co-star's virtuous anguish so well, is the risky, brilliant, and frequently alienating performance he gives as Troy."
Film Inquiry," February 8, 2017",Tomas Trussow," Fences is an important tale of humanity, responsibility, self-sacrifice and error told from the perspective of lives that have been occluded from the grand narrative. "

Herald Sun (Australia)," February 8, 2017",Leigh Paatsch, There is no doubting the power and the fury charging through the work of Washington -- who also directs here -- and a few of his most compelling speeches rank as true master classes in wielding the spoken word as a weapon.
Independent (UK)," February 8, 2017",Geoffrey Macnab," This feels more like a record of a stage performance than a film in its own right. That, though, doesn't lessen its impact in the slightest or take away from the searing brilliance of the two leads."

HeyUGuys," February 6, 2017",Stefan Pape," Given this is based on a stage play, naturally this film is fundamentally about speech, and the dialogue is beautifully crafted and rhythmically delivered, with a collection of quite remarkable monologues, and indelible two-handers."

Variety," November 22, 2016",Owen Gleiberman," As you watch ""Fences,"" there's never a doubt that these lives matter, and that's a good and noble thing, but you're also aware (maybe too aware) of how much the movie itself wants to matter."
Screen International," November 22, 2016",Tim Grierson," Denzel Washington's marvelous adaptation of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play provides the actor-director with one of his finest roles, and he gives a powerhouse performance as an aging patriarch undone by his pride, stupidity and bitterness."

Wall Street Journal," December 15, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," It will not come as a news flash that Mr. Washington is a movie star of the first rank... what he does here is both sizzling and subtle, a star performance that does equal justice to the play's poetry and kitchen-sink reality."

BET.com," December 9, 2016",Clay Cane, Give Viola Davis her Oscar!
Nerdist," December 8, 2016",Kristy Puchko, Fences' performances are hands down some of the best of the year. But Washington...half-heartedly strove to make it cinematic.

New York Observer," December 20, 2016",Rex Reed," Fences is a labor of love and attention must be paid. You don't get writing or acting of this caliber every day, and in this particularly dreary year of second-rate everything, this movie is something special."
Paste Magazine," December 19, 2016",Andy Crump," For a first-timer, the film would be an achievement. For Washington, it's further proof of his indelibility as an actor."
PopMatters," December 19, 2016",Chris Barsanti," As director and star of this powerful adaptation of August Wilson's canonical play, Denzel Washington plays a brash talker masking a world of misery and secrets, with an unforgettable pathos."

Minneapolis Star Tribune," December 22, 2016",Colin Covert," Regardless of whether its controlled style and emotionally rich cast introduce this scalding drama of family discord to new audiences or revive it for longtime followers, it's tightrope-taut theater."
Slate," December 22, 2016",Dana Stevens," Watching it is like getting a front-row seat to the beautifully mounted revival of a classic work of American drama, starring two stars who know and understand that text as well as any actors in the world."
St. Louis Post-Dispatch," December 22, 2016",Calvin Wilson," ""Fences"" is perhaps best appreciated as a showcase for the brilliant acting of Washington and Davis. Their performances are virtually guaranteed to garner Oscar nominations."

Time Out," December 20, 2016",Joshua Rothkopf," Washington's performance -- as big as it gets -- is all wrong for the movies, where even a self-aggrandizing character like Troy Maxson, a former Negro Leagues star ballplayer turned '50s Pittsburgh garbageman, needs to be scaled back to feel realistic."
"Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)"," December 23, 2016",Bob Bloom," The film is the next best thing to seeing a stage production of this 20th-century classic. Its power, compassion and intimacy crashes through the screen and into your heart."
San Diego Reader," December 23, 2016",Matthew Lickona," Your best bet is to let those mellifluous, multitudinous words bewitch, bother, and beguile you; then maybe you won't notice the stagey presentation, slight story, and occasional emotional overreach."
