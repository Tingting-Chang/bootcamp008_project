Laramie Movie Scope," January 17, 2017",Robert Roten," Acting is not the problem here. The story is the problem. It takes aim at some serious issues, but doesn't have the guts to really address them. Instead, the story skittishly skates around the issues it raises, and quits before it gets ahead."
Seanax.com," January 13, 2017",Sean Axmaker," This is not a Disney movie with a teary resolution and all sins forgiven. Sachs is more interested in the nuances of relationships, the power of childhood friendship..."
Film Experience," January 2, 2017",Nathaniel Rogers, It's safe to say that [Ira Sachs] is in the midst of his peak storytelling years. Do not miss out on them.

Baltimore Magazine," December 29, 2016",Max Weiss, Ira Sachs is a director of uncommon empathy and insight. His latest explores the perils of gentrification and the wisdom of the young.
Financial Times," December 27, 2016",Nigel Andrews," As a picture of ticking intergenerational lives and their complex movements, it's as exact as a watch."
3AW," December 26, 2016",Jim Schembri," As with Love is Strange, Sachs shows his love of little moments, nuanced behaviour and unforced, if occasionally forceful, performances, with the turns from the lads oozing with naturalism."
ABC Radio Brisbane," December 25, 2016",Matthew Toomey, It's a well-told tale that comes together nicely in the last half-hour.
Concrete Playground," December 15, 2016",Sarah Ward," Little Men could've easily been called Life Is Strange - and, like its predecessor, much hinges upon the work of its cast. "
The Australian," December 9, 2016",Stephen Romei, There are no cliches here.
Daily Telegraph (Australia)," December 7, 2016",Vicky Roach, A beautifully-observed account of friendship and human frailty.
FILMINK (Australia)," December 5, 2016",Jarrod Walker, a wonderful film
Film Inquiry," December 5, 2016",Alistair Ryder," Sachs demonstrates his ability to make fantastic character dramas, with an ear for realistic dialogue and a satirical swipe at the middle classes. "
ABC Radio (Australia)," December 1, 2016",CJ Johnson," As it moves calmly but deliberately along, the power of the dilemmas facing each of the main characters grows stronger. Inexorably, you can't help but be drawn in."
"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," November 17, 2016",John Beifuss," A compact and purposeful 21st-century parable of miscommunication motivated by economic anxiety, cultural identity, real estate resentment and personal antipathies and insecurities."
New Zealand Herald," November 11, 2016",Russell Baillie, A bittersweet charmer.
El antepenúltimo mohicano," November 10, 2016",Ignacio Navarro," A film that bases its energy on its inherent habitat rather than on aesthetics, deploying with truthfulness, pause and sensitivity the way coexistence can be generated and broken. [Full review in Spanish]"

El Pais (Spain)," October 21, 2016",Javier Ocaña, A distinctly New Yorker film on adolescent friendship and the apparent failure of maturity that has great performances. [Full review in Spanish]
Slant Magazine," August 1, 2016",Matt Brennan," Director Ira Sachs transforms the smallest blip on life's radar, a childhood friendship, into a momentous occasion."
New Yorker," August 1, 2016",Anthony Lane," The best reason to watch ""Little Men"" is Michael Barbieri, who musters a blend of soulfulness and aggression that would be remarkable at any age. The danger for any Sachs movie is that its humane quietude could slide into dullness. Not with this boy ..."
Compuserve," July 30, 2016",Harvey S. Karten, Arguably among the most authentic movie treatments of the adolescent's world.
Movie Nation," July 19, 2016",Roger Moore," Well-acted, but under-written and forgettable. "
The Skinny," June 22, 2016",Jamie Dunn," Sachs specialises in low-key melodrama, creating moments of joy and sadness so casually that they take you by surprise."
The List," June 21, 2016",Emma Simmonds," Little Men has a lightness of touch which belies its formidable powers of observation; frequently insightful and superbly performed, it presents us with a rainbow of recognisable humanity."
Christianity Today," June 18, 2016",Alissa Wilkinson," The performances are great, to be sure, but it's really the careful observation underpinning this script that stays with you."
Consequence of Sound," May 24, 2016",Blake Goble, Ira Sachs' sensitively drawn Little Men occupies a rarified space of total emotional truth
Flavorwire," May 3, 2016",Jason Bailey," A warm, honest, mellow movie, and Theo Taplitz and Michael Barbieri, the two young actors at its center, are terrific."
The Film Stage," February 19, 2016",Dan Schindel," The contrast between the straightforwardness of these kids and the roiling, mixed emotions of the adults is simple, even archetypal, and it works."
HeyUGuys," February 19, 2016",Stefan Pape," Not only a charming, joyous cinematic experience but a profound and moving one too."
The Young Folks," February 4, 2016",Josh Cabrita," The characters are all flawed and don't always act with nobility and altruism, but even as they undercut and condescend each other, the director Ira Sachs maintains a moral high-ground, treating his characters with respect even when they don't."
New York Magazine/Vulture," January 30, 2016",Bilge Ebiri," Little Men has a melancholy edge, but it's not really a depressing film. For all the despair onscreen, what remains afterwards are its luminous characterizations and big-hearted filmmaking."
Paste Magazine," January 29, 2016",Tim Grierson," Leaves us moved in an offhand, almost accidental manner."
The Playlist," January 29, 2016",Noel Murray," The beauty of ""Little Men"" - and of the director's work in general - is that it displays a rare understanding of how the world works. "
Guardian," January 26, 2016",Nigel M. Smith, The humanity Sachs and his actors depict is profound and leaves a mark.

Screen International," January 26, 2016",Fionnuala Halligan, Small and intimate it may be - and Ira Sachs' Little Men is more compact than his last slow-burn hit Love Is Strange - but there's no end to the discreet pleasures on screen here.
AARP Movies for Grownups," August 5, 2016",Bill Newcott, The film's most dramatic moment is one of its quietest: Dad sits down with Jake in the boy's bedroom...apologizing not so much for his handling of the situation as for the cruel complexities of life itself. 
Globe and Mail," August 5, 2016",Johanna Schneller," By the end, Sachs has raised urgent questions about immigration, classism, gentrification, loyalty, family and nascent sexuality - but he's done so utterly organically, via 10 square feet of city. Lovely."
Wall Street Journal," August 4, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," A touching, sometimes wrenching drama in which two schoolboys try to remain best friends while their parents struggle with a commercial dispute that threatens to tear both families apart."
NPR," August 4, 2016",Mark Jenkins," Sachs' latest is ... warm, subtle, and observant, but feels a little undercooked."
Toronto Star," August 4, 2016",Peter Howell," The antagonists all make persuasive arguments. Sachs, co-writing with Mauricio Zacharias, is careful not to demonize the families or trivialize their sentiments."
New York Post," August 4, 2016",Sara Stewart," It's a no-win situation in which no one is the bad guy - a gentle, intelligent oasis in this summer of heated name-calling."
Playboy Online," August 4, 2016",Stephen Rebello," Little Men needs no explosions, no CGI, no dramatic pyrotechnics. It just sneaks up and wallops you."
Newark Star-Ledger," August 4, 2016",Stephen Whitty," As always, it's about finding drama in the pauses."
Entertainment Weekly," August 4, 2016",Kevin P. Sullivan," The restrained script from Sachs and co-writer Mauricio Zacharias takes these boys seriously, without one whiff of condescension, and places value in life's mundane miracles, like forgiveness and the love of a true friend."
AV Club," August 4, 2016",Jesse Hassenger," The younger characters are so full of life, and the older ones so full of trenchant but predictable talking-point issues, that it sometimes feels like a middling movie encroaching on a good one."
NOW Toronto," August 3, 2016",Norman Wilner," The movie's stakes are small, but don't let that fool you. This is a nuanced, thoughtful drama about people figuring out who they are. They're just, you know, little."
indieWire," August 3, 2016",David Ehrlich, Ira Sachs' latest is that rarest of beasts: a truly hopeful heartbreaker.
New York Observer," August 3, 2016",Rex Reed," It doesn't eventually add up to much, but the acting is deeply sincere, and I was touched in unexpected places."
Film Journal International," August 3, 2016",Kevin Lally," With Little Men, Ira Sachs proves himself one of the foremost movie chroniclers of modern-day New York."

"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," August 19, 2016",Robert Horton, An impressionistic portrait of people trying to get along.
PopMatters," August 18, 2016",Bernard Boo," The grief of displacement and financial inadequacy is real and devastating and informs much of Little Men, but so too does the equally authentic exhilaration of young friendship in the big city."
Arizona Republic," August 18, 2016",Randy Cordova," The most remarkable thing about Ira Sachs' richly textured new film ""Little Men"" is how it manages to be about so much, and yet so little."
Seattle Times," August 18, 2016",Moira MacDonald, A heartfelt drama that has a lot to say.
Uproxx," August 16, 2016",Scott Tobias," Little Men has only one big dramatic scene, but it's a shot to the heart, so piercing because Sachs was patient enough to define all his characters fully before unleashing it."

SF Weekly," August 11, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," Little Men sticks its landing, implying something new about a major character without invalidating what came before. And that's no small feat."
Washington Post," August 11, 2016",Michael O'Sullivan," With a firm grasp on the duality implicit in its title, ""Little Men"" is a story that's neither tragic nor triumphal in the way it resolves itself, but rather one that's sadly, even satisfyingly true."
Out Magazine," August 11, 2016",Armond White, Sachs expands his social consciousness beyond the gay ghetto ...a sign of social progress and the ultimate class assimilation. In Little Men this diversion takes the sting out of the first friendships that many gay men experience as first love.
Los Angeles Times," August 10, 2016",Sheri Linden, Beautifully observed ...
San Francisco Chronicle," August 10, 2016",Mick LaSalle," The movie is as interesting as spying on your neighbors during the most interesting 85 minutes of their lives, as well as a sensitive look at what it's like to be 15 years old and have no control over anything."

RogerEbert.com," August 5, 2016",Sheila O'Malley," Little Men is extremely powerful in its own right, with its devotion to its characters' differing perspectives so refreshing in an increasingly black-and-white world."
Guardian," September 22, 2016",Peter Bradshaw, Little Men is composed with scrupulous observational intelligence and care. It is really engaging.
Movie Talk," September 22, 2016",Jason Best," Sachs indicates the boys' easy rapport with joyous travelling shots showing them breezing through the Brooklyn streets on scooter and roller-blades. By contrast, the relationship between the boys' parents is full of awkward friction. "

San Diego Reader," September 9, 2016",Scott Marks," Shoring together small moments from the lives of believable characters, in a manner free of special effects and fluky plotting, and with the same dramatic and visual gusto one would apply to an epic is what independent filmmaking should be all about."

Ozus' World Movie Reviews," September 6, 2016",Dennis Schwartz," A remarkable subdued kitchen sink drama, that resounds with touching realistic characters and awkward real-life situations."

"Deseret News, Salt Lake City"," September 2, 2016",Josh Terry, Little Men is the flip side of so many great coming-of-age films that bring their young protagonists into an awakened state via a rocky journey. Sometimes maturity and perspective comes at a cost that doesn't deliver a happy ending.
Mark Reviews Movies," September 2, 2016",Mark Dujsik," We can empathize with these people, because none of us is ever convinced that we might be the childish bad guy or the stubborn holdout or the inattentive neighbor..."
Philadelphia Inquirer," September 2, 2016",Steven Rea," As in the films of the French New Wave's Eric Rohmer, nothing cloying happens here, nothing plainly engineered to elicit emotions. But emotions are elicited - moral and ethical concerns are addressed, examined, defined."

Boston Globe," September 1, 2016",Ty Burr," Sachs doesn't push the tragic aspects of ""Little Men,"" but they're there, looming behind the life-goes-on vibe of the final scenes and waiting for you to work it out on the way home."

The Young Folks," August 31, 2016",Gary Shannon, Little Men is fleeting and generously introspective in its one hour and twenty-five minutes.
Blu-ray.com," August 31, 2016",Brian Orndorf," Led by terrific performances and a frightening understanding of passive-aggressive combat, ""Little Men"" is a modest drama with unexpectedly robust emotion."
Newcity," August 29, 2016",Ray Pride," Questions like, ""what is family?"" and ""what is money?"" are dramatized with delicate, elusive craft through the handiwork of craftspeople doing what they do best... lovely and hopeful, but shattering."
Reeling Reviews," August 26, 2016",Laura Clifford," Ira Sachs' latest, like his last, looks at how New York real estate affects a male couple...cinematographer Óscar Durán's overhead shot of the Jardines' neighborhood with Manhattan rising in the distance makes magical use of that elusive hour"

Irish Independent," September 27, 2016",Paul Whitington, There's a lot more to Ira Sachs' indie drama Little Men than initially meets the eye.
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," September 27, 2016",Hilary A White, Sachs's less-is-more directing style does make for some stunning moments between Jake and Tony where the mood crackles with a low-wattage hum.

Total Film," September 27, 2016",Kevin Harley," Greg Kinnear, Jennifer Ehle and Paulina García nail flawed adulthood, though young leads Theo Taplitz and Michael Barbieri steal the show."
Observer (UK)," September 25, 2016",Wendy Ide," Sachs's preoccupation with real estate may be a trifle bourgeois, but the films that result are finely tooled little gems."
The Arts Desk," September 23, 2016",Tom Birchenough," Little Men may have something of the scale of a novella rather than a full-blown drama, but its insight is considerable, its impact poignant and lasting."

Daily Telegraph (UK)," September 22, 2016",Tim Robey," Beguiling and sad but also a tough pill to swallow, it's about good people reluctantly competing for what they want, and how circumstances can be a friendship's best friend, but also its worst."
