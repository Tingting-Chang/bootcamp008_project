Financial Times," December 27, 2016",Nigel Andrews," What other filmmaker could create a tissue of metaphor, almost musical, from the hum of rotary objects?"
Times (UK)," October 10, 2016",Kate Muir," From the Thai arthouse director Apichatpong Weerasethakul, whose Uncle Boonmee won the Palme d'Or at Cannes a few years ago, comes another strange swooning dream, Cemetery of Splendour."
Cine Vértigo," August 23, 2016",Ernesto Diezmartinez," It's hard to keep your eyes open while watching a still frame of a group of sleeping men, but manages to accomplish truly magical moments. [Full review in Spanish]"
Correcámara," August 22, 2016",Hugo Lara, Not the best of Weerasethakul but definitely stands out and it's worth watching. [Full review in Spanish]
Cine Premiere," August 19, 2016",Alejandro Murillo, This film is so visually amazing that stimulates the audience's senses and imagination. [Full review in Spanish]
Total Film," August 15, 2016",Kevin Harley," Weerasethakul's radiant images, magical digressions and surprise knob gags keep things fresh and alert, anchored by a sense of sighing sorrow for personal/political traumas."
La Jornada," August 8, 2016",Carlos Bonfil, A film as gratifying as it's disturbing. [Full review in Spanish]
La Jornada," August 8, 2016",Leonardo Garcia Tsao, A film as interesting as it's lethargic. [Full review in Spanish]
Clarín," August 8, 2016",Gaspar Zimerman, A film full of magical realism. You either love it or hate it. [Full review in Spanish]

Seanax.com," July 16, 2016",Sean Axmaker, ... the world we live in and the world we dream are one and the same.
Antagony & Ecstasy," July 10, 2016",Tim Brayton," Calling the film supremely pleasurable and transfixing is undoubtedly selling it short, but as a first impression, it's absolutely enough."
SciFiNow," July 8, 2016",Katherine McLaughlin, Quietly powerful and curious film.
Brooklyn Magazine," June 28, 2016",Forrest Cardamenis," Apichatpong's unique breed of not-quite Magical Realism, then, enables his politics, rather than vice-versa. Even so, those who have trouble with Apichatpong's unusual formalism can grasp something more tangible this time around."
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," June 20, 2016",Hilary A White," Your mind is encouraged to put its feet up while watching Cemetery of Splendour. If you can do that, there is an ambience here that you'll gradually warm to. For many, however, it may prove too hard a sell."

The Arts Desk," June 17, 2016",Nick Hasted," Like most Weerasethakul films, it's both deeply rooted, and transcendent."
Sight and Sound," June 17, 2016",Tony Rayns," Apichatpong's singular method is by now familiar: he looks at present-day realities through a prism of personal and collective memories, refusing to distinguish between the everyday, dream-states and dark fantasies"
Radio Times," June 16, 2016",David Parkinson," It's possible to detect an allegorical discussion of Thailand's recent travails, but this distinctive blend of lyricism and mysticism is to be experienced as much as understood."
New Yorker," February 29, 2016",Richard Brody," Weerasethakul films the Thai landscape and village spaces, their tones of light and color, with a poised and painterly eye, keeping the camera still and the action quiet as if to invite elusive spirits to inhabit the image."
Willamette Week," February 24, 2016",Mike Gallucci," It's a beautiful hallucination, life and death nestled in the wonders of nature. "
The Film Stage," February 22, 2016",Nick Newman, [Apichatpong Weerasethakul's] latest film is as enveloping as anything he's ever made.
Chicago Reader," January 28, 2016",J. R. Jones," Calm and quiet, but nicely paced."
TheFilmFile.com," January 24, 2016",Dustin Putman," [Sundance 2016] Heady but not self-serious, the beautifully strange ""Cemetery of Splendor"" holds a welcome lightness and humor alongside its thematic pathos."
The Age (Australia)," January 22, 2016",Philippa Hawker," It is characteristically slow and measured, combining a profound sense of melancholy with a light touch, blurring the boundaries between waking and sleeping, dream and memory, past and present in the most relaxed, quotidian way."
FILMINK (Australia)," January 14, 2016",Thomas Derwin," Both a film of resistance and an openly escapist experience, Cemetery of Splendour envelops you in immediate reverie, pulling you in with its quiet rhythms and cadences."
Madison Movie," November 18, 2015",Rob Thomas," The placid, normal-seeming exterior seems appropriate for a film that is about digging beneath the layers, digging to the past, digging to the subterranean heart of ourselves."
Variety," July 20, 2015",Justin Chang, The latest gently hypnotic cinematic enigma from the Thai writer-director Apichatpong Weerasethakul.
Metro," March 4, 2016",Matt Prigge," The strange and unusual are presented as normal, and we're begged to accept a world where the fantastical really can happen - where life really is bigger and more amazing than what's in front of us."
BuzzFeed News," March 4, 2016",Alison Willmore," The languidly paced movie requires some surrendering to, but it's well worth it."
NPR," March 4, 2016",Ella Taylor," It's almost boring, until you give yourself over to the long, atmospherically still takes that cover every scene. The mood is serene, with an undertow of sadness."
Movie Mezzanine," March 4, 2016",Vikram Murthi, Cemetery of Splendour is too multifaceted a film to force viewers to ascribe to a single interpretation. 
RogerEbert.com," March 4, 2016",Sheila O'Malley," Within its structure lies multiple intersecting and contradicting arcs of meaning, none of which cancel each other out but instead create a vast pool of associations."
New York Times," March 3, 2016",Glenn Kenny," There's a cultural specificity to this movie that will make it, for Western audiences, even more enigmatic than it is in its Thai context. This ought not be a stumbling block, though."
Film Comment Magazine," March 3, 2016",Jonathan Romney," It's sweet, simple, potent theatrical magic-but it all signals, as so much does in the film, how much the past is visible in Thailand's present, and how much is invisible unless we're willing to look."
Film Journal International," March 3, 2016",David Noh, The latest film by Apichatpong Weerasethakul will inspire both rapture in his avidly devoted claque and boredom in the less patient.
AV Club," March 3, 2016",A.A. Dowd, The film succeeds in attuning its audience to a quieter way of life ...
Village Voice," March 1, 2016",Melissa Anderson," As is his custom, Weerasethakul addresses his nation's martial history with the lightest of touches."
Screen International," February 29, 2016",Allan Hunter, There is the notion that any individual or country can awaken from the darkness of its past.

CineVue," February 29, 2016",John Bleasdale, Asking what it all means is laughably irrelevant and Weerasethakul's Cemetery of Splendour teeters occasionally on the ephemeral even as its subject is the ephemeral nature of reality.
Daily Telegraph (UK)," February 29, 2016",Robbie Collin," This is the same wondrous journey on which Apichatpong sends his audience: inwards and downwards, to a place where the simplest rhythms of everyday life become hallowed and mythic."
Guardian," February 29, 2016",Peter Bradshaw," Jen's own loneliness and gentle spirituality are deeply affecting. It is such a strange film in its way, stranger still if you are not accustomed to Weerasethakul's work, and it needs a real investment of attention. But there is something sublime in it."
Time Out," February 29, 2016",David Ehrlich, Cemetery of Splendour is a whisper of a film that can only cast its spell if you let your breathing slow and give yourself over to the urgency of its spectral dimension.
The Playlist," February 29, 2016",Jessica Kiang," If you are susceptible and trusting enough to let the film gently occupy you, you will have something glorious and quiet to keep for yourself. Just please, for the love of all things holy, of which this film may very well be one, see it in a cinema."
Slant Magazine," February 29, 2016",James Lattimer," Weerasethakul's films have always been marked by their great tenderness, unobtrusive rigor, and desire to splice the straightforward with the cryptic, with Cemetery of Splendor one of the purest, most focused expressions of these concerns. "
Paste Magazine," February 29, 2016",Tim Grierson, To watch Cemetery of Splendor is to witness one of our finest filmmakers putting a spell on us. I can't say what everything in this elliptical movie means. But I sure know how it feels -- and it feels astonishing.
Newcity," February 29, 2016",Ray Pride," The cinematography by Diego García enhances the offhand lyricism of this lovely, memory-steeped meditation."

Little White Lies," June 14, 2016",Vadim Rizov, A vital addition to a cogent body of work.
The List," June 13, 2016",Allan Hunter, History is everywhere in a typically cryptic and melancholy tale from director Apichatpong Weerasethakul that may still be his most accessible work to date.
The Skinny," June 1, 2016",Philip Concannon," If Cemetery of Splendour is to be the last film Apichatpong makes in Thailand, he is saying goodbye with a masterpiece."
Winnipeg Free Press," May 27, 2016",Alison Gillmor," If you give in to Cemetery of Splendour's slow, dreamy, dozy vision, you might end with a wide-awake cinematic jolt."
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," April 14, 2016",Josef Braun," A haunting, visionary work, balancing tremendous tenderness with quiet rage at governing powers seeking to silence dissent and bury great swathes of history."
Sensacine," April 12, 2016",Violeta Kovacsics, Cemetery of Splendour is a film that amazes us with few resources. [Full review in Spanish]
San Diego Reader," April 7, 2016",Scott Marks," Given the cultural boundaries, there is much in the film that we may never fully grasp, but the less we're told, the more were sucked in by the film's hypnotic, ever-expanding aura of mystery."
Georgia Straight," March 30, 2016",Ken Eisner," The cleverly made Cemetery is packed with so much wry humour, gentle mystery, and strange beauty almost anyone would enjoy spending some time there. Some."
In These Times," March 30, 2016",Michael Atkinson," A poetic tissue of tropical moments, haunted by the irrepressible past."
San Francisco Chronicle," March 23, 2016",G. Allen Johnson," If you haven't seen a Weerasethakul film yet, here's a good opportunity, but leave your expectations at the door. There's no one like him."
"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," March 18, 2016",Robert Horton," If there's such a thing as a party movie, then there is surely its opposite -- the kind of picture that lulls you into a meditative state."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," March 17, 2016",Colin Covert, The point seems to be a sort of symbolic political wake-up call for a nation where modern life takes a very long time to arrive.
Seattle Times," March 17, 2016",John Hartl, The actors seem to be miles from the cameras.
Cinema em Cena," March 15, 2016",Pablo Villaça, I'm starting to believe Weerasethakul is pranking us all. [Full review in Portuguese.]

Globe and Mail," March 11, 2016",Julia Cooper, An enchanting interpretation of where our sleeping and waking minds wander.
Los Angeles Times," March 10, 2016",Sheri Linden," It's a sinuous tale shaped by the writer-director's favorite motifs - animism and medicine - and by sideways glances at the myths, religious traditions and political convulsions of his native Thailand."
Toronto Star," March 10, 2016",Peter Howell," Ghosts, dreams, regrets - they all mingle in this artful trance: ""The most brilliant are those who are focused."""
NOW Toronto," March 9, 2016",Norman Wilner, Apichatpong's latest venture into low-key magic realism is pleasurable but familiar.
