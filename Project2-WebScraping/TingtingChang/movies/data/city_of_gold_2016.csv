MetroActive," December 31, 2016",Richard von Busack," An unalloyed success, this documentary makes the city and its subject one."
Austin American-Statesman," December 27, 2016",Matthew Odam," City of Gold' is a sweet and charming portrait of a talented man with a big appetite -- for food, for people, for Los Angeles."
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," August 26, 2016",Philip Martin, While the documentary occasionally verges on hagiography... it doesn't irritate... It's just a nice movie about a nice man 
Combustible Celluloid," July 1, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," It's really a documentary about journalism and eating, and truly appreciating both words and food. "
New Zealand Herald," May 26, 2016",Peter Calder," Be warned: if you go on an empty stomach, you will certainly not last the distance."
East Bay Express," April 29, 2016",Kelly Vance, It's obviously fun being Gold.
Spirituality and Practice," April 20, 2016",Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, An impressive documentary about a Pulitzer-Prize-winning food critic who loves Los Angeles and its diversity of restaurants.
Austin Chronicle," April 14, 2016",Kimberley Jones," The film's final shots of Gold in his truck, negotiating Los Angeles traffic at sunset - ""magic hour,"" in La La Land's dreamy lingo - drive home the film's raison d'Ãªtre: as an ode to the city, and to its most lyrical chronicler."
Las Vegas Weekly," April 13, 2016",Josh Bell," While the movie may overstate Gold's brilliance, it's still a relatively entertaining look at the world of food and food criticism."
"Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)"," April 12, 2016",Ken Hanke," So much of the food and its unassuming nature -- and especially Gold's enthusiasm for it -- is, like the film itself, very appealing indeed."
Cinemalogue.com," April 1, 2016",Todd Jorgenson," Although there might be a few too many items on its menu, this mouth-watering documentary uses the food culture of Los Angeles to celebrate the city's diversity."
Salt Lake Tribune," April 1, 2016",Sean P. Means," Laura Gabbert's sweet, soulful documentary City of Gold is simultaneously an endearing portrait of food critic Jonathan Gold and a valentine to his home city, Los Angeles."
Arts Fuse," April 1, 2016",Gerald Peary," The really unforgivable thing about City of Gold: the dull, flat way in which the food is shown."
Globe and Mail," April 1, 2016",Calum Marsh," Gabbert's film is part portrait, part city symphony. It celebrates Gold as a fixture of his native Los Angeles and L.A. as in thrall to its stalwart guide."
Detroit News," April 1, 2016",Adam Graham," There's an honesty in what Gold writes and the way he writes it, which is why his words have so much impact. The film has a similar impact to one of his reviews."
National Post," March 31, 2016",Chris Knight," Toronto audiences may be too far removed to get much from Gold's Pulitzer Prize-winning taco panegyrics, but the film still works as an examination of the role of the critic in the age of Yelp."
NUVO Newsweekly," March 31, 2016",Edward Johnson-Ott," If you opt to see the film, and you should, I suggest you grab a bite before, or make plans to grab one right after, because this is certainly going to make you hungry."
NOW Toronto," March 30, 2016",Susan G. Cole," It's kinda fun going along with Gold while he makes his way to apparently nondescript malls to eat dishes from remote areas of China, Mexico and Korea. And he definitely does love his city."
Philadelphia Inquirer," March 25, 2016",Molly Eichel," It's a documentary that is ostensibly a profile of a man, but is really about the vibrant city he inhabits, beyond the Hollywood sheen and the grit of Compton."
Reeling Reviews," March 24, 2016",Robin Clifford," ""City of Gold"" is a love poem to the Los Angeles food scene and to the man who made it his mission...to eat."
Wall Street Journal," March 10, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," The film is up to its subject, which is saying a lot. Why would you pass up an introduction to a food writer who is on the case as soon as a tweet alerts him to a promising new taco from a taco truck?"
TIME Magazine," March 10, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek, Gold shows us that the real work of a writer happens far from the keyboard: mostly it involves being alive to the world around us. But there's no reason to set out on an empty stomach.
New York Times," March 10, 2016",A.O. Scott," ""City of Gold"" transcends its modest methods, largely because it connects Mr. Gold's appealing personality with a passionate argument about the civic culture of Los Angeles and the place of food within it."
The Film Stage," March 9, 2016",Jacob Oller," Simultaneously a vibrant, colorful love letter to the unsung parts of Los Angeles, a populist philosophy of food and culture, and a thesis on what criticism should be."
Village Voice," March 8, 2016",Amy Nicholson," Gold is merely the conduit for the film's real focus: Like his own reviews, City of Gold is a love letter to L.A. "
indieWire," March 8, 2016",Ibad Shah, The film is an agreeable document of cultural processing that should especially appeal to the niche crowd at its center - it's more or less mandatory viewing for L.A. foodies. 
The Playlist," March 8, 2016",Kimber Myers," Gold's enthusiasm is infectious, and the film never lacks energy, passion or humor. "
Hollywood Reporter," March 8, 2016",Todd McCarthy, Accessible and informative.
TheWrap," March 8, 2016",Inkoo Kang," Filmmaker Laura Gabbert's love letter to the Pulitzer-winning food critic, and the city of Los Angeles, is hyper-palatable yet unconvincing."
Metro," March 8, 2016",Matt Prigge," Less a documentary version of 'Babette's Feast' than an old-fashioned city symphony, and to a city often wholly misrepresented by the movies."
Compuserve," March 7, 2016",Harvey S. Karten," This doc is like a loving commentary on the value of immigrants, who have made Los Angeles not just the city of movies but of food as well."
Slant Magazine," March 7, 2016",Oleg Ivanov, The film affectively defends food critic Jonathan Gold's assertion that it's ultimately cooking that makes us human.
4:3," March 2, 2016",Conor Bateman," For some, City of Gold might just seem like an interesting and intimate distraction, but for others, it will appear as a powerful love letter to the art of discovery. "
Urban Cinefile," February 16, 2016",Andrew L. Urban," Getting a Pulitzer Prize for restaurant criticism must attract our attention, and Jonathan Gold's enthusiasm coupled with his eye (and palate) for places off the beaten food critics track kinda explain the prize"
Variety," January 17, 2016",Dennis Harvey, A flavorsome documentary appreciation of the first Pulitzer-awarded food critic's culturally adventuresome palate.
Boston Globe," March 24, 2016",Devra First," It's a neat little bit of hagiography, dwelling fondly on his quirks, but that's OK. For people who want to taste the world, Gold is a patron saint."
Washington Post," March 24, 2016",Maura Judkis, A colorful and loving tribute to the kinds of restaurants that food critics once ignored - and a few fancy places as well.
Minneapolis Star Tribune," March 24, 2016",Colin Covert, Why make a film about this lucky guy? Gold is a philosopher and cultural critic as much as a gourmet.
Arizona Republic," March 24, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," As cultural archaeology, unearthing the relationship between food and a city, food and a critic, a city and a critic and a swirling stew of all the above, it's fantastic."
Seattle Times," March 24, 2016",Bethany Jean Clement," While the film's formula gets repetitive, little revelations peppered throughout keep it engaging."
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," March 24, 2016",Cary Darling," City of Gold then comes off as something of a puff piece. But when snatches of his poetic reviews are read in voiceover, it's clear that at least some of that puffery is well deserved."
San Diego Union-Tribune," March 24, 2016",Anders Wright," Gold's writing sparkles much like his namesake, and often reading it is as delicious as some of the dishes he samples. Gabbert's new movie is a tasty morsel in and of itself."
SF Weekly," March 23, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," City of Gold isn't quite as mouth-watering as other recent foodie documentaries such as The Search for General Tso or Deli Man, which may speak more to this writer's own palate than anything else."
San Diego Reader," March 23, 2016",Matthew Lickona," A pure and pleasant celebration of the man and his work, the latter of which achieves something approaching anthropological profundity by its humble, loving attention to culinary detail."
San Francisco Chronicle," March 23, 2016",Peter Hartlaub, It's a pleasing and informative ride-along with a subject whose passions have coincided with the truth.
Nonfics," March 21, 2016",Christopher Campbell," It may only offer an illusion of understanding its subjects, but it suggests that Gabberts has full comprehension, which may also be an illusion but is good enough either way."
The Atlantic," March 21, 2016",Sophie Gilbert," As Gabbert follows Gold from hot-dog stand to strip-mall restaurant to a meeting at Momofuku, what becomes clear is that she's using him as a lens to expose the richness of American culture."
L.A. Biz," March 17, 2016",Annlee Ellingson," Gold's decades of writing on LA's food scene are as much a story of immigration and the American dream as they are tacos and curry - and they'll make you very, very hungry."
AV Club," March 17, 2016",Noel Murray," City Of Gold takes something of a once-over-lightly approach to Gold's life, sprinkling little bits of his biography throughout ..."
Newcity," March 16, 2016",Ray Pride," Affably unpretentious but always grandly informed, Gold opines and divines his way across a complex city that he explores in unique and exemplary fashion. All critics should know their beat so well, and love it truly. Plus, tacos. "
Movie Mezzanine," March 11, 2016",Mallory Andrews," As a film, City of Gold is unfocused and lacks cohesive structure."
RogerEbert.com," March 11, 2016",Godfrey Cheshire," ""City of Gold"" offers no evidence of Gold ever penning a negative review. This is why it ultimately comes off more as a cinematic puff piece than a ""real"" documentary."
Chicago Tribune," March 11, 2016",Michael Phillips," A tasty primer on the man, the eater, the critic and the city."
Time Out," March 10, 2016",Christina Izzo," What it lacks in cohesion, City of Gold makes up for in its subject's wit and wisdom."
Rolling Stone," March 10, 2016",Peter Travers," In search of fresh culinary treasures, Gold travels the hidden corners of a too-familiar city and we get to fall in love with L.A. again. "
