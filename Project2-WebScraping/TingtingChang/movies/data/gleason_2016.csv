Reeling Reviews," August 4, 2016",Laura Clifford," ""Gleason"" tells an incredible tale of a family struggling through the inconceivable, frequently even with humor, but the marriage at its heart faces troubling, less explored, consequences."
Washington Post," August 4, 2016",Pat Padua," ""Gleason"" portrays great strength and great suffering in equal measure, lending vivid credence to tired platitudes about what it means to live life to the fullest."

Arizona Republic," August 4, 2016",Randy Cordova," A lot of sports-themed films put a heroic, inspirational spin on the proceedings. You cheer, shed a few tears, and move on. That's so not ""Gleason."""
Common Sense Media," August 1, 2016",Sandie Angulo Chen, Emotional docu's powerful story outweighs strong language. 
Paste Magazine," August 1, 2016",Andy Crump," You'll walk away from the film with optimism in mind, and that's very much by design. Gleason ends on higher notes, the better to send us out of the theater convinced we have seen something wholly uplifting."
Little White Lies," August 1, 2016",Spencer Moleda, As inspiring as it is devastating.
Rolling Stone," July 29, 2016",Peter Travers, Tweel has crafted a film that goes beyond the facts of Gleason's football life. It promotes an awareness of ALS that trumps any well-intended ice-bucket challenge - and ranks as a profound achievement.

New York Times," July 28, 2016",Glenn Kenny," While the director's vision never strays too far from the positive message that he and the Gleasons doubtlessly wish to impart, the movie winds up being most effective at doing what cinema cannot avoid doing."
Los Angeles Times," July 28, 2016",Sheri Linden," If this film portrait stirs deep emotions, they spring from a breathtakingly unsentimental embrace of life at its most challenging."
SF Weekly," July 28, 2016",Jeffrey Edalatpour," It's astonishing to watch a dying man plead for the sanctity of his spiritual life. All of his embarrassing bodily functions are on display, but nothing feels more intimate than having dominion over your own soul."
Wall Street Journal," July 28, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," ""Gleason"" is so powerful in its cumulative effect that it should be accompanied by a consumer advisory-something along the lines of ""This documentary may cause sudden alterations of mood and attitude."""
Entertainment Weekly," July 28, 2016",Devan Coggan, The result is a candid testament to not only Gleason himself but the many people who love him.
The Film Stage," July 28, 2016",Dan Schindel, There's something off-putting about such aggressive inspiration.

Metro," July 27, 2016",Matt Prigge, It's easy to read this as a triumph-of-the-human-spirit jag or even a stranger-than-fiction tall tale. But it runs deeper than that. 
Washington City Paper," January 2, 2017",Tricia Olszewski," Gleason, needless to say, is not an easy sit."

Cinema Crazed," December 1, 2016",Phil Hall, A moving portrait of a brave man's struggle against ALS.
NOW Toronto," August 18, 2016",Radheyan Simonpillai," The videos are a way for Gleason to say everything he can to his baby boy before time runs out. That's enough to leave you a blubbering mess, but this doc, culled from home videos by director Clay Tweel, goes much further. "
Minneapolis Star Tribune," August 18, 2016",Colin Covert," An intimate, deeply moving film."
St. Paul Pioneer Press," August 18, 2016",Chris Hewitt (St. Paul)," The gift of ""Gleason"" to moviegoers is that it depicts people who know they don't have all the answers and who are trying to figure them out in front of our eyes."
Movie Nation," August 16, 2016",Roger Moore, Refreshing in its intimacy and the way it strips the halo off of noble suffering. 
Under the Radar," August 15, 2016",Austin Trunick, [Steve] and Michel's perseverance [is] inspiring ... their capability to think of others at their own time of greatest need that make them such compelling subjects.
National Post," August 12, 2016",Tina Hassannia," This is a brutally honest look at ALS at every stage of the way, and thus becomes a fairly illuminating and heart-wrenching story."
Reel Film Reviews," August 12, 2016",David Nusair, One of the most moving and flat-out heartbreaking documentaries ever made...

Mark Reviews Movies," August 5, 2016",Mark Dujsik, [T]he film is inspiring in a way that few films are.
Consequence of Sound," August 4, 2016",Blake Goble," Gleason is very much an inspirational and difficult true sports tale. But there's something skeptically melodramatic about the doc at times; it's a strange negotiation of the nature of what's ""genuine"" in a documentary."
Chicago Reader," August 4, 2016",J. R. Jones," As Gleason's physical condition worsens, the documentary becomes a harrowing study in marital devotion, capturing him and his loyal wife, Michel Varisco, in a series of increasingly bleak moments together."
Boston Globe," August 4, 2016",Peter Keough," ""Gleason"" immerses the viewer in the ordeal of incurable illness. Not just that of the sufferer, but of family, friends, and loved ones as well, because, as these films make clear, such misfortunes are not just personal, but communal."
Village Voice," July 27, 2016",Bilge Ebiri," There are moments of such raw, intimate anguish in this film that you can't help but turn away."
TheWrap," July 26, 2016",Michael Nordine," Tweel's approach is no-frills, with much of the footage having been shot by Gleason and his wife Michel. This is wise: The story itself is so wrenching that any attempt to gussy it up would run the risk of feeling overwrought, even manipulative."
Times-Picayune," July 26, 2016",Mike Scott, A powerful and inspiring portrait of unbowed strength and courage in the face of great adversity. Must-see cinema for anyone in need of a psychic pick-me-up.

Hollywood Reporter," July 19, 2016",John DeFore," Having followed [Gleason] from the start, we can't help but see the active mind inside that body, one full of love for his family and determination to stay with them as long as he can."
