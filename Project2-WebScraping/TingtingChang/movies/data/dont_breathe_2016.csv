Seven Days," January 1, 2017",Rick Kisonak, Easily one of the most assured and immersive horror films in recent memory.
Columbus Alive," December 31, 2016",Brad Keefe, Those underdeveloped characters become more of a problem when the plot starts to run into the realm of the indestructible bad guy and a shocking twist I found lazy and in poor taste (even in this realm).
Hindustan Times," December 31, 2016",Rashid Irani, Even the recurring passages of pin-drop silence generate edge-of-the-seat dread.
Total Film," December 28, 2016",Jordan Farley," A suspenseful game of cat-and-mouse develops where a creaky floorboard is the difference between life and death. Lang makes an intimidating antagonist, but a silly final act ends things on a sour note."
3AW," December 26, 2016",Jim Schembri," Terrific, taut, dry-throated thriller..."
Film Ireland Magazine," December 14, 2016",Sarah Griffin, It's a decent piece of schlock suspense with enough thrills to shake the popcorn out of the box.
Japan Times," December 14, 2016",Kaori Shoji," Clocking in at just under 90 minutes, Don't Breathe keeps the terror going until the very end, but it takes a lot of liberties with credibility, even for the genre."
ChaseWhale.com," December 11, 2016",Chase Whale, The best and most violent in the HOME ALONE series. 
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 8, 2016",Tim Brayton, 'Tis pity that such a well-honed thriller should take place around such a vacuous center.

LarsenOnFilm," December 2, 2016",Josh Larsen, ...relies on some outlandish plot twists to amp up the ickiness.
Tampa Bay Times," November 29, 2016",Jimmy Geurts," Don't Breathe mines much of its tension from its claustrophobic setting, with doors closed and dogs released on the intruders. (It also recalls indie horror It Follows in its desolate Detroit location.)"
Cinema Crazed," November 29, 2016",Felix Vasquez Jr.," Works wonders with claustrophobia, tension, startling action, and in taking the home invasion film and giving it a unique twist."
The Blu Spot," November 29, 2016",Jeff Beck," Don't Breathe shows once again that Alvarez is a competent filmmaker when it comes to directing, but thanks to a script riddled with plotholes and idiotic characters, it's clear that he and Sayagues still have a lot of work to do when it comes to writing."

Film Journal International," March 28, 2016",Rebecca Pahle," Simple, brutal and intense."
indieWire," March 16, 2016",Eric Kohn," The ending leaves room for a sequel, but it's not just a half-baked teaser. As with all strong horror stories, the conclusion of one dangerous scenario feeds the fear of more to come."
We Got This Covered," March 15, 2016",Matt Donato," Don't Breathe is a punch to the face, delivering everything you deem tense and thrilling. It's an adrenaline shot of genre-bending ferocity."
The Playlist," March 15, 2016",Charlie Schmidlin, Don't Breathe indeed reaches a unique destination in horror filmmaking. Unfortunately it fails to deliver a worthy emotional hook to pin its savagery onto.
Hollywood Reporter," March 15, 2016",John DeFore," A trapped-in-a-house thriller pitting thieves against an unexpectedly resourceful victim, the lean and mean pic offers scares aplenty and at least a couple of game-changing twists."
Daily Dead," March 15, 2016",Heather Wixson," It's nice to see [Alvarez] flex his filmmaking muscles a bit more independently, and I do hope this is only the start of his very promising career as a genre director because Don't Breathe is an amazing sophomore effort."
Consequence of Sound," March 15, 2016",Marten Carlson," Alvarez's Evil Dead left many wondering what this visually talented director would do next. Inconsistent and offensive, Don't Breathe is not the follow-up many will have wanted."

Arizona Republic," August 25, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," A nice little mix tape of a horror movie, incorporating elements of familiar films into something satisfyingly different."
Entertainment Weekly," August 25, 2016",Christian Holub," Alvarez appears to have consciously toned down the gore from his blood-saturated Evil Dead remake, trusting unnerving visuals and foreshadowing what terrors are about to unfold."
Charlotte Observer," August 25, 2016",Lawrence Toppman," Lang, snorting and enormous and bestial, seems like the Minotaur stalking intruders in his deadly labyrinth. For the first hour, the psychological cruelty far outweighs the physical."
AV Club," August 25, 2016",A.A. Dowd, It leaves the audience in the same place as the characters: gasping for air.
Las Vegas Weekly," August 24, 2016",Josh Bell," What started as an intense, gripping thriller becomes a ridiculous cartoon."
Guardian," August 24, 2016",Jordan Hoffman," While its script could have been written on the back of an envelope, its editing and use of sound design is a triumph."

Village Voice," August 24, 2016",Alan Scherstuhl," The script, by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues, steadily and inventively heightens the tension of the break-in and the inevitable hiding and chasing, at least until everything gets ridiculous toward the end."
Movie Nation," August 24, 2016",Roger Moore," What happens on the screen spreads to the audience. The silence, like the fear, is contagious."
Tribune News Service," August 23, 2016",Katie Walsh," While the sight-based conceit offers the opportunity for clever suspense and scares, it's the starkly realistic setting and all too newsworthy themes underpinning the spooky tale that makes the horror of this film so bone-chilling. "
Metro," August 22, 2016",Matt Prigge, Director Fede Alvarez is a pro at creating tension with nothing more than sound effects and shots that constantly have us thinking of what's outside the frame.
Slant Magazine," August 21, 2016",Ed Gonzalez, Don't Breathe's sustainment of its corkscrew tension is so elegant and methodical as to feel dance-like.
The Young Folks," August 20, 2016",Michael Fairbanks," While it is definitely time for Alvarez to stretch beyond his brand of housebound horror, he just may be the current master of it."
Empire Magazine," August 18, 2016",Kim Newman," An intense, streamlined exercise in gruesome thrills, with a tiny glimmer of social context (it's all about the economy) which doesn't take away from the exciting struggle to get out of this house of horrors."
New York Daily News," August 16, 2016",Edward Douglas," The type of edge-of-your seat thrills promised by its commercials, but also takes you into far darker territory than anticipated."

New York Post," August 25, 2016",Kyle Smith," Apart from its thin characters and occasional trite moments, as well as a silly attempt to set up a sequel, ""Don't Breathe"" is just about perfect."
Kansas City Star," August 25, 2016",Jon Niccum, How refreshing to see fight scenes that pivot on panicked opportunism rather than martial arts skills or mutant powers.
TheWrap," August 25, 2016",Michael Nordine," So inventive for its first hour, Don't Breathe strains credulity the longer this goes on. By the time the credits roll, you might find yourself breathing a sigh of relief for all the wrong reasons."
Collider," August 25, 2016",Matt Goldberg," There's nothing wrong with crafting a thrill ride, but Alvarez' 'Don't Breathe' eventually goes off the rails as it veers from the exhilarating to the revolting."

Chicago Sun-Times," August 25, 2016",Richard Roeper," In what is shaping up to a banner year for scary movies, this is another solid and memorable entry."
Boston Globe," August 25, 2016",Tom Russo, Alvarez serves up some jaw-droppingly tasteless third-act twists to ensure this all sticks. And that's his big mistake.
Los Angeles Times," August 25, 2016",Justin Chang," A devious and demonstrative piece of home-invasion mischief that also leans heavily, and ingeniously, on blindness as a crucial plot device."
Toronto Star," August 25, 2016",Peter Howell, This is a movie where every jump scare is worthy of a shriek.
Den of Geek," August 25, 2016",David Crow," Intriguingly, Don't Breathe plays with the kind of moral relativism that escapes most studio pictures."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," August 25, 2016",Colin Covert," Fast-paced, coherent and continually gut-wrenching, this home invasion thriller begins with a gambit that pays off handsomely: making the villains redeemable and their victim monstrous."

Austin Chronicle," August 25, 2016",Marjorie Baumgarten," More methodical than innovative, Don't Breathe is nevertheless an effective suspenser."
CinemaBlend.com," August 25, 2016",Conner Schwerdtfeger," Taps into our deepest, darkest fears, and offers us a bloody, instant horror classic that's not for the faint of heart."
Washington Post," August 25, 2016",Pat Padua," Alvarez, who directed the 2010 remake of Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead,"" effectively sets up a brutal cat-and-mouse game; the problem is that sometimes you don't know who to root for."
Bullz-Eye.com," August 25, 2016",David Medsker," It's a very effective '90s throwback thriller, where a broken man is robbed by a group of morally bankrupt kids. Have fun deciding which side are heroes and which side are villains."
RogerEbert.com," August 25, 2016",Brian Tallerico, The kind of morality play that toys with audience loyalty and conveys its protagonists' predicament by making us feel claustrophobic right alongside them.

National Post," August 25, 2016",Calum Marsh," Our heroes are compelled to spend so much time skulking around the house quietly that whenever one of them do make a noise, often stupidly, the entire audience groans in unison, as if they're blurting out, ""Hey, blind man, I'm over here!"" "
Associated Press," August 25, 2016",Mark Kennedy," Robbery crews are strongly advised to avoid 1837 Buena Vista, but moviegoers hoping for a thrill might like to visit. But don't linger."
MTV," August 25, 2016",Amy Nicholson," Alvarez knows the size of his ambitions. He's written one great ghoul, surrounded him with targets, and simply let him let rip."
Chicago Reader," August 25, 2016",J. R. Jones," Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues keep the plot twists coming, though as they accumulate the story begins to feel like a confection, succeeding not through any fresh idea but through the stubborn recombination of a few stale ones. "
The Verge," August 25, 2016",Tasha Robinson," Don't Breathe is still a thrilling experience that effectively puts the audience in the protagonists' place: uncertain, cringing, afraid to even breathe because of the potential consequences."
Salt Lake Tribune," August 25, 2016",Sean P. Means, Don't Breathe is almost a throwback to older horror films. It's meticulously planned and thrillingly satisfying with a camera always a step ahead.
New York Times," August 25, 2016",Anita Gates," It will probably please fans of this simple genre with its solid suspense, murky lighting and ""gotcha!"" scares."
Philadelphia Inquirer," August 25, 2016",Tirdad Derakhshani," One of the most suspenseful, terrifying, and devilishly original horror pics in recent memory."
Reeling Reviews," August 25, 2016",Laura Clifford," Alvarez knows how to build tension, but unfortunately he leans on narrative laziness to accomplish it, threats appearing with no explanation of how they've worked themselves out of their last predicament. "
SciFiNow," August 25, 2016",Abigail Chandler," This is a tight, tense horror with very little gore on show, relying on suspense to keep the audience on tenterhooks. Expect to see a lot more from Alvarez in future."
Rolling Stone," August 25, 2016",Peter Travers," This is some weird, twisted s--t. Don't groan when I say Don't Breathe is a home-invasion thriller. Director Fede Alvarez is as good as it gets when it comes to playing with things that go bump in the night."
Uproxx," August 25, 2016",Scott Tobias," Great horror films are feats of direction: Scoff all you like about teenagers getting thrashed by a blind war vet, but it's Alvarez who gets the last laugh."
Portland Mercury," August 25, 2016",Andrew Wright," [Stephen Lang] delivers a Pantheon boogeyman here, conveying with every thought and gesture that this is absolutely not a man with whom to screw. This movie should be played loud."
Las Vegas Review-Journal," August 25, 2016",Christopher Lawrence," If you're looking for straight-up blood, guts and gore horror, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you're just in the mood for a shockingly good time, don't miss ""Don't Breathe."
Playboy Online," August 25, 2016",Stephen Rebello, It's a sharp and savvy thriller for an age in which more than half of Americans seem to feel less secure than ever -- a fear that politicians tend to stoke despite violent crime and violence being down significantly since the '90s.
Mark Reviews Movies," August 25, 2016",Mark Dujsik," [A]n elaborately staged, finely choreographed game of cat and mouse..."
One Guy's Opinion," August 25, 2016",Frank Swietek," [Though] Alvarez proves an adept stager and arranger of calculated shock effects...the script isn't concerned with even an iota of logic, but merely with generating one more empty jolt."
Blu-ray.com," August 25, 2016",Brian Orndorf," ""Don't Breathe"" is simple, but blessedly so, focusing on the procurement of horror and suspense, wasting little of the picture on nonsense."
EricDSnider.com," August 25, 2016",Eric D. Snider," Satisfying, meat-and-potatoes horror that takes a simple premise, adds a couple of flourishes, makes the most of it for 85 minutes, then gets out before it can overstay its welcome."
Common Sense Media," August 26, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," The first three-quarters of this simple, intense thriller are something close to masterful -- and then it goes a little too over the top, with an outlandish reveal and elements of torture and gore. "
"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," August 26, 2016",Robert Horton, Slick and nasty in a way that prevents it from being pure escapist fun.
Showbiz Junkies," August 26, 2016",Rebecca Murray, (Fede) Alvarez uses lengthy stretches of silence to heighten the tension and draw the audience into the hunt.
ABC Tucson," August 26, 2016",Phil Villarreal, You may walk away with a scarred psyche and enough nightmare material to stock your subconscious up through the winter.

Alt Film Guide," August 26, 2016",Tim Cogshell," Horror filmmaker Fede Alvarez avoids the fate of the sophomore curse with his second feature film, Don't Breathe, which establishes the director as the real deal when it comes to horror and thrills... and horror."
We Live Entertainment," August 25, 2016",Fred Topel, It takes a turn so unpleasant it goes from being mediocre to just plain gross.
NYC Movie Guru," August 25, 2016",Avi Offer, A very ordinary horror thriller without any shocking twists or surprises. If only the screenplay were half as clever and imaginative as the sound and visual design!
Tri-City Herald," August 25, 2016",Gary Wolcott," Won't have you holding your breath. It has a villain unique enough to separate it from others of its ilk. BTW, the less you know about it before buying a ticket, the better. "
TheFrightFile.com," August 25, 2016",Dustin Putman," Ceaseless in its nail-biting tension and only becoming more breathlessly savage as it goes, ""Don't Breathe"" shreds one's nerves and leaves them for dead. It's easily one of the smartest, most riveting thrillers of the year."
Your Movies (cleveland.com)," August 25, 2016",John Urbancich," 'Don't Breathe' might be the creepiest movie of the year, and that's saying something after the very good ""Green Room"" and ""The Conjuring 2"" both spooked us out earlier."
Lyles' Movie Files," August 25, 2016",Jeffrey Lyles," Hits all the marks of a classic. Count on a steady dose of nervous laughter and a sense of dread. And remember the title is a warning for the characters, not the audience. "

FilmsInReview.com," August 25, 2016",Victoria Alexander, Terrific and unsettling horror-thriller. Alvarez is using film to explore his fetishes and he's doing a great job.
Austin American-Statesman," August 25, 2016",Joe Gross," Don't Breathe does a solid job of dispensing with dialogue in favor of driving the plot via strong, claustrophobic images as the camera snakes in and out of underlit rooms."
Film School Rejects," August 29, 2016",Rob Hunter, A smart and twisted breath of fresh air for a sub-genre at risk of growing stale.

Miami Herald," August 26, 2016",Rene Rodriguez," You start out fearing ""Don't Breathe,"" but by the end you're laughing at it - and the humor is not intentional. "

ScreenRant," August 26, 2016",Ben Kendrick," Don't Breathe cuts a fresh path, providing thrill-seeking moviegoers and horror die-hards with an inventive as well as terrifying movie experience."
Reel Reviews," August 26, 2016",Frank Wilkins," If Fede Alvarez's revisit of Sam Raimi's spooky old cabin in the deep, dark, twisted woods of rural America did something for you in 2013's Evil Dead, then you need to know that Alvarez is back ... this is one sick puppy."
Screen It!," August 26, 2016",Jim Judy," A tense, edge of your seat crackerjack thriller. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"

New York Magazine/Vulture," August 26, 2016",David Edelstein, It's visually resourceful and honest in how it sets up and delivers on its shocks. There isn't a single false scare.
Starburst," September 2, 2016",Gareth Evans, Don't Breathe has a tense atmosphere with a good pay off. Stephen Lang is a mincing presence and we root to see Rocky and her friends survive. Don't Breathe is good for a fun night out.
The Australian," September 2, 2016",Stephen Romei, This is not a gore-fest like Evil Dead. It's a tight film about people messed up by the ordinary world and what happens when they walk further down the wrong path -- and collide.

The Age (Australia)," August 31, 2016",Jake Wilson," This is one for horror diehards -- well-engineered, but not on a par with Jeremy Saulnier'​s grimy Green Room or Dan Trachtenberg'​s zany 10 Cloverfield Lane."
