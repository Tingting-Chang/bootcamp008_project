Reeling Reviews," February 9, 2017",Robin Clifford," I think it is Peter Simonischek's off the wall performance that make's ""Toni Erdmann"" a cut above just quirky."
Flicks.co.nz," February 9, 2017",Paul Casserly," This film delivers surprises, shocks and cringe-inducing comedy at an impressive rate."
Newsday," February 8, 2017",Rafer Guzman," Funny, tender, outrageous - this unpredictable movie belongs in a category all its own."
Herald Sun (Australia)," February 8, 2017",Leigh Paatsch," Wonderfully unconventional, yet highly enjoyable."
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," February 6, 2017",Hilary A White," Maren's screenplay has its eccentricities (for one, a bizarre sexual interlude), but is anchored by the gorgeous duelling of its leads. If only it was 40 minutes shorter."
Irish Independent," February 6, 2017",Paul Whitington," At two hours and 43 minutes, Toni Erdmann may test the patience of some, but it's a wise, insightful, boldly eccentric and, at times, hilarious film that raises all sorts of interesting questions."
Sunday Times (UK)," February 6, 2017",Camilla Long, A German comedy with bite.
Urban Cinefile," February 5, 2017",Andrew L. Urban," Acclaimed with awards and showered with positive reviews though it is, Toni Erdmann has somehow missed out on making me a fan, despite the excellent performances and its quirky qualities "
Urban Cinefile," February 5, 2017",Louise Keller," A highly lauded and awarded comic drama that has many scratching their heads wondering what the fuss is all about ... If you can persevere through the film's often frustrating first half, there is a pay off"
Daily Express (UK)," February 5, 2017",Nicholas Barber, Worth almost three hours of anyone's time.
Observer (UK)," February 5, 2017",Mark Kermode," ""This will not be a comedy,"" Ade reportedly told her co-producer. ""This will be a very long and sad film."" In fact, it is both and more."
ABC Radio Brisbane," February 4, 2017",Matthew Toomey," I'm struggling to think of a more warped, out-of-the-box comedy from the past year."
The Australian," February 3, 2017",David Stratton," The first thing to note is that Toni Erdmann is wholly original. It doesn't follow any of the usual ""rules"" of narrative cinema."
RTÉ (Ireland)," February 3, 2017",Paddy Kehoe," At the heart of this deeply-convincing human drama is the lingering after-effect of unmentioned family discord, astutely tempered with some brilliant comic set-pieces."
Contactmusic.com," February 3, 2017",Rich Cline, Surprises us with both its hilarity and its resonance.
Baltimore Magazine," February 3, 2017",Max Weiss," While I appreciate that the film contains multitudes -- and, yes, maybe even the spark of genius -- I must confess that I'm not fully down with the hype."
sbs.com.au," February 3, 2017",Rochelle Siemienowicz," Long, fluid takes, naturalistic cinematography (by Patrick Orth) and bland, realistic set design (by Silke Fischer) allow all the focus to follow the interactions between the actors -- both verbal and often even more powerfully, non-verbal."
Reel Film Reviews," February 3, 2017",David Nusair," Toni Erdmann, saddled with a storyline that is, at its heart, fairly conventional, ultimately finds its various positive attributes rendered moot in the face of a needlessly, obnoxiously epic running time."
Aisle Seat," February 3, 2017",Mike McGranaghan," The film is funny and insightful, outrageous but still grounded."
London Evening Standard," February 3, 2017",Charlotte O'Sullivan, Boasts two fascinating characters and a string of surreal set-pieces that you can't afford to miss.
Time Out," May 20, 2016",Dave Calhoun, A sly evocation of the absurdities and banalities of modern life. Just brilliant. 
Hollywood Reporter," May 17, 2016",Leslie Felperin," A slow-burning thing of beauty, ultimately as moving as it is implausibly funny."
Paste Magazine," May 17, 2016",Tim Grierson," Toni Erdmann detonates the typical father-daughter drama, Ade and her cast adventurously trying to put back the pieces into an exciting new whole. You'll see the imperfections in this mosaic, but it's still a wonder to look at."
Otroscines.com," May 17, 2016",Diego Battle, The movie shows brilliant comedy moments and others of big psychology intensity. [Full review in Spanish]
The Playlist," May 16, 2016",Jessica Kiang, [T]he genius of Maren Ade's brilliantly funny and slyly crushing Toni Erdmann is that it makes the utterly foreign nation of its central father/daughter relationship feel so much like home.
Otroscines.com," May 16, 2016",Diego Lerer," A charming, delicious, free and very human comedy. [Full review in Spanish]"
El antepenúltimo mohicano," May 16, 2016",Alberto Sáez Villarino, A film that never stops increasing it's dose of full delirium through situations that go from the absurd to become simply surreal until you can't take it anymore. [Full review in Spanish]
Cinema Movil," May 16, 2016",Oscar Uriel," A fun and endearing film, the only thing that drags it down is it's excessive running time, something a film with these characteristics doesn't need. [Full review in Spanish]"
Slant Magazine," May 16, 2016",Sam C. Mac, Maren Ade always possesses as fine an instinct for calibrating the emotions of her characters as any working director.

Guardian," May 14, 2016",Peter Bradshaw," Ade upends the cliche with her extravagantly strange, farcical situations - interestingly flavoured by embarrassment and resentment."

We Got This Covered," May 14, 2016",Josh Cabrita," With a perfect balance of heart and humor, Toni Erdmann transcends its clichéd premise, becoming one of the most tragic comedies of the decade so far."
Variety," May 14, 2016",Guy Lodge," Like all great humanist filmmaking, Toni Erdmann keeps an eye out for life at the edges, even when the lives in focus consume a whole lot of energy."
Compuserve," October 27, 2016",Harvey S. Karten, An alternately sad and jocular look at a father's attempt to bring his daughter closer through a series of practical jokes.
The Skinny," October 14, 2016",Ian Mantagni," Just as the film seems primed for a self-pitying, cheap-shot conclusion, there's a liberating set-piece of fumbling group adventure that achieves a mythic, cathartic quality."
International Business Times," October 13, 2016",Alfred Joyner," While you'll delight in the comedic spectacle, it's the film's poignancy that will gnaw at you for much longer."
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," October 12, 2016",Brian Gibson," Ade's sticky mix of the foolish and the lonesome clings on afterwards, seeping slowly under the skin around your funny bone."
Consequence of Sound," October 11, 2016",Nico Lang," What Toni Erdmann offers - in all its crushing optimism - is a chance at absolution. Running nearly three hours, Ade's film is almost overwhelming in its hopefulness, which is precisely what makes it so necessary. "
AwardsCircuit.com," October 10, 2016",Clayton Davis," Having elements of a German version of ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" Ade paints a portrait, often detailed, most times, too much so."
The List," October 10, 2016",Emma Simmonds," A textured portrait of the parent-child relationship, as well as a shrewd satire of corporate shenanigans."
Reverse Shot," October 3, 2016",Adam Nayman," Enough cannot be said about the sharpness and intelligence of Ade's script, and how credibly it sketches the connections between its superficially disparate co-protagonists."
Slant Magazine," October 3, 2016",Christopher Gray," By its end, Toni Erdmann is a work of laser-guided social critique and a comedy."
Maclean's Magazine," September 19, 2016",Brian D. Johnson," Finally, the feminist workplace comedy we've all been waiting for."
NOW Toronto," September 9, 2016",Norman Wilner," It's long (two and three-quarters hours), it's hysterically funny, it's deeply moving, it features a show-stopping impromptu performance of a Whitney Houston song, and it's a masterpiece."
Irish Times," September 9, 2016",Donald Clarke," Other characters appear, but, for all its sprawl, Toni Erdmann still plays like a blissful two-hander between admirable professionals."
Collider," September 5, 2016",Brian Formo," With Maren Ade's careful construction, Toni Erdmann's offsetting comedy and tragedy seeks to find some sort of balance in our modern times."
Film-Forward.com," July 1, 2016",Kent Turner," It's as though [director] Ade, who wrote the script, drew upon the fundamentals of farce, rewarding the audience for sitting through an elongated setup with one last act of lunacy. "

HeyUGuys," May 23, 2016",Jo-Anne Titmarsh," This is a tender and funny film, which suffers from being overly long, but Ade is a skilled craftswoman and gifted screenwriter."
The Young Folks," May 22, 2016",Jordan Ruimy," ... the flawed, scrambling, ambitious narrative structure of the film does it no disservice. Instead, it's a pure delight ... "
Sight and Sound," May 20, 2016",Jonathan Romney," The visual style is soberly realist, Patrick Orth's photography strictly no-frills... and it's perfectly attuned to a film that lets the acting and the situations lead."
Vanity Fair," May 20, 2016",Richard Lawson, Ade's film is odd and captivating and speaks many truths and boasts probably the best final shot of the festival.
AV Club," May 20, 2016",Mike D'Angelo," Ade begins with a fairly simple dynamic and then proceeds to tease out every possible facet, taking her characters to truly unexpected places and ending on a note of disarming irresolution."
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 26, 2016",Tim Brayton," The whole thing is, basically, perfect: impeccably-made cinema with a pair of smart messages hiding inside the driest, funniest movie of the year."
TheWrap," December 23, 2016",Dave White," A comedy with just as many moments of sadness, disaffection, and humiliation as there are laughs, the film never shies away from awkward human strangeness. This is how it sticks, and sticks the ending."
RogerEbert.com," December 23, 2016",Susan Wloszczyna, Abundantly talented writer/director Maren Ade fully embraces the inherent awkwardness of a testy emotional bond and tackles it to the ground.
Metro," December 23, 2016",Matt Prigge, Bear with us while we sell you on the greatness of a near-three-hour German comedy that has the same plot as an Adam Sandler movie.
Newark Star-Ledger," December 23, 2016",Stephen Whitty," A nice new comedy, with plenty of smiles and a few genuine belly laughs. And, at the same time, a painfully honest family drama, made for anyone who's ever been an embarrassed teen."
New York Times," December 22, 2016",A.O. Scott," A thrilling act of defiance against the toxicity of doing what is expected, on film, at work and out in the world."
amNewYork," December 22, 2016",Robert Levin," Under the skillful eye of director Maren Ade, the movie is certainly unafraid of embracing the weird, but it is an inherently sweet and oftentimes moving picture about the lengths to which a parent can go to help a child in distress."
Los Angeles Times," December 22, 2016",Justin Chang, Ade has an unusual gift for planting more than one idea in each frame; I don't think there's a single one of the movie's 162 minutes that can be reduced to a single emotional beat or narrative function.
Village Voice," December 22, 2016",Melissa Anderson, Toni Erdmann remains constantly absorbing through its precise examination of even the most mundane interactions.
New York Magazine/Vulture," December 21, 2016",David Edelstein," Flat, sober, paced like an art picture, its themes never directly announced: Toni Erdmann should be deadly. Instead, people scream at the screen. Really, they go crazy."
Brooklyn Magazine," December 20, 2016",Samuel T. Adams," With a truly unique script, definitive characterization, and plenty of surprises, Toni Erdmann is among the most enthralling and moving cinema of the year."
Film Journal International," December 19, 2016",Tomris Laffly, Toni Erdmann is a fascinating beast with a father-daughter story at its heart that is at once familiar and nothing like you've ever seen before.
Screen International," December 15, 2016",Sarah Ward," Earns every uproarious, heartbreaking or illuminating moment, and every corresponding emotional response as well. "
Tiny Mix Tapes," December 7, 2016",Derek Smith," It is tender and melancholy, yet its absurdist twists, played with the straightest face, make it one of the most uniquely rewarding experiences I've had at the movies all year."
PopMatters," December 7, 2016",Alex Ramon, Toni Erdmann is a painfully drawn out and rather limp piece of work that dribbles on shapelessly until Ade finally stops the show by having the male protagonist bluntly sum up the movie's message at the end.
Film Inquiry," December 5, 2016",Alistair Ryder," Toni Erdmann has a few show-stopping sequences that give the allusion of an arthouse crowd pleaser, yet the laughs are spread too thin across the overlong and dull narrative."
NYC Movie Guru," December 4, 2016",Avi Offer," A profound, heartfelt and outrageously funny emotional journey. It's one of the best films of the year."
The Nation," November 17, 2016",Stuart Klawans," You'll want to see this one in a crowd when it opens in theaters, so you can feel the waves of laughter crashing over each other."
El antepenúltimo mohicano," November 10, 2016",Miguel Muñoz Garnica, A pinnacle of the present century cinema because of its capacity to blend comedy with the melancholy and being rapturous in both aspects. [Full review in Spanish]
EntertainmentTell," October 28, 2016",Stephen Silver," It's many things, all of them good- leading up to a wondrous thid-act setpiece (Broad Street Review)"
El Mundo (Spain)," January 23, 2017",Luis Martínez," An extravagant and incisive comedy that has a lucidity so amusing that, in fact, hurts. [Full review in Spanish]"
Blog de cine," January 23, 2017",Mikel Zorrilla," Although I don't think it will become a masterpiece, it will end up being among my favorite releases of 2017, maybe even as my favorite movie of the year. Definitely essential. [Full review in Spanish]"
Combustible Celluloid," January 19, 2017",Jeffrey M. Anderson," I liked these characters, and the movie mostly avoids squeamish moments of uncomfortable comedy, but it just went on and on with no real payoff for its extreme length."
SF Weekly," January 19, 2017",Sherilyn Connelly," The movie's most impressive trick is that while Winfried's stated philosophy is ""Don't lose the humor,"" his disguises never descend into a Patch Adams-type aggressive whimsy."
San Francisco Chronicle," January 18, 2017",Walter V. Addiego," That the movie works so well is also due to the exceptional talents of leads Simonischek and Huller, who hold nothing back - especially the former, whose Winfried is one of the oddest ducks in recent movies."
Reeling Reviews," January 18, 2017",Laura Clifford," Writer/director Maren Ade's (""Everyone Else"") generational comedy is like a bizarre game of chicken, Ines's prankster dad pushing all her buttons until she finally recognizes the absurdity of her priorities."
The Atlantic," January 16, 2017",David Sims," It's some new, evolved form of awkward comedy that doesn't strive to make the audience wince, but rather lives in every joyously strange, unsettling moment."
ArtsHub," January 8, 2017",Sarah Ward, Defies expectations - and disarms and delights in the process.
Christian Science Monitor," January 6, 2017",Peter Rainer, It's all fitfully sharp and amusing but hardly a masterpiece.
Film Inquiry," January 4, 2017",Benjamin Wang, One of 2016's best.
Wall Street Journal," January 2, 2017",Joe Morgenstern, Brilliantly funny and moving.
Artforum," December 30, 2016",Nick Pinkerton," Lacking anything to disturb its basic binary or to put a complacent viewer momentarily on their back foot, there's little here that lifts the ongoing game of farcical imposture and father-daughter sparring above briskly repetitive actor's exercises."
In These Times," December 29, 2016",Michael Atkinson," Movies this inventively generous and organically unpredictable should be, in a proper world, produced dozens of times a year, as a matter of routine."
Vox," December 29, 2016",Alissa Wilkinson," Rather than taking the joke-a-minute slapstick approach, Toni Erdmann slow-burns its humor, winding up to the punch with care and pathos that renders the punchline all the more poignant."
FilmDrunk," December 29, 2016",Vincent Mancini," An outrageous but heartwarming father-daughter comedy that's also a tragedy about globalization's broken promises -- one the year's best, and probably it's most unique. "
NPR," December 28, 2016",Andrew Lapin," Toni Erdmann is silly yet profoundly moving, a movie that speaks to the human disconnect of our time."
Cinemalogue.com," December 28, 2016",Todd Jorgenson," While the length is daunting, the film never feels rambling or indulgent, offering rich characters, terrific performances and a visual texture that yield sympathy."
Rolling Stone," December 28, 2016",Peter Travers," If you're looking for the best and most beguiling foreign-language film of the year, you'll find it in Maren Ade's German father-daughter story that will leave you laughing and choking back tears, often simultaneously. "
LarsenOnFilm," December 28, 2016",Josh Larsen," ...hilarious, bizarre, and oddly sweet."
New Yorker," December 27, 2016",Richard Brody," There isn't a question in any of the filming; Ade's sense of representation is one of confident approximations. In sticking to a familiarly unquestioned sense of cinematic reality, she empties it of psychological reality; it's a movie with no inner life."
Cinemanía (Spain)," January 27, 2017",Andrea G. Bermejo, The movie that will make you rethink your life and look at joke shops with better eyes. We all need a Toni Erdmann. [Full review in Spanish]
National Post," January 27, 2017",Chris Knight, It has important things to say about how one culture can be foisted on another in the name of globalization or efficiency. 
AllMovie," January 27, 2017",Violet LeVoit, .... a Teutonic Ferris Büeller...
San Diego Reader," January 27, 2017",Scott Marks," Sure enough, Andy Kaufman's prankster and premeditatedly abrasive second-self was the impetus behind this epic one-joke comedy from German writer-director Maren Ade."
Mark Reviews Movies," January 27, 2017",Mark Dujsik," Toni Erdmann is a bit sad, a bit weird, and a bit funny -- all in the right ways."
Globe and Mail," January 27, 2017",Kate Taylor," As director Maren Ade builds one extended set piece after another, you will gradually spy her brilliant fusion of form and function ..."
MetroActive," January 26, 2017",Richard von Busack," Loveable if not ordinarily hilarious, Toni Erdmann explores both sides of a situation familiar to many."
Washington City Paper," January 26, 2017",Noah Gittell," Toni Erdmann is a delight, a masterpiece of subtlety, and a rich comedy of eras."
One Guy's Opinion," January 26, 2017",Frank Swietek," Overlong and-apart from a few truly bizarre moments-pretty obvious, it neither delivers consistent laughs nor carries any deep emotional impact. "
Chicago Reader," January 26, 2017",J. R. Jones," Comedies are supposed to be short, but this German farce... succeeds by virtue of its endlessness-like its hero, an aging piano teacher and irrepressible joker, the movie keeps bugging you and bugging you until you can't help but laugh."
Toronto Star," January 26, 2017",Peter Howell," Despite a nearly three-hour running time that feels at times like a miniseries, Ade's script is that unique conundrum: an art house comedy with a deft pace and finely tuned emotional intelligence."
Washington Post," January 26, 2017",Ann Hornaday," The movie is worth its sloggiest moments - and its frequently off-putting title character - for Hüller's fearless performance, which is a revelation of pathos, humor and keen, sharp-eyed focus."
Chicago Tribune," January 26, 2017",Michael Phillips," The movie has a lot to say about the endless, free-floating bs women must contend with in a capitalistic patriarchy."
Arizona Republic," January 26, 2017",Bill Goodykoontz," ""Toni Erdmann"" is worth every minute of your time."
Philadelphia Inquirer," January 26, 2017",Tirdad Derakhshani," Toni Erdmann is an immensely rich, deeply-felt exploration of human relationships that draws you in and holds you fast for nearly three hours."
Georgia Straight," January 25, 2017",Ken Eisner," This extravagantly long import recently landed on many top-10 lists, but it contains ideas, not people. Fortunately, the actors are good enough to make you forget its inexplicable plot machinations."
East Bay Express," January 25, 2017",Kelly Vance," In Toni Erdmann, the sandpaper is coated with honey and the protagonists only want to prove they're right, on their way to ultimate family happiness. "
Willamette Week," January 25, 2017",Ben Ferguson," Corporate politics, nudity and a very well-used set of false teeth fuel the blithe absurdities of this German comedy. "
Newcity," January 25, 2017",Ray Pride," Maren Ade's third feature... is bittersweet and berserk, realist yet surrealist, which, once you've absorbed the particulars of the premise, has as many indelible laughs as any movie released in recent months."
El Pais (Spain)," January 23, 2017",Carlos Boyero," A bittersweet and unusual comedy that, although it could have been shorter, it has been a pleasant and delicious time being with its characters in their crazy trip. [Full review in Spanish]"
iNews.co.uk," February 3, 2017",Matthew Turner," If you're thinking that maybe life's too short for 162 minutes of German comedy, think again."
Times (UK)," February 2, 2017",Kate Muir," The story of a nuttily disguised father stalking his uptight business executive daughter is surreal and screamingly funny, but also a tender dissection of their relationship."
The Sun (UK)," February 2, 2017",Jamie East, It isn't often you watch a three hour long German language farce in which a father wearing a wig and false teeth antagonises his daughter in a hotel bar - and think it's bloody brilliant.
Daily Mail (UK)," February 2, 2017",Brian Viner," Even at a mightily excessive running time of 162 minutes, Maren Ade's picture generally holds the attention with its sheer singularity."
Radio Times," February 2, 2017",David Parkinson," Exploring corporate sexism, the decline in business ethics, the EU's betrayal of the post-Communist bloc and communication in the mobile age, this playful screwball comedy has plenty to say about the state of the continent."
Daily Express (UK)," February 2, 2017",Allan Hunter," A slow-burning joy of a film that delivers dark, outrageous laughs and some genuinely touching moments."
Blu-ray.com," February 2, 2017",Brian Orndorf," Has moments that test patience in full, but it's also a richly realistic study of interpersonal struggle and fractured communication, delivered with a free-flowing sense of playfulness."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," February 2, 2017",Colin Covert," Rather than setting up jokes, scoring points and swiftly moving on, Ade keeps her shots rolling past the natural beats, hindering what at its core is a road trip comedy - one that is thinly staged, shot and edited."
St. Paul Pioneer Press," February 2, 2017",Chris Hewitt (St. Paul)," Ade is interested in following these two average people as they try to figure out some huge things: What do they want out of life? How can they get it? Can a willingness to do silly, random stuff make us happier?"
Sight and Sound," February 2, 2017",Catherine Wheatley," Toni Erdmann is as strange, delightful and dementedly funny as the hype has it. But repeat watching reveals a film that plays first as comedy, then as tragedy."
Financial Times," February 2, 2017",Nigel Andrews," Force of feeling and intelligence meets force of comic metaphor and invention, somewhere in a Dadaist deep space miraculously liberated from solemnity."
Empire Magazine," February 2, 2017",Ian Freer," A weird, thoughtful, affecting treat."
Scotsman," February 2, 2017",Alistair Harkness," Rich, funny, rewarding and ultimately moving."
Cine Premiere," February 1, 2017",Carlos Jesús González," A film that you can't miss; and also, the new great hope of German cinema that deserves everything. [Full review in Spanish]"
Independent (UK)," February 1, 2017",Geoffrey Macnab," Playful and profound by turns, it spins a complex and multi-layered story from what seems to be a simple premise."
The Straits Times (Singapore)," February 1, 2017",John Lui, This is Ade's masterful take on cringe comedy.
CineVue," February 1, 2017",Matthew Anderson," A morbid, awkward, raucously funny critique of modern life."
Total Film," January 31, 2017",Jamie Graham," Strikingly original, brilliantly acted, this serio-comic masterpiece constantly swerves expectations."
Little White Lies," January 30, 2017",David Jenkins," As great as you've heard, and probably even greater."
ComingSoon.net," January 30, 2017",Joshua Starnes," Hilarious, weird, insightful and charming, Toni Erdmann is the type of character comedy which comes along infrequently and must be cherished in the time it is here."
