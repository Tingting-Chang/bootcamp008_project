Adelaide Review," February 1, 2017",David 'Mad Dog' Bradley," While terribly, even hauntingly painful at times, Manchester by the Sea is also generously funny, which is rather odd given that it's a film about grief, self-loathing, forgiveness and not-so-happy families."

The Australian," January 27, 2017",David Stratton," Not a moment in the film is wasted; though on the long side, this is from start to finish a rewarding and strangely beautiful drama with a conclusion that is immensely satisfying in its touching understatement."
3AW," January 27, 2017",Jim Schembri," There is an in-built drabness to the drama of Manchester by the Sea that, while never exactly boring, takes far too long to get to its sobering yet unremarkable payoff. We all enjoy a good downer, but not one that also manages to tire us out. "

Christian Science Monitor," November 18, 2016",Peter Rainer," Because Lonergan is so true to the intricacies and rhythms of family strife, we trust his vision. When it comes time for the fade-out, he doesn't gussy up sorrow with a sunrise glow. Healing is hard."

Us Weekly," November 22, 2016",Mara Reinstein," It's a masterful, all-American tale that delves deep into the black hole of grief. At times, it can all be emotionally overwhelming - but isn't that a characteristic of a great movie?"

The Patriot Ledger," November 24, 2016",Al Alexander," Affleck's Lee is a figure too tragic even for Shakespeare. But his pain, and yes, his courage, is seared into our memories, making ""Manchester"" not just a place by the sea, but also a piece of our hearts."

Salt Lake Tribune," December 8, 2016",Sean P. Means," Manchester by the Sea paints a rich and touching portrait of a family's grief, and one man drawn back to deal with the past he tried to put behind him. It's a movie that will resonate in the heart long after the credits roll."
