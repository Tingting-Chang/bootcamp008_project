NUVO Newsweekly," December 30, 2016",Edward Johnson-Ott," When the big battle between two feuding factions of the Avengers finally happens, it's a doozy."
Sunday Times (UK)," December 17, 2016",Camilla Long," Never mind if his stuff is cut with unbelievable dross, if the acting is terrible, the costumes are hideous, if the wigs are preposterous and the codpieces are disappointingly flat, loyal fans will still come back to be expertly fleeced."
MovieCrypt.com," December 13, 2016",Kevin A. Ranson, ... this is exactly what we asked for since (Steve) and Tony squared off in The Avengers... but it is also not what we wanted - and that's a good thing.
Film Experience," December 2, 2016",Nathaniel Rogers," [While] the Russo brothers in the directors chair show a fairly deft hand at balancing a dozen characters and keeping the action exciting, elsewhere there's a bit of flailing."
Movie Mezzanine," November 17, 2016",Josh Spiegel, A perfectly fine brand deposit in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," November 14, 2016",Piers Marchant," If we don't have something quite as fun and thrilling as The Avengers, we're still a hell of a long way from Zack Snyder's regrettable, murky Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice fiasco."
Seanax.com," October 6, 2016",Sean Axmaker," Joe and Anthony Russo (who directed the earlier Captain America: Winter Soldier, which introduced even more story threads picked up in this film's dense plot weave) are actually quite adept at this kind of big team juggling. "
Matt's Movie Reviews," September 20, 2016",Matthew Pejkovic," Its many ideas, plot-points and characters are expertly conceived, written and portrayed to make for a roller coaster of a superhero movie. "
Chesapeake Family Magazine," August 2, 2016",Roxana Hadadi," The real key to Captain America: Civil War is its sense of inevitability, and its acceptance that sometimes things change-they change big."
Washington Free Beacon," July 14, 2016",Sonny Bunch," Despite the name on the marquee and the content of the advertising campaign, this is very much a film about Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.)."
The Mary Sue," July 13, 2016",Lesley Coffin," Captain America: Civil War is good, but too stuffed to be great."
Antagony & Ecstasy," July 10, 2016",Tim Brayton," Civil War is the Marvel machine doing things right, but the machine is still designed to make films with all of the corners rounded off and all of the themes simplistic enough for ten-year-olds."
San Francisco Examiner," July 1, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," Recalls last year's extravaganza ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" although it's less slick and has a stronger emotional center."
Baltimore Magazine," June 13, 2016",Max Weiss, It's this light-heartedness that keeps Captain America: Civil War from succumbing to the kind of pretentiousness that marred Batman V. Superman.
El Mundo (Spain)," June 1, 2016",Luis Mart√≠nez," The most mature, smart and fun Marvel movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
Pitch.com," May 31, 2016",Eric Melin," Marvel's response to superhero fatigue, then, is clear: Double-down on character and up the storytelling's short game as well as its long game. It's an old-fashioned strategy, and it absolutely works."
Cinema Signals," May 30, 2016",Jules Brenner," Marvel, with its comic strip cool, Industrial Light & Magic control of gravity, what may be the largest ensemble of characters in its movie history and visual artistry, has done it again."
Japan Times," May 20, 2016",James Hadfield," It wields an equally large cast with surprising dexterity, never losing sight of which players matter most to the story it's trying to tell."
Total Film," April 13, 2016",Jordan Farley," If there's a risk of the Marvel 'formula' becoming stale, there isn't any evidence of that here. Civil War isn't just a damn-near-perfect popcorn crowd-pleaser; it doesn't offer any easy answers for its combatants, or the world going forward."
IGN Movies," April 13, 2016",Jim Vejvoda," Featuring what's arguably the best ever screen depiction of Spider-Man as well as a cool new hero in Black Panther, Captain America: Civil War can't quite recapture the emotional and cerebral strengths of its predecessor."
Screen International," April 13, 2016",Tim Grierson," A gargantuan entertainment that finds room for a little emotional resonance underneath the sterling spectacle, ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a well-paced, thoroughly satisfying, completely overstuffed action-thriller."

Empire Magazine," April 13, 2016",Dan Jolin," Matching its blockbuster scale and spectacle with the smarts of a great, grown-up thriller, Captain America: Civil War is Marvel Studios' finest film yet."
Hollywood Reporter," April 13, 2016",Sheri Linden," Call it ""civil war"" or call it brand extension; call it a ""cinematic universe"" or a corporate behemoth - the latest Marvel extravaganza furthers the studio's cross-pollination of action franchises in a way that's sure to satisfy devotees."
Variety," April 13, 2016",Justin Chang, The most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The Daily Beast," April 13, 2016",Jen Yamato," Finally, a big budget superhero sequel that manages to be both effortlessly entertaining and utterly sobering, instead of just one of those things-or, as we've endured too frequently in the past, neither of them. (Looking at you, Batman v Superman.)"
Uproxx," April 13, 2016",Mike Ryan, This is the best Marvel movie so far. This is not hyperbole. I have my doubts they can make anything better.
CinemaBlend.com," April 13, 2016",Eric Eisenberg," Bringing together tremendous character dynamics; bold structure; an emotional narrative; and spell-binding, fun action sequences, it's everything a blockbuster should be. "
CraveOnline," April 13, 2016",William Bibbiani," It is entertaining without being fluffy. It has consequence without being dire. It is the floor of a child's bedroom, covered in action figures who are perpetually in mid-conflict, whose limitations have yet to be discovered."
Starburst," April 21, 2016",Paul Mount," It's a magnificent action film, it's a wonderful character piece, it's big, brash, bursting with confidence and brio; it's Marvel firing on all cylinders just when, by rights, we might be expecting the law of diminishing returns to set in."
The Straits Times (Singapore)," April 21, 2016",John Lui," Once the plot kicks in, things chug along nicely, though action scenes are blighted by shaky camera syndrome."
Access Hollywood," April 21, 2016",Scott A. Mantz," The biggest, the boldest and the most ambitious movie yet to come from Marvel Studios."
SciFiNow," April 21, 2016",Poppy-Jay Palmer," The film's tone and themes feel a tiny bit darker and a lot more grown-up than usual, but the reaction it provokes is still one of giddy, childlike joy."
Independent (UK)," April 21, 2016",Clarisse Loughrey, If Captain America: Civil War is the true herald of Marvel's Phrase Three and its carefully planned future; maybe it doesn't actually feel so bad that we'll be getting these movies every year until the Earth collapses in on itself.
New Statesman," April 21, 2016",Ryan Gilbey," The characters are multi-layered, crammed full of old allegiances and grudges and irritations. They have personalities. Remember those?"
The Skinny," April 21, 2016",Josh Slater-Williams," There are still imperfections to be found in this Marvel offering, but when the highs are this good, it's hard not to temporarily give in to our new insect overlords."
Time Out," April 21, 2016",Tom Huddleston, Packed to bursting with the one ingredient 'Batman v Superman' lacked: joy. 
CineVue," April 20, 2016",Joseph Walsh," The pitch is simple enough - liberalism or totalitarianism, heroes or vigilantes - and there's more than a whiff of American imperialism on both sides of the coin."
WOW247," April 20, 2016",Matthew Turner, Puts a certain other superhero vs superhero movie to shame. 
Little White Lies," April 20, 2016",David Jenkins, Calling this 'the best Marvel movie' is equivalent to proclaiming 'this is the best Dorito I've ever tasted.'
Daily Telegraph (UK)," April 20, 2016",Robbie Collin," This is the cinematic superhero showdown you've dreamt of since childhood, precisely because that's everything - and all - it wants to be."
Guardian," April 19, 2016",Peter Bradshaw," It's a huge aspartame rush of a film: a giant irresistible snack, not nutritious, but very tasty."
The Young Folks," April 15, 2016",Michael Fairbanks, This movie is so toothless that you'll probably pay for your ticket in a paper cup on the side of the road... it's so concerned with keeping everything in line for future movies that it ultimately takes no risks...
HeyUGuys," April 15, 2016",Jon Lyus," In the best Comic Book film since The Dark Knight, the Russo Brothers along with Captain America and Iron Man completely knock it out of the park."
Forbes," April 14, 2016",Mark Hughes," [T]he best Marvel yet, with the greatest superhero action on film. It's immense, marvelous action-packed fun... [T]he single greatest pure superhero movie ever made."
The Playlist," April 13, 2016",Russ Fischer, The Russos deftly craft compelling blockbuster entertainment out of moral and emotional conflicts.
USA Today," April 13, 2016",Brian Truitt," Tear away the powers, abilities and egos, though, and the third Captain America movie is at its core a deep exploration of friendship and family and what sacrifices should be made to hold onto both."
Birth.Movies.Death.," April 13, 2016",Devin Faraci, Civil War isn't great despite being the third Captain America and thirteenth overall Marvel movie - it's great because of those things.
TheWrap," April 13, 2016",Dave White," Directors Anthony and Joe Russo continue to mine their experience with TV comedies, juggling all the members of their superhero family with a playful touch that both informs character interaction and delivers vital breathing room in between battles."
The Standard," April 28, 2016",Matt Neal, I feel sorry for DC fans.
The Popcorn Junkie," April 28, 2016",Cameron Williams," Revels in it's complacency, spectacular only within the boundaries of what has become the serviceable standard for a Marvel film; it's all glory and no guts."
Student Edge," April 27, 2016",Simon Miraudo," Devotion among bros (debrotion?) is tested in Civil War, which sees suspicious boy scout Steve Rogers battle Tony Stark, in defence of his old Brooklyn buddy Bucky Barnes... [it's] unique; you don't often say that of 13th instalments."
Sensacine," April 27, 2016",Alejandro G. Calvo," Where we afraid we would get tired of superhero movies? if what's comes next is as good as this, send me all the movies you want. [Full review in Spanish]"
News.com.au," April 27, 2016",Wenlei Ma," There's enough variety in the action to sustain at least four major arrangements without resorting to more boom, smash and bam. For a two-and-a-half hour movie, everything's surprisingly well-paced."
Herald Sun (Australia)," April 27, 2016",Leigh Paatsch," This is how Marvel Entertainment does the multi-hero smackdown thing, and man, does it deliver."
The Age (Australia)," April 27, 2016",Jake Wilson," This is good ridiculous fun, with a steady stream of wisecracks to accompany the fan-pleasing one-on-one match-ups."
indieWire," April 27, 2016",David Ehrlich," Marvel movies don't get much better than this. The trouble is, they don't want to."
Blog de cine," April 27, 2016",Mikel Zorrilla, A large demonstration that Marvel can go much further. [Full review in Spanish]
FILMINK (Australia)," April 27, 2016",Erin Free," ...a bright, vivid, compelling cocktail..."
Irish Times," April 27, 2016",Donald Clarke, It is during those scenes with Spider-Man that Marvel Studios demonstrates its greatest strength: a certainty of tone.
Entertainment Weekly," April 26, 2016",Chris Nashawaty," Plotwise, there's a lot of ground to cover in Civil War (even at two-and-a-half hours). But the Russos juggle all of the murky motivations and shifting alliances with impressive deftness."
Digital Spy," April 26, 2016",Rosie Fletcher," Captain America: Civil War, has managed to reinvent the comic book movie once again, creating a film that's thoughtful, mature and moving at the same time as being a thrilling ensemble romp."
GQ Magazine [UK]," April 26, 2016",Helen O'Hara," Thanks to the extraordinary engineering work of screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directors Anthony and Joe Russo, this film keeps moving, never losing its sense of purpose."
Fan The Fire," April 26, 2016",Martin Roberts," In the 2016 battle for superhero supremacy, Marvel has unquestionably delivered the knock-out blow."
The List," April 25, 2016",Angie Errigo," There is real maturity in a story of guilt, revenge, torn loyalties and tragic revelations - between the fights, explosions, chases and general awesomeness."
Urban Cinefile," April 25, 2016",Louise Keller," Heroes or vigilantes is the question raised in this highly inventive, full-throttle adventure... An agile mind is required to keep up with the never-ending plot twists and leaps; it is refreshing to find genuine originality and flair"
South China Morning Post," April 23, 2016",James Mottram," Unlike Avengers: Age of Ultron, this is leaner and more low-key. Captain America: Civil War is less about citywide destruction or alien hordes being repelled than it is mistrust and internal divisions."
Nerdist," April 22, 2016",Kyle Anderson," Not only is it another stellar Cap movie, it's maybe my favorite Tony Stark movie, and it also proves how you put a million heroes in the same movie effectively."
Radio Times," April 21, 2016",Jeremy Aspinall," The Russos deliver the goods once again and prove to have a safe pair of hands when it comes to pacey, well-choreographed action and accommodating a large starry cast."
Cinema em Cena," April 28, 2016",Pablo Villa√ßa, The best movie produced by Marvel Studios so far. [Full review in Portuguese]
4:3," April 28, 2016",Dominic Barlow, It all feels shudderingly hollow; a stack of briefs filled to a fault by a pair of journeyman directors.
Concrete Playground," April 28, 2016",Tom Glasson," Not only does Civil War eschew the dull trend of city-wide destruction, it bases its entire plot on the consequences of having caused all that ruin."
LaButaca.net," April 28, 2016",Jos√© Arce," Marvel returns with their biggest blockbuster ever, proving how well they know how to deliver a product that audiences will love. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Spectator," April 28, 2016",Deborah Ross," Look, I don't begrudge those who love the Avengers, as they so passionately do. I'm just genuinely perplexed."
Sight and Sound," April 28, 2016",Kim Newman, It's not as gloomy as DC's recent efforts (few films are) and judicious doses of wit and charm relieve the angst and the smashing.
Sky Movies," April 28, 2016",Rich Phippen," Civil War, for all of its fanboy shout-outs, continues The Winter Soldier's sense of mystery and intrigue, using the shady shenanigans to drive action sequences that rarely feel forced."
Crikey," April 28, 2016",Luke Buckmaster," The political allegories are mostly abandoned and swapped for character motivation, as if we should never have bothered to contemplate a second meaning in the first place."
El Pais (Spain)," April 28, 2016",Jordi Costa," Marvel movies are not adapted from stories they're based on, they seem to be the product of dreams. [Full review in Spanish]"
Garuyo," April 28, 2016",Uriel Barco," A mix of genres that appeals not just to comic book fans, but also to a broader audience looking for stories full of emotion and intrigue that are able to hold their own. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Arts Desk," April 28, 2016",Adam Sweeting," Funny, sad, satirical, spectacular... this is that rare blockbuster that proves that more can be more."
Junkee," April 28, 2016",Paul Verhoeven," Grief, anguish, revenge. All of these, when rendered onto the canvas of a well-rounded character, are so much more potent than the sight of a city crashing into another city or a looming CGI spaceship drawing ever nearer to its fatal destination."
Cinetvymas.cl," April 28, 2016",Juan Carlos Berner, One of the best superhero flicks until now. [Full review in Spanish]
Indie London," April 28, 2016",Rob Carnevale, Captain America: Civil War is therefore a stunning achievement: one that far exceeds expectations to deliver one of the most thrilling superhero experiences you are ever likely to see.
Village Voice," April 28, 2016",Bilge Ebiri," These films no longer have to delight and surprise us; no, their job now is to manage the brand, not screw anything up too royally, and keep us hooked for the next installment. Civil War pulls all that off mostly well."
Cine Premiere," April 28, 2016",Sergio L√≥pez Aguirre," Iron Man and Captain America duke it out in a round, exciting film in what can be described as the biggest blockbuster of the year. [Full review in Spanish]"
Cinema Movil," April 28, 2016",Jonathan S√°nchez," In spite of having so many characters on screen, the film never turns into Avengers 2.5 and always mantains focus on Captain America. It's not perfect, but it almost is and you will really enjoy it. [Full review in Spanish]"
sbs.com.au," April 28, 2016",Anthony Morris, No doubt this is the kind of high note Marvel would like to continue indefinitely across the franchise.

London Evening Standard," May 1, 2016",Charlotte O'Sullivan," The central debate is topical but it cries out for input from some of Marvel's newer creations (if only there was space for Ms Marvel, aka Kamala Khan, a Pakistani-American teen from New Jersey)."
Daily Mail (UK)," May 1, 2016",Brian Viner," Even for those of us who aren't comic-book devotees, Captain America: Civil War scores as pure cinematic escapism."
Daily Express (UK)," May 1, 2016",Henry Fitzherbert, The picture's great achievement is the adept balancing of so many characters. It never feels overstuffed and everyone has their moment and purpose while several new heroes are introduced.
Daily Express (UK)," May 1, 2016",Allan Hunter, In many respects this is the Marvel movies' finest hour.
Observer (UK)," May 1, 2016",Wendy Ide, The sheer force of so much superpowered personality on screen makes for a blast of a movie.
Daily Star," April 30, 2016",Andy Lea," A near-perfect blend of humour, drama and action."
The Australian," April 29, 2016",Stephen Romei," There are lots of other laugh-out-loud moments: self-aware, comic book-aware ones for Marvel fans and straight-out ones for non-expert viewers."
Graffiti With Punctuation," April 29, 2016",Blake Howard," Captain America: Civil War is very good, but the connective tissue between the powerful scenes, felt like chewy gristle in a great cut of steak."
Independent Online (South Africa)," April 29, 2016",Theresa Smith," The Russos have taken a leaf out of Joss Whedon's playbook, remembering that as cool as they are in costume, the most character development happens when these superheroes are in civvies."
Irish Independent," April 29, 2016",Paul Whitington," Captain America: Civil War rumbles busily towards a confrontation between Cap and Iron Man, but that fistfight is perhaps the least interesting bit of this frenetic, hyperactive and intermittently enjoyable film."
Flick Filosopher," April 29, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson," Tough, unanswerable human questions frame spectacular, innovative action sequences that are like superhero ballets. This series just keeps getting better."
Times (UK)," April 29, 2016",Kate Muir, Are you #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan? If this question makes any sense to you then Captain America: Civil War and its superb action sequences will bring you untold joy.
Reforma," April 29, 2016",Adriana Fern√°ndez, The directors and wrters know how to nit layers and plots together while also introducing new characters in a very organic way. [Full review in Spanish]

En Filme," April 29, 2016",Luis Fernando Galv√°n, The Russo brothers use some elements of political thrillers and spy films to create some beats that give some breath to the visual spectacle we see on screen while giving us other moments to develop the plot. [Full review in Spanish]
CineXpress," April 29, 2016",Fico Cangiano, Civil War is one of the best Marvel movies and superhero movies overall. [Full review n Spanish]

RT√â (Ireland)," May 2, 2016",Sarah McIntyre, It's worth seeing alone for the ultimate superhero face-off battle scene - epic stuff.
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," May 2, 2016",Aine O'Connor," There's a light touch, and it is often funny. There are many series in-jokes -- the scene where Iron Man recruits Spider-Man (Tom Holland) is a classic example. And the action scenes are outstanding."
Financial Times," May 2, 2016",Danny Leigh, The two sides arrive on the tarmac of Leipzig airport... [and] the result manages to resemble both a brawl in a Magaluf nightclub and one of the most purely delirious scenes in recent action cinema.
Eclipse Magazine," May 2, 2016",Michelle Alexandria, A near perfect Superhero film! All that destruction in the previous films have real world consequences and those chickens come home to roost. There's no hugging it out this time.
Metro," May 2, 2016",Matt Prigge, There's some good stuff in 'Captain America: Civil War.' That's what these Marvel things are now: a lot of stuff.

Cinencuentro," May 2, 2016",Sebastian Zavala Kahn, Captain America: Civil War is one of the best superhero movies out there because it dares to break the formula. [Full review in Spanish]
New York Magazine/Vulture," May 2, 2016",David Edelstein, The best way to think of Captain America: Civil War is as a toy box in which the sheer quantity of toys partly makes up for the lack of anything new.
ABC Radio Brisbane," May 2, 2016",Matthew Toomey," There are more characters and subplots that a Game of Thrones episode but somehow, directors Anthony and Joe Russo have managed to mash it all together into something that works. "
The Ooh Tray," May 1, 2016",Ed Whitfield," A remarkably coherent and tightly focused affair that by virtue of clarity and concision, manages to keep all its ducks in a row while providing both the movies billed, i.e. the sequel to Winter Soldier and the Avengers' civil war."
Scotsman," May 1, 2016",Alistair Harkness," This film may excel at building anticipation for cool things coming a year or two down the line, but does a movie called Captain America that leaves you wishing you were watching one called Spider-Man really count as a win for blockbuster fans?"
The Verge," May 3, 2016",Tasha Robinson," Civil War lives in those moments when the smashing starts. The central fight between the two halves of the Avengers group is a tremendous sequence, full of imaginative teamwork and impressive effects."

Consequence of Sound," May 3, 2016",Dominick Mayer," The Russos understand how to pace action better than many of their MCU contemporaries, and as such, Civil War moves at a rapid clip despite all the table-setting and it being the lengthiest Marvel film to date at 146 minutes"
Rip It Up," May 3, 2016",David 'Mad Dog' Bradley," Naturally this is all cluttered and overstuffed to the point of bursting, and yet the convoluted feel and overfamiliarity of much of the plotting is compensated for by the Russo brothers knack for gargantuan action, some tough laughs and real acting."
Vanity Fair," May 3, 2016",Richard Lawson," It's the most lively, engaging Marvel movie since Guardians of the Galaxy, and among the very best of the whole Avengers series."

Cine V√©rtigo," May 3, 2016",Ernesto Diezmartinez, The latest Captain America adventure us nothing more than a really long trailer for the new adventures of the new Spider-Man. [Full review in Spanish]
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," May 3, 2016",Cary Darling," While it lacks the sense of surprise of [the last film], its mix of action, humor, effects, the introduction of a new character and the reintroduction of an old one strikes just the right tone for a film that is as much about marketing as moviemaking."
Miami Herald," May 3, 2016",Rene Rodriguez," The summer movie season has barely begun, and already the remedy for superhero film fatigue has arrived."
The Film Stage," May 3, 2016",Brian Roan," A taut, sinewy piece of filmmaking with enough brains to keep you engaged and enough brawn to keep you in awe."

MovieWeb," May 3, 2016",Julian Roman, Captain America v Iron Man succeeds where Batman v Superman utterly failed. Civil War is Marvel's greatest action film so far.
Film Journal International," May 3, 2016",Ethan Alter, The Marvel blockbuster machine keeps on trucking with a double-sized new issue of Captain America that packs enough punch to distract from its grinding plot mechanics.
Examiner.com," May 3, 2016",Travis Hopson," Marvel has no peer in this arena, and the utter perfect and sheer awesomeness of ""Captain America: Civil War"" is the best example of their superiority."
The New Republic," May 3, 2016",Will Leitch," Civil War is both a Captain America sequel and a third Avengers movie, and that's more than any movie could possibly pull off. It does the best it can, though."
New York Daily News," May 3, 2016",Stephen Whitty," Bragging just a bit - see how many franchise characters we've got, DC? - Marvel practically doubles the number of superheroes for this movie. And it's too much."

Sci-Fi Movie Page," May 7, 2016",Rob Vaux," Above all, it's simply a well-made movie: juggling a staggering number of characters with absolute effortlessness and readily expanding Marvel's collection of heroes without cramming them in."
Examiner.com," May 6, 2016",Chris Sawin, Captain America: Civil War is precisely crafted as one of the best comic book films of all time. It's as if Return of the Jedi stole all of the action sequences from Die Hard: With a Vengeance and Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. 
Winnipeg Free Press," May 19, 2016",Randall King," Joe and Anthony Russo effectively hit the pause button on the Avengers franchise to address the human cost of ""collateral damage,"" while still delivering the impressive action we've come to expect from the Marvel franchise."
Willamette Week," May 18, 2016",AP Kryza," Civil War is fun. It's smart. It's coherent. And, most importantly, it allows its heart to beat strongly amid the chaos, with character moments and set pieces working in tandem to create perhaps Marvel's best film so far."
Blog de cine," May 18, 2016",Alberto Abu√≠n," It's more of the same, of course it has a little more entertainment, but it's the same tendency to repeat what has worked in the past, nothing new. [Full review in Spanish]"
MetroActive," May 18, 2016",Richard von Busack," This satisfying adventure is rich with the things Marvel comics always did best: critiquing the consequences of power in explosive, four-color form."
"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," May 18, 2016",John Beifuss," Like guest star Ant-Man in his new Giant-Man identity, this somewhat ungainly Marvel sequel almost collapses under its own weight."
Hot Press," May 18, 2016",Roe McDermott," In Captain America: Civil War, the intelligent plotting, thoughtful character development and blockbuster action of the past two instalments comes to a thrilling apex."
The Sunday Age," May 17, 2016",Craig Mathieson, Anthony and Joe Russo's first-rate feature provides both invigorating action and genuine contemplation. It's an engaging superhero movie that actually ponders the human cost of doing all that cool stuff.
Cinema Sight," May 17, 2016",Wesley Lovell," On par with the recent Avengers combo films, but quite inferior to the prior Captain America outing."
Cinemaphile.org," May 16, 2016",David Keyes," Very entertaining, and a far tighter production than much of Marvel's recent output."
EntertainmentTell," May 15, 2016",Stephen Silver," Not the best Marvel movie, but does do the best job balancing its obligations, while also boasting the series' best action sequence (Splice Today) "
3AW," May 14, 2016",Jim Schembri," A good, disposable piece of FX-driven entertainment, even if it comes with the obligatory one-act storyline, lack of originality and 30-minute over-run."
Sacramento News & Review," May 13, 2016",Jim Lane," Anthony and Joe Russo make a cheerful show of it, giving their gee-whiz comic book audience all they could wish for -- and more. But that's the problem -- it's still just 90 minutes worth of story stretched out to two-and-a-half hours."
BBC.com," May 12, 2016",Nicholas Barber, It's this levity that makes the much-touted battle royale between Team Cap and Team Iron Man so much fun.
Reno News and Review," May 12, 2016",Bob Grimm," Hey, two superheroes can do battle without totally sucking. "
El Financiero," May 12, 2016",Daniel Krauze," The fact that Civil War ponders the importance of those who've died in conflicts doesn't add complexity to the film, it just fills it with hipocrisy. [Full review in Spanish]"
Blog de cine," May 12, 2016",Luis Caviaro," SO entertaining it wll feel short, even if it's two and a half hours. I wanted more. Please give us more! [Full review in Spanish]"
National Review," May 12, 2016",Armond White," Captain America and Iron Man almost represent the schism that now divides American voters, politicians, and pundits. I say ""almost,"" because the film...doesn't inspire reflection upon the dire seriousness of our current ideological civil war."
ChristyLemire.com," May 11, 2016",Christy Lemire," The fact that a Marvel movie dares to question the big, shiny spectacle that is its bread and butter - and acknowledge that untold thousands die in the name of entertainment - seems rather novel. "
Laramie Movie Scope," May 11, 2016",Robert Roten," When I saw that this was going to be a clash of superheroes, with former friends fighting each other, I wondered how they were going to set it up. Very carefully, it turns out, with a solid screenplay and strong performances."
Reforma," May 10, 2016",Edgardo Res√©ndiz," A magnificent superhero film, with endearing characters, humor and action to go with an interesting plot and a well told story. [Full review in Spanish]"
