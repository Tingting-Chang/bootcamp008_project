Hollywood Reporter," September 14, 2015",John DeFore," While this performance gives the drama psychological weight, efforts of those on the ground to get the girl out of harm's way introduce very satisfying action elements."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," September 14, 2015",Tim Robey," Eye in the Sky is a tick-tock suspense exercise as well as a neat little ethical echo chamber, a plea for reason in a world exploding too vigorously to give it the time of day."

Wall Street Journal," March 10, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," Fundamentally serious, if obviously flawed, ""Eye in the Sky"" argues both sides of its specific case, and, by extension, the merits and perils of a radical new tool for fighting wars."
New York Post," March 10, 2016",Lou Lumenick," Director Gavin Hood pulls off some really tricky tonal shifts. He's abetted by a terrific cast, including Barkhad Abdi as a surveillance expert who tries to save the girl -- and Rickman in his final on-screen appearance, one of his very best."

New York Times," March 10, 2016",Stephen Holden," A grim, suspenseful farce in which unpredictable human behavior repeatedly threatens an operation of astounding technological sophistication."
AV Club," March 10, 2016",Adam Nayman," This is a film that doesn't want to be easily pegged, either in terms of its politics or generic allegiances. Such ambiguity is a virtue, but for all his technical facility, Hood doesn't really have the finesse of a great, fearless satirist."

Chicago Sun-Times," March 17, 2016",Richard Roeper, Mr. Rickman was never nominated for an Academy Award and it's probably a long shot for a posthumous supporting actor for this film -- but his work here is a reminder of what a special talent he possessed.
Boston Globe," March 17, 2016",Ty Burr," It's clockwork entertainment, in the end - a precisely calibrated schematic in which every aspect of the ethical quandary balances every other aspect, and the only variable is your own moral compass."
Chicago Daily Herald," March 17, 2016",Dann Gire, What South African director Gavin Hood and his filmmakers do with the military drone drama Eye in the Sky is nothing short of astonishing.
Washington Post," March 17, 2016",Ann Hornaday, This is the rare military drama that conveys both the graphic physical effects of war and its lingering psychic cost.

Seattle Times," March 17, 2016",Moira MacDonald," At times, the film approaches gallows comedy ... perhaps a little too much so; at others, it's a tense, chilling look at a seemingly unbearable choice - refreshingly, without telling its viewers what to think."
RedEye," March 17, 2016",Matt Pais," A thoughtful, slow-building thriller."
Examiner.com," March 16, 2016",Travis Hopson," ...a film that is timely, certainly relevant, but as a thriller it gets bogged down in minutiae that may be authentic but isn't always entertaining. "

Reeling Reviews," March 11, 2016",Robin Clifford, Director Gavin Hood and screenwriter Guy Hibbert have their hearts in the right place in this modern morality play set amidst the ongoing war on terror...
Tolucan Times," March 11, 2016",Tony Medley, Seems like a remake of Gable's 'Command Decision' updated for the 21st Century. The tension crackles as time is a-wastin' while everyone passes the buck. This is exceptionally realistic with a top flight performance by Helen Mirren in Gable's role.
IGN Movies," March 11, 2016",Josh Lasser," It would have been exceptionally easy for Eye in the Sky to take either a pro- or anti-drone warfare stance and simply show the horror of the alternative point of view. Rather than doing that, the movie offers a thoughtful, nuanced middle ground."

Georgia Straight," March 23, 2016",John Lekich, Eye in the Sky provides an intimate look at the moral minefield that accompanies the employment of drone warfare. It's not the first movie to do so. But thanks to a deeply committed cast this one is well worth your time.
Willamette Week," March 23, 2016",Zach Middleton," The effects look cheap, the action scenes are unmemorable, and the plot regularly blows up its own tension-and the audience's interest-with missiles raining ignorantly down from the heavens. "
tonymacklin.net," March 23, 2016",Tony Macklin, It rigs its case on the sentimental side.
Consequence of Sound," March 21, 2016",Dominick Mayer," Eye in the Sky sees, like any good film about warfare, that there are no real victories, and there's no end in sight."
East Bay Express," March 21, 2016",Kelly Vance, Does this much discussion happen with every drone strike?
The Young Folks," March 20, 2016",Jon Espino," The film not only focuses on the political effects of drone warfare, but also the devastating psychological toll it takes on these operators. "

The Australian," March 18, 2016",David Stratton," Eye in the Sky is a disturbing, intelligent and very well crafted contemporary thriller with a solid screenplay by Guy Hibbert and seamless direction."
"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," March 18, 2016",Robert Horton," Plenty of food for thought, if not very subtly done."
PopMatters," March 18, 2016",Cynthia Fuchs," Gavin Hood's movie provides you with more information than any of the participants might have, including glimpses of just who that collateral damage will be."
Cambridge Day," March 18, 2016",Tom Meek," Tight editing (there's never any dislocation in sense of place while locale hopping) and well-framed shots hold the tension, as does Hibbert's well-gamed chess match of statesmanship and foreign policy."
Boston Herald," March 18, 2016",James Verniere," Game of Drones, indeed. Excellent ensemble cast, nerve-shattering, technological high-wire act. Mirren, Rickman (sigh) and Abdi in top form."
Mark Reviews Movies," March 18, 2016",Mark Dujsik," For the foreseeable future, we will be having a debate about the efficacy of drone strikes ... Eye in the Sky establishes itself as an important part of that conversation."

Kansas City Star," March 31, 2016",Robert W. Butler," A taut, well-acted thriller that raises all sorts of moral questions - Hitchcock with a conscience."
Las Vegas Weekly," March 30, 2016",Josh Bell," It's hard to imagine a movie making the audience root for the bombing of a little girl, but Eye in the Sky sure comes close."
Your Movies (cleveland.com)," March 30, 2016",John Urbancich," Maybe best of all, Hood manages to tell his suspenseful tale in a quick-moving 102 minutes. Other, more long-winded filmmakers should take notice."
Junkee," March 30, 2016",Alice McCredie-Dando," Eye in the Sky engages multiple perspectives in examining the factors that play into a drone strike, with the film's focus shifting between the cogs in the machine."
Seven Days," March 30, 2016",Rick Kisonak," Suspense and tension are masterfully deployed. Your knuckles will be white. The edge of your seat will see action for 102 minutes. And you will never think about drones in quite the same way as you did before you saw this timely, electrifying film."
Philadelphia Inquirer," March 27, 2016",Molly Eichel," Eye in the Sky is disturbing, but it's also balanced and ambivalent about what is right."
ReelViews," March 27, 2016",James Berardinelli," Eye in the Sky is compelling, offering the best elements of a drama and a thriller."
ComingSoon.net," March 25, 2016",Joshua Starnes, Strong performances and timely subject matter largely cover up TV movie production quality.
National Post," March 25, 2016",David Berry," The effect of this thriller... is ultimately one of a particularly tense (and well-acted) roundtable: a lot of very good ideas about what to think, but rarely does it ever succeed at hitting below the neck."
Globe and Mail," March 25, 2016",Brad Wheeler," The military and covert war-wagers are getting better and better at killing from farther and farther away, and filmmakers seem to be getting better and better in the drone-warfare genre."
Detroit News," March 25, 2016",Adam Graham," Hood keeps the action tense throughout this nail-biter, which unfolds like a taut stage play. It offers no easy answers, only difficult questions about following orders and the cost of war."
FILMINK (Australia)," March 24, 2016",Mark Demetrius," Eye In The Sky is sporadically sentimental, unrealistic, and overburdened with intrusive soundtrack music. But it gets you in, and it's suspenseful, claustrophobic, and a fairly unusual take on the counter-terrorism sub-genre."
Salt Lake Tribune," March 24, 2016",Sean P. Means, This one entertains while also posing tough questions about whom we choose to kill in order to stifle our fears.
Toronto Sun," March 24, 2016",Liz Braun," Watching battle organized at arm's length is a strange and surreal experience, steeped in dread. When Eye in the Sky eventually touches down to put a viewer right into the centre of the action, emotionally speaking, it's a jarring transition. "
Toronto Star," March 24, 2016",Linda Barnard," This riveting drone thriller is contemporary edge-of-your seat stuff, propelled by a crack cast led by Helen Mirren as single-minded British Col. Katherine Powell."
Austin Chronicle," March 24, 2016",Marc Savlov," Eye in the Sky maintains nerve-racking suspense throughout its running time and explicates some of the unknown nuances of drone warfare. Plus, you know, Alan Rickman is reason enough to see it."
AARP Movies for Grownups," March 23, 2016",Bill Newcott," ""Eye in the Sky"" consists mostly of big-name stars squinting at video monitors and saying, in effect: ""Can we shoot now? How about now? OK, how about now?"""

The List," April 11, 2016",James Mottram," Mirren and Rickman are outstanding, and Hood complements them by juggling theme and pace with aplomb. The result is as thought-provoking as it is nerve-shredding."
Cinemixtape," April 8, 2016",J. Olson," Armed with a terrific cast and suspense and poignancy to spare, [director Gavin Hood's] long-awaited return to independent film is a keeper."
The Straits Times (Singapore)," April 7, 2016",John Lui," Powerful performances from Mirren, Rickman and Aaron Paul as an American drone pilot with a conflicted conscience make this the gold standard for thrillers about what waging war is like when one side has God-like powers of life and death."

The Virginian-Pilot," April 1, 2016",Mal Vincent, The suspense is there. So is the soul-searching.
Cleveland Plain Dealer," April 1, 2016",Michael Heaton, No easy answers are offered in Eye in the Sky. But the many questions it begs will remain with you long after you leave the theater.
Sacramento News & Review," April 1, 2016",Jim Lane," One of the best movies of the year so far -- a riveting, white-knuckle thriller to rank with the best of Hitchcock, and an examination of the morality of drone warfare to rank with the polemical plays of George Bernard Shaw."

Daily Express (UK)," April 17, 2016",Henry Fitzherbert," The picture may be a glorified ""war room"" re-enactment of the sort shown on television but it's so well done it deserves to be seen on the big screen."
Daily Express (UK)," April 17, 2016",Allan Hunter," A drama that forces the audience to think, take sides and examine their own consciences."
Observer (UK)," April 17, 2016",Mark Kermode, A provocatively tense thriller that negotiates the moral minefields of its thorny subject matter in crowd-pleasing fashion.
Movie Talk," April 15, 2016",Jason Best, Alan Rickman adds a wry sardonic note as the high-ranking British army officer advising the vacillating politicians in Whitehall.
Flick Filosopher," April 15, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson, As entertaining on an escapist level as it is irrefutably engaging on a level that is essential for citizens who are players in our political environment.

Daily Mail (UK)," April 14, 2016",Brian Viner," There is plenty to admire, not least the mighty Mirren, who manages, aged 70, to be entirely convincing as a tough old soldier. And it's nice, if sad, to see Rickman one last time."
The Arts Desk," April 14, 2016",Saskia Baron," Eye in the Sky is an old-fashioned court-room-style drama... Its aim is to force the audience to confront the ethics of remote-control warfare, and encourage us to despair at self-interested politicians endlessly referring up to absent superiors."
Independent (UK)," April 14, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab," What's refreshing, though, is how nuanced the film's approach remains. There is no simple minded resolution here and it is inevitable that there will be blood on somebody's hands by the final reel."
New Zealand Herald," April 14, 2016",Peter Calder, Sharp editing and slick camerawork emphasise the disjuncture between the brightly sunlit killing field and the dark office where political caution wrestles military urgency.

Laramie Movie Scope," May 2, 2016",Robert Roten," Only very hard-hearted people will not be moved by this film, in which there are no easy answers. There is one missing piece of drone warfare question here: Does drone warfare create more enemies than it kills? This film doesn't go there."

Associated Press," April 27, 2016",Jake Coyle," It's a lean, Lumet-like thriller that puts the moral calculus of drone warfare in its crosshairs."
News.com.au," April 27, 2016",Wenlei Ma, Director Gavin Hood has achieved something few could -- he made what is essentially 100 minutes of people standing in rooms and staring at screens incredibly compelling. It's a master class in suspense.

Sunday Independent (Ireland)," April 18, 2016",Hilary A White," Unsurprisingly, there is ample philosophical and political meat to Eye In The Sky. As a crisis drama it also scores highly, rotating from one set to the next and linking the tense energies and tones of a superb cast."

London Evening Standard," April 17, 2016",David Sexton," It's a tense thriller about a single action, taking place in Nairobi, commanded from London, albeit piloted from Las Vegas - and its presentation of the moral dilemma about whether to strike or not is complex and wrenching."
