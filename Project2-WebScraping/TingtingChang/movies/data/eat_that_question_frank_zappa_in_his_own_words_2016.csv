The List," November 28, 2016",Eddie Harrison," Zappa and his music may rarely have been fashionable, but this documentary provides a valuable and permanent record of the man himself; his musical canon can be enjoyed elsewhere."
El Pais (Spain)," November 23, 2016",Javier Ocaña," An interesting French documentary about Zappa, that truly captures his essence. [Full review in Spanish]"

We Got This Covered," August 6, 2016",Will Ashton," Eat That Question is more insightful than illuminating, but that's what makes it such a fitting tribute to Frank Zappa's eccentric genius."
Charlotte Observer," August 4, 2016",Lawrence Toppman," When son Dweezil was born, Zappa filled in the spot for ""religion"" on the birth certificate with ""musician."" ""Eat That Question"" shows how true that was."
Orlando Weekly," August 4, 2016",Matt Gorney," Many of the interviews play like conversational grindcore - truculence branded with a scowl and an iconic mustache, soul patch and stringy black hair. It's a good show for everyone."

Consequence of Sound," June 29, 2016",Collin Brennan," Zappa's fans and true believers will already be familiar with many of these clips, so the most Eat That Question can offer is fresh context. The fact that it seems to actively avoid contextualizing, then, is a problem."

Entertainment Weekly," June 24, 2016",Leah Greenblatt," Eat That Question is a fitting title for a movie that never quite gets at the mystery of Zappa's contradictions, even as it stacks up intimate live clips and fierce monologues from a rich trove of vintage interviews."
RogerEbert.com," June 24, 2016",Glenn Kenny," The movie put me on a major Zappa listening jag ... which makes it sound like a fan-only proposition. It kind of might be, but I hope it isn't."

Groucho Reviews," July 9, 2016",Peter Canavese," From the evidence of Thorsten Schütte's found-footage documentary...Zappa saw the interview as sometime endurance test, sometime amusement, and all-the-time chess match he could never lose, played as it was against lesser lights."
National Post," July 8, 2016",Matt Bobkin," The film can be frustrating for those who need a bit of context, but doesn't add anything new for the experts either."
Newsweek," July 8, 2016",Zach Schonfeld," Although there is some nice performance footage, the film isn't a good way for a beginner to get a grip on Zappa's music, which spans from proto-punk to classical. It is a nice journey through Zappa's mind for the already converted."

SF Weekly," June 30, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," Frank Zappa has always been an acquired taste, and Thorsten Schütte's otherwise terrific documentary Eat That Question: Frank Zappa in His Own Words may not be the best place for a neophyte to start."
Washington Post," June 30, 2016",Mark Jenkins," Amusing and even edifying, although it is also unlikely to make converts out of those who just don't get Zappa's pastiche of juvenile parody and sophisticated songwriting, derived from rock, jazz and 20th-century experimental music."
San Francisco Chronicle," June 29, 2016",G. Allen Johnson," ""Eat That Question"" will please Zappa fans, but it's not just for fans only. It serves as a great introduction to an important artist who was ahead of his time."
