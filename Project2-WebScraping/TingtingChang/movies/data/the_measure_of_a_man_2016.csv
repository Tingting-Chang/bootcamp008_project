Total Film," January 2, 2017",Jamie Graham, Watch Adam McKay's flash and funny financial crisis movie The Big Short and then turn to The Measure of a Man to see the human cost.
Sunday Times (UK)," December 19, 2016",Edward Porter," Stéphane Brizé's absorbing but unspectacular film stars Vincent Lindon as a working-class Joe who experiences the indignities of unemployment and, later, those of a soul-corroding job."
Film Inquiry," December 7, 2016",Mike Daringer," There are far better films, including French ones, that tackle the same thematic ideas as The Measure of a Man and actually do something with them."
Seattle Times," July 21, 2016",Moira MacDonald," Stéphane Brizé's ""The Measure of a Man"" feels so real, you're almost startled when it's over - it seems as if this French drama about a middle-aged husband and father facing unemployment should just go on, as life tends to do."
It's Just Movies," July 12, 2016",Ron Wilkinson, A piece of narrative fiction that borders on agit-prop in its fervent plea for the worker.
Urban Cinefile," July 9, 2016",Andrew L. Urban," Lindon draws us in beautifully to his character, even though there isn't much to explore. It all relies on the final scene, a weak payoff to justify the title"
Urban Cinefile," July 9, 2016",Louise Keller," Subtle, voyeuristic and engrossing, with a stellar naturalistic performance by Lindon, this is a film for the discerning cinema lover"
Brooklyn Magazine," July 8, 2016",Elise Nakhnikian," The Measure of a Man is a triumph of realistic cinema, and a dirge for a blue-collar European worker left stranded after a once-solid job has melted away."
The Sunday Age," July 5, 2016",Craig Mathieson," Built around long, unsparing takes that are scrupulously observant ... the movie makes clear the importance of employment as a means of not just economic but mental underpinning."
Reeling Reviews," July 5, 2016",Laura Clifford," ""The Measure of a Man' poses an important question - what are we losing as humans in a world that champions financial profit above all?"
Sydney Morning Herald," June 29, 2016",Paul Byrnes," No question, it is a fine performance. Lindon has a minimalist style, a shaggy dog look, and a barely suppressed working-stiff rage that gives the film some grit."
The Australian," June 24, 2016",David Stratton," The subject is one that will be familiar to working-class people all over the world, and is presented by Brize and his co-writer Olivier Gorce without a hint of compromise or sentimentality."
Empire Magazine," June 5, 2016",Patrick Peters," Uncompromisingly authentic, impeccably played and quietly compelling."
Observer (UK)," June 5, 2016",Wendy Ide," Impassive on the surface, Lindon reveals the weight of despair in the dragging steps, the bowed shoulders, even the droop of his character's moustache."
Irish Independent," June 3, 2016",Paul Whitington," Vincent Lindon is staggeringly good in the part, burying so deep into his demanding role that actor and character merge and become indistinguishable."
Sight and Sound," June 2, 2016",Ginette Vincendeau," Brizé has cleverly cast people with an extraordinary confidence in front of the camera, which means that Lindon's customary minimalist yet charismatic performance style blends wonderfully with the rest of the cast."
San Francisco Chronicle," June 2, 2016",Mick LaSalle," As 15 minutes turns into a half hour, and then an hour, and then more, viewers will get tired of nodding their heads. The movie makes a point, but it doesn't build on it."
Guardian," June 2, 2016",Peter Bradshaw," A tough, clear-sighted, compassionate film."
Little White Lies," June 2, 2016",Philip Concannon, An absorbing and enraging look at a broken system.
SF Weekly," June 1, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," [The] picture isn't as much of a study of masculinity as its domestic release title The Measure of a Man would suggest; the original French title, La Loi du Marché, translates as The Law of the Market, which is far more appropriate on multiple levels."
Spirituality and Practice," April 14, 2016",Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, A remarkable portrait of what it's like to live in the prison of unemployment.
AV Club," April 14, 2016",Mike D'Angelo, The Measure Of A Man's beating heart is Lindon's performance ...
New York Post," April 14, 2016",Farran Smith Nehme," French director Stéphane Brizé films in lingering takes, with Lindon in almost every shot, and the actor is wonderful, able to convey Thierry's conflict even when his back is to the camera."
NOW Toronto," April 14, 2016",Radheyan Simonpillai," Tackling the same dehumanizing economy the Dardennes dealt with in Two Days, One Night, director Stéphane Brizé is far more schematic, leaving little room for any emotion -except despair. "
Film Journal International," April 14, 2016",Tomris Laffly, [A] sublimely affecting humanist drama.
New Yorker," April 11, 2016",Richard Brody," The movie becomes a masterly quasi-documentary police procedural, filled with hypnotically lurid technical and intimate details of the detection and punishment of crime, however petty."
Compuserve," April 5, 2016",Harvey S. Karten," As naturalistic as a movie can get, this features an astonishing, if restrained, performance by Vincent Lindon."
Hollywood Reporter," March 28, 2016",Jordan Mintzer," Teaming up once again for a film that leaves many things unsaid while saying a whole lot, director Stephane Brize and star Vincent Lindon offer up an impressive foray into social drama."
Variety," March 28, 2016",Scott Foundas, Low-key but powerfully affecting.
Guardian," March 28, 2016",Jordan Hoffman," Brize's laconic, observational style is a total mismatch for a movie that wants to suggest that it's totally OK to steal on the job."
Screen International," March 28, 2016",Lisa Nesselson, An unflinching look at deteriorating working -- and non-working -- conditions for the common man and woman in contemporary France.
Slant Magazine," March 28, 2016",Chuck Bowen," The director's greatest asset, though, is Lindon's sad, weathered, haunted face, which invests the film with omniscient heartache, offering evidence of the sense of self that's lost in the bureaucratic labyrinth that many of us call home."
The Playlist," March 28, 2016",Jessica Kiang, Stéphane Brizé's [film] The Measure of a Man is a terrific addition to the low-key social realist genre that is unavoidably dominated by the films of the Dardenne brothers.
CineVue," March 28, 2016",John Bleasdale, The Measure of a Man is solid social document that offers insight into quiet lives lived by those who don't give in - despite every good reason -- to desperation.
Film-Forward.com," December 5, 2015",Kent Turner," It was no surprise that Vincent Lindon won the best actor prize for The Measure of a Man. At its premiere, he received a five-minute standing ovation."
Independent (UK)," June 1, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab, Lindon brings gravitas and pathos to his role as the French everyman trying to stay afloat in a society that has spurned him.
CineVue," June 1, 2016",Matthew Anderson," A sobering, quietly defiant and affirmative piece of realist filmmaking."
Time Out," May 31, 2016",Geoff Andrew," Compassionate, engrossing and utterly relevant."
The List," May 31, 2016",Allan Hunter," It is sustained throughout by the depth of feeling in Lindon's granite-like, hangdog performance - as he steps into the shoes of a man forced to decide what is truly important in his life."
Christian Science Monitor," May 20, 2016",Peter Rainer," It's Lindon's achievement that, even when Thierry is at his most impassive, we always know what is going on inside his head."
Los Angeles Times," May 19, 2016",Robert Abele, It's a miniature portrait of quotidian desperation that nevertheless speaks to the collective psychic moan of job-seekers and those barely holding on everywhere.
What Culture," May 18, 2016",Alex Leadbeater, You could say he's discovering the measure of a man. You could also say this is a head-bangingly dull movie full of nothing.
Montreal Gazette," May 12, 2016",T'Cha Dunlevy, Lindon's performance is a master class in restraint and internalizing emotion.
National Review," April 26, 2016",Armond White," The Measure of a Man...charts a global unease in the case of a working-class white male trying to stay afloat in Europe's unsteady economy...Brizé's unplotted, naturalistic style highlights a common man's series of on-going indignities. "
Chicago Reader," April 21, 2016",J. R. Jones," It's a memorable portrait of a man whose dignity and humanity are slowly pried away from him, until he snatches them back at the end."
Newcity," April 19, 2016",Ray Pride," Brizé doggedly stays with hangdog Lindon through thin and thin. Bureaucracy bites at the decent man, job interviews chew him through. Frustration rests upon frustration... melancholy rests on his shoulders almost as weightily as the droop of his mustache."
Brooklyn Magazine," April 19, 2016",Benjamin Mercer," As a portrait of global-capitalist labor as inevitably compromising, it works very well indeed. "
Ex-Press.com," April 19, 2016",Jay Stone," A low-key study - quotidian in every respect - about the small agonies, humiliations, and failures of a person who is being left behind by a heartless economy."
Globe and Mail," April 15, 2016",Nathalie Atkinson, On this small scale and rather ordinary canvas the human drama is keenly felt.
RogerEbert.com," April 15, 2016",Peter Sobczynski," ""The Measure of a Man"" may be a hard film to watch at times, but with Lindon's great performance at its center, it is one from which you cannot look away."
Toronto Star," April 15, 2016",Peter Howell, Stéphane Brizé's humanist drama tallies the slow drip of dignity in a downsized world.
New York Times," April 14, 2016",Manohla Dargis, Mr. Brizé transforms one individual's story into a social tragedy.
indieWire," April 14, 2016",David Ehrlich," A standout at Cannes 2015 (where Lindon deservedly won the prize for Best Actor), Brizé's ode to the working stiff is a sobering corrective for anyone who's ever said 'It's not personal, it's just business.'"
Paste Magazine," April 14, 2016",Tim Grierson," In its own modest way, this quietly crushing drama is not just about how we judge a man -- by his work, by his ability to provide -- but also how men judge themselves using similar criteria. "
rec.arts.movies.reviews," April 14, 2016",Louis Proyect, Astonishingly perceptive take on what it means to be a victim of capitalist progress. An amazingly political film from a director who has not made such a film in the past. Not to be missed.
