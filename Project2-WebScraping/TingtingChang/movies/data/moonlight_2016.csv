The Skinny," February 6, 2017",Josh Slater-Williams," An authentic, complex, operatic, boldly expressive meditation on the circularity of time, alongside identity and love in all their forms."
Urban Cinefile," February 5, 2017",Louise Keller," While the muffled dialogue and slang may stop you from understanding every word, one thing is sure, there is no mistaking the powerful statement this exploration of the Afro American male makes....

El antepenúltimo mohicano," February 1, 2017",Alberto Sáez Villarino," A film that insists on a reflective narrative advance, with no special effects of great spectacularity, providing an alternative vision of that tragic determinism that dictates the life of the African American ghetto inexorably.

Screen International," September 4, 2016",Tim Grierson," An indelible portrait of an imperilled life, ""Moonlight"" is a devastating depiction of masculinity, race and identity.

The Playlist," September 2, 2016",Gregory Ellwood," There have simply not been enough films about the gay experience of African-Americans or other people of color for that matter.

Slate," October 20, 2016",Dana Stevens, Jenkins mounts no soapboxes and brandishes no manifestos in his attempt to illuminate the inner life of this troubled boy turned teenager turned man. Instead he shows us the love that other characters feel for Chiron ...

Associated Press," October 21, 2016",Lindsey Bahr," Hopefully it doesn't take Jenkins another eight years to make a film. But we can take comfort in the very strong likelihood that, even if it does, it will be well worth the wait."
amNewYork," October 21, 2016",Robert Levin," This is a movie set in an on-screen world that feels familiar, the American inner city, in this case one of Miami's toughest neighborhoods. But it meticulously defies the conventions typically associated with movies about that milieu."

Salt Lake Tribune," November 10, 2016",Sean P.

Combustible Celluloid," November 9, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," Jenkins's setups and scenes are remarkably perceptive, and quietly textured."

National Review," November 4, 2016",Armond White," Moonlight's best moments come in Little's reaction to Juan's affection, but later scenes of Chiron's erotic confusion and Black's maudlin self-pity (he wears muscular drag yet succumbs to weakness) insist that viewers feel sorry for black gay males."
