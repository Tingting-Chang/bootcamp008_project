Cinencuentro," February 1, 2017",Sebastian Zavala Kahn, A film that proposes a plausible scenario and that delights to surprise us with different plot twists and fascinating discoveries by its protagonists. [Full review in Spanish]
Bangkok Post," January 12, 2017",Kong Rithdee," Arrival, which aims to touch rather than to excite, looks inward. The film about aliens, it proposes, is in fact a way to look at the human race, the good and the bad in us (mostly the bad)."
The Straits Times (Singapore)," January 11, 2017",John Lui," Like all good science fiction, Arrival is about one big idea taken to a satisfying conclusion."
South China Morning Post," January 9, 2017",Richard James Havis, An unusually delicate tale about how to cope with an alien arrival on Earth.
National Review," January 9, 2017",Armond White," Though a second-rate, semi-profound art movie, Arrival is nonetheless an ambitious demonstration of how the media manipulate our perception and our experience."
Film Comment Magazine," January 3, 2017",Devika Girish," A Spielberg-Nolan lovechild of sorts, wondrous and mind-bending in equal parts, Denis Villeneuve's latest is a quintessential science-fiction blockbuster steeped in genre traditions and made singular by Amy Adams's transporting performance."
Washington City Paper," January 2, 2017",Tricia Olszewski," Arrival may offer a few too many metaphors to keep some viewers engaged. But it's guaranteed to stick in your mind a fair amount longer than, say, Men in Black 3."
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," January 1, 2017",Brian Gibson," It's remarkable how far Villeneuve, too, has travelled -- from minor but impressive Quebec features to big-budget filmmaking that's turned mainstream genre-fare into thrilling, atmosphere-rich cinema."
Huffington Post," January 1, 2017",Derek Malcolm," The film is not a colourful one, with suitably muted cinematography and a sense of realism many such stories eschew. Maybe that's not the best news for the box-office but it makes for a more intelligent movie of the genre all the same."
Hindustan Times," December 31, 2016",Rashid Irani, This film cements Villeneuve's reputation as one of the finest filmmakers of his time.
Daily Star," December 31, 2016",Andy Lea," In it's own way, this beautifully shot, brilliant acted and smartly written movie is as exciting as Independence Day or War of the Worlds."
Columbus Alive," December 30, 2016",Brad Keefe," Arrival may not be the sci-fi movie we deserve, but it's the one we need right now."
Cine Vértigo," December 27, 2016",Ernesto Diezmartinez," With Arrival, Villeneuve and Heisserer have delivered us the 2001: Space Odyssey (1968) of the new century. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Sunday Age," December 27, 2016",Craig Mathieson," Most aliens-on-Earth movies move towards destruction, usually of the planet-wide kind, but the crux of Arrival is creation: the writing of a word, the beginning of a bond, the start of a life."
"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," December 26, 2016",John Beifuss, How to communicate? The challenge faced by every artist is dramatized as a semantic conundrum and amplified as an existential dilemma ('What is your purpose on Earth?') in this moody science fiction film.
ABC Radio Brisbane," December 25, 2016",Matthew Toomey," Don't go in thinking you can sit back, relax, and enjoy some action-heavy entertainment. Your mind will be put to work. "
Blog de cine," December 22, 2016",Mikel Zorrilla, A film that goes beyond everything and also combines in a masterly way its cerebral side with strong emotional roots. [Full review in Spanish]
Cinemaphile.org," December 22, 2016",David Keyes," In times when audiences are trained to be enamored by special effects and simplified narrative patterns, Arrival is an unusual discovery: a movie that requires us to think beyond the polished surface and contemplate our own place in the universe."
Daily Dead," December 21, 2016",Heather Wixson," Arrival's narrative takes an unbelievable turn (and I mean that in the best way possible), opening up the film's story in an emotional way that I was not expecting, leaving me absolutely stunned."
En Filme," December 20, 2016",Luis Fernando Galván, A suspense film that turns out to be more complex and emotional than expected. [Full review in Spanish]
Screen International," September 1, 2016",Fionnuala Halligan," In a crowded genre, Villeneuve's picture is distinguished chiefly for being so richly realised and executed, gifted with an almost symbiotic score by his regular collaborator Johann Johannsson."
TheWrap," September 1, 2016",Alonso Duralde," A fairly chilly, cerebral bit of business, from its beautifully tamped-down cinematography (by modern master Bradford Young) to Jóhann Jóhannsson's ethereal score."
Uproxx," September 10, 2016",Mike Ryan, Arrival is quite pretentious ... but it's the good kind. It's the smart kind.
RogerEbert.com," September 10, 2016",Brian Tallerico," A film that forces viewers to reconsider that which makes us truly human, and the impact of grief on that timeline of existence."
Den of Geek," September 10, 2016",Edward Douglas, A cerebral and emotionally resonant examination of language through the genre of science fiction.
NOW Toronto," September 9, 2016",Norman Wilner," This is hard science fiction made by an artist - which means big questions, impossible concepts and difficult choices."
Independent (UK)," September 9, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab, It's heartening to encounter a science fiction thriller that is ready to deal with abstract ideas.
Vanity Fair," September 9, 2016",Richard Lawson," Arrival has the heft of a literary airport novel, with enough poetry and pathos to elevate it above Michael Crichton."
ScreenCrush," September 9, 2016",Matt Singer," Arrival is a smart film, but it's not a cold or clinical one."
Film Freak Central," September 6, 2016",Walter Chaw," It's the fulfillment of what great fiction can do, particularly genre fiction."
Collider," September 4, 2016",Brian Formo," For a film about language, Villeneuve smartly relies most on the cinematic language: cinematography, production design, visual effects and musical scoring. His collaborators flex some of the best work of the year in every cinematic realm."
Times (UK)," September 2, 2016",Kate Muir," Less Close Encounters of the Third Kind and more Linguistic Encounters of the Academic Kind, this is a sci-fi movie with intelligence, cerebral and emotional."
Daily Mail (UK)," September 2, 2016",Brian Viner," It's ingenious, and brilliantly directed, shot and scored, all of which bodes well for Villeneuve's next project, a keenly-awaited sequel to 1982's Blade Runner."
London Evening Standard," September 1, 2016",David Sexton," Compellingly made, this is science fiction of substance, which is promising for the forthcoming new Blade Runner."
Time Out," September 1, 2016",Dave Calhoun, Plenty of smart ideas and bravura visuals.
TIME Magazine," September 1, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," Arrival gives us a lot to take in, and the picture is big, somber and grand, if in the end somewhat sterile."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," September 1, 2016",Robbie Collin," Beautiful, provocative allegory that can bump your whole worldview off balance. "
The Film Stage," September 1, 2016",Rory O'Connor," A high-stakes, hard sci-fi action film."
CineVue," September 1, 2016",John Bleasdale," Arrival is a close encounter with the best of intelligent, thoughtful science fiction."
Guardian," September 1, 2016",Peter Bradshaw, Both heartfelt and very entertaining.
The Playlist," September 1, 2016",Jessica Kiang," It's a monolith, a megalith, but like the gigantic alien craft that comes to rest somewhere above Montana at the start of the film, despite its immensity it hovers elegantly overhead. The film defies gravity."
Hollywood Reporter," September 1, 2016",David Rooney," Anchored by an internalized performance from Amy Adams rich in emotional depth, this is a grownup sci-fi drama that sustains fear and tension while striking affecting chords on love and loss."
We Live Entertainment," October 12, 2016",Fred Topel, A captivating story about an admirable protagonist in a fantastic position at the heart of a wonderful situation could actually make the world a better place.
The List," October 12, 2016",Nikki Baughan, It celebrates the very best traits of humanity ... while also encouraging us to confront life's biggest questions. This is filmmaking at its most powerful and profound.
Cinema em Cena," October 6, 2016",Pablo Villaça," Arrival can be mentioned in the same breath as 2001, Solaris and Contact. [Full review in Portuguese.]"
Digital Spy," September 29, 2016",Mayer Nissim," Like all the best sci-fi, Arrival isn't really about aliens. It's about people. It's about ideas. But instead of hammering you over the head with those ideas in a bid to show how clever-clever it is, the film lets the story and characters do the talking."
Film School Rejects," September 23, 2016",Rob Hunter," Denis Villeneuve's latest is smart, hopeful, and intimately devastating science fiction."
ComingSoon.net," September 22, 2016",Alan Cerny, Arrival is one of the best films of the year.
Flavorwire," September 18, 2016",Jason Bailey, The sheer emotional heft is downright staggering. Movies like this are what I'm here for.
Slant Magazine," September 17, 2016",Jake Cole," With Arrival, Denis Villeneuve communicates the wonder of a Steven Spielberg alien movie within a decidedly hard sci-fi milieu."
Nerdist," September 16, 2016",Noah Gittell," A film of rare vision and beauty, Arrival is easily the most intelligent blockbuster released this year-and maybe any year."
PopMatters," September 15, 2016",Stephen Mayne," Watching Adams attempt to teach the aliens English is remarkably gripping, aided by some genuinely breath-taking shots."
Rolling Stone Mexico," September 14, 2016",Arturo Aguilar," The combination of science and emotions that Nolan wanted to deeply explore with Interstellar, it's fully reached in this film. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Mary Sue," September 13, 2016",Sasha James," Arrival proves to be much more than the standard first contact flick, and Villeneuve maintains his track record of turning all expectations of genre on their head."
Cinema Movil," September 13, 2016",Oscar Uriel, The kind of movie that Christopher Nolan wanted to accomplish with Interstellar. [Full review in Spanish]
Otroscines.com," September 13, 2016",Carlota Mosegui, An existentialist and theorical film similar to Inception or Interestellar. [Full review in Spanish]
Dork Shelf," September 12, 2016",Jason Gorber," Quite simply, Arrival is one of the most extraordinary, affecting films of the year, a delicate balance between intellect and passion, finding ways to entertain while opening one's mind up to possibilities."
The Verge," September 12, 2016",Bryan Bishop, The extraordinary success of Arrival is that it combines its bravura style and grand sci-fi questions with tremendous emotional intelligence and a heart so full it's ready to burst.
JoBlo's Movie Emporium," September 12, 2016",Chris Bumbray, Sophisticated sci-fi - stunningly well-crafted and acted. 
Consequence of Sound," September 11, 2016",Sarah Kurchak," Be patient. Arrival falls just short of perfect thanks to an expositional hiccup midway through the film and a climax that hinges on a borderline-hokey revelation, but the end will more than justify these ever so slightly sloppy means."
HeyUGuys," September 10, 2016",Stefan Pape," Villeneuve has crafted a compelling tale which explores humanity's flaws, our own fears and impatience, in a way that is scarily realistic."
We Got This Covered," September 10, 2016",Matt Donato," Arrival challenges viewers to a brainier sci-fi conundrum than they're used to, which makes for an intellectual breath of fresh air."
Student Edge," November 7, 2016",Simon Miraudo," A linguist, a physicist and a colonel walk into an alien spaceship. No joke. Just brilliance... Arrival is miraculous."
Metro," November 7, 2016",Matt Prigge," Brainy yet expensive, ""Arrival"" flaunts its hope to be more like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"": slow, measured and filled with moments where the audience is supposed to collectively hush, open their jaws in unison and go awe."
Forbes," November 7, 2016",Scott Mendelson," It has big ideas and an unconventional structure, and it is rather engaging when it dives deep into the trade of language translation. "
Brooklyn Magazine," November 7, 2016",Jesse Hassenger, This isn't Close Encounters's wonder about the vastness of the universe; it's something trickier and more bittersweet about how we make our life decisions.
Little White Lies," November 7, 2016",Adam Woodward," Given that personal trauma is the prevailing throughline of Denis Villeneuve's filmmaking career so far, it's no surprise to find Arrival anchored by a familiar narrative motif."
New Yorker," November 7, 2016",Anthony Lane," So sure is the stride of the narrative, and so bracing the air of expectation, that you feel yourself, like Louise, beginning to spin, and barely able to catch your breath."
Black Girl Nerds," November 6, 2016",Lauren Warren," For fans of dark, cerebral, Christopher Nolan type sci-fi or even time-related sci-fi this will be right up your alley."
Urban Cinefile," November 5, 2016",Louise Keller," In a breathtaking performance, Amy Adams grounds this hypnotizing sci-fi drama from Incendies director Denis Villeneuve, in which communication, purpose and time are key"
Village Voice," November 4, 2016",Bilge Ebiri," For most of its running time, Arrival is entrancing, intimate, and moving - a sci-fi movie that looks not up at the stars but rather deep within."
Graffiti With Punctuation," November 2, 2016",Cameron Williams, Manages to transcend its genre elements and get to the heart of our existence. It exemplifies the power of love and sorrow to work as markers for our lives.
Empire Magazine," November 2, 2016",Dan Jolin," Arrival is Villeneuve's The Day The Earth Stood Still or Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, and somehow he makes it true to the tropes while also feeling like something new."
Correcámara," October 28, 2016",Miguel Ravelo," An intense film that make us consider not only what it means the arrival of the visitors, but how this will alter our reality. [Full review in Spanish]"
Chicago Sun-Times," October 27, 2016",Bill Stamets, An outstanding sci-fi film with an intergalactic language lesson.
AwardsCircuit.com," October 26, 2016",Clayton Davis," With performances that have spanned a vast net of quirky and strong supporting players (i.e. ""Junebug"" and ""The Fighter""), Amy Adams has emerged as a fully realized leading lady."
Eye for Film," October 25, 2016",Amber Wilkinson," The themes of the film are intricate, navigating ideas of love, loss and perception but Eric Heisserer - adapting from the short story The Story Of Your Life by Ted Chiang - keeps the exposition manageable. "
Total Film," October 24, 2016",Matt Maytum, A super-smart sci-fi that'll blow your mind and have you on the edge of your seat without recourse to explosions or souped-up fighter jets.
The Arts Desk," October 14, 2016",Adam Sweeting," All this theoretical stuff is offset by some nicely unfussy performances... Still, the flick could use a little less conversation and a little more action."
The Skinny," October 14, 2016",Jamie Dunn, Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is that rare beast: an awe-inspiring sci-fi that delivers both spectacle and smarts.
International Business Times," October 13, 2016",Amy West, [Villeneuve] pushes the boundaries on what a sci-fi film really can be.
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," October 12, 2016",Josef Braun, Some grossly overstated dialogue keeps an immensely fascinating story and inventive visualization of a human-alien struggle to communicate from touching our tenderest sci-fi cinema soft-spots.
Film Journal International," November 9, 2016",Daniel Eagan," ...[A] message drama disguised as a science-fiction adventure. Somber and slow-paced, it has been engineered more for the mainstream than fanboys."
New York Daily News," November 9, 2016",Allen Salkin," Adams is convincing and smart-seeming, bringing appropriate queasiness to the position of being a college professor drawn into a rough military world."
FILMINK (Australia)," November 9, 2016",Matthew Lowe," ...a more thoughtful, more intelligent science fiction film than the mainstream usually offers. "
CraveOnline," November 8, 2016",Witney Seibold," No writer or wordsmith or anyone who has studied language will be able to resist this film. In the eyes of Arrival, language can do more than connect disparate peoples, but change our very perspective on everything."
MovieWeb," November 8, 2016",Julian Roman," Arrival is unlike any science fiction film you have seen. It builds like a slow boil into a deeply cerebral, emotionally expansive journey. "
San Jose Mercury News," November 8, 2016",Tony Hicks," Arrival arrives at a good time, as something of a salve for the ugly discourse going on and a reminder to us that thinking big is really worthwhile."
Charlotte Observer," November 8, 2016",Lawrence Toppman, I have seen no movie to which I felt more deeply connected this year. But I won't tell you exactly why. To discuss most particulars of this movie is to defeat its purpose.
Groucho Reviews," November 8, 2016",Peter Canavese," A science-fiction masterpiece that's largely about our perceptions of time and our struggles to communicate...unexpectedly romantic and profound in its deeper concerns, by exploring the happy-sad nature of existence itself, of being born to die."
Flick Filosopher," November 8, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson," Intelligent, intense, grownup science fiction that will thrill genre lovers and satisfy fans of moving human drama. A beautiful, thought-provoking film."
SSG Syndicate," November 8, 2016",Susan Granger," Enlightening, inspiring, sci-fi allegory for our times - one of the year's best!"
Irish Times," November 8, 2016",Donald Clarke, The film develops an emotional undercurrent that becomes properly overwhelming in the final reel.
Us Weekly," November 8, 2016",Mara Reinstein," The sci-fi thriller not only subverts expectations in brilliant ways, it explores deeply felt themes of life, loss and love. In other words, it's light-years away from Independence Day 3. "
Slant Magazine," November 8, 2016",Sam C. Mac, The film's searching images counterpoint the hyper-articulate methodology of its characters' sense of imbalance and uncertainty.
CinemaBlend.com," November 8, 2016",Sean O'Connell," Arrival deserves our attention for being one of the best-paced, expertly shot and awe-inspiring sci-fi dramas to arrive in theaters in quite some time."
USA Today," November 8, 2016",Brian Truitt, Arrival is such a beautiful and thought-provoking film that it almost singlehandedly makes up for every bad aliens-coming-to-Earth film you've ever seen.
New York Magazine/Vulture," November 8, 2016",David Edelstein," Much of Arrival - the part that sticks closest to its source, egghead sci-fi cult figure Ted Chiang's ""Story of Your Life"" - is an eerie, tantalizing, altogether superb puzzler."
Compuserve," November 7, 2016",Harvey S. Karten, Cerebral sci-fi with a Spielbergian sense of wonder.
indieWire," November 7, 2016",Ben Croll," Arrival has its heart in the right place. Who doesn't want smart sci-fi? Who wants to argue with a big budget drama about linguistics? And though the film is not more than sum of its parts, well, those parts are pretty great."
IGN Movies," November 7, 2016",Chris Tilly," Arrival is an alien invasion movie for grown-ups; one that's lacking in action, explosions and all-out war, but heavy on tension, drama, and raw emotion."
Radio Times," November 7, 2016",Stephen Carty," If you like thoughtful, cerebral sci-fi films that are driven by ideas, you will be in for a treat."
Parade Magazine," November 10, 2016",Neil Pond," A whip-smart sci-fi movie that powers through strongly and confidently on character, an emotional human story and a performance, instead of special effects."
Bullz-Eye.com," November 10, 2016",Jack Giroux," Arrival is arguably the most emotional, thought-provoking and visceral experience [Villeneuve has] crafted yet."
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," November 10, 2016",Cary Darling," Arrival is at its best when pregnant with the suspense of the possible, when the unidentified stationary objects bear no trace of their intentions. But the film becomes less intriguing as the story's direction moves from teasingly opaque to crystal-clear."
Movie Nation," November 10, 2016",Roger Moore, Cerebral. Serene. Entrancing. 
AV Club," November 10, 2016",A.A. Dowd," Arrival has come, like a visitor from the cosmos, to blow minds and break hearts."
Seattle Times," November 10, 2016",Moira MacDonald," So much of the pleasure of Denis Villeneuve's poignant science-fiction drama ""Arrival"" lies in watching Amy Adams figure things out."
The Standard," November 10, 2016",Matt Neal, Remember all that crap at the end of Interstellar where it tried to get clever but failed horribly? This pulls it off.
Concrete Playground," November 9, 2016",Tom Glasson, A terrific example of how to put the 'science' back into 'sci-fi' without compromising pace or action. 
ABC Radio (Australia)," November 9, 2016",CJ Johnson," Feels deeply, cloyingly influenced by others. It's the last act of Close Encounters of the Third Kind meets Contact meets Inception / Interstellar meets The Tree of Life ... tries too hard to make you cry to actually make you cry. "
ReelViews," November 9, 2016",James Berardinelli," If Arrival succeeds at the box office, it will shine as a beacon in favor of not dumbing down every production to appease the distracted and disinterested masses."
Philadelphia Inquirer," November 9, 2016",Steven Rea," Arrival is at once majestic and melancholy. It's a grand endeavor, and Adams, at the center of it all, brings pluck and smarts and a deep-seated sorrow to her role. This is her movie, no doubt."
Film Ireland Magazine," November 9, 2016",Sarah Cullen, Arrival never fully escapes from the bounds of its source material.
Cleveland Plain Dealer," November 9, 2016",Michael Heaton, It can seem at times intellectually impenetrable and breathily pretentious. But a movie that makes you think? What a novel idea.
Associated Press," November 9, 2016",Mark Kennedy, [Adams] delivers a heart-wrenchingly beautiful performance using her ability to communicate a half-dozen emotions just standing still... But director Denis Villeneuve sometimes gets lost in repetition and blind alleys.
New Zealand Herald," November 9, 2016",Russell Baillie, Adams' performance as Dr Louise Banks is terrific. She's the affecting emotional core of this. Especially once she starts her own close encounters with the inhabitants of the ship hovering above rural Montana.
The Movie Minute," November 9, 2016",Joanna Langfield," Elegant and ambitious, this sci-fi mystery is designed to take on life's biggest questions in the most intimate way. "
Common Sense Media," November 9, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," This deeply thoughtful, profoundly compassionate sci-fi movie beautifully mixes realism with a sense of wonder. It keeps its mysteries at bay, and, amazingly, doesn't disappoint when all is revealed. "
Herald Sun (Australia)," November 9, 2016",Leigh Paatsch, This rather wonderful science-fiction drama is very much a next-century companion piece to Steven Spielberg's 1977 classic Close Encounters Of the Third Kind.
Daily Telegraph (Australia)," November 9, 2016",Vicky Roach, Arrival is reaching for something it can't quite grab hold of. But it comes a whole lot closer than most.
New York Observer," November 9, 2016",Rex Reed," Arrival is a weird flick, slow and tedious, too metaphysical for Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone and most likely to appeal to people who like to play video games and solve puzzles."
Mark Reviews Movies," November 10, 2016",Mark Dujsik, How far from reality is this hypothetical scenario? It doesn't seem too far removed...
Montreal Gazette," November 10, 2016",T'Cha Dunlevy," Yes, there is something resembling a traditional climax, but it doesn't come at the expense of the ethereal tone established by Villeneuve. In this time of political upheaval, it's a welcome tonic."
Newsday," November 10, 2016",Rafer Guzman," A familiar story about a close encounter, though well crafted and unusually moody."
Financial Times," November 10, 2016",Nigel Andrews," In its low-key lyricism with glimpses into the epiphanic, this is a beautifully controlled movie."
One Guy's Opinion," November 10, 2016",Frank Swietek," More brain-teaser than action film, this is an elegantly-wrought piece of thinking-person's science fiction...that plays with convention in unexpected and enthralling ways."
JoBlo's Movie Emporium," November 10, 2016",JimmyO, ARRIVAL is likely to become a modern day sci-fi classic.
Dallas Morning News," November 10, 2016",Britton Peele," By the time it ends, Arrival is a story that could only be told in the science-fiction genre, and the result is a beautiful narrative that you find has been telling you things about itself without you ever realizing it."
Boston Globe," November 10, 2016",Ty Burr," Fine, full-bodied filmmaking, with a sense of the alien-ness out there in the universe that flatters our intelligence while making us feel tantalizingly small."
Chicago Sun-Times," November 10, 2016",Richard Roeper," Arrival is not a linear adventure of the mind, and it is a film probably best seen twice."
Washington Post," November 10, 2016",Ann Hornaday," Muted, measured and meditative, ""Arrival"" brings taste and restraint to a genre in the midst of a mini golden age: It comes in peace."
St. Louis Post-Dispatch," November 10, 2016",Calvin Wilson," Working from a screenplay by Eric Heisserer, director Denis Villeneuve creates a richly imagined world in which the theme of extraterrestrial outreach is addressed with a refreshing dignity."
Arizona Republic," November 10, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," [A] terrific, haunting film that plays with our expectations - and rewards us with satisfying left turns."
Chicago Reader," November 10, 2016",J. R. Jones," Villeneuve draws on Close Encounters of the Third Kind for his portrayal of scientists and soldiers groping for answers and, more generally, of the celestial playing out in highly personal terms."
NUVO Newsweekly," November 10, 2016",Edward Johnson-Ott," Amy Adams is spot on in the lead role, admirably keeping the story on track and not seizing a flashy scene for the consideration of Oscar voters. She does everything right."
Tampa Bay Times," November 10, 2016",Steve Persall," One of a handful of movies that have legitimately fooled me; not with an abrupt twist but a dawning awareness of where it's going thematically, how deeply and how distanced from sci-fi as usual."
Austin Chronicle," November 10, 2016",Marc Savlov," What really stays stuck in your memory long after the movie has ended and the world has been saved, or just as likely not, is the ache at the heart of the world Villeneuve has created."
Entertainment Weekly," November 10, 2016",Leah Greenblatt," An alien-invasion fantasy that operates within the genre at the same time as it subverts it - large-scale movie-star sci-fi filtered through the tricky, esoteric lens of art-house cinema."
Miami Herald," November 10, 2016",Rene Rodriguez," ""Arrival"" is the sort of superficially profound movie that initially seems deep and weighty but stops making sense the moment you put down the bong."
Newark Star-Ledger," November 10, 2016",Stephen Whitty, How many sci-fi movies actually give you ideas to argue about anymore? How many sci-fi movies give you ideas at all?
Suite101.com," November 10, 2016",Nick Rogers," Ostensibly an alien story, ""Arrival"" tackles, with confidence and clarity, conflict in whether mankind will acquiesce or aggress, come together or cloister tighter, compromise or collapse. Here is a masterwork of both the moment and the millennium."
NPR," November 10, 2016",Andrew Lapin," Arrival, like the Spielberg classic it aspires to, brings the beyond to us. In doing so, it asks a challenging, prescient question: Are we ready to teach, and ready to learn?"
Salt Lake Tribune," November 10, 2016",Sean P. Means, [Amy Adams] gives Arrival the humanity that turns an interesting piece of science fiction into something that's grand beyond words.
Newsweek," November 10, 2016",Tom Shone," Arrival is grand, technically marvelous, solemn, spooky, somewhat unbelievable and sometimes unfathomable. Who is to say alien visitation will be any different?"
Punch Drunk Critics," November 10, 2016",Travis Hopson, Arrival fulfills on an entertainment level while feeding the mind and soul.
New York Post," November 10, 2016",Sara Stewart," ""Arrival"" makes a moving case that we've only scratched the surface of what we think is possible - and what we define as intelligence."
Fort Worth Weekly," November 10, 2016",Kristian M. Lin," Without [Adams], Arrival becomes an arid and talky exercise, but thanks to her remarkable efforts, this thoughtful science-fiction epic has human warmth at its core."
Indie London," November 10, 2016",Rob Carnevale, Denis Villeneuve is fast becoming the go-to director for intelligent cinema; someone capable of traversing genre and putting his own stamp on things.
Toronto Sun," November 10, 2016",Steve Tilley," If you're yearning for a smart, thoughtful sci-fi film that wonders how first contact with aliens might go down, this tight little gem of a film is a gift from beyond the stars."
LarsenOnFilm," November 10, 2016",Josh Larsen, ...belongs to the cinematic tradition of philosophical space flicks that ultimately turn inward.
Austin American-Statesman," November 10, 2016",Joe Gross," Villeneuve, cinematographer Bradford Young, composer Jóhann Jóhannsson and editor Joe Walker dole out information and color it in knowing ways, building to third act revelations that make for profoundly moving film-making."
The Spectator," November 10, 2016",Deborah Ross, I won't describe the aliens in detail here because the reveal is 87.4 per cent of the fun. I will say only that they're monstrous but also strangely balletic and tender.
Flicks.co.nz," November 10, 2016",Matt Glasby, Johan Johannsson's sonorous score is lovely; the performers spot on; and the philosophical concerns deep enough to confuse Christopher Nolan.
New Statesman," November 10, 2016",Ryan Gilbey," Where Close Encounters of the Third Kind gazed outward in awe at the universe, Arrival asks only how its mysteries might provide succour and illumination for us. "
Playboy Online," November 10, 2016",Stephen Rebello," Through Adams and Renner's performances, we share dread, wonder, frustration, panic and transcendence as they begin to interact with the ""Heptapod"" aliens that evoke memories of the work of H.G. Wells and John Wyndham."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," November 10, 2016",Colin Covert," The focus is serious human drama, gripping in a way that sci-fi seldom achieves. The film is intricately handsome and rarely showy, flawlessly made and earnest-minded."
Kansas City Star," November 10, 2016",Robert W. Butler," That ""Arrival"" works so well is in large part due to Adams, whose fear/eagerness in confronting beings from another world registers squarely with viewers. She can project deep emotions with a minimum of expression. It's all in the eyes."
TheFilmFile.com," November 10, 2016",Dustin Putman," Exquisitely structured in surprising ways which only gradually reveal themselves, ""Arrival"" proves thoroughly mesmerizing. Conventional action is kept to a minimum, yet 2016 has scarcely seen such an exciting film. A hauntingly brilliant tour de force."
Los Angeles Times," November 10, 2016",Kenneth Turan," It is simultaneously old and new, revisiting many of these alien-invasion conventions but with unexpected intelligence, visual style and heart."
Wall Street Journal," November 10, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," What's remarkable about Arrival is its contemplative core -- and, of course, Ms. Adams's star performance, which is no less impassioned for being self-effacing."
The Daily Beast," November 10, 2016",Nick Schager," Arrival is the latest in a long line of ""first contact"" sci-fi stories, and yet regardless of its familiar premise, its achievements are unique."
Reel Film Reviews," November 11, 2016",David Nusair," Arrival, though consistently watchable, is rarely as compelling or engrossing as one might've anticipated..."
Rolling Stone," November 11, 2016",Peter Travers," Amy Adams is a miracle worker-she makes us believe in this mesmerizing mindbender about alien communication, directed with searching mind and heart by Denis Villeneuve."
Reeling Reviews," November 11, 2016",Laura Clifford," This science fiction is a rarity, a cerebral film that will break your heart while expanding your mind."
Globe and Mail," November 11, 2016",Barry Hertz," A twisty, cerebral drama that just happens to involve aliens, Denis Villeneuve's film is a truly beguiling take on both the sci-fi canon and what, exactly, a grown-up Hollywood film is supposed to be."
Detroit News," November 11, 2016",Adam Graham," It doesn't pack the punch you'd expect from an alien invasion movie; it aims higher, and in the end, it cuts deeper."
Movie Talk," November 11, 2016",Jason Best, Would first contact play out as imagined by Close Encounters of the Third Kind or with the gung-ho bluster of Independence Day? Denis Villeneuve's intelligent and humane sci-fi drama Arrival definitely flies the flag for the former camp. 
WOW247," November 10, 2016",Matthew Turner," A profoundly moving, beautifully made story that presents a timely message about the importance of communication and understanding."
New England Movies Weekly," November 10, 2016",Daniel M. Kimmel," This is science fiction for grown-ups, ready to follow three-dimensional characters grappling with deep ideas."

The Arts Desk," November 10, 2016",Saskia Baron," If Arrival's ending is a little too upbeat and the explanations for the fractured narrative leave one a bit puzzled, it's still a worthy attempt to refresh a familiar story."
Sky Movies," November 10, 2016",Andy Psyllides, Denis Villeneuve makes this directing lark look easy - whatever the genre he seems to effortlessly step up to the plate and deliver the goods.
Dread Central," November 10, 2016",Staci Layne Wilson," In the plus column, Arrival feels like a dreamily updated version of 1951's The Day the Earth Stood Still. On the negative side, there's not enough excitement or revelation to justify its two-hour runtime. "
Scotsman," November 10, 2016",Alistair Harkness, Sci-fi with a big emotional sweep is tough to get right.
Daily Express (UK)," November 10, 2016",Allan Hunter," You can pick holes in the plot if you examine it closely but Arrival is so well made and acted that you are willing to suspend your disbelief, engage your little grey cells and savour one of the smarter screen epics we've seen in quite a while."
New York Times," November 10, 2016",Manohla Dargis," By turns inviting and opaque, Ms. Adams turns softness and quiet into heroic qualities, keeping her voice low, modulated, and using stillness to draw you near."

Tri-City Herald," November 11, 2016",Gary Wolcott," Decent sci-fi that wanders a bit and is kinda slow but it's darkness helps keep your interest and while good but not great, it at least is not dead on arrival. "
Comic Book Resources," November 11, 2016",Kristy Puchko, Villeneuve's indulgence in mood and melancholy mount to a conclusion that wastes its compelling premise and wallows in infuriatingly all-consuming sentimentality.
Christian Science Monitor," November 11, 2016",Peter Rainer, It's difficult to get worked into a state of awe with this film because so much of it is so sodden.
Hot Press," November 11, 2016",Roe McDermott," Adams' acting is masterful: she is strong, raw and vulnerable, a beating heart in the bloody mess of humanity's fear. It's a powerhouse performance in a stunning film that transcends genre to become art."
AllMovie," November 11, 2016",Daniel Gelb," A strikingly human film, one that's concerned much more with the feebleness of language and the fragility of time than with its mysterious extraterrestrial visitors."
Baltimore Magazine," November 11, 2016",Max Weiss," It's easy to say that Denis Villeneuve's tingly sci-fi Arrival is a whole lot of Spielberg with a little bit of Tarkovsky thrown in, but what's remarkable is how much it actually defies the conventions of its genre."
Tulsa World," November 11, 2016",Michael Smith, Arrival is a first-rate story about first contact because it meets that great science-fiction movie test: It's less about who they are and more about who we are.
Toledo Blade," November 11, 2016",Kirk Baird," Words have meaning, Arrival reminds us, and communication is the way forward for humanity, especially in times of great uncertainty when the world seems to be at a crisis point."

RedEye," November 11, 2016",Lauren Chval," The real triumph of Arrival, though, is its commitment to the complexity of time and language."
"Deseret News, Salt Lake City"," November 11, 2016",Josh Terry," In the realm of big screen science fiction, ""Arrival"" feels like a mix of 2001: A Space Odyssey with a generous dose of Close Encounters of the Third Kind."
The Young Folks," November 11, 2016",Allyson Johnson," ... this is a hopeful tale despite it's forlorn air, one where a linguist is the hero at the end of the day, where the answer to peace is obvious and the notion that despite terrible loss, life goes on, life still exists and it will be remembered."
Blu-ray.com," November 11, 2016",Brian Orndorf, A viewing experience that's filled with as much frustration as it is with awe. 
Washington Free Beacon," November 11, 2016",Sonny Bunch, Arrival is a magnificently made movie and likely the best I've seen so far this year. See it as soon as possible and on as big a screen as you can. You don't want to miss out.

HollywoodInToto.com," November 11, 2016",Christian Toto, You'll admire Arrival far more than you'll love it.
Lyles' Movie Files," November 11, 2016",Jeffrey Lyles," A wonderfully complex, heartfelt tale in the midst of an encounter with the unknown. One of the smartest sci-fi films to come around in years and lands as one of 2016's best."
amNewYork," November 11, 2016",Robert Levin," [Villeneuve creates] a mood of lingering unease, crafting a series of immense images set to the orchestral dread of Jóhann Jóhannsson's score that powerfully suggest the mystery at hand without indulging in obvious instincts."
MTV," November 11, 2016",Amy Nicholson, Learning Heptapodese seems easy compared to the tough talks Americans need to have with each other.

ScreenRant," November 11, 2016",Sandy Schaefer," Arrival is a smart tale of alien contact that boasts great visuals and performances, if also more brains than heart."
"Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)"," November 11, 2016",Bob Bloom," The movie is slow, but not in a dull sense. It is a brainy, step-by-step primer on learning how to reach out and begin an exchange of ideas between two vastly different life forms in a peaceful and constructive manner."
Vox," November 11, 2016",Alissa Wilkinson," Arrival is one of the best movies of the year, a moving, gripping film with startling twists and imagery. It deserves serious treatment as a work of art."

BBC.com," November 11, 2016",Sam Adams," With Arrival, Villeneuve finally finds a subject, and a script, whose magnitude matches the weight he assigns to it. All it took was an alien species' appearance on Earth."
CNN.com," November 11, 2016",Brian Lowry," Those expecting a whiz-bang film should be prepared for a more cerebral and emotional experience, admirable for its ambition and tone, if not wholly satisfying in its payoff."
Winnipeg Free Press," November 11, 2016",Randall King," We need more science fiction films like this. And given that Villeneuve is currently filming the long-awaited sequel to Blade Runner, we should now feel assured that project is in the right hands."
The New Republic," November 11, 2016",Will Leitch, Arrival plays with your head as gently as any sci-fi thriller I can remember.

Ex-Press.com," November 11, 2016",Katherine Monk," So bang a gong.

San Diego Reader," November 11, 2016",Matthew Lickona, Denis Villeneuve's latest is an artier - certainly moodier and less entertaining - version of M. Night Shyamalan's Signs.

The Australian," November 11, 2016",David Stratton," Visually the film is as impressive as you may wish, and the sense of unease is augmented by the offbeat music score by Johann Johannsson."

Examiner.com," November 14, 2016",Chris Sawin," Its visuals are remarkable and its storyline is so beautifully structured. Arrival is one of the most extraordinary, breathtaking, and thought provoking films of the year. This is what science fiction is supposed to be. "
Daily Express (UK)," November 13, 2016",Henry Fitzherbert," An intellect-stroking sci-fi film that asks you to imagine how humanity might respond, emotionally rather than militarily, in the event of an arrival from outer space."
Observer (UK)," November 13, 2016",Mark Kermode," Arrival may be just the poem we need; a departure from the dystopian visions which now appear all too real, a memory of a future in which light still shines in the darkness."
Tolucan Times," November 12, 2016",Tony Medley," ...there is enough incomprehensibility to give you 'The Day the Earth Stood Still Meets 'Last Year at Marienbad.' Despite the fact that it's utter nonsense, you don't have to completely follow or accept what happens to enjoy it."
Beliefnet," November 12, 2016",Nell Minow, The Chomsky-esque notions that language shapes our thinking even more than our thinking shapes language is conveyed in the film's own structure as well as its dialog.

Creative Loafing," November 12, 2016",Matt Brunson," A motion picture that turns out to be far more focused on humanity than on otherworldly visitors, it's a transcendent viewing experience that gets under the skin and into the heart. As a bonus, it's also the right movie at the right time."

Reel Reviews," November 11, 2016",Frank Wilkins," Takes its focus away from the invaders - for the most part - and shines it directly on human character and the questions of what might happen if we actually tried to communicate and solve the puzzle of our differences with brains, rather than brawn."
Boston Herald," November 11, 2016",James Verniere," If The Day the Earth Stood still (the original) were silly and derivative, this would be it. Bodes unwell for Blade Runner sequel."

San Francisco Chronicle," November 15, 2016",Peter Hartlaub," The revelation here is Villeneuve, who expands on the symphonic pacing showcased last year in the drug war drama Sicario. Even though the concept of Arrival is far-out fiction, Villeneuve treats it with no less detail or urgency."

leonardmaltin.com," December 15, 2016",Leonard Maltin, It's a film you'll want to discuss and debate with your friends. The message may not be original but the methodology certainly is.

Matt's Movie Reviews," December 15, 2016",Matthew Pejkovic," Arrival speaks to our tenacious need to know just who we are and why we are here. In that search we look to the stars, we pray to the heavens, we seek answers within ourselves and the environment around us. "
Graffiti With Punctuation," December 15, 2016",Blake Howard, Arrival is about the awakening and ensuing trauma discovering that we're not alone in the universe.
