Willamette Week," February 8, 2017",Lauren Terry, It's a stirring testament to humanity when the patient voice of the marine patrol addresses the panicked refugees on their boat's radio.
San Diego Reader," February 3, 2017",Scott Marks, Who needs voiceovers when a director's camera has this much to say?
Detroit News," January 20, 2017",Tom Long," A fascinating study in contrasts, ""Fire at Sea' shows how the normal and painfully abnormal exist side by side - the horrific and the serene, the tragic and the mundane, global crisis and daily humdrum."
Combustible Celluloid," January 19, 2017",Jeffrey M. Anderson," The end result is transporting, but also moving; it's a wake-up call, asking us to think about how much attention we really pay to what's around us, and - perhaps more importantly - what to do about it?"
Chilango.com," January 18, 2017",Hugo Juárez," A current, unmissable and noisy film, not because of what you will hear, but because of its outrageous repercussions, that maybe someday they will reach the right ears. [Full review in Spanish]"
Butaca Ancha," January 18, 2017",Mariana Fernández, A reflexive and hard critic that becomes a necessary instrument to show the prevailing level of dehumanization in society. [Full review in Spanish]
Ibero 90.9," January 18, 2017",Fernando Moreno," Demolishing and poetic, hard and intelligent. Rosi's work moves away from sentimentalism and obvious narrative resources to build a free and unconventional documentary. [Full review in Spanish]"
Cinegarage," January 16, 2017",Erick Estrada," A film in which the aesthetic probably devours some of the impact but the serious, inmediate and mortal problems are clearly exposed. [Full review in Spanish]"
Laramie Movie Scope," January 16, 2017",Robert Roten," This is a documentary about two different things, connected by a single thread. The only thing connecting these two stories is a doctor, Pietro Bartolo. He treats both the residents of Lampedusa, and he treats the refugees as well."
Excelsior," January 12, 2017",Lucero Solórzano," A film that manages to establish a dichotomy between the peaceful life of the inhabitants of Lampedusa, and the tragedy of whole families who desperately seek a better life. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," January 1, 2017",Brian Gibson, [A] potent near-parable of a documentary.
Total Film," December 27, 2016",Matt Looker," Rosi offers a simple, stark contrast between quiet moments of everyday life and tragedy as mass fleeing results in sunken boats, horrific injuries and death."
MovieMail," December 27, 2016",Mike McCahill," Fire at Sea is the kind of film that, without ever seeming to harass or harangue the viewer, could well change minds and save lives; a small film, certainly, but no mean feat."
Chicago Reader," December 15, 2016",J. R. Jones," Though conceived as a humanitarian statement, the movie wouldn't be as memorable or challenging without its quotidian aspect."
AwardsCircuit.com," December 13, 2016",Shane Slater, An uncommonly observant film.
San Francisco Chronicle," December 7, 2016",David Lewis," We feel the bewilderment of the parochial yet decent residents, the helplessness of the well-intentioned yet overwhelmed rescuers, and the anguish and disorientation of the refugees."
Newcity," December 6, 2016",Ray Pride," Rosi moves in and out of stories. The pastoral life of the island is apart from the humanity crashing to the shore. The images he finds are bold, from the gentle to the dire. [H]ope is in limited supply,contrasting with the seawater that seems limitless. "
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," December 5, 2016",Dennis Schwartz, Observant and poignant documentary.
Reeling Reviews," December 1, 2016",Robin Clifford," The relatively normal lives of the locals are contrasted by the frantic attempts of the desperate refugees to reach the ""promised land."""
Compuserve," November 24, 2016",Harvey S. Karten," Donald Trump should learn a lesson by watching how the brave people of Italy are rescuing hostages from North Africa in this loosely constructed documentary, submitted by Italy into Oscar competition."
Guardian," June 9, 2016",Peter Bradshaw, Fire at Sea is masterly film-making.
Time Out," June 9, 2016",Dave Calhoun, What role can cinema play in making sense of Europe's migrant crisis?
Little White Lies," June 9, 2016",David Jenkins, Mixes political and observational documentary to profound effect.
Financial Times," June 9, 2016",Nigel Andrews," It's an amazing film. Life and death; mundanity and mortality; growing up and growing old; family and country; conflict and concord. Each is made more vivid, more complex, more intricately human, by its interaction with the other."
CineVue," June 7, 2016",Joseph Walsh, Rosi's subjects appear totally at ease with his presence.
The List," June 6, 2016",Angie Errigo, Poetic and powerfully affecting.
4:3," March 21, 2016",Jessica Ellicott," Rosi shows the tragedy unfolding before our eyes through a cinematic gaze that is both patient and urgent, empathetic and horrific."
The Playlist," February 27, 2016",Jessica Kiang," Despite all the craft and care it seems just slightly deflating that ""Fire at Sea"" can elicit a relatively complacent reaction when it is such a thoughtful, deeply-felt and exquisitely observed film, set right in the eye of a raging storm. "
Variety," February 22, 2016",Peter Debruge," Where Rosi's previous work has been accused of offering scattershot portraits of disparate characters, this one feels more focused in its overall edit, while open enough to encourage personal reactions."
Screen International," February 22, 2016",Lee Marshall," The European migrant crisis has found its cinematic Pietà in Fire At Sea, Italian director Gianfranco Rosi's powerful, at times shocking but also intensely human documentary."
Guardian," February 22, 2016",Andrew Pulver," This is quiet, unflashy film-making, that nonetheless packs a powerful punch."
CineVue," February 22, 2016",Harriet Warman," Samuele's story is told with a resignation and deep sadness that testify, more than mere images ever could, the scale of human tragedy."
Hollywood Reporter," February 22, 2016",Deborah Young," Where journalism leaves off, Fire at Sea (Fuocoammare) begins. It takes a unique documentary filmmaker like Gianfranco Rosi to capture the drama through the periscope of his camera focused on the small Sicilian island of Lampedusa."
Thompson on Hollywood," February 22, 2016",Demetrios Matheou," The selection of characters is small, precise. The dominant personality of the film is Samuele, a nine-year-old boy and a terrific bundle of good humor and contradictions"
London Evening Standard," February 21, 2016",David Sexton," The film provides no commentary, no text or context, it just shows."
El Pais (Spain)," October 14, 2016",Jordi Costa, A film full of unforgettable pieces where the viewer becomes witness to the African migration that flows to the coast of Lampedusa for survival. [Full review in Spanish]
El Mundo (Spain)," October 14, 2016",Luis Martínez," This film is to portrays the double life of an island: on one side, the daily life of the people of Lampedusa from the perspective of a boy; the other, the tragedy of inequality. [Full review in Spanish]"
Sensacine," October 13, 2016",Quim Casas," The film is a respectful portrait of a community of men, women and children who fail at trying to find elsewhere what has been denied them in their own world. [Full review in Spanish]"
Sensacine," October 11, 2016",Paula Arantzazu Ruiz, A neorealist approach to the life of the people of Lampedusa and the abstraction of a landscape that resists being marine cemetery. [Full review in Spanish]
The Film Stage," October 2, 2016",Giovanni Marchini Camia," While Rosi certainly manages to jolt the viewer out of complacency, his strategy towards this end is so ethically dubious as to border on repellent."
Film Comment Magazine," September 26, 2016",Stuart Klawans," Constructed as much as reported, Fire at Sea is a beautiful artifact presented for your contemplation. It is also an act of conscience. And it is harrowing."
Slant Magazine," September 22, 2016",Clayton Dillard, Fire at Sea initiates a narrative that probes the fundamental gap between wanting to help and actually being able to do so.
NOW Toronto," September 9, 2016",Glenn Sumi," Rosi captures it all with balance and dignity, allowing a bit of humour in an impromptu game of soccer among the refugees and letting the immensity of the sea and sky at times dwarf the human experience."
La Nación (Argentina)," August 15, 2016",Fernando Lopez, Lampedusa's solidarity in the film is as evident as the indifference around this tragedy. [Full review in Spanish]
Clarín," August 12, 2016",Horacio Bilbao, The author portrays this endless drama with moving simplicity. [Full review in Spanish]
Irish Times," August 9, 2016",Tara Brady," Rosi disguises the urgency of these unfolding horrors with a stately, procedural crawl. There is no political grandstanding or direct campaigning, but this is a call to arms from those left to ferry the corpses."
South China Morning Post," July 4, 2016",James Mottram," Never preaching, Rosi leaves it for us to soak up these revelations. The result is sometimes wayward but peppered with images that sear the brain."
New Statesman," June 16, 2016",Ryan Gilbey," [A] restrained, humane documentary."
Irish Independent," June 13, 2016",Paul Whitington," This impeccably photographed film doesn't quite manage to reconcile its two narratives, but should be required viewing for those who think anyone but the desperate would willingly board those fetid coffin ships."
Observer (UK)," June 12, 2016",Wendy Ide, Sometimes real life provides us with symbolic imagery that is every bit as potent and sophisticated as anything you would find in a fictional narrative.
Sight and Sound," June 10, 2016",Trevor Johnston, Moral courage and filmic artistry exist side by side in this essential offering from a director gradually earning the right to be thought of as one of the greats of our era.
Times (UK)," June 10, 2016",Kate Muir," As timely as it is timeless, Gianfranco Rosi's portrait of a year on the Italian island of Lampedusa is stunning."
The Big Issue," June 10, 2016",Edward Lawrenson," Made with the rigour of the best journalism and haunting emotional artistry, Fire at Sea deserves to be seen as widely as possible."
Radio Times," June 9, 2016",David Parkinson," Lampedusa is barely eight square miles in size and some 400,000 souls have passed through it over the last 20 years. But Rosi makes it abundantly clear this is an emergency that affects everyone."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," June 9, 2016",Robbie Collin," Poses no direct questions, but leaves your head and heart overflowing with them."
The Nation," November 17, 2016",Stuart Klawans," It looks and moves like a clearheaded observational drama but is devastatingly, inescapably real. "
It's Just Movies," November 14, 2016",Ron Wilkinson, Sea sounds alternate cries for help and mercy and the timeless songs of a culture changing too fast. 
SF Weekly," November 10, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," Fire at Sea meditates on how life can go on even with a front-row seat to unspeakable misery and injustice. After all, someone still has to make the pasta and take listener requests."
Georgia Straight," November 9, 2016",Ken Eisner," Unspoken but suggested by the subtext and title of Fire at Sea is that some First World countries profit from war, while other First World countries -- hell, sometimes the same First World countries -- are left to clean up the mess."
Rolling Stone Mexico," October 31, 2016",Arturo Aguilar, A heartbreaking look of one of the most complex and sad phenomena of our times. [Full review in Spanish]

National Post," October 27, 2016",Chris Knight," If you think you know how a documentary about the European migrant/refugee crisis will play out, Fire at Sea will surprise."
Wall Street Journal," October 27, 2016",Joe Morgenstern, Fire at Sea is a shining example of journalism fueled by outrage and shaped by free-ranging curiosity.
Los Angeles Times," October 27, 2016",Kenneth Turan," What ""Fire at Sea"" appears to be and what it is are not the same thing, and it's that difference that makes it a masterful documentary."
New Yorker," October 24, 2016",Richard Brody," Rosi films the migrants empathetically but sentimentally; he depicts helicopters and ships with bombastic grandeur. What's more, half the movie has nothing to do with migrants ..."
WBAI Radio," October 22, 2016",Prairie Miller," As horrifying as the scenes of suffering and apparent if not imminent death are for these migrants, Rosi situates them as backdrop to the ordinary or humorous lives of oblivious locals. And continuing a Western tradition of exotic rendering of the Other."
Film-Forward.com," October 21, 2016",Nora Lee Mandel, Brings viewer along an extended stay on European front line in refugee crisis...The very visceral scenes...will hopefully help bring the migrants' plight to wider attention.
The Young Folks," October 21, 2016",Nathanael Hood, Rosi completely fails to connect the two sides of the story together.
RogerEbert.com," October 21, 2016",Glenn Kenny," As laudable as the movie is, it does not quite achieve greatness. That's the fault of both its indirectness and its obviousness."
Globe and Mail," October 21, 2016",Mark Medley," Harrowing, heartbreaking and humane ..."
New York Times," October 20, 2016",A.O. Scott," ""Fire at Sea"" occupies your consciousness like a nightmare, and yet somehow you don't want it to end."
Village Voice," October 20, 2016",Bilge Ebiri," How do you reconcile trauma like this with the easy rhythms of ordinary life? You don't, Rosi's film tells us, and to do so would be obscene."
Metro," October 20, 2016",Matt Prigge," ""Fire at Sea"" contains nightmarish footage of unspeakable misery. But it's not the straight-arrow film human rights activists most desire."
AV Club," October 20, 2016",Mike D'Angelo, Here is an island. Things happen on and near that island. Some of those things are heartbreaking. Others are banal. The end.
Spirituality and Practice," October 19, 2016",Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, A heart-rending documentary about a small island between Libya and Sicily where illegal immigrants from Africa stop on their way to Europe.
