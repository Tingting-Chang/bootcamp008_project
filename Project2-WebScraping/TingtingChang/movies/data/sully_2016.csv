Seattle Times," September 7, 2016",Moira MacDonald," If Tom Hanks hadn't existed to play the title role, Eastwood would have had to invent him: This is one of those cases where movie-star persona and real-life legend blend perfectly."

Sometimes all of those things come together to create a miracle, and ""Sully"" is a warm reminder of that."
Us Weekly," September 6, 2016",Mara Reinstein, Watching that airplane land on the Hudson River is a heart-stopping wonder. But the entire ordeal lasted just 208 seconds. The movie is 96 minutes.

Screen International," September 4, 2016",Tim Grierson," An unabashed salute to real-life heroism, Clint Eastwood's drama rivetingly recreates the Miracle on the Hudson. Though not always as confident outside of the cockpit, ""Sully"" mostly earns its crowd-pleasing, lump-in-your-throat sentiment."
Time Out," September 3, 2016",Joshua Rothkopf," Even as recently as American Sniper, Eastwood has done a much better job than this of shading in the grays of what constitutes heroism, both during and after the fact. Sully is so square, it's a wonder it even gets airborne."

Reeling Reviews," September 8, 2016",Laura Clifford," Screenwriter Todd Komarnicki (""Perfect Stranger"") has taken a simple approach in adapting Sullenberger's book, perhaps too simple...See it for Eastwood's classical direction and Hanks' thoughtful reconstruction of an American hero."

MovieWeb," September 8, 2016",Julian Roman," Clint Eastwood's adaptation of the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" isn't quite as riveting as hoped. Sully is fairly acted by the players, but runs short with a few scenes that come off as contrived."
Bullz-Eye.com," September 8, 2016",Jason Zingale, For as conventional and safe as Eastwood plays the human drama ... the movie's gripping reenactment of the crash is a wonderfully staged piece of filmmaking that makes it all worth it.

Rolling Stone," September 8, 2016",Peter Travers," Like Sully, Hanks makes the impossible seem effortless. Listen up, Oscar. Hanks and director Eastwood deserve the three words Sully prizes most: Job well done."
Parade Magazine," September 8, 2016",Neil Pond," A man doing his job, a guy flying a plane, a pilot controlling the stick. 'Sully' shows just how important one ""ordinary"" person can be, when ordinary circumstances suddenly, unprecedentedly, become extraordinary."

Las Vegas Weekly," September 8, 2016",Josh Bell, Stretching those 208 seconds into 96 minutes proves difficult.
Student Edge," September 7, 2016",Simon Miraudo," The closest [Sully] gets to 'emotive' is a brief welling-of-the-eyes at the hospital, after hearing that all of his passengers survived. It's a reminder that Tom Hanks does his best work while being treated for trauma."
Punch Drunk Critics," September 7, 2016",Travis Hopson, That Eastwood is able to tell a story so big in a tight 96-minute package and do it so effortlessly is a true achievement.

Den of Geek," September 8, 2016",Don Kaye," Even with its mistakes, Sully is watchable and occasionally gripping entertainment."
Tulsa World," September 8, 2016",Michael Smith, Sully is a character study that doesn't tell us much about the character. Other than the fact that he is a hero. Which we already knew.
Cleveland Plain Dealer," September 8, 2016",Michael Heaton," The writing, acting and direction all combine for a satisfying real-life-hero, ripped-from-the-headlines story that was well worth telling."
"Quad City Times (Davenport, IA)"," September 8, 2016",Linda Cook," Tom Hanks was born to play ""Sully."""
Austin Chronicle," September 8, 2016",Marc Savlov," Eastwood keeps his direction lean and mean. There's not an ounce of wasted screen time in Sully's 96 minutes, but the story, an example of ""truth is stranger than fiction,"" has all the thrust it needs, and then some."
Baltimore Magazine," September 8, 2016",Max Weiss," [Hanks] is predictably great, especially in a scene where he's informed that all his passengers survived, but it's a quiet, dignified performance, the kind that has lately become his stock-in-trade."

Village Voice," September 8, 2016",Danny King, The movie is more than worth seeing ...
One Guy's Opinion," September 8, 2016",Frank Swietek," It could be argued that the very plainness of the picture, anchored by a predictably solid but unflashy performance by Tom Hanks, is the appropriate way of celebrating a man who saw himself not as a hero but simply a fellow doing his job as best he can."
Toronto Star," September 8, 2016",Peter Howell," Clint Eastwood is simply the ideal director for a big-screen telling of the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" hero pilot story that Sully delivers with confidence and grace."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," September 8, 2016",Colin Covert," By turning an emergency that lasted a little more than two minutes into an accomplished, unsettling adventure thriller, Eastwood is at the controls of a movie machine that other directors could send skidding off the runway."

Truthdig," September 8, 2016",Carrie Rickey, Eastwood's leanest and most personal movie since Gran Torino.
Associated Press," September 8, 2016",Jake Coyle," Eastwood moves slowly to the landing but gives it its full due. Filmed on IMAX, his big, clear images nevertheless remain somber -- as does Eastwood's own quiet score - in the big, awaited moment."
CinemaBlend.com," September 8, 2016",Eric Eisenberg," There are shockingly few scenes that manage to add to the story in a meaningful way, and it results in more drag than a plane taking off with its flaps up."

Playboy Online," September 8, 2016",Stephen Rebello," Sully won't just please crowds and evoke tears but, in an angry, ugly time in our national history, it should also resonate deeply with many."

We Got This Covered," September 8, 2016","Robert Yaniz, Jr."," Tom Hanks turns in a beautifully restrained performance in Sully, but despite some memorable sequences, the plodding script feels padded even at barely over 90 minutes."
New York Times," September 8, 2016",Manohla Dargis," That it unnerves you as much as it does may seem surprising, given that going in, we know how this story ends. But Mr. Eastwood is also very good at his job, a talent that gives the movie its tension along with an autobiographical sheen."
Flixist.com," September 8, 2016",Matthew Razak," Sully is another testament to just how deft a filmmaker Eastwood is because it's easy to tell the ""true"" story of a hero, but it's hard to tell the true story of a man."
Blu-ray.com," September 8, 2016",Brian Orndorf," ""Sully"" offers a large-scale air near-disaster, but the real draw here is the star turn, with Hanks shaping an interior life to Sully that's as powerful as any plane crash imagery."

Globe and Mail," September 9, 2016",Simon Houpt," Thrilling when we're on and around the plane (seeing that giant CGI bird splash down, especially on an Imax screen, makes you realize how improbable the whole enterprise was) and too often thudding when we're not."

Paste Magazine," September 9, 2016",Michael Snydel," This is exactly the type of historical dramatization that Hollywood loves to churn out, but Sully doesn't feel like merely a paycheck. Like much of latter-day Eastwood's work, this is another flawed but thoughtful effort."
Impulse Gamer," September 9, 2016",Damien Straker," Despite its excellent lead performance from Tom Hanks, it also feels like a thematically safe and unadventurous entry from one of the industry's heavyweight filmmakers."
ScreenRant," September 9, 2016",Sandy Schaefer," Sully amounts to a respectable yet unmemorable account of real-life heroism, despite fine performances and capable direction."
Ex-Press.com," September 9, 2016",Katherine Monk," Tom Hanks has enough emotional charisma to keep Clint Eastwood's hero conventions in the air, but this cinematic salute to Chesley Sullenberger's heroism loses thrust."
L.A. Biz," September 9, 2016",Annlee Ellingson," A mishmash of genres -- a would-be disaster flick, a legal thriller, a heroic biopic -- jarringly cut together with the thinnest of threads linking them together."
Tolucan Times," September 9, 2016",Tony Medley," Despite a soporific first 30 minutes that is almost deadly, when director Eastwood finally gets to the landing on the Hudson and the subsequent hearing the film is so good that it overcomes the first third, but why did Hanks hide Sully's smile?"
The Age (Australia)," September 9, 2016",Jake Wilson, Clint Eastwood still has surprises in him.
Daily Telegraph (Australia)," September 9, 2016",Vicky Roach," Tom Hanks is as solid as ever in the role of Sullenberger, a stoic who is trying to hold it together under immense pressure -- from without and within. But... the character, while earning our respect, is a little hard to warm to."
Aisle Seat," September 9, 2016",Mike McGranaghan," Both an admiring recreation of the Miracle on the Hudson and a poignant reflection on how an ordinary, yet supremely competent man declines to exalt himself as a hero."
People Magazine," September 9, 2016",Tom Gliatto," Near the end, as we watch aviation re-enactors simulate the cockpit conditions under which Sully was operating, even these relatively humdrum moments have their own white-knuckle tension."
National Post," September 9, 2016",Chris Knight," Eastwood's decision to focus on the ""yes-but"" questions is wise, giving the film, if not a life-or-death narrative arc, a more relatable tension."
Slate," September 9, 2016",Dana Stevens," Sully can feel like a dutiful, hagiographic slog, even though its actual running time barely tops 90 minutes and both Hanks and Eckhart give warm, understated, funny performances in the only two roles developed enough to qualify as real characters"
National Catholic Register," September 9, 2016",Steven D. Greydanus," The film is attentive to the iconic power of that event, both in itself and in connection with the last time the world watched as an airliner went down against the New York skyline."
Killer Movie Reviews," September 9, 2016",Andrea Chase," hinges on the superiority of experience over theory, a soothing message in a mechanized world that relegates the human factor to a slot just this side of superfluous, but one that needed the kind of subtlety that Hanks delivers in his performance."
Cinemalogue.com," September 9, 2016",Todd Jorgenson," ... a vivid and intimate glimpse into the buildup and aftermath of the crash, both inside and outside the cockpit."
National Review," September 15, 2016",Armond White," Instead of mending fences in Sully, Eastwood works through both awe and disbelief, recognizing underappreciated professionalism...by looking back at ""the miracle on the Hudson"" with a sobering, unsentimental sense of recent history."
Adelaide Review," September 14, 2016",David 'Mad Dog' Bradley," With good work from Linney (in a slightly thankless part), Aaron Eckhart as First Officer Jeff Skiles and a large cast in small roles as passengers, this is still mostly about Hanks' fine, subtle performance, which dominates the proceedings."
NUVO Newsweekly," September 14, 2016",Sam Watermeier," This isn't Eastwood's best film, and it doesn't completely succeed in translating the true story to the big screen. But it's not without moments of spine-tingling movie magic."

tonymacklin.net," September 14, 2016",Tony Macklin, Sully is a film made by a pro's pro about a pro's pro.
HitFix," September 13, 2016",Drew McWeeny," I can imagine all of the good impulses that went into the decision to make Sully, but none of that matters when the film is as resolutely limp as this one."
LarsenOnFilm," September 13, 2016",Josh Larsen, ...would work better as a video exhibit at an aviation history museum than it does as a dramatic narrative.
CraveOnline," September 13, 2016",Witney Seibold," It's impressive that Eastwood, at age 86, has managed to become more lively and humane a director. But his politics may be unduly coloring his films, and it's becoming distracting."

MediaMikes," September 12, 2016",Michael A. Smith," Centuries from now, should movies still be being made, film historians will still be talking about Tom Hanks and Clint Eastwood...if you want to introduce your little one to a true hero, introduce them to ""Sully."""
Looking Closer," September 12, 2016",Jeffrey Overstreet," This is a quietly powerful story about the importance of mastering, rather than surrendering to, machines."
The Young Folks," September 12, 2016",Jon Winkler," Sully isn't a new career peak for Eastwood and probably won't be mentioned on any year-end lists, but it shows Eastwood can find a sweet-spot between musings of modern life and effective character study."
New Yorker," September 12, 2016",Richard Brody," A fierce, stark, haunted drama of horror narrowly avoided."
Cinemixtape," September 11, 2016",J. Olson, As cold as the Hudson River in January.
Laramie Movie Scope," September 11, 2016",Robert Roten," When the movie gets around to actually depicting the incident itself, fragmented though it is, it is a visual tour de force, with convincing images of the aircraft, trailing smoke, gliding through the sky, not far enough above New York City."
Reel Reviews," September 11, 2016",Frank Wilkins," Hanks' measured performance of an honest, humble everyman who was simply doing the best he could under extreme circumstances, elevates the entire experience"

Sydney Morning Herald," September 19, 2016",Sandra Hall, Somehow it works.
CNN.com," September 19, 2016",Brian Lowry," Eastwood has delivered a no-frills affair, almost to a fault. A brisk 96 minutes, the movie is workmanlike in its approach, yet still manages to be stirring thanks to the subject matter."

Q Network Film Desk," September 17, 2016",James Kendrick," Hanks and Eckhart as both excellent, and part of the reason the film works as well as it does is because they have a natural chemistry that makes their partnership both before and after the Hudson landing feel real and lived-in."
Winnipeg Free Press," September 16, 2016",Alison Gillmor," This modest, moving and unshowy ode to professionalism gets the job done."
ABC Radio (Australia)," September 16, 2016",CJ Johnson," Like much of Eastwood's latest work, a highly proficient, professional, refreshingly unsentimental procedural about men. "

"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," October 24, 2016",John Beifuss," The auteur sees himself in the aviator, whose competence makes believers out of skeptics and who - in a critique of effects-driven blockbuster filmmaking - argues that 'computer simulations' mean nothing when divorced from the 'human' element.

Washington City Paper," October 14, 2016",Matt Cohen," Sully is at its best when it's in full dramatic reenactment mode, and at its most eye-rolling when it shifts to emotional handwringing."
Phantom Tollbooth," October 14, 2016",Marie Asner," Tom Hanks seems comfortable in the role, moustache and all."
The Skinny," October 12, 2016",Ian Mantagni," Eastwood remains an American master, and if some of the finer details lack finesse, such quibbles are subsumed by the overall emotional whomp."
The Nation," October 11, 2016",Stuart Klawans," This is pretty much the truth of New Yorkers' feelings about the landing on the Hudson -- and Eastwood brings them back with a crisp, unmannered efficiency of which few other moviemakers are capable."
Matt's Movie Reviews," October 5, 2016",Matthew Pejkovic," With clear barriers between institutions of authority and the citizens they have sworn to serve and protect, Sully is a film that shows how the system can work when the right time comes."

"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," September 30, 2016",Brian Gibson," Glides between workplace drama and action-adventure while avoiding most of the right-stuff cliches of one-good-man biopics. And it doesn't land without first navigating some turbulent questions about heroism, post-9/11."

Empire Magazine," November 28, 2016",Olly Richards," Eastwood's message that no good deed goes unpunished feels misplaced, but for the crash sequences and Hanks' turn it's worthwhile. But for goodness' sake, don't watch it on a plane."
Total Film," November 28, 2016",Philip Kemp, Sully is a skilfully made reconstruction of a recent real-life feat of heroic professionalism. But narrative tension is sorely lacking.
