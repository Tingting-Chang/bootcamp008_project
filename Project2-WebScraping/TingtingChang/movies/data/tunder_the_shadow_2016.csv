MovieMail," September 29, 2016",Mike McCahill," Clearly the recent wave of quiet-quiet-loud horrors -- and the slower creep of 2014's The Babadook -- have factored into Anvari's thinking, but Under the Shadow works as well as an evocation of a fraught moment in recent Iranian history."
Guardian," September 29, 2016",Peter Bradshaw, Elegantly shot and very well acted. A definite frisson.
Fan The Fire," September 29, 2016",Martin Roberts," [Under The Shadow] takes many of the standard tropes of haunted-house cinema and makes a good fist of refreshing them with to its good performances, strong sense of place, and understated political commentary."
Cinemixtape," September 29, 2016",J. Olson," [The film] doesn't just want our neck hairs at attention. No, it wants our hearts and minds, too, and for eighty-four collar-tightening minutes, it gets them."
Empire Magazine," September 29, 2016",Kim Newman, A quality ghost story with an unusual backdrop and great performances.
Little White Lies," September 29, 2016",David Jenkins," Though ostensibly a horror movie, Babak Anvari's Under the Shadow is also a bluntly effective screed on everyday female suppression."
Total Film," September 27, 2016",Jamie Graham," Writer/director Babak Anvari blends war, patriarchal rule, folklore, spooky kids and one of the best jump scares since Carrie's hand burst from the grave, into a startling debut."

CineVue," August 31, 2016",Martyn Conterio, ★★★★★ Babak Anvari's Under the Shadow uses the haunted house set-up and classical filmmaking techniques expressly for political purposes.
Projected Figures," August 29, 2016",Anton Bitel," Like A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night, this is feminist horror made by an Iranian in exile, looking in from the outside - and as ominous winds of change blow through Shideh's home, Anvari matches social insights with expertly managed scares."
Eye for Film," August 9, 2016",Amber Wilkinson," The sleeping and waking worlds begin to tumble together, with cinematographer Kit Fraser using his camera to add to the unsettling atmosphere, spinning the image at key moments or rocking it to ratchet tension."

Slant Magazine," March 16, 2016",Elise Nakhnikian, The film's horror is spookily and movingly expressive of the tenuous position of women in 1980s Iran.
Film School Rejects," February 23, 2016",Rob Hunter," Under the Shadow gives us something to fear and something to think about, and that's two more things than most horror films can claim."
Bloody Disgusting," February 23, 2016",Fred Topel," Under the Shadow has everything that makes great horror: a unique mythology that plagues us psychologically as well as viscerally, a confined setting (in this case culturally mandated confinement as well as physical) and good old scary monsters."
Hollywood Reporter," February 23, 2016",David Rooney," Anvari deftly builds and sustains tension throughout, crafting a horror movie that respects genre conventions (right down to the safe/not safe ending), while firmly establishing its own distinctive identity. "
The National (UAE)," February 23, 2016",Chris Newbould, The closing act is more akin to a white-knuckly ride on a particularly ferocious ghost train than a traditional horror movie.

RogerEbert.com," October 7, 2016",Sheila O'Malley," There is no escape, for characters or audience. Under the Shadow is unnerving in the extreme."
Aisle Seat," October 6, 2016",Mike McGranaghan," It tries to be both a political allegory and a horror movie, never quite finding a way to meld the two together smoothly. Consequently, this is a film more easily admired than enjoyed."
Uproxx," October 6, 2016",Keith Phipps," Its slowly intensifying approach, use of shadows and suggestion, unsettling soundtrack, and well-deployed special effects allow it to stand nicely next to a recent horror classic, Jennifer Kent's The Babadook."
New York Times," October 6, 2016",Manohla Dargis, Quietly nerve-pricking ...
NPR," October 6, 2016",Andrew Lapin," The most consistent fear in Anvari's film is that of being a mother and daughter alone in a world that won't help or respect you. Far more so than djinn, this is a fear that doesn't easily dissipate."
Paste Magazine," October 6, 2016",Brogan Morris," Under the Shadow features two major breakouts: [star] Narges Rashidi... and [director Babak] Anvari, who with his debut proves himself as adept at politically-charged social-realism as he is at horror."

Austin Chronicle," October 6, 2016",Marc Savlov," To paraphrase Talking Heads, life during wartime ain't no party, especially if you're stuck in Tehran at the tail end of the Iran-Iraq war in the late Eighties. That's the predicament facing the family at the heart of this nervy little haunter."
Village Voice," October 6, 2016",Bilge Ebiri," The jump scares are solid, and earned. The suspense is genuine. And Under the Shadow never loses sight of the basic human reality of mother and child, trapped at home, encircled by a variety of evils, both real and imagined."

AV Club," October 5, 2016",A.A. Dowd, Under The Shadow ... demonstrates how two movies you've seen many times before-an Iranian social-issues drama and a Blumhouse-style poltergeist thriller-can be combined to create one you haven't.

Observer (UK)," October 2, 2016",Mark Kermode," With this terrific feature debut, Anvari lifts the veil on his heroines' hidden lives and leaves us all dreaming with our eyes wide open."
Independent (UK)," September 30, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab, What's refreshing about the film is that it comes at the genre from a new angle. This is as much a study of a desperate and traumatised woman as it is a conventional horror pic.

Radio Times," September 30, 2016",James Luxford," A real treat for those who love horror with a brain, this proves there's a lot more to say in such an often overcrowded genre."
Flick Filosopher," January 26, 2017",MaryAnn Johanson, A sinister tapestry of urban unease and feminist fury that turns an ordinary domestic setting into a place of skulking terror. Original and deeply creepy.

Film Experience," January 2, 2017",Nathaniel Rogers, Anvari makes great use of this highly specific time and setting -- the air raids are always unnerving and one sequence in which Shideh runs into the empty streets of Tehran in a panic is just terrific.
Legion of Leia," December 29, 2016",Witney Seibold, 'Under the Shadow' is one of the more technically graceful and emotionally important films to come out of the genre this year.
Daily Dead," December 21, 2016",Heather Wixson," Those unexpected beats make for a deeply emotional and harrowing journey for not only Shideh and Dorsa, but for viewers as well."
Sunday Times (UK)," December 17, 2016",Edward Porter," A spine-chiller about a woman (Narges Rashidi) whose young daughter is picked on by an evil spirit, Babak Anvari's film is essentially formulaic, but its setting, Tehran in the 1980s, makes a difference."
AwardsCircuit.com," December 12, 2016",Shane Slater, [Anvari] effectively gives the impression of both a literal and metaphorical hell on earth.
The Sunday Age," December 9, 2016",Craig Mathieson," The debut feature from Iranian-born and British-based filmmaker Babak Anvari is an excellent mix of political repression, maternal dread, and suggestive myth."

San Diego Reader," November 18, 2016",Scott Marks, The shift from family drama to djinn game is so subtle as to be barely perceived
LarsenOnFilm," November 14, 2016",Josh Larsen," Apparently women should be covered at all times, even if djinn are chasing them."
Willamette Week," October 26, 2016",Grace Culhane," Anvari employs only the cream of the horror-trope crop, from decapitated dolls to creepy mute children and a newly abandoned Cold War-era apartment complex. The effect is a gradual shift from the merely creepy to the utterly terrifying."
New Zealand Herald," October 20, 2016",Russell Baillie," Yes, if you see only one Iranian horror movie this year, make it this one. A smart choice for Halloween."

Under the Radar," October 19, 2016",Julia Bembenek, Under the Shadow's greatest achievement is creating a genuinely terrifying film that also serves as an accurate and sympathetic encapsulation of life during wartime.
New Yorker," October 10, 2016",Anthony Lane," Did you honestly doubt that peeling duct tape and a sheet of printed fabric, if handled with imaginative brio, could be as frightening as any ten-million-dollar monster? O ye of little faith."
