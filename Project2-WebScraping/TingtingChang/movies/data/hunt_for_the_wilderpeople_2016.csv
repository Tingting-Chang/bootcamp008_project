Laramie Movie Scope," January 16, 2017",Robert Roten," I can't remember the last time I laughed this much at a movie. This wacky adventure set in New Zealand's wilderness is outrageously funny. It is filled with quirky, compelling characters and witty dialog."
Stuff.co.nz," December 29, 2016",Graeme Tuckett, Wilderpeople emerges as a hugely likeable but not always coherent yarn.
Stuff.co.nz," December 29, 2016",Sarah Watt," While there are numerous nods to cultural references only a local audience will appreciate, Ricky and Hec's emotional journey is one which every viewer can climb aboard."
New Yorker," December 29, 2016",Richard Brody, Gentle and appealing performances can't rescue this facile and cloying comedy.
Variety," December 29, 2016",Dennis Harvey," [Its] sheer good-naturedness pulls off a not particularly inspired crusty-old-coot-thawed-by-young-scamp concept, maintaining an agreeable tonal balance despite occasional wobbles between spoof, sentimentality and silliness."
MetroActive," December 29, 2016",Richard von Busack," In Hunt for the Wilderpeople by Taika Waititi, lush landscapes of the rainforest of New Zealand counter a sense of humor so toast-dry that it makes the British Ealing comedies of the 1950s seem overripe."
The Verge," December 29, 2016",Chris Plante, The film would be thuddingly familiar if not for Waititi's willingness to grasp overused tropes and manipulate them into something new.

Irish Times," December 27, 2016",Tara Brady," Sweeping cinematography (by Lachlan Milne) and playful editing (by Luke Haigh, Tom Eagles and Yana Gorskaya) make the adventure all the more majestical."
Financial Times," December 27, 2016",Nigel Andrews, Strictly for those who love pie-eyed problem pics with scenic wanderlust.
PopMatters," December 20, 2016",Jennifer Panzera, What keeps all this enchantment grounded is the characters.
Sunday Times (UK)," December 17, 2016",Edward Porter," It's formulaic at heart, but has a sweet, unpredictable sense of humour and a nice way with words."
The National (UAE)," December 12, 2016",James Mottram, Hunt for the Wilderpeople might just be Waititi's most triumphant moment to date.
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 11, 2016",Tim Brayton, A splendidly morbid comedy for the whole family.
tonymacklin.net," December 11, 2016",Tony Macklin, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a kicky treat. 
Film Inquiry," December 8, 2016",Benjamin Wang," Hunt for the Wilderpeople is unabashedly sentimental, and some of the specific tragic notes threaten to come across as cloying, but the comedy gives it a lot of life."
Collider," February 23, 2016",Matt Goldberg," While the plot and some of the characters may be a bit cartoonish, the emotions always feel honest and Waititi is able to get some big laughs thanks to his charming protagonists."
The Film Stage," February 19, 2016",Jordan Raup," If one imagines a real-life version of Up with a bit of Thelma & Louise thrown in, they get [this] charming on-the-run adventure comedy."
Nerdist," February 12, 2016",Russ Fischer," There's no point where Hunt for the Wilderpeople does anything that you've never seen before, but it would be crazy to hold that against a film made with such an effortlessly cultivated tone and an accommodating ear for comedy."
Eye for Film," February 4, 2016",Amber Wilkinson," Taika Waititi knows growing up isn't child's play but he also respects childhood as a place of adventure, where spontaneity rules and the possibilities are only limited by imagination."
Salt Lake City Weekly," January 31, 2016",Scott Renshaw," Built on formula, but when a formula is this well-executed, it's awfully hard to complain."
The Playlist," January 29, 2016",Sam Fragoso," ""Hunt For The Wilderpeople"" is a perfectly amicable dramedy that makes a concerted effort to avoid offending or provoking. "
Nerd Report," January 26, 2016",Fred Topel," Waititi manages the balance of tones perfectly and his eye for editing and action show both scale and restraint, so he won't fall short and won't go overboard. "
CraveOnline," January 26, 2016",William Bibbiani," There aren't a lot of truly fantastic kids movies out there nowadays, but this is one of them."
Film School Rejects," January 25, 2016",Rob Hunter," A sweetly-told, laugh-out-loud adventure that reminds us you're never too young or too old to find someone to love who'll also love you back."

sbs.com.au," May 25, 2016",Rochelle Siemienowicz," If you're after a film that's funny and sweet and harks back to a certain kind of innocent (but not toothless) 80s action-adventure, then Hunt for the Wilderpeople is perfect."
FILMINK (Australia)," May 25, 2016",Julian Wood, ...a very winning comedy. 
Consequence of Sound," May 23, 2016",Michael Roffman," In an age of branded films, it's such a relief to stumble upon a film like Hunt for the Wilderpeople. Filmmaking this fresh, this vibrant, and this affecting for all ages is rare these days."
The Sunday Age," May 23, 2016",Craig Mathieson, The humour here is derived from the gap between a fantastic scenario and the everyday outcomes. It's [Waititi's] ability to create a self-contained world - complete with amateurish songs - which makes the resulting dialogue so amusing. 
Urban Cinefile," May 22, 2016",Andrew L. Urban," I do find New Zealand films refreshingly offbeat, crazy in the most entertaining way, and peopled with characters who inhabit the outer edges of society. In this film, those characteristics are in abundance"
Urban Cinefile," May 22, 2016",Louise Keller, It's a small film with a big heart and one whose charm resonates and grows on you
Student Edge," May 22, 2016",Simon Miraudo," The Revenant had a lot of things (too many things, even), but it didn't have the heart, humour and hoodies of Taika Waititi's Hunt for the Wilderpeople... one of 2016's best, warmest and wildest comedies."

Flavorwire," April 26, 2016",Jason Bailey," It's a gentle movie, but with a bittersweet edge - and it's funny as hell to boot."
Comic Book Resources," April 25, 2016",Kristy Puchko," Full of character and comedy, it's easily one of the best films of the year."
We Got This Covered," April 23, 2016",Matt Donato," Hunt For The Wilderpeople is a comical, soul-searching tale from the Bush that delights around every leaf-covered turn."
Slant Magazine," April 20, 2016",Elise Nakhnikian, It finds humor and love in a potentially grim situation without ever belittling or caricaturing the characters.
Village Voice," April 20, 2016",Nick Schager," Neil proves compellingly gruff as a reluctant father figure, though it's the trash-talking, family-craving ten-year-old Dennison who steals the show, exuding a wacko, wounded attitude rooted in Ricky's backwoods Rambo-Scarface-Mad Max reveries."
New Zealand Herald," April 1, 2016",Russell Baillie," The remarkable performance of young Julian Dennison as Ricky Baker, the city juvenile delinquent fostered out in the backblocks, gives Wilderpeople most of its many laughs. But he's not just there doing cute stuff and being precocious."
Flicks.co.nz," March 31, 2016",Steve Newall," A hilarious, heartwarming tale that harnesses script, direction and performances and takes plenty of creative risks on its way to delivering movie magic."
Austin Chronicle," March 15, 2016",Michael Agresta, A throwback family classic in the mold of The Goonies.
Bullz-Eye.com," June 23, 2016",Jason Zingale, A delightful little movie that ranks as one of the more pleasant surprises of the year thus far.
AV Club," June 23, 2016",Mike D'Angelo," An enjoyably goofy adventure that manages to bring some freshness to the moldy ""cantankerous adult reluctantly bonds with adorable kid"" subgenre."
NOW Toronto," June 22, 2016",Norman Wilner, [A] lovely little study of bonding and healing in the New Zealand bush.
Film Journal International," June 22, 2016",Michael Sauter," In the midst of another big blockbuster summer, this raffish comedy-adventure provides a breath of fresh air."
Slant Magazine," June 22, 2016",Chuck Bowen, It infuses an outdoorsy survival tale and a coming-of-age story of friendship with Taika Waititi's penchant for distaff flakiness.
New York Daily News," June 21, 2016",Edward Douglas, A wonderful slice of New Zealand-bred humor that should have a far wider appeal than Waititi's previous films.
Metro," June 20, 2016",Matt Prigge," A rollicking, joke-filled, brightly-colored boys' adventure where both boy and adult get to be boys."
CineVue," June 19, 2016",Matthew Anderson, As a transient feel-good movie it certainly is 'magestical'.
The Skinny," June 16, 2016",Michelle Devereaux," Quirky outsider comedy is clearly Waititi's forte, and here it's polished to an effortlessly funny, confident and crowd-pleasing shine."
Hollywood Reporter," June 14, 2016",Todd McCarthy, A deliciously good time at the movies.
ABC Radio Brisbane," June 3, 2016",Matthew Toomey, This is Waititi's best film yet. The way he mixes tones throughout the film is a thing of beauty.
Washington City Paper," June 2, 2016",Noah Gittell," With its youthful protagonist, wicked sense of humor, and monstrous depiction of authority figures, the spirit of Roald Dahl is alive and well in Hunt for the Wilderpeople."
Concrete Playground," June 2, 2016",Tom Glasson," Offbeat, intimate and impressively affecting, this Kiwi comedy is one of the year's strongest films to date."
Junkee," June 1, 2016",Lachlan Kanoniuk," This may sound like a standard adventure narrative or buddy film, but Waititi magnificently feels out the nuances with enormous heart."

Rip It Up," June 1, 2016",David 'Mad Dog' Bradley, New Zealand has never looked more breath-taking (and fearsome) and the performances are all tremendous here.
Guardian," May 31, 2016",Nigel M. Smith," Dennison holds his own opposite Neill, who hasn't been tasked with such a gravely amusing role in years. Together, the two are comic dynamite."
The Popcorn Junkie," May 31, 2016",Cameron Williams," It's like being killed with kindness, a good problem to have but a hard one to define beyond pleasantries "
ABC Radio (Australia)," May 27, 2016",CJ Johnson," Waititi, who wrote the screenplay based on a novel by Barry Crump, is pretty fearless in his tonal palette ... It's not your conventional, conservative kid's flick, to its definite credit."
Sydney Morning Herald," May 27, 2016",Paul Byrnes," Sam Neill is as good as he's ever been, spurred on by his unpredictable and lively offsider, Julian Dennison. It's a good sign when you don't want a movie to end."
The Verge," June 29, 2016",Tasha Robinson," Like What We Do In The Shadows, Wilderpeople is laugh-out-loud funny and full of left-turn surprises."
IGN Movies," June 29, 2016",Josh Lasser," Full of off-kilter characters, an improbable set of events, and a touching if predictable ending, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is as enjoyable to watch as it is a gorgeously shot film."

Rolling Stone," June 26, 2016",David Fear, An oddball and oddly affecting take on two misfits finding their metaphorical partner-in-crime match.
Paste Magazine," June 24, 2016",Kenji Fujishima, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is ultimately disarming in its innocent sincerity.
Reeling Reviews," June 24, 2016",Laura Clifford," a hilarious and heartfelt adventure that's a Kiwi twist on the curmudgeonly Carl and overweight outsider Russell of Pixar's ""Up"" by way of the outlaws that were ""Thelma and Louise."""

New York Times," June 23, 2016",Manohla Dargis," ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" takes a troika of familiar story types - the plucky kid, the crusty geezer, the nurturing bosom - and strips them of cliché."

NPR," June 23, 2016",Andrew Lapin, A familiar sort of coming-of-age movie made more interesting by the uniqueness of its setting and its off-kilter Kiwi humor.
Los Angeles Times," June 23, 2016",Kenneth Turan," Every once in a while, a small, unheralded film comes along, so smart and funny, such a pleasure to experience, you can't believe your luck. ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is such a film."

CinemaBlend.com," June 23, 2016",Eric Eisenberg," It's off-beat in all the best ways, has fantastic actors all delivering fantastic performances, and is a uproarious adventure with endless heart."
Entertainment Weekly," June 23, 2016",Chris Nashawaty," Dennison juggles foulmouthed brattiness and sweet sincerity well enough, and Neill soars as a gruff outdoorsman hiding a soft, chewy center."
Kaplan vs. Kaplan," July 8, 2016",Jeanne Kaplan," It's a beautiful and moving ""buddy"" story --- full of hilarity. "
Kaplan vs. Kaplan," July 8, 2016",David Kaplan," Without the exceptional performances from Sam Neill and Julian Dennison, ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" would likely devolve into an outlandish situation comedy-wannabe. "
"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," July 8, 2016",Robert Horton," Given Waititi's creativity, I was a little disappointed in how few surprises there are in Wilderpeople. But it's all right to be just a well-executed charmer -- and this movie is certainly that."

Chicago Reader," July 7, 2016",J. R. Jones," Waititi looks for humor in quirks of character and degrees of stubbornness, and the natural challenges of Crump's wilderness journey generate a succession of belly laughs onscreen as the gruff old man scraps with the loudmouthed kid."
Seattle Times," July 7, 2016",Soren Anderson," Laugh-out-loud funny one minute, achingly sad the next, ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" takes the audience on a rollicking yet poignant journey through the New Zealand backcountry in the company of a pair of engagingly eccentric characters."
Chicago Daily Herald," July 7, 2016",Dann Gire, A kind and moving story bristling with honest humor and genuine affection for its characters.
Arizona Republic," July 7, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," Dennison is a marvel, completely unself-conscious in his portrayal of a kid who is lost but thinks if he acts tough, it'll look like he's found. Neill, playing a different sort of character for him (quiet, unfriendly), is also outstanding."

Washington Post," June 30, 2016",Ann Hornaday," Waititi is an expansive, warm-hearted humanist. The fun he pokes is strictly superficial, never grazing his characters' vital organs or essential dignity."

New England Movies Weekly," July 22, 2016",Sean Burns," Waititi's film has the stylized exaggerations and emotional directness of the best children's literature. Everything is just a tiny bit louder and more colorful than real life, but the feelings are straightforward and unadorned. "

Film Ireland Magazine," October 5, 2016",James Bartlett," A mixture of comedy, drama, whimsy and anarchy (and with plenty of charm to spare, even if sometimes the tone wavers a little), this is almost impossible not to like, and it's the strong characters that draw you in."
Independent (UK)," September 19, 2016",Jack Shepherd," There's brilliant chemistry between Dennison and Neil, the pair quite obviously bouncing off each other; a joy to watch on screen, and as the story progresses you begin to feel like a member of their special pack, gleefully part of the adventure."
Observer (UK)," September 18, 2016",Wendy Ide," The film's main asset is an unaffected naturalism, both in the film-making, and in the unpolished characters that we root for."
Times (UK)," September 16, 2016",Kate Muir," Hunt for the Wilderpeople has been a huge audience favourite at festivals this year and you can see why, with its brand of dark New Zealand humour, coupled with a boy's own adventure story that goes not merely off the rails, but off-road and off-grid."
