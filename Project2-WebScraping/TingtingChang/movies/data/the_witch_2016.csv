Brooklyn Magazine," June 28, 2016",Jesse Hassenger," Though there is some real horror-movie imagery on hand, writer-director Robert Eggers also summons dread with small farmhouse touches: the thwack of an axe on wood, the eyes of a goat called Black Philip, the rustles of branches."
Eclipse Magazine," June 21, 2016",Michelle Alexandria," If you aren't a fan of Witchcraft based horror films, this isn't going to change your mind. At times confusing, creepy, and has brief spurts of over the top bloodletting. I left wondering, what did I just watch? "

Consequence of Sound," September 22, 2015",Sarah Kurchak," The Witch is worth watching. Just don't get too wrapped up in the hysteria that surrounds it. As the film itself so admirably demonstrates, unquestioned passion and devotion doesn't tend to end particularly well."

NOW Toronto," September 10, 2015",Norman Wilner," Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are painfully believable as a God-fearing couple desperately trying to rationalize the inexplicable, and Anya Taylor-Joy is simply stunning as their terrified, all-too-innocent eldest daughter."

Kansas City Star," February 18, 2016",Jon Niccum, What appears to be a moody and earnest attempt at genuine horror transforms into a drab downer. A drama turned parable turned confused exploitation flick.

Boston Globe," February 18, 2016",Ty Burr," Eggers doles out the horror sparingly and eerily: an image of blood in a milk pail, a moving shape in the shadow of a barn. The movie uses lamplight and hearth light to conceal as much as they reveal."

Reeling Reviews," February 20, 2016",Laura Clifford," This production is absolute perfection in every regard, from its well researched screenplay and art direction to its great ensemble cast and unnerving score"
The Patriot Ledger," February 20, 2016",Al Alexander," If you're looking for a movie that's better than hex, lay down with ""The Witch."" It's guaranteed to bewitch, bother and bewilder."
Killer Movie Reviews," February 20, 2016",Andrea Chase, this dour psychological thriller plumbs the depths of madness that human nature invites upon itself with a closed mind and a conviction of righteousness.
LarsenOnFilm," February 20, 2016",Josh Larsen," ""...a consideration of evil without and evil within."""
"City Pages, Minneapolis/St. Paul"," February 20, 2016",Michael Nordine," We fear such things because they're unnatural, a perversion of everything we know to be true about the world. The Witch renders them even more horrifying by suggesting that they are natural - that witches and spirits have been here all along."
Creative Loafing," February 20, 2016",Matt Brunson," The Witch harbors several weighty themes, including the fear of the feminine mystique in a patriarchal society as well as the danger of placing too much faith in a puritanical belief without allowing other emotions an equal opportunity to breathe."
Examiner.com," February 20, 2016",Chris Sawin, The imagery of The Witch plunges into territory many films wouldn't even have the balls to consider. This is a hellish journey that scares and captivates in a slickly subtle way that is both satisfying and memorable. 
The Young Folks," February 20, 2016",Nathanael Hood," By pulling back the curtain and revealing the presence of the supernatural, The Witch ruins what could have been a stunning examination of the roots of why young women like Thomasin were accused of sorcery. "
ReelViews," February 20, 2016",James Berardinelli, I would prefer seeing a failed attempt at something different than a regurgitation of every modern horror trope. Yet The Witch proves unable to capitalize on being different.
Times (UK)," March 10, 2016",Kevin Maher, The best moments are early on.
Empire Magazine," March 10, 2016",Chris Hewitt (UK)," A hugely assured debut, The Witch is a beautiful, bleak brainworm that will haunt you for days."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," March 10, 2016",Robbie Collin," One of the scariest horror movies in years - and not the creep-up-and-prod-you kind of scary either, but a profound, unsettling dread that gnaws at your bones, and which comes back to find you in the dark."
Graffiti With Punctuation," March 10, 2016",Blake Howard, Eggers 'New England Folktale' exhumes the concept of the witch back from the primordial place we hid her; and it's as chilling as it is clever.
Fan The Fire," March 8, 2016",Martin Roberts," It's a well played, pleasingly sinister film. Not outright scary for most of its runtime, and not perhaps what many fans of mainstream horror will be expecting, but it has the power to disturb."
Thrillist," March 7, 2016",Matt Patches," The payoff will keep your mind racing, and your face hiding under the covers, for days."
Little White Lies," March 7, 2016",Sophie Monks Kaufman, Its hypnotic spell lingers.
Total Film," March 7, 2016",Jamie Graham," Robert Eggers' measured, meticulous debut builds into one of the most genuinely scary horror movies of recent years."
ShockTillYouDrop.com," March 4, 2016",Chris Alexander, Magnificent.
ABC Radio (Australia)," March 3, 2016",CJ Johnson," Artful and beautifully crafted little gem ... while it's creepy and atmospheric, it's as far from a rollercoaster of jump-scares as it is from a barrel of laughs."
Seven Days," March 3, 2016",Margot Harrison," We leave it deeply unsettled, as if we've time traveled back into our ancestors' worst nightmares. "
Cinemaphile.org," March 2, 2016",David Keyes," A movie that looks great, builds immense atmosphere and then allows it all to putter out well before we are even close to reaching any significant momentum."
Chicago Reader," February 29, 2016",Andrea Gronvall, The Witch is sparing in its use of special effects and generates suspense and foreboding through what is suggested rather than what is seen.
Chicago Reader," February 29, 2016",J. R. Jones," In the tradition of William Friedkin's The Exorcist, this chilling low-budget horror movie taps into the same temporal fear that sparks religious feeling."
"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," February 29, 2016",John Beifuss," This story about a 17th-century Puritan family struggling to survive at the edge of the wilderness becomes a dark American origin story: a beautiful promise, corrupted by fear and hypocrisy. The fruit is rotten; the milk bloody."
CinemaDope," February 28, 2016",Glenn Lovell," Not to worry, the satanic entity found herein is not of the head-spinning, pea soup-spewing variety ... Eggers is too smart to recycle a Central Casting Lucifer."
Missoula Independent," February 27, 2016",Molly Laich," In this alternative history, the tension comes from the murky unknowns between true black magic and paranoia, because both are at play. "
Under the Radar," February 26, 2016",Austin Trunick, There's a gut-wrenching sense of dread that saturates nearly every minute of director Robert Eggers' feature debut.
EricDSnider.com," February 26, 2016",Eric D. Snider," It has a creeping darkness, leaving you with the sense that you've taken a harrowing ride through hell and gotten some of it on you."
ABC News Radio," February 25, 2016",David Blaustein, The Witch is an extraordinarily well-acted horror film.
Student Edge," March 17, 2016",Simon Miraudo," The Witch's scares are plentiful; it's just that many of them come after, once you're alone with your thoughts, and its disturbing images suddenly return to mind. The closing credits only cap the horror; they do not end it."
Sydney Morning Herald," March 16, 2016",Jake Wilson," As a curio, The Witch has its own fascination; at least until the over-explicit finale shatters much of the mood that has been so carefully built up."
Rip It Up," March 15, 2016",David 'Mad Dog' Bradley, One of the best (and creepiest) movies of the year so far.
Cinencuentro," March 15, 2016",Sebastian Zavala Kahn, One of the best horror films I've seen in years. [Full review in Spanish]
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," March 14, 2016",Aine O'Connor," The Witch suggests rather than shows and leaves much to audience interpretation. For a horror film, it is mostly psychological; there are no jump moments and not much gore. It's clever and atmospheric and creepy."
London Evening Standard," March 14, 2016",Charlotte O'Sullivan," Aware that gender, as much as faith, remains a burning issue, Eggers makes our hearts swell and our brains sweat."
Observer (UK)," March 13, 2016",Mark Kermode," An atmospheric chiller rooted in the fertile soil of religious zealotry, social isolation and original sin."
Cinema em Cena," March 12, 2016",Pablo Villaça, It's a horror movie less concerned with scares than with the idea of exploring the darkness of the individuals who inhabit its world. [Full review in Portuguese.]
Urban Cinefile," March 12, 2016",Andrew L. Urban," Visually and viscerally effective, intelligent and haunting"
Irish Independent," March 11, 2016",Paul Whitington, Robert Eggars' directorial debut The Witch is so good it almost feels as if William Friedkin had decided to have a pop at Arthur Miller's Crucible.
The Herald (Ireland)," March 11, 2016",Chris Wasser," Wonderfully acted and featuring a deeply unsettling score, Eggers builds his story meticulously, presenting an eerie, slow-burning sense of dread that, eventually, gives way to a distressing finale."
Hot Press," March 11, 2016",Roe McDermott," Robert Eggers' remarkable debut is deeply unsettling portrayal of paranoia, torment and repression in an isolated Puritan family."
The Australian," March 11, 2016",David Stratton," The little-known cast of British actors succeeds in convincingly portraying these threatened pilgrims who, while seeking out a new and better life, find themselves in the middle of an inexplicable nightmare."
Irish Times," March 11, 2016",Donald Clarke," Anybody seeking torture porn or mindless jump shocks will be in for a disappointment, but Eggers's slippery, intelligent film is not short of accumulating unease."
Radio Times," March 11, 2016",Jeremy Aspinall, Spellbinding horror that drips with dread.
The Sun (UK)," March 10, 2016",Alex Zane, Don't expect any jumpscares here or to leave the cinema particularly terrified. The Witch is a slow-burner of weirdness in the wilderness and unlike any recent horror film.
Sky Movies," March 10, 2016",Rob Daniel," Perfectly riding a knife edge of ambiguity, what is religious hysteria and what could be real is a guessing game sustained until the memorable climax."
Daily Mail (UK)," March 10, 2016",Brian Viner," On the whole Eggers skilfully avoids too many classic horror-film tropes, as the family's already fervent belief in hell is insidiously, traumatically, reinforced."
Guardian," March 10, 2016",Benjamin Lee," Like any outstanding horror film, its true impact only reveals itself once the credits have rolled and it stays buried under your skin, breaking through every now and then to remind you of its insidious power."
Independent (UK)," March 10, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab, The problem is that the craft and artistry are just too laboured and foregrounded.
El antepenúltimo mohicano," April 28, 2016",Alberto Sáez Villarino, The visual elements are key to the film. What scares the spectator is everything that you can't hear or see. [Full review in Spanish]
Flavorwire," April 27, 2016",Jason Bailey," A film that surrounds you with a general yet mostly indescribable sense of unease, less through its violence or blood than its mood and tension. And then it clobbers you."
People Magazine," April 25, 2016",Tom Gliatto, At times it's like The Shining directed by Cotton Mather.
Movie Talk," April 9, 2016",Jason Best, Eggers keeps us enthralled with his film's mix of folktale eeriness and period authenticity.
Cinemixtape," April 7, 2016",J. Olson," It's anything but a sure thing for mainstream horror audiences, a ride best taken with expectations in check and a healthy taste for metaphor."
Laramie Movie Scope," April 6, 2016",Robert Roten," This is a super dark and depressing story. Though it is well acted, and it does have some emotional power, I would not recommend that anyone spend money to see this movie that tries to have its supernatural cake, and fake reality too."
Clarín," April 5, 2016",Pablo A. Scholz," A psychological horror film, even if it has some of the scariest scenes ever. [Full review in Spanish]"
John Hanlon Reviews," April 2, 2016",John Hanlon, An intense supernatural thriller that is as anxiety-producing as it is geniunely unpredictable. 
Cinemalogue.com," April 1, 2016",Todd Jorgenson," Austere and haunting, the film's low-key twists and creepy imagery resonate afterward."
Contactmusic.com," April 1, 2016",Rich Cline," To make one of the most inventive and unnerving horror films in recent memory, writer-director Robert Eggers conducted extensive research into folktales from the witch-hunt era of 17th century New England."
FilmGamed," March 29, 2016",Mahmoud Mahdy," Associating the movie with mysteries and thrillers, rather than horror, sounds more fitting for me to appreciate the beautiful picture that Robert Eggers is introducing."
Cairo360," March 28, 2016",Marija Loncarevic," The film uses the power of suggestion to deliver its chills. Disturbing, but not necessarily in-your-face scary, there is a lot to appreciate about The Witch - you just have to give it a chance."
Concrete Playground," March 26, 2016",Tom Clift," While the film's gnawing brand of terror may not be particularly immediate, its lingering effects are also far less easily dispelled."
Film Freak Central," March 26, 2016",Walter Chaw," I can't wait to see it again, but I'm afraid to."
FILMINK (Australia)," March 24, 2016",Sarah Ward," Feature debutant Eggers proves a master of mood more than story, though the success of the former overcomes the familiar nature of the latter."
The Sunday Age," March 23, 2016",Craig Mathieson," Eggers' aesthetic, suffused with artful dread and punctuated by a malevolent goat, runs deep, and its portrait of American hysteria manages to feel both historical and contemporary."
sbs.com.au," March 23, 2016",Rochelle Siemienowicz," Original and moody, especially in its strong start, The Witch is a must-see for all fans of spooky, stylish, supernatural horror."
Impulse Gamer," March 21, 2016",Damien Straker, The Witch is a rare treat today: a horror movie that gripped me not because it is immediately gory but because of the ambiguous means in which it is told.
Herald Sun (Australia)," March 18, 2016",Leigh Paatsch," A slow and sinister exercise in ever-escalating dread, The Witch is quite unlike any other horror movie you have ever seen. Or felt."
Cinencuentro," March 18, 2016",César Cortez, There's no doubt that this is one of the best horror movies in recent history and that's a good thing for the genre. [Full review in Spanish]
Seanax.com," May 19, 2016",Sean Axmaker," It's dark and spooky and suggestive and at times genuinely terrifying, and it leaves you wondering just how much belief guides our perceptions."
En Filme," May 19, 2016",Luis Fernando Galván, A hellish ride that disturbs and captivates at the same time with all of its subtelties. The Witch is a gratifying and memorable experience. [Full review in Spanish]
El Universal," May 19, 2016",Alonso Díaz de la Vega, This might be one of the most original horror films today. [Full review in Spanish]
Chilango.com," May 19, 2016",Oswaldo Betancourt Lozano," A film that will disturb you, and if it doesn't there is something wrong with you. [Full review in Spanish]"
El Fanzine," May 18, 2016",Gonzalo Lira Galván," The Witch is much more than a horror film, specially because it never goes for easy scares or cheap thrils that are common place in the more commercial aspect of the genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
Butaca Ancha," May 18, 2016",JJ Negrete," A valuable film due to it's rich context, it's vision of fundamentalism as something evil, an elegant cinematography work and an art direction that's only as good as Kate Dickie and Harvey Scrimshaw's performances.[Full review in Spanish]"
Garuyo," May 18, 2016",Uriel Barco, The Witch is a milestone for modern horror. [Full review in Spanish]
Blog de cine," May 16, 2016",Mikel Zorrilla, A magnificent work of horror. [Full review in Spanish]
The Blu Spot," May 16, 2016",Jeff Beck," The Witch does an excellent job in establishing its 1630s New England setting, but when it comes to the film's storyline, it's never quite able to reach the compelling and disturbing heights that writer/director Robert Eggers strives for."
3AW," May 14, 2016",Jim Schembri," A powerful example of minimalist horror film-making at its best, where less is definitely more and mood proves itself infinitely more unsettling and unnerving than visual effects."
El Mundo (Spain)," May 13, 2016",Luis Martínez," With no gimmicks and a lot of patience, this is one of the most disturbing films of the year. [Full review in Spanish]"
La Vanguardia (Spain)," May 13, 2016",Jordi Batlle," Suggestive and disturbing horror, even more because of the lack of special effects or jump scares. [Full review in Spanish]"

RTÉ (Ireland)," May 12, 2016",Harry Guerin," The Witch does a lot of things very well, but - to these eyes -- it's a bit off the classic that the clamour has claimed. You may feel very differently."
Blog de cine," May 12, 2016",Sergio Benítez," A film with haunting sensations that will make you sick, it shakes you on your core, primitive and raw horror. [Full review in Spanish]"
Konexión," May 9, 2016",Iván Belmont, The witch is an excellent period piece that evoques perfectly English romanticism on every shot and boasts great performances from every member of it's cast. [Full review in Spanish]
Cinemanía (Spain)," May 9, 2016",Irene Crespo, Eggers explores the puritan faith of the 18th Century and the witch hunt to touch themes such as misogyny in Christianity. [Full review in Spanish]
Bangkok Post," May 9, 2016",Kong Rithdee," Eggers's touch can sometimes feel stagey, but for the most part The Witch has a classical rigour that services its ominous build-up."
Den of Geek," May 8, 2016",David Crow, the effect [of The Witch] only works if it is immediately accepted that this is a film where Evil with a 'capital E' resides.
The Straits Times (Singapore)," May 4, 2016",John Lui," Actors Ineson, Dickie and Anya Taylor-Joy exult in the archaic language, delivering powerful performances in this fairy tale of a family given a glimpse of the forces that lurk on the edge of the civilised world."
Baltimore Magazine," June 10, 2016",Max Weiss," As horror films go, the film is more slow burn than an edge-of-your-seat thriller, but it builds steadily to its dreadful and earned conclusion."

Proceso," June 8, 2016",Fausto Ponce," The type of horror in this film is a slow burn so it might not click with casual viewers, but lovers of the genre can't miss this film. [Full review in Spanish]"
Pitch.com," May 31, 2016",Eric Melin, The lack of answers and stifling cultural specificity are what give The Witch its gnawing power.
