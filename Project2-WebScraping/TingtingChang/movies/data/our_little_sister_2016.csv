Total Film," December 30, 2016",Kate Stables," Filled with cherry-blossom gorgeousness and sentimental homages to small-town Japanese life, it's a film of quiet, telling moments, even when big revelations surface. "
Financial Times," December 27, 2016",Raphael Abraham," [A] warmly enveloping exploration of grief, guilt and gradually letting go."
Sunday Times (UK)," December 18, 2016",Edward Porter," It helps that Koreeda's way with atmosphere is in full effect. The film has tranquil settings, fresh-food meals, cherry blossoms and soothing breezes; watching it is a good way to clear your head."
Cleveland Plain Dealer," November 10, 2016",Michael Heaton," Our Little Sister is not so much a dramatic work as a cinematic tone poem. The point of the movie is not to get anywhere in particular, but just to enjoy the journey along the way."
Georgia Straight," November 9, 2016",Ken Eisner," Often compared with Yasujirō Ozu's domestic tales, Koreeda's films share that Chekhovian vibe, but his movies have more cinematic fluidity and highly tactile surfaces; he makes you feel things you might otherwise forget."
Winnipeg Free Press," October 14, 2016",Alison Gillmor," There are minor conflicts and revelations, but these never seem like plot points. Rather they feel like the fabric of everyday life, observed with limpid simplicity and given powerful emotional effect with natural, easy, unforced performances."

Minneapolis Star Tribune," September 15, 2016",Colin Covert," Kore-eda has made a career of family stories focused on youth, some of them heartbreakingly bleak. Here he uses a much lighter brush, creating a picture that is simpler than most, and all the more beautiful for it."

Salt Lake Tribune," September 8, 2016",Sean P. Means, The most touching of family reunions.
Austin Chronicle," September 8, 2016",Marjorie Baumgarten," Kore-eda is one of the most optimistic and humanist filmmakers working today, and even though Our Little Sister isn't quite as finely articulated as some of his previous work, his core compassion for humanity comes through clearly."
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," September 2, 2016",Philip Martin," ...a lyrical, plain-sung movie about people who are obliged to love one another. And do."
Blu-ray.com," August 25, 2016",Brian Orndorf," While urgency is less of a priority this time out, the helmer still puts together an irresistible collection of characters and personal issues."
"Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)"," August 24, 2016",Bob Bloom," 'Our Little Sister' is a tender and restrained feature that flows by like a gentle stream, lulling you with its melodic cadence and drawing you into its beauty."
Arizona Republic," August 18, 2016",Barbara VanDenburgh," Under a less masterful hand, you'd be dying for a fistfight, a sex scene or a gunshot to shatter the calm. But Koreeda makes thrilling the rich inner lives of four young women trying to navigate rocky emotional terrain in the wake of their father's death."
Charlotte Observer," August 18, 2016",Lawrence Toppman," By the end, a Zen-like calm that might be mistaken for stasis settles over the story. But these lives move forward slowly, inexorably, and they move us, too."
Las Vegas Weekly," August 17, 2016",Josh Bell," [Kore-eda] captures small interactions beautifully, and builds up a layered portrait of the main characters' everyday lives in those meaningful gestures and exchanges."
EricDSnider.com," August 16, 2016",Eric D. Snider," Koreeda's restrained style and gentle pace may try some viewers' patience, but if you can roll with it, it's a lovely, poignant slice of life."
Movie Nation," August 12, 2016",Roger Moore," Static, slow and slight, but with its own rewards. "
Seattle Weekly," August 11, 2016",Robert Horton," Even death is part of the flow, part of the process of getting along and finding a place in the world."

El Fanzine," March 9, 2016",Gonzalo Lira Galván," Koreeda achieves an intimate and timely film that results in its way of illustrating the history of growth, life, death and the family. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Jerusalem Post," March 2, 2016",Hannah Brown," This movie is more episodic and less plot-driven than his previous work but no less enjoyable. For some, Our Little Sister will be too slow, but anyone who can stick with it will be rewarded."
The Film Stage," February 22, 2016",Giovanni Marchini Camia," Kore-eda seems to have bitten off more than he can chew, delivering an uneven and ultimately superficial story of emotional maturation."
BuzzFeed News," November 10, 2015",Alison Willmore," Offering up their hard-won home and refusing to let Suzu be saddled with her parents' baggage, grows more and more breathtaking in retrospect, a quiet act of grace and love that the film provides just the right showcase for."
Sight and Sound," November 5, 2015",Nick Roddick," Slightly hampered by an episodic structure deriving from its source, Our Little Sister is nevertheless a seductive and engrossing celebration of family and community."

What Culture," September 25, 2015",Alex Leadbeater, The most subtle comic adaptation you'll see all year.
NOW Toronto," September 14, 2015",Norman Wilner," A methodically paced, quietly moving experience."
Reel Film Reviews," September 12, 2015",David Nusair, Our Little Sister slowly-but-surely morphs from a passable character study into a seriously (and aggressively) interminable cinematic endurance test. 
Hollywood Reporter," August 20, 2015",Leslie Felperin," The result is an episodic, generous-spirited, pristinely shot and, quite frankly, somewhat dull effort."
sbs.com.au," August 20, 2015",Rochelle Siemienowicz, There's no doubting the film's commitment to a compassionate understanding of the complexities of the human heart.
Daily Telegraph (UK)," July 20, 2015",Tim Robey," Precisely because it's less emotionally coercive than Kore-eda's last couple of pictures, it's even more moving: rather than lunging full-bore for the solar plexus, the truths it's telling creep up on you."
Screen International," July 20, 2015",Dan Fainaru," Kore-Eda's film is more than the beautifully luminous faces of his actresses, the particular way they move and speak, or the lovely landscapes of Kamakura, even though all of these should be admired."
Variety," July 20, 2015",Maggie Lee, Hirokazu Kore-eda's latest fractured-family drama is a graceful yet somewhat emotionally muffled portrait of four siblings.
Guardian," July 20, 2015",Peter Bradshaw, There is such compositional flair here.
Bangkok Post," May 10, 2016",Kong Rithdee," Put simply, Hirokazu Kore-eda has made another one of his films: delicate, heart-tugging, sweet but not cloying, a meandering stream of limpid water under which an eddy of emotions, unsettled pasts and unspoken worries swirl."
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," April 18, 2016",Hilary A White," Not a huge amount happens yet it is transfixing at times, largely a product of superbly moulded characters, gentle humour, refined performances and a charming devotion to human warmth."
Scotsman," April 17, 2016",Alistair Harkness," A deeply humane look at the way the shards of a broken family unit can be reconfigured into something warm, positive and functional."
Daily Express (UK)," April 17, 2016",Allan Hunter," Is it sentimental? Of course, but never unbearably so thanks to the director's delicate touch."
Observer (UK)," April 17, 2016",Mark Kermode," As its magical spell takes hold, so the film's true depths become apparent, each character dealing in their own way with the departure of a parent, and issues of love, loyalty and loss."
Irish Independent," April 15, 2016",Paul Whitington," It's a delightful film, excellently acted and charged with undercurrents of familial emotion."
Radio Times," April 14, 2016",Wendy Ide," The film's gentle, empathetic tone might seem a little toothless compared to the peril or conflict of Koreeda's earlier work, but it's a warm, embracing joy of a movie to watch."
Times (UK)," April 14, 2016",Kate Muir," Hirokazu Koreeda's Our Little Sister is a gentle, lyrical, beautifully shot story of three sisters who take in their 14-year-old half-sister, and find their past is not what it seemed."

Sensacine," March 18, 2016",Carlos Losilla, Kore-ede manages to make every image surface little by little in comedic or dramatic situations that flow into each other naturally. [Full Review in Spanish]
Excelsior," March 18, 2016",Lucero Solórzano, Highly recomended. [Full review in Spanish]
Cine Vértigo," March 16, 2016",Ernesto Diezmartinez, A delicate and femenine family melodrama. [Full review in Spanish] 
Garuyo," March 15, 2016",Uriel Barco," At a first glance it doesn't seem to be any purpose to the film, but this is a tale about family and a dysfunctional one at best. [Full review in Spanish]"

Village Voice," July 8, 2016",Kenji Fujishima," All one needs is a close-up of Suzu's face euphorically looking skyward, eyes closed, as she rides on a road surrounded by cherry blossoms to grasp the laudable humanity at the heart of Kore-eda's patient, warmhearted worldview."
Metro," July 8, 2016",Matt Prigge, The nicest movie in theaters right now is 'Our Little Sister.' That's not to say it's not sad or dark or that its characters can't be prickly and neurotic.
Christian Science Monitor," July 8, 2016",Peter Rainer," Kore-eda may have moved away from the adventurous, mysterioso moodiness of early films like ""After Life,"" but the smiles he provokes here -- both with his characters and with us -- are well-earned."
RogerEbert.com," July 8, 2016",Simon Abrams, Japanese melodrama Our Little Sister is the rare film that captures the everyday pleasures and anguishes of family life.
Paste Magazine," July 8, 2016",Tim Grierson," Kore-eda's latest exudes the same sentimental, unhurried tone of ""Still Walking"" and ""Like Father, Like Son,"" and to be sure it's a simple tale without many surprises. But in his hands, that slightness can feel elemental, timeless."

New Yorker," July 5, 2016",Anthony Lane," Nobody could describe the movie as eventful (and viewers may be surprised to learn that it's adapted from a graphic novel), yet the thrust of Kore-eda's storytelling, as so often, is that even a quiet life can be a full one."
Slant Magazine," July 4, 2016",Christopher Gray, The film's reserve softens some of its more piquant observations about tradition and mortality.

Philadelphia Inquirer," July 29, 2016",Steven Rea," If you succumb to Koreeda's slow rhythms, the climbs up a hill to find a magnificent view, the walks along the beach, the simple peace of a shared meal, this is the kind of movie that will leave you feeling restored, maybe a little misty-eyed as well."
Montreal Gazette," July 28, 2016",T'Cha Dunlevy," As he eases toward his subtly stirring resolution, it's hard to resist getting swept up in the moment; for somewhere along the way, Kore-eda has brought us into the fold."
Chicago Reader," July 28, 2016",Dmitry Samarov," Koreeda allows the action to unfold gradually, and plum wine isn't the only food metaphor enriching his tale. Each meal seems like an invitation for the sisters to learn more about each other or to be reminded-for good or ill-of their parents."
Boston Globe," July 28, 2016",Peter Keough," ""Sister"" ... broods on the past, on how it defines the present and future, but as a film about remembering it is not especially memorable."
SSG Syndicate," July 24, 2016",Susan Granger," Slight, serene and sweet, it's a subtly calming interlude..."

RTÉ (Ireland)," July 20, 2016",Paddy Kehoe, The four girls in Our Little Sister make an impressive ensemble as their inclusive spirit and positive outlook restore a kind of equilibrium to a troubled hearth. It must be one of the films of the year.
Reeling Reviews," July 20, 2016",Laura Clifford," The Brazilians have a word for the feeling Kore-eda evokes, saudade, a mixture of happiness and sadness, a love that remains once someone is gone. ""Our Little Sister"" is as close to perfect as a film can be."
Groucho Reviews," July 18, 2016",Peter Canavese," Moves at a rhythm akin to the gently lapping waves...yet somehow swiftly establishes the personalities of the three sisters, a contradiction that speaks to the resonance of the performers and Koreeda's skill at eliciting emotional truth."

Wall Street Journal," July 14, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," Our Little Sister often feels Chekhovian, a movie attuned to the passage of time and the changing of seasons. As I watched it, though, I also thought, in a general way, of Thornton Wilder, [whose plays] are suffused with love and kindness."
Punch Drunk Critics," July 14, 2016",Travis Hopson," Koreeda's latest, Our Little Sister, is closer to the fairy tale tone of his nearly-flawless childhood adventure, I Wish, although this exploration of family obligation and loss is less challenging than his prior output."
Washington Post," July 14, 2016",Vanessa H. Larson," While the emotions may be muted, there's still something appealingly heartfelt about the way these siblings find each other. One can't help but cheer them on."
