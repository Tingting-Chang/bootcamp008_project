El antepenúltimo mohicano," February 7, 2017",Alberto Sáez Villarino, This idiosyncratic polysemy is gradually digestible thanks to a well-grounded narrative structure. [Full review in Spanish]
Film Inquiry," February 7, 2017",Jay Ledbetter," The great performance of Natalie Portman, the incredible score by Mica Levi, and the direction of Pablo Larraín make a very relevant reflection on modern celebrity culture."
South China Morning Post," February 6, 2017",Richard James Havis," Politics is given a back seat, and that's what makes Jackie interesting - it unspools as a deep character study of its subject rather than a history lesson."
ABC Radio Brisbane," February 4, 2017",Matthew Toomey," Portman skilfully mimics Jackie's mannerisms but more importantly, you understand her character's complexities."
The National (UAE)," February 1, 2017",Chris Newbould, Jackie is one of the most conflicted films I've had the pleasure of watching. It is good -- but it does take a while to work out exactly what type of film it is supposed to be.
Matt's Movie Reviews," February 1, 2017",Matthew Pejkovic," An incredibly immersive experience that is hard to shake after the credits role, a film that illuminates and moves in its artistry and its spirit."

Ex-Press.com," January 27, 2017",Jay Stone," It feels both random but suddenly relevant today, when the American presidency has become something other than Camelot."

Film Ireland Magazine," January 25, 2017",Niall McArdle, This is Portman's film through and through: she gives one of her best performances (better even than her Oscar-winning turn in Black Swan).
GQ Magazine [UK]," January 25, 2017",Helen O'Hara," It's a time-fractured but close-focused look at the bereaved First Lady, and thanks to Natalie Portman's performance as the fragile, ferocious Jackie, it's one of the strongest dramas of the year."
3AW," January 24, 2017",Jim Schembri," A fine film boasting some notably detailed period recreation...As a historical drama about how a nation looked to a single person for its cue about how to react to the murder of its leader the film does make for a solid, if somewhat repetitive, journey."
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," January 23, 2017",Hilary A White," While brilliant French cinematographer Stephane Fontaine paints the picture, Noah Oppenheim's screenplay makes you wonder why it's taken so long to essay this endlessly fascinating historical figure."
Sunday Times (UK)," January 23, 2017",Camilla Long, Bizarre yet irresistible.
Daily Express (UK)," January 22, 2017",Henry Fitzherbert, Portman is excellent but it's hard not to know why the story is being told.
Observer (UK)," January 22, 2017",Mark Kermode," From the saddening glissando strings of the opening theme, with its falling invocations of death and discord, Levi provides the unifying emotional glue for Larraín's deliberately shattered film."
International Business Times," January 20, 2017",Amy West, A brilliant depiction of shock.
Irish Independent," January 20, 2017",Ed Power," With eyes wide and startled, pale skin drawn tightly over cheekbones, Portman is hypnotic."

The Film Stage," September 7, 2016",Rory O'Connor," A strange, refreshingly cynical, and unexpectedly cerebral account of former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's actions in the immediate aftermath of John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963."
Variety," September 7, 2016",Guy Lodge," Chilean helmer Pablo Larraín makes an extraordinary English-lingo debut with this daring, many-leveled portrait of history's favorite First Lady."
Film Experience," October 13, 2016",Nathaniel Rogers, Rarely has a picture about events 50 plus years in the past felt so immediate and bruising.
AwardsCircuit.com," October 13, 2016",Clayton Davis," A biopic that breaks the barriers and conventions of the genre, Pablo Larrain's ""Jackie"" layers itself as a deeply felt drama masquerading as a new form horror venture. "
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," October 12, 2016",Josef Braun," The film is fascinatingly moribund, more meditation than narrative, a sort of monument to a singular act of public and private mourning."
Uproxx," October 5, 2016",Mike Ryan," Jackie [delivers] a way for Portman to give one of the best performances of her career, maybe her best performance."
Cinema Movil," September 19, 2016",Oscar Uriel," Natalie Portman gives a tour de force with her performance, that will possibly make her win another Oscar. Nevertheless, I believe that the movie suffers from the film festival hype. [Full review in Spanish]"
Flavorwire," September 18, 2016",Jason Bailey," Her elegance, pedigree, and fame made her seem the most remote of figures, but for just over 90 minutes, 'Jackie' seems to exist alongside her. It's an electrifying and unexpected piece of work."
Sight and Sound," September 16, 2016",Tom Charity," While it's certainly of interest, this predictably grim, grainy, gloomy movie only periodically splutters into life."
JoBlo's Movie Emporium," September 16, 2016",Chris Bumbray, Good enough to make Portman this year's best actress Oscar front-runner. 
We Got This Covered," September 16, 2016",Matt Donato," Jackie is Natalie Portman's show, and she never wastes an opportunity to dazzle as JFK's glamorous grieving widow."
PopMatters," September 15, 2016",Stephen Mayne, It's unorthodox but good approach to telling her story.
BBC.com," September 14, 2016",Sam Adams," It's an intellectual experience rather than an emotional one, but the ideas in play are so heady they're enough to sweep you away on their own. "
Time Out," September 14, 2016",Joshua Rothkopf," Eclipsing her work in Black Swan, Portman flutters like a sail in a brisk wind. She is scattered, tense, wrecked and compellingly defiant in the face of those who would have her act a certain way. "

ScreenCrush," September 13, 2016",Erin Whitney," Instead of observing its historical subject from behind a glass case, Jackie offers a piercing portrait of a woman's psychological and emotional journey."
Collider," September 12, 2016",Matt Goldberg," Larraín doesn't see a hero or a victim in Jackie Kennedy but a person, and with the aid of Portman's astonishing performance, we feel like we come to some truths about her even if those truths aren't the pretty picture of Camelot."
The Daily Beast," September 12, 2016",Marlow Stern," There is much to like about Jackie, from the pitch-perfect period detail to Noah Oppenheim's inspired script, but it's Portman's portrait of grief that will linger long after the credits roll."
Hollywood Reporter," September 12, 2016",David Rooney, Extraordinary in its piercing intimacy and lacerating in its sorrow.
Vanity Fair," September 12, 2016",Richard Lawson, It's a character study that projects its subject's inner turmoil onto the whole map of the movie. A final cliché: it's as if we're inside Jackie's head. It's a thrill to have Portman give us a tour.
HeyUGuys," September 7, 2016",Jo-Anne Titmarsh, Jackie is Larrain's first foray into English-language film and his first attempt to tackle non-Chilean political issues. The result is supremely accomplished and fascinating.
Film Journal International," November 30, 2016",Harry Haun, Natalie Portman excels in this uncanny portrait of Jacqueline Kennedy's anguish and dignity following the murder of her husband.
L.A. Weekly," November 30, 2016",April Wolfe," A searing, almost scary thrill ride through the psyche of one very determined woman ... a reminder that JFK's visage owns the half dollar because Jackie owned Americans' hearts."
FromTheBalcony," November 30, 2016",Bill Clark, The opening frames of Jackie lead one to believe they're about to see a horror film. One wouldn't be far off.
Associated Press," November 29, 2016",Jake Coyle," Pablo Larrain's Jackie, a work of probing intimacy and shattered stereotype, is an electrifyingly fractured portrait of the former First Lady."
IGN Movies," November 29, 2016",Alex Welch," Gorgeous and emotional, Jackie is the kind of introspective film about American history that just doesn't come around very often."
Eye for Film," November 29, 2016",Jennie Kermode," All those beautiful artificial vistas remind us that we are strangers here, that all we can do is watch; that the real Jackie, and her celebrated pain, are unknowable."

New York Daily News," November 29, 2016",Stephen Whitty," Portman's been a committed, in-the-moment actress since she was a skinny kid running after ""Leon: The Professional"" but ""Jackie"" is an accomplishment on the Oscar-winning order of ""Black Swan."""

Us Weekly," November 28, 2016",Mara Reinstein," Natalie Portman depicts the former First Lady not as an enigmatic glamour icon, but as a flesh-and-blood woman grieving her husband - as well the end of her fairy-tale Camelot life."
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," November 28, 2016",Dennis Schwartz," A well-conceived intimate portrait of the widow First Lady, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy (Natalie Portman)."
Slant Magazine," November 28, 2016",Christopher Gray, Pablo Larraín's film bluntly hammers home the notion that history is framed by perception rather than reality. 
New Yorker," November 28, 2016",Anthony Lane," I happen to find the result intrusive, presumptuous, and often absurd, but, for anyone who thinks that all formality is a front, and that the only point of a façade is that it should crack, ""Jackie"" delivers a gratifying thrill."
El Fanzine," November 17, 2016",Gonzalo Lira Galván, A film that manages to circumvent the conventions of biopics and common historical films. [Full review in Spanish]

Butaca Ancha," November 10, 2016",Rafael Paz," A biographical film that tries to break the mold and play with the pieces, where Jackie's troubled face is the perfect complement of Larraín's aesthetic. [Full review in Spanish]"
Compuserve," November 3, 2016",Harvey S. Karten," Though the unconventional biopic does not often spring to life, Natalie Portman's awards-worthy performance must be seen."
Punch Drunk Critics," October 22, 2016",Travis Hopson," It is both the Oscar bait drama we thought it would be and yet fuller, richer due to Larrain's direction and Portman's vivid, unforgettable performance. "
Den of Geek," October 16, 2016",Edward Douglas," When it comes to making films that work as much for the sake of artistic expression as for capturing a moment in history, there's little question Jackie might be one of the finest pieces of cinematic storytelling we see this year."
Film Freak Central," October 14, 2016",Bill Chambers, Every scene is kind of perfectly-honed.
NPR," December 1, 2016",Scott Tobias," There's a mesmeric intensity to Jackie that's unlike any biopic of its kind, marked by a deliberate effort to narrow the scope to one woman's actions and reactions over the course of a few fraught days."
Parade Magazine," December 1, 2016",Neil Pond," It's not a conventional biography, or even a historical drama. It's deeper and darker than that, and Portman bores down to the complex, most challenging parts of its core."
Wall Street Journal," December 1, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," The real question is what Jackie as a whole adds up to, and the returns are mixed."
Rolling Stone," December 1, 2016",Peter Travers," A potent cinematic provocation. Powered by a transfixing Portman as Jackie, Larrain's film - one of the year's best - is appropriately hard to pin down and impossible to forget."
Tribune News Service," December 1, 2016",Katie Walsh," Portman is simply magnetic in the role, but it's a performance that works when in concert with all the other elements of the filmmaking... It's entirely of a piece; a perfect film because all of the details are perfect together. "
CNN.com," December 1, 2016",Brian Lowry, Moving but fitfully realized.
TheWrap," December 1, 2016",Claudia Puig," He offers glimmers of what lies beneath the near-mythic, elegant exterior, but Larrain's take is more impressionistic than revelatory, more presumptuous than knowing. "
New York Post," December 1, 2016",Kyle Smith," ""Jackie"" does more than a disservice - bordering on an insult - to its subject: It's so obtuse about the history of mores that it's the equivalent of showing Abraham Lincoln reading the Gettysburg Address off a teleprompter."
The Atlantic," December 1, 2016",David Sims," Jackie is a remarkably composed, artful piece of storytelling about storytelling, as an examination of the gauzy reputation of the Kennedys and the darker myth-making involved."
Slate," December 1, 2016",Dana Stevens," For all its disorienting intensity, emphasized by Mica Levi's keening and discordant score, Jackie operates at a chilly remove from the viewer."
AllMovie," December 1, 2016",Daniel Gelb, Larraín pieces together the fabric of Jackie's character with striking command and unmistakable purpose.
Metro," December 1, 2016",Matt Prigge," Ultimately ""Jackie"" isn't that different from ""Manchester by the Sea."" Both films deal with bottomless torment, but also with the way the death of a loved one brings headaches big and small. "
Consequence of Sound," December 1, 2016",Allison Shoemaker," There are no shortage of stories about the Kennedy assassination, but this may be the first to show us the event through the eyes of the woman in the pink suit and hat. It's beautiful, and ugly, and long overdue."
Entertainment Weekly," December 1, 2016",Leah Greenblatt," Both wildly stylized and feverishly intimate, a surreal collision of private and public selves played out simultaneously in the exclusive back rooms of power and on the world's biggest stage."
New York Magazine/Vulture," December 1, 2016",David Edelstein," Jackie is a hard movie to love, but its brittleness might be its most admirable quality."
Bullz-Eye.com," December 1, 2016",Jack Giroux, Director Pablo Larraín and screenwriter Noah Oppenheim have crafted a dazzling 99-minute drama.
Newsday," December 1, 2016",Rafer Guzman, An ambitious but jumbled drama in which the central figure remains elusive. Portman's performance gets lost in the chaos.
Los Angeles Times," December 1, 2016",Kenneth Turan," Larraín told his producers he wouldn't do ""Jackie"" unless Natalie Portman agreed to take on the role, and her superb performance, utterly convincing without being anything like an impersonation, vindicates his determination."
Cinema Crazed," December 1, 2016",Phil Hall, Natalie Portman falls back on excessive Acting 101 shtick that seems aimed for generating film awards rather than seriously trying to decipher the soul of a beloved figure.
AV Club," December 1, 2016",A.A. Dowd," For Portman, this isn't so much the role of a lifetime as maybe the roles, plural: The notion of multiple Jackies affords her a range of personas ..."
Reeling Reviews," December 2, 2016",Laura Clifford," Stéphane Fontaine...uses rigidly composed frames for the interview which anchors the film while operating more fluidly in flashbacks, a device which mirrors Jackie's carefully composed legend building against real life."
Christian Science Monitor," December 2, 2016",Peter Rainer," [Portman] captures Jackie's mincing, tinkly speaking voice and brittle politesse, but some inner emotional core, even in Jackie's most resonant moments, as in the weeks after the assassination, is lacking."
Reel Reviews," December 2, 2016",Frank Wilkins," It's as beautiful as it is sorrowful, and as reassuring as it is disheartening."
ABC News Radio," December 2, 2016",David Blaustein, It's a stunning historical snapshot and nifty piece of filmmaking.
Thrillist," December 2, 2016",Matt Patches, One of the most barbed and breathless movies of the year ... grief and social pressure haunt [Portman's Jackie] like Freddy Krueger.
Movie Mezzanine," December 2, 2016",Mallory Andrews," Unfortunately, Portman's performance is the kind of boilerplate biopic mimicry that, while certainly attractive to Oscar voters, is the antithesis of the kind of critique she and Larraín are attempting."
People Magazine," December 2, 2016",Tom Gliatto, Every detail shines with significance.
MovieWeb," December 2, 2016",Julian Roman, Natalie Portman is stunning as Jacqueline Kennedy in the aftermath of her husband's assassination. Chilean Director Pablo Larrain crafts a sublimely artistic and intimate portrayal of her struggle. 
FilmDrunk," December 2, 2016",Vincent Mancini," A brilliant exploration of Jackie's role in creating the Kennedy mythos, though it also doesn't really ever question that mythos. "
MTV," December 2, 2016",Amy Nicholson, Pablo Larraín's Jackie is an elegy to two slandered traits: self-consciousness and superficiality. 
RogerEbert.com," December 2, 2016",Matt Zoller Seitz, There are two movies in Jackie. One of these movies is just OK. The other is exceptional. The first one keeps undermining the second.
Reason Online," December 2, 2016",Kurt Loder," The movie devolves into a suffocating examination of its star as she unleashes a tsunami of acting-weeping, simpering, smoking and snapping-much of it captured in relentless, oppressive close-ups. "
Brooklyn Magazine," December 2, 2016",Nicolas Rapold," Jackie is at its strongest not as a making-of-history biopic, but as a perceptive and aphoristic essay on history."
The New Republic," December 2, 2016",Will Leitch," We all know the Kennedy story by heart, but you'll still never look at Jackie the same way again."
Daily Film Fix," December 2, 2016",Jonathan W. Hickman, It's a very rare thing when a movie transcends so perfectly making the viewer feel something of what its tormented protagonist experienced. 
Nerdist," December 2, 2016",Luke Y. Thompson," Jackie is not a feel-good movie; if you have any empathy in you, you'll feel sad at best and terrible at worst. It's meant to upset, and maybe motivate"
Film-Forward.com," December 1, 2016",Kent Turner, Vibrant and melancholic.
New York Times," December 1, 2016",Manohla Dargis," In some roles, Ms. Portman stiffens up and never seems to get out of her head; in ""Jackie"" this works as a character trait."
Aisle Seat," December 1, 2016",Mike McGranaghan, A profoundly haunting and powerful film that examines grief in its most raw form. Natalie Portman is extraordinary. 
Playboy Online," December 1, 2016",Stephen Rebello," Although often gut-wrenching, the movie is supremely compassionate toward its subject. Yet Larrain and Oppenheim pull no punches when it comes to Jackie, who emerges as incredibly complex."
Reverse Shot," December 7, 2016",Nick Pinkerton, Though Larraín sometimes fails entirely to convince on that emotional level... his talent and intelligence have never really been in question. And then there was Jackie.
Doddle," December 7, 2016",Kimberly Gadette," Unlike previous projects, this unique film zeroes in on a particular timeframe, in which the indelible legacies of both Jack and Jackie Kennedy first came to pass."
NOW Toronto," December 7, 2016",Susan G. Cole, It's the feel of the piece that's so unique.
Boston Globe," December 7, 2016",Ty Burr, What is this movie trying to do? Simply dramatize everything that can go on inside a woman simultaneously marginalized and revered.
San Francisco Chronicle," December 7, 2016",Mick LaSalle," What is the tension of the movie? Where is the drama? There's nothing at stake, no transformation to witness, just the weird spectacle of Portman's peculiar Jackie impersonation and the promise, hinted at throughout, that the assassination will be shown."
Deadline Hollywood Daily," December 6, 2016",Pete Hammond, There's no way around it. Natalie Portman is astonishing in a surprising and engrossing look at a Jackie Kennedy we only thought we knew. 
EricDSnider.com," December 6, 2016",Eric D. Snider," Portman's portrayal of Jackie is almost startlingly immersive, and the film is an invaluable glimpse into the mind and heart of a tragic figure."
Q Network Film Desk," December 6, 2016",James Kendrick, takes a topic that could so easily have become a one-dimensional hagiography or a cruelly biting hatchet job and turns it into a powerful study in loss and resolve
Common Sense Media," December 6, 2016",S. Jhoanna Robledo," Intense, complex film about assassination and aftermath. "
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 5, 2016",Tim Brayton," One of 2016's most interesting, adventurous, and just plain best films, the most thorough revivification of the biopic form in a good long while."
Kaplan vs. Kaplan," December 4, 2016",Jeanne Kaplan," The scene of Jackie playing the original song ""Camelot"" while she drinks wine and floats through their White House rooms in a daze is as heartbreaking a sequence as any I've seen. For just these moments, Portman deserves an Oscar nom."
Kaplan vs. Kaplan," December 4, 2016",David Kaplan," Portman's turn in ""Jackie"" may end up to be the defining one of her career, even though she's only thirty-five. The more the film moves along, the more convincing she becomes. "
Salon.com," December 3, 2016",Nico Lang," ""Jackie"" transcends mimicry to achieve something greater - bringing the first lady's grief and resolve in the face of unspeakable loss to vivid life."

SSG Syndicate," December 3, 2016",Susan Granger," Solemn and mesmerizing, propelling Natalie Portman into serious Oscar contention..."
Tolucan Times," December 2, 2016",Tony Medley," Yikes, could they have gotten worse performances out of an outstanding cast? Portman plays Jackie as if she's a moron. Sarsgaard, Hurt, and Crudup are perfectly awful, but Laurence Olivier wouldn't have been any better given the lines they utter."
L.A. Biz," December 2, 2016",Annlee Ellingson," If Portman's portrayal seems studied, that's because the woman herself was, and not since Black Swan has the actress been so in command of such a substantial role."
amNewYork," December 2, 2016",Robert Levin," [Larraín's] film deepens the general understanding of this person at this terrible time, while also keeping her truest and deepest thoughts exactly where they must be - out of our reach."
Laramie Movie Scope," December 2, 2016",Robert Roten," It is well acted and informative, revealing a side of Jackie Kennedy that is relatively unknown."
Vox," December 2, 2016",Alissa Wilkinson," It's a revelation, a steady gaze into the early years in which the American presidency was a site for crafting an image not just for the history books, but for the cameras."
Boston Herald," December 9, 2016",James Verniere," Portman's Jackie is certainly haughty (she cannot hide her disdain for the Johnsons), and she's got that excessively breathy speech pattern down pat."
San Francisco Examiner," December 9, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," Yet another film about the Kennedy family may seem like an eye-rolling prospect, but Pablo Larrain's ""Jackie"" is so painfully alive, so painstakingly intimate, it rises above such simple descriptions."
Screen It!," December 9, 2016",Jim Judy," Powerful and profoundly spectacular. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
Globe and Mail," December 9, 2016",Barry Hertz," To watch Portman's every move is to not only watch history being recreated, but to also witness history being made. No one will ever be able to touch this role again. Or, at least, no one should."
Spliced Personality," December 9, 2016",Sean Burns, A Slaughterhouse-Five adaptation starring the former First Lady. I'm pretty sure most people are going to hate it.
Chicago Sun-Times," December 8, 2016",Richard Roeper, Portman's performance carries the day.
Chicago Reader," December 8, 2016",J. R. Jones," Natalie Portman is flawless as a string of pearls, and Peter Sarsgaard lends valuable support underplaying Robert Kennedy, but the ghoulishness of reenacting the assassination for the millionth time overwhelms the film's pretended merits."
Toronto Sun," December 8, 2016",Jim Slotek," At the core of it all is Natalie Portman's masterful performance of a strong, tightly-reined personality, seen in almost painful, constant close-up."
Mark Reviews Movies," December 8, 2016",Mark Dujsik," The film is wise in the way it sees Jackie as a constructor of narratives, and it's tragic in its recognition that those narratives have little to do with her. "
Toronto Star," December 8, 2016",Peter Howell," What emerges is more serious docudrama: a fully rendered vision of a woman ill-served by most previous accounts, featuring an Oscar-worthy lead performance by Portman. It's also one of the year's best movies."
SF Weekly," December 8, 2016",Jeffrey Edalatpour," Instead of devolving into a Warholian pop artifact, the prescient Jackie offers a raw blast of electoral catharsis."
Movie Nation," December 8, 2016",Roger Moore, An iconic performance packaged in a film good enough to support it. 
Washington Post," December 8, 2016",Ann Hornaday," ""Jackie"" would have been an exceptionally smart, intriguing movie as an astutely conceived, well-crafted meditation on political mythmaking. In Larraín and Portman's hands, it becomes something deeper and more emotionally potent."
Chicago Tribune," December 8, 2016",Michael Phillips," Even if it lacks full dimension, and a final imaginative leap past the biopic strictures, ""Jackie"" pulls you into its web, shot by shot, moment by moment - most of them Portman's."
Arizona Republic," December 8, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," It's not a one-woman show but it's clearly Portman's film, and she makes the most of it, helping Larrain to answer the question: How are myths made?"

CinemaBlend.com," December 8, 2016",Greg Wakeman," While the gorgeous and mesmerizingly subversive biopic itself is destined to be cult rather than classic, Portman's is a performance for the ages, and one that makes Jackie utterly irresistible."
Newcity," December 7, 2016",Ray Pride," Dazed yet undaunted, grief-stricken but determined, genteel yet steely, Jackie is the role Natalie Portman was born to embody, swaddled in a brilliant skin of a score by Mica Levi. "
Paste Magazine," December 7, 2016",Dom Sinacola," If the film is about grief, then the film must act as grief acts. Unmoored and aimless, Jackie acts like a bad dream."
Chicago Daily Herald," December 7, 2016",Dann Gire," Jackie is a triumph of production design, period costuming and vintage cars and props, all captured by Stephane Fontaine's formal camera lens in a mix of sharply defining close-ups and scenes constructed of Kubrickian symmetry."
"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," December 16, 2016",Robert Horton," Portman's scarily composed performance is laser-focused, an act of empathy without tears."

Sacramento News & Review," December 15, 2016",Daniel Barnes," All the perfectly manicured technical elements assembled by Larraín are the reasons to watch Jackie, even as they overwhelm a slight and not particularly revealing story."

Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," December 15, 2016",Cary Darling, Larrain's gorgeously grim and austere vision bolsters a bravura performance from Natalie Portman. She inhabits Jackie as a woman who has been shaken to her core with grief.
Graffiti With Punctuation," December 15, 2016",Blake Howard," Jackie's power is in the sticky quality of the moments of pure cinematic composition. Those images, moments and chords in the score flicker in your memory long after the viewing. "
Seattle Times," December 14, 2016",Moira MacDonald," ""Jackie"" is mesmerizing; a familiar story told from an entirely different angle."
Cambridge Day," December 13, 2016",Tom Meek," It's an impressively bold go at such a revered presidency, and much of the project's success hangs on Natalie Portman's fully immersed and utterly mesmerizing portrait of the grieving first widow."
Huffington Post," December 12, 2016",Derek Malcolm, How do you dramatise history on film without adding a large dollop of fiction to the mix? Many have tried and most have failed. But Pablo Larraín succeeds better than many with Jackie.

Minneapolis Star Tribune," December 22, 2016",Colin Covert," This is a movie about power, and its spectacle is that of a woman almost losing all of it. Larrain portrays all of this with the appropriate degree of horror and sorrow."
Orlando Weekly," December 22, 2016",Thaddeus McCollum," The success of any biopic rests squarely on the shoulders of the actor playing the subject, and Natalie Portman harnesses every bit of the strength and fragility she displayed in her Oscar-winning role in 2010's Black Swan to astounding effect."

Suite101.com," December 20, 2016",Nick Rogers," The best film about any Kennedy since ""JFK."" This is not a safe, comfortable, amber-encased reminiscence people may want. It's a mesmerizing, insidious suggestion of how deep the American political rot may run and for how long it has done so."
CineXpress," December 19, 2016",Fico Cangiano," Jackie breaks new ground inside the biopic genre, thanks to a magnificent direction by Pablo Larráin and Natalie Portman's best performance to date. One of the best films of 2016. [Full review in Spanish]"

ReelViews," December 18, 2016",James Berardinelli, The title character never emerges from the iconic shell she inhabits to become a fully fleshed-out individual and the filmmakers are perhaps too reverential to make her seem real.
AARP Movies for Grownups," December 16, 2016",Bill Newcott, There's an eerie rightness: the bright Dallas sun; the long Washington shadows; the delicate bouclé of that pink Chanel suit; the clarion clip-clop along Pennsylvania Avenue.

Washington City Paper," January 2, 2017",Tricia Olszewski," Yes, the actress nails Jackie's soft, breathy, almost brittle voice. Yes, she moves about with the perfect posture and grace that Kennedy was known for. Yet her Jackie rarely feels lived-in."
MetroActive," January 1, 2017",Richard von Busack, A movie like this stands or falls by its lead performance. Fall it does.
ColeSmithey.com," January 1, 2017",Cole Smithey, [Here is an] ill-conceived movie further hobbled by an inarticulate script ineptly executed by miscast actors - gross political exploitation at its lowest. 
The Virginian-Pilot," December 29, 2016",Mal Vincent, One could excuse the lack of factual detail if the movie had some focused impression to suggest.
It's Just Movies," December 27, 2016",Ron Wilkinson, Viewers who were alive and witnessed it will find it inspiring. Those who were not will find it flat.
