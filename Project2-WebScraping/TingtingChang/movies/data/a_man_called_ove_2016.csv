The Playlist," September 29, 2016",Gary Garrison," It's hard to resist the joy of the film, the unbridled heart, and Ove's tremendous, hilarious hatred for all the idiots of the world."
NPR," September 29, 2016",Ella Taylor," This modest dramedy, deftly directed by Hannes Holm from the best-selling novel by Fredrik Backman, is as sweetly sincere as it is market-driven, with gusts of saving black comedy rolling in to rescue it from excess goo."
Chicago Reader," September 29, 2016",J. R. Jones," Two of the most hackneyed scenes in any movie are the comically interrupted suicide attempt and the lonely soliloquy addressed to a dead spouse's headstone; the title character gets them both, multiple times, in this slow and obvious Swedish drama."
New York Times," September 29, 2016",Glenn Kenny," Good-hearted stuff, to be sure, but mainly of interest to lovers of cinematic comfort food."
Chicago Tribune," September 29, 2016",Michael Phillips," Lassgard isn't the whole show, but he's most of it, and he's rock steady without being predictable, or falling into easy caricature, even when the movie veers that way."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," September 29, 2016",Colin Covert," From its opening suicide jokes onward, this is a bittersweet view of life as gloomy but promising."
Seattle Times," September 29, 2016",John Hartl," ""A Man Called Ove"" has some tear-jerking moments, but the film is so carefully designed - with long, circular takes that seem to surround the main characters at crucial fateful points - that technique often triumphs over sentimentality."
Blu-ray.com," September 29, 2016",Brian Orndorf," It's a strange effort, but often in the best way possible. "
Los Angeles Times," September 28, 2016",Michael Rechtshaffen," Incorporating fluid flashbacks and snippets of narration that refreshingly serve to enhance rather than distract, director-writer Hannes Holm maintains a gentle, lyrical flow while coaxing fine performances from a diverse cast."
Georgia Straight," September 28, 2016",Ken Eisner, A culture-clash comedy that tries too hard to please the back rows
Village Voice," September 28, 2016",Nick Schager, A Man Called Ove - preaching tolerant togetherness as the key to happiness - earns its sentimentality by striking a delicate balance between barking-mad comedy and syrupy melodrama.
Newcity," September 26, 2016",Ray Pride, Ove is a rare spiteful-curmudgeon-meets-new-neighbors fable that finds the measure of spite and sugar. 
Slant Magazine," September 26, 2016",Keith Watson," It's emotionally manipulative, but its two leads find a core of humanity even in the most calculating plot machinations."

Variety," March 9, 2016",Alissa Simon," It's a heartwarming tale about a stubborn, short-tempered man with steadfast beliefs, strict routines and the feeling that everyone around him is an idiot - and no reticence about telling them so."

Boston Herald," October 14, 2016",James Verniere, It's a Wonderful Life to the tenth power.
"Capital Times (Madison, WI)"," October 14, 2016",Rob Thomas," Ove is a human Volvo. You wouldn't think such an ordinary man could carry his own movie, but the Swedish comedy-drama ""A Man Called Ove"" is a delight, balancing flinty Scandinavian wit with dry-your-eyes sentimentality."

The Newnan Times-Herald," October 14, 2016",Jonathan W. Hickman, Heartwarming and darkly funny...

Arizona Republic," October 13, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz, Lassgard manages to keep us from completely hating and giving up on him at the beginning of the film - no small trick - and allows us to care for him without engaging in maudlin sentimentality at the end.
San Francisco Chronicle," October 12, 2016",G. Allen Johnson," Though our put-upon hero's gradual realization that he has much to live for is obvious from the get-go, it still is a pleasant journey from pawn to king - spiritually speaking, of course."
Huffington Post," October 7, 2016",Jackie K. Cooper, A surprisingly warm and wonderful movie. One of the best of the year!
Detroit News," October 7, 2016",Tom Long," ""A Man Called Ove"" starts out gruff and unlikable and more than a bit stereotypical. Then it opens up and becomes something of an epic about ordinary life, touching, funny and engrossing."

Reeling Reviews," October 4, 2016",Laura Clifford," a minor miracle.

Hollywood Reporter," September 30, 2016",Sheri Linden," Holm assumes the audience requires ample evidence of Ove's goodness, and the film loses its footing in backstory melodrama."
NYC Movie Guru," September 29, 2016",Avi Offer," Warm, darkly humorous, bittersweet and tender. Rolf Lassgård is a revelation. "
America Magazine," February 7, 2017",John Anderson," Ove is marvelously entertaining, but it also has an edge of political currency."

"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," November 17, 2016",John Beifuss," Trite in concept and hurt by some cornball contrivances (an investigative journalist functions as the deus ex machina for an utterly unnecessary subplot), the movie nonetheless is hard to resist."
El Nuevo Herald (Miami)," November 14, 2016",Pilar Ayuso," This kind and beautiful film is a delight, and has a very clever script, which harmonizes drama with humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
Austin Chronicle," November 3, 2016",Steve Davis," A Man Called Ove deftly incorporates the seminal moments of its titular character's past in a series of flashbacks that inform, rather than intrude upon, the present."
Las Vegas Weekly," November 3, 2016",Josh Bell, Holm tugs so hard on the audience's heartstrings that they eventually wear out.
NUVO Newsweekly," October 28, 2016",Edward Johnson-Ott," A nice mix of bitter and sweet, with a strong cast."
