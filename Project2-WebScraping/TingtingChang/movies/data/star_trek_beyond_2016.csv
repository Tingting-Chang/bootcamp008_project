ArtsHub," January 8, 2017",Sarah Ward, While the details played out on screen are barely diverting - albeit often visually stunning - the energy they're packaged with helps the film surge more than its lags.

The Mary Sue," December 30, 2016",Carly Lane," Star Trek Beyond definitely delivers on the heart. But the explosions are pretty great, too."
3AW," December 26, 2016",Jim Schembri, Easily the most enjoyable and pacy of the new Star Trek films.
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 5, 2016",Tim Brayton, The appeal of the movie is exactly the appeal of hanging out with the main characters and watching them do their thing.
Movie Talk," November 22, 2016",Jason Best," Much of the fun simply comes from watching the old crew conform to our expectations, giving new spins to old routines. Familiarity breeds content"
Seanax.com," November 1, 2016",Sean Axmaker, ... a warp-speed adventure that makes good use of the youth of the cast while leaning on a chemistry that Abrams' films never fully achieved.

CinemaDope," September 19, 2016",Glenn Lovell," ... a place-holder installment ... Let this be a lesson to JJ Abrams and Paramount: wait until you have new terrain to plow, something to say, before you summon Kirk and gang from dry dock."
Proceso," September 14, 2016",Fausto Ponce, Star Trek returns to its original essence which is great for devoted fans but not so much for the ones that know the franchise thanks to J. J. Abrams' remakes. [Full review in Spanish]
Contactmusic.com," September 13, 2016",Rich Cline, This is where the Star Trek franchise officially shifts from thoughtful drama into thunderous action.
PlusbitsMx," September 13, 2016",Asaf López, A very entertaining movie that you can't miss. [Full review in Spanish]
Screen International," July 15, 2016",John Hazelton," The third instalment of the re-booted Star Trek franchise gets safely through its voyage, offering a strong returning cast and a familiar, if slightly tweaked mix of effects-heavy space action, cheeky humour and philosophical musing."
Variety," July 15, 2016",Owen Gleiberman," ""Star Trek Beyond"" is a somewhat diverting place holder, but one hopes that the next ""Star Trek"" movie will have what it takes to boldly go where no ""Star Trek"" movie has gone before."
Total Film," July 15, 2016",Matt Maytum," Powered by a spirited sense of adventure and a nice teamwork dynamic, it's fun, but not essential, summer viewing."
Empire Magazine," July 15, 2016",Chris Hewitt (UK)," A return to fun, and a return to form for the new version of the old Trek."

Guardian," July 15, 2016",Peter Bradshaw, An entertaining adventure.
Hollywood Reporter," July 15, 2016",David Rooney," The script injects a welcome strain of humor that's true to the original Gene Roddenberry creation, delivering nostalgia without stiff veneration."
Forbes," July 15, 2016",Scott Mendelson," It starts and ends exceptionally well, but it gets bogged down in the middle. "
TheWrap," July 15, 2016",Russ Fischer," This episode cuts right to the core of the series's original appeal, giving the terrific cast a chance to play against one another in a straightforward story. It's not exactly bold, but ""Beyond"" does satisfy."
indieWire," July 15, 2016",Eric Kohn," While ""Star Trek Beyond"" lacks a center, it compensates with an endless parade of distractions. When the movie moves along at a breezy clip, it's partly because it feels so purposeless."
Time Out," July 15, 2016",Tom Huddleston, Not since the original crew stepped down have we felt such a vivid sense of adventure and comradeship.
Arizona Republic," July 18, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," What's most notable about the new film is how closely it hews to Gene Roddenberry's original TV series, at least in spirit."
Access Hollywood," July 18, 2016",Scott A. Mantz," Beyond goes from being a fun action movie to a great Star Trek movie, and one that's the closest of the reboots to capturing the spirit of the original series."
Metro," July 18, 2016",Matt Prigge," The kind of movie the bloated second one should have been: a one-off romp - a super-sized version of an old episode, just with more hot-dogging motorcycle stunts and stuff going boom."
South China Morning Post," July 17, 2016",James Mottram," A hugely enjoyable romp. Alien hordes, Enterprise annihilation, ass-kicking females, emotional goodbyes ... this one has it all."
USA Today," July 17, 2016",Brian Truitt," The galactic adventure might be an uneven one, but the combination of gravitas, a little mirth and old-school Trek themes makes Beyond a decently entertaining trip to the final frontier."
Den of Geek," July 17, 2016",Don Kaye," Star Trek Beyond may not be the perfect Star Trek film, but it is unashamedly, entertainingly and enthusiastically a true one -- and that's more than enough for this Starfleet lifer."
HitFix," July 17, 2016",Drew McWeeny," If you're even remotely interested in a new Star Trek film, this feels like everything you could have asked for. Here's hoping the great adventure continues for another 50 years from here."
Independent (UK)," July 16, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab, Star Trek Beyond should appeal both to older audiences who remember the glory day days of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy and to younger ones looking for a placebo while they wait for the next Star Wars.
IGN Movies," July 15, 2016",Scott Collura," I can think of no better way to celebrate Star Trek's 50th anniversary than with this film, which embraces everything that's great about the series."
HeyUGuys," July 15, 2016",Stefan Pape," A film that preaches the notion of togetherness as a means of triumphing in the face of adversity, is a rather important one to indulge in right about now."
Newsday," July 15, 2016",Rafer Guzman," An enjoyably old-fashioned entry in the new series. Short on back story, long on action, loads of fun."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," July 15, 2016",Tim Robey," It makes very few promises it can't keep, but also goes halfway out on every limb it can find, risking next to nothing, sights permalocked on par."
The Daily Beast," July 15, 2016",Jen Yamato," When Beyond soars, it hits a sweet spot of perfectly balanced stakes, momentum, character development, callbacks, music, and action, blasting at full power in particular in one memorable space-battle set piece that punches in just the right moments."
Entertainment Weekly," July 15, 2016",Chris Nashawaty," Ultimately, Beyond is a movie about characters - and character. But that's half the battle. The other half of the battle is... battle. And Lin, who has such a strong track record with vehicular mayhem, doesn't bring his ""A"" game."
Daily Dead," July 15, 2016",Heather Wixson," It's not hyperbole in the least bit to say that Star Trek Beyond perfectly celebrates 50 years of the franchise, while taking these stories into a bold new future where anything is possible for Captain Kirk and the fearless crew of the USS Enterprise."
JoBlo's Movie Emporium," July 15, 2016",JimmyO, Justin Lin has given fans an impressive sequel.
CinemaBlend.com," July 15, 2016",Eric Eisenberg," While Lin's success with big battles and explosions are hardly a surprise given his background in the Fast & Furious franchise, that in no way undercuts how jaw-dropping and thrilling Star Trek Beyond's biggest set pieces are."
We Live Entertainment," July 15, 2016",Fred Topel," Michael Bay has won. Every movie has now become a music video, even a legendary science fiction franchise."
Digital Spy," July 15, 2016",Hugh Armitage," The drama never swamps the film's humour, and it combines a glossy Hollywood sense of wonder with that classic Star Trek optimism. In the uncertain world we live in, it couldn't feel more timely."
Village Voice," July 15, 2016",Bilge Ebiri," While he may have seemed like a counterintuitive choice to take over a Star Trek movie, Lin is absolutely in his element whenever the film becomes about bodies and vehicles moving swiftly through space - which is often."
Uproxx," July 20, 2016",Mike Ryan, It's just like watching a big budget version of The Original Series.
Globe and Mail," July 20, 2016",Barry Hertz," Star Trek Beyond is much more than a mere refresh. Thanks to Lin's steady directorial hand and knack for visualizing improbable set-pieces, the new film is bold, breathless and propulsive, a distillation of the action movie to its purest elements."
Stuff.co.nz," July 20, 2016",Graeme Tuckett," I hope, I truly do, that Star Trek Beyond marks a return to a real golden age of big-screen cinema, with Star Wars and now Star Trek now both seemingly back on track and delivering exactly what we hope for."
The Age (Australia)," July 20, 2016",Jake Wilson," It would be optimistic to expect the franchise to venture into new conceptual territory at this point. As in the Abrams films, a vague pacifist message is undercut by the frenetic, bloodlessly violent action obligatory in modern Hollywood blockbusters."
Indie London," July 20, 2016",Rob Carnevale," If anything, a little more Enterprise was needed in the creative stakes to make this a more memorable experience. As things stand, it merely does what you'd expect."
New York Times," July 20, 2016",A.O. Scott," Not every wheel needs reinventing, and one of the abiding pleasures of ""Star Trek,"" in its old and newer iterations, lies in its balance of stubborn consistency and canny inventiveness."
The Straits Times (Singapore)," July 20, 2016",John Lui," This third film of the rebooted series is all slick spectacle, created for 3D cinema."
Herald Sun (Australia)," July 20, 2016",Leigh Paatsch," While Star Trek Beyond absolutely delivers as a pure, pulse-raising spectacle, it is also none too shabby as a rollicking adventure yarn."
The National (UAE)," July 20, 2016",Chris Newbould," This is clearly not the greatest film ever made by any means, but it is eminently palatable summer fare. If you are planning a trip to the cinema this weekend, it is the film to see."
Us Weekly," July 20, 2016",Mara Reinstein, It's freewheeling enough to entertain a casual moviegoer - and faithful enough to satisfy a Comic-Con nerd. 
Comic Book Resources," July 19, 2016",Kristy Puchko," Lin, a mastermind of car chases, brings his imaginative sense of spectacle to space, and the result is something truly sensational, and befitting a summer blockbuster."
SciFiNow," July 19, 2016",Poppy-Jay Palmer," It's big and loud, but also has a heart, which is all we could have asked for."
BuzzFeed News," July 19, 2016",Alison Willmore," Star Trek Beyond is a snappy, diverting affair that nevertheless leaves a lingering feeling, like Kirk, that something's missing."
Forbes," July 19, 2016",Simon Thompson," If you wrote a list of what you wanted from a Star Trek film, from action and humor to strong characters (both male and female) and a solid storyline, this delivers and it deserves your dollars."
RTÉ (Ireland)," July 19, 2016",Alan Corr," Following the ponderous and leaden Star Trek Into Darkness, Fast and Furious director Justin Lin puts real zip back into the space-going franchise."
Associated Press," July 19, 2016",Jake Coyle," Star Trek Beyond, like most of the rebooted properties flying around our movie theaters, delights in nostalgically resurrecting iconic characters and tweaking them anew."
Toronto Sun," July 19, 2016",Jim Slotek," Though the action-packed trailers might suggest he simply launched that manic vibe into space, Lin and scriptwriters Simon Pegg and Doug Jung made a clever plot move that gives Beyond the most breathing room for its characters in years."
Chicago Tribune," July 19, 2016",Michael Phillips," Lin's movie works best when approached as a relaxed, somewhat playful two-hour expansion of one of the old '60s episodes."
Urban Cinefile," July 18, 2016",Louise Keller, A grand scale sci-fi adventure with eye-popping visuals
FILMINK (Australia)," July 18, 2016",James Fletcher," ...a bold, entertaining spectacle..."
Trespass," July 21, 2016",Alex Doenau," You could ask for more, but Star Trek Beyond is more than enough to be contented with."
St. Louis Post-Dispatch," July 21, 2016",Calvin Wilson," Lin seems most concerned with keeping things moving, and on that score he succeeds."
sbs.com.au," July 21, 2016",Jessica Ellicott," While there might not be much going on beneath the surface of Star Trek Beyond, it's certainly fun to go along for the ride, whether or not you'll remember it in two weeks' time."
News.com.au," July 21, 2016",Wenlei Ma," In a time... when people are being pitted against one another by virtue of their place of birth or their faith, it's the reminder we need of how the collective can work together for something bigger and better than their own immediate self-interest."
Playboy Online," July 21, 2016",Stephen Rebello," There's nothing new in Star Trek Beyond, the latest installment in the venerable 13-film series, but its least inspired stretches still manage to play like a crowd-pleasing and exceptionally well-acted Star Trek clip show."
St. Paul Pioneer Press," July 21, 2016",Chris Hewitt (St. Paul), There's little sense of a larger purpose or of any movement forward for any of these beloved characters.
New York Magazine/Vulture," July 21, 2016",David Edelstein," Lin knows how to shoot his fights from unexpected angles and with enough spatial-temporal variables to keep us jolt-addicts rocking in our seat, happy to be dizzy."

LarsenOnFilm," July 21, 2016",Josh Larsen," ...has the feel of an obligatory installment, an effort aimed mostly at meeting a summer release date and fulfilling cast contracts."
Financial Times," July 21, 2016",Danny Leigh," Though its sense of peril would barely raise a sweat in a kindergarten, the film has surprising vim for the third part in a franchise inspired by a 50-year-old TV show."
MovieWeb," July 21, 2016",Julian Roman," Star Trek Beyond is basically fast and furious in space. It will entertain the majority, but leave Trekkies nostalgic. Alas, Gene Roddenberry's vision of Star Trek is no more. "
The Standard," July 21, 2016",Matt Neal," When it works, Beyond is great... but predominantly this is so-so Star Trek that feels like a small episode of one of the series, enlarged for the big screen."
San Francisco Chronicle," July 21, 2016",Mick LaSalle," There are bright, busy ""Star Trek"" movies, full of wit and interest, and then there are ""Star Trek"" movies like this one, that are subdued and dark, as if imbued with the monotony of being stuck on a space ship for five long years."
TIME Magazine," July 21, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek, Lin keeps this tense adventure ... from stumbling over its own excess: he knows that any good Star Trek needs wit as well as spectacle.
Daily Star," July 21, 2016",Andy Lea," It's witty, spectacular and expertly paced by action specialist Linn who has managed to recapture the spirit of The Original Series."
Punch Drunk Critics," July 21, 2016",Travis Hopson," The most explosive, intense Star Trek yet, and it's so relentless you don't have time to worry about what's missing."
Little White Lies," July 21, 2016",Anton Bitel," To reinvigorate the franchise's sense of purpose, new recruit Justin Lin takes things back to their roots and core values, while also injects some of the dynamic action that he has honed on multiple Fast and Furious sequels."
Groucho Reviews," July 20, 2016",Peter Canavese," What works (marginally) in this instantly forgettable entry: a few diverting character moments...fan-serving fairy dust...action, action, action."
Movie Nation," July 20, 2016",Roger Moore, Pandering? Yes. But pandering with polish. 
Student Edge," July 20, 2016",Simon Miraudo," Whatever is done to recalibrate the sequel, here's hoping a better balance of humour, meditative contemplation and thrilling, big-screen spills is struck. Still, there are worse crews to be shipwrecked with for two hours."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," July 21, 2016",Colin Covert," ""Star Trek Beyond"" is not a stale rehash ... But it is another case of an aging franchise running short of good individual films, even when it pursues an alternate timeline."
Washington Post," July 21, 2016",Michael O'Sullivan," It may not boldly go where no ""Star Trek"" film has gone before, but it gets there at warp speed, and with a full tank of fresh ideas."
Slate," July 21, 2016",Dana Stevens," Star Trek Beyond may not go where no Trek has gone before, but [its] fidelity to the show's original values that will keep fans trekking to the box office."
TheFilmFile.com," July 21, 2016",Dustin Putman," ""Star Trek Beyond"" works, first and foremost, as a crowd-pleasing science-fiction adventure, but it is equally notable as a thoughtful rumination on embracing one's larger purpose and coming to terms with the temporariness of life."
The Arts Desk," July 21, 2016",Adam Sweeting," This is the third of the rebooted new generation Star Treks, and ultimately leaves you with the feeling that the intrepid crew of the starship Enterprise continue to boldly go, but still haven't quite arrived."
International Business Times," July 21, 2016",Amy West, Beyond injects some much-needed fun into the ongoing series that is sure to make hard-core Trekkies and casual fans desperate to boldly go alongside them as they continue to make more.
Kansas City Star," July 21, 2016",Loey Lockerby," The actors had their roles down by the end of the first film, and it's a pleasure watching them play the familiar crew with just enough of a twist to fit the new timeline."
Legion of Leia," July 21, 2016",Witney Seibold," 'Star Trek Beyond' is not a grand return to form, nor is it a stellar life-affirming entertainment. But it is a modest step in the right direction."

Chicago Sun-Times," July 21, 2016",Richard Roeper, What a load of fun.
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," July 21, 2016",Cary Darling, Feels more like an elaborate TV episode than a cinematic event. But it's a comfortable film...in which the familiar faces don't go anywhere no man has gone before - boldly or otherwise - but they seem to be having a rousing good time anyway. 
Slant Magazine," July 21, 2016",Sam C. Mac," Stark Trek Beyond emphasizes the inter-personal dynamics of the USS Enterprise, and functions best as an extended team-building exercise."
Film Journal International," July 21, 2016",Rebecca Pahle," If it doesn't offer anything particularly groundbreaking, Star Trek Beyond is nonetheless an exciting, well-crafted actioner."
Blu-ray.com," July 21, 2016",Brian Orndorf," Strives to be a traditional adventure to help realign creative chi, while still allowing Lin to play around with widescreen action, giving the 13th ""Trek"" movie some real velocity. "
ScreenCrush," July 21, 2016",Matt Singer, A necessary and welcome course correction; a Star Trek back into the light.
Collider," July 21, 2016",Matt Goldberg, The reason why 'Beyond' works better than the previous two Trek films is because there's an emphasis on exploration and discovery. 'Beyond' feels rooted in the TOS episodes where the crew would find themselves on an alien planet.
The Playlist," July 21, 2016",Rodrigo Perez," Fairly forgettable, but as entertaining summer fare it will more than engage blockbuster-friendly audiences."
What Culture," July 21, 2016",Alex Leadbeater," Pegg has story and narrative structure down, although where he really wins is how he gives Star Trek back that philosophical side."
Flick Filosopher," July 21, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson," Intense action; smart, funny nods to its roots while moving in a new direction; and explicit confrontation of a problem always at the heart of Star Trek ."

Vanity Fair," July 21, 2016",Richard Lawson," Beyond, which sees the previous two Trek films' director, J.J. Abrams, handing the reins to Fast and Furious franchise favorite Justin Lin (don't worry, there are still lens flares), has a plucky, engaging panache."
Common Sense Media," July 21, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," The 13th overall movie in the Star Trek franchise turns out to be good luck for everyone. It's a fresh, satisfying return to the beloved characters of the 1966-1969 TV series and to a rousing sense of teamwork. "
National Post," July 21, 2016",Chris Knight," The critics' Prime Directive demands that I not reveal any of Beyond's surprise plot twists, but they are often so random that I could probably sneak in one or two without even calling attention to them as spoilers."
Times (UK)," July 21, 2016",Kate Muir, It delivers a satisfying and amusing dollop of sci-fi comfort food.
Los Angeles Times," July 21, 2016",Kenneth Turan," The fact that the result is serviceable, delivering enough value to be worth a fan's time, is about as good as one could reasonably expect."
The Sun (UK)," July 21, 2016",Jamie East," A good old-fashioned Star Trek romp through space. Simon Pegg has worked wonders with the script and generously given the best lines to Spock and Bones, whose pairing here is a delight."
Wall Street Journal," July 21, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," ""Star Trek Beyond"" is better than not-bad. By any earthly standard it's good."

The Film Stage," July 21, 2016",Dan Schindel," In the barren desert of summer 2016 blockbusters, this is a lovely oasis."
Philadelphia Inquirer," July 21, 2016",Steven Rea," There is plenty in Star Trek Beyond for diehard Trekkers to enjoy, and director Justin Lin guns the action sequences - even if that motocross machine that Kirk is ostensibly riding looks totally fake and video-game-ish."
CineVue," July 21, 2016",Tom Duggins," It's brightly coloured eye-bait, Jim, exactly as we know it."
"Star-Democrat (Easton, MD)"," July 21, 2016",Greg Maki," After spending two movies getting back on its feet again, ""Star Trek"" has rediscovered its heart."
CNN.com," July 21, 2016",Brian Lowry," Granted, with all the galaxies at its disposal, and yet another TV series in dry dock, one might hope for a Star Trek movie with a bit more narrative heft. But in terms of delivering solid entertainment for its devoted base? Mission accomplished."
Seattle Times," July 21, 2016",Soren Anderson," The pattern for these pictures has been set for decades, and this latest entry in the series breaks little new ground."
Reeling Reviews," July 21, 2016",Laura Clifford," The latest in the rebooted franchise, dedicated to the late Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin (appearing as Chekov for the last time here), is like an oversized episode of the original television series, and that happens to be a good thing."

Fan The Fire," July 22, 2016",Martin Roberts," The crew has been well cast, and although this may not be their most memorable adventure, it's still a cut above your average action blockbuster."
BET.com," July 22, 2016",Clay Cane, Is Beyond better than the previous two versions? Not at all. Is Beyond a solid action film with the franchise's signature wit and social relevance? Absolutely. Is Beyond terribly predictable? Without a doubt. Will anyone care? Nope!
Mark Reviews Movies," July 22, 2016",Mark Dujsik," The nostalgia may be absent, but so, too, are the two most vital elements of the franchise: character and ideas."
Sky Movies," July 22, 2016",Rich Phippen, It's a safe entry into the Star Trek canon. ​But what lies Beyond is going to require a little more depth if the Enterprise is boldly continue.
JoBlo's Movie Emporium," July 22, 2016",Chris Bumbray, A back-to-basics Trek that puts the franchise back on solid ground.

HollywoodInToto.com," July 22, 2016",Christian Toto, Stop all the CGI action pieces! We just wanna watch Spock and Bones bicker.
Screen It!," July 22, 2016",Jim Judy," It's an entertaining diversion featuring characters we like to watch, all of which helps distract one from the pic's various issues. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - Available)"
Brooklyn Magazine," July 22, 2016",Keith Uhlich, To boldly go where no man has gone before is not for a property so culturally and economically exploitable.
MTV," July 22, 2016",Amy Nicholson, Beyond doesn't have the tactile crash-smash thrill of Vin Diesel gunning a Charger. It's more like that dumb gag in Furious 7 when cars skydive from a plane. 
Spliced Personality," July 22, 2016",Sean Burns," Star Trek, in its many permutations and generations, is supposed to be about optimism, inclusiveness and faith in the future. That's something this picture gets right, and it's no small thing. "
Lyles' Movie Files," July 21, 2016",Jeffrey Lyles," Star Trek Beyond takes the series to a louder, hollow and more explosive frontier. Yes, it's still fun, but it comes by it in a cheaper, eager to please fashion."
The Movie Minute," July 21, 2016",Joanna Langfield, Justin Lin's take on the iconic series is not your father's Star Trek. 
New England Movies Weekly," July 21, 2016",Daniel M. Kimmel," Longtime fans will remember that there used to be a rule of thumb about the movies: the ""even ones"" were the good ones. Now it looks like it will be look for the ""odd ones."" "

NOW Toronto," July 21, 2016",Norman Wilner, [It's] a really satisfying adventure that comes closest to recapturing the spirit of the original series - and is perhaps the first film in the rebooted series that truly stands on its own. 
Fresno Bee," July 21, 2016",Rick Bentley," From action to aliens, Star Trek Beyond combines the legacy of the franchise with contemporary visual effects to create a production that should live long and prosper."
One Guy's Opinion," July 21, 2016",Frank Swietek," An enjoyable if unexceptional episode in the ongoing series, more place-holder than game-changer, not the culmination of a trilogy but a solid springboard for further adventures."
ReelViews," July 22, 2016",James Berardinelli," Star Trek Beyond is a Star Trek movie, although not an especially good one."
Tri-City Herald," July 22, 2016",Gary Wolcott," Doesn't boldly go where other Star Treks have gone, but hey, it's Star Trek so what's not to love? Fun film and the second best of the now three reboots. "
Spirituality and Practice," July 22, 2016",Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, Another successful and engaging episode in this long-running sci-fi saga.
Hindustan Times," July 22, 2016",Rohan Naahar," Star Trek Beyond lives up to its title: It goes above and beyond what was expected, and, like its predecessors, turns out to be the best blockbuster of summer 2016."
Christian Science Monitor," July 22, 2016",Peter Rainer, The actors work so well together that they reinforce the series' central appeal: This crew is like family.
The Australian," July 22, 2016",Stephen Romei," This is the sort of reboot I like because it's there for everyone. Star Trek devotees will have their specialised views on its place in the 13-film universe, but average viewers will not feel marooned."
RogerEbert.com," July 22, 2016",Matt Zoller Seitz, The movie never delivers on its considerable promise because it's always in such a hurry to get to the next action scene. 
The Atlantic," July 22, 2016",David Sims," It's exactly the kind of fun, steeped in effervescent goodwill that Hollywood should be delivering right now."
L.A. Biz," July 22, 2016",Annlee Ellingson, [Director Justin Lin's] sweeping vision emblematizes the galactic scope of the setting and the dramatic stakes of the story.
Tulsa World," July 22, 2016",Michael Smith," That combination of action and humor is enough to make ""Star Trek Beyond"" a cosmic summer blast of fun of which -- despite a couple of illogical moves -- the late Anton Yelchin, our new Chekov, and Leonard Nimoy, would have been proud."
Boston Herald," July 22, 2016",James Verniere," Generic plot, meaningless action, overdone CGI, forgettable villain. The camaraderie of the first of the three in short supply. Only Karl Urban scores."
Christianity Today," July 22, 2016",Alissa Wilkinson," In a summer top-heavy with... depressing underachievers, Star Trek Beyond is a breath of fresh air -- not a clever or innovative movie, but one with at least an idea in its head and the dose of optimism we all need right about now."
NY1-TV," July 22, 2016",Neil Rosen," If that's what you're looking for -- basically a shoot 'em up set amongst the stars -- then it's fun and fits the bill. But true Star Trek fans will not really be satisfied, as the higher, thought provoking ideas are missing."
Vox," July 22, 2016",Todd VanDerWerff, It's a surprisingly joyful throwback to everything that makes the Star Trek universe great.
The Verge," July 22, 2016",Tasha Robinson," Until a richer villain and more thought-out story come along, we at least have this chapter, which offers fans of the original Trek world some of the things they've most wanted: space to enjoy all their old heroes, and reasons to respect them again."
Toledo Blade," July 22, 2016",Kirk Baird, Star Trek Beyond is a mea culpa to fans who felt the new film series abandoned the franchise's network TV roots.

Junkee," July 22, 2016",Paul Verhoeven," Beyond is, above all else, fun to watch; it's a proper Star Trek experience. And it feels profoundly good to say that."
The Ooh Tray," July 23, 2016",Ed Whitfield," Safe plays well enough, but didn't Jean-Luc Picard once remind us that the sky's the limit?"
Flavorwire," July 23, 2016",Jason Bailey," 'Star Trek Beyond' is at its best - separating itself from not only an ugly pack of ostensibly enjoyable summer popcorn flicks, but 'Into Darkness' - when it's having fun, and at its worst when bogged down in the generic action/villain stuff."
SSG Syndicate," July 23, 2016",Susan Granger," In this exciting, explosive shoot 'em up, unfortunately, character complexity has become secondary to continual conflict - too much hardware, too little heart."
"Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)"," July 22, 2016",Bob Bloom," Overall, ""Star Trek Beyond"" is an exciting and fun movie; a sturdy feature that is the first step in hopefully a refreshing direction for the vaunted franchise."
National Catholic Register," July 22, 2016",Steven D. Greydanus," This is something that has been missing from Star Trek for a while: an arresting picture of a shiny, hopeful future worth dreaming of. "
Cinemalogue.com," July 22, 2016",Rubin Safaya," Sure, TREK BEYOND is an entertaining ride... But that... is at the center of why the J.J. Abrams-produced reboot runs afoul of the spirit of what STAR TREK was always about: Tackling complex social issues with inventive and diplomatic workarounds."
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," July 22, 2016",Dennis Schwartz, A decent film in the long-standing series.
Chicago Reader," July 22, 2016",J. R. Jones," This third installment in the millennial Star Trek reboot races along without an idea in its head, often recalling the silly, monster-driven final season of the 60s TV show."
ScreenRant," July 22, 2016",Chris Agar, Star Trek Beyond is a highly entertaining summer blockbuster for fans and casual moviegoers that pays respect to the franchise legacy. 
AV Club," July 22, 2016",Ignatiy Vishnevetsky," The movie bounces along, hurtling its heroes over colliding wreckage and into currents of artificial gravity, pausing just long enough for a punchline or a knowing exchange of looks."
EricDSnider.com," July 22, 2016",Eric D. Snider," Though the film glides merrily through its paces, it has no more urgency than a mid-season episode of a Trek TV show."
Cinemaclips.com," July 22, 2016",Roger Tennis, This well-paced outer space adventure is a glowing tribute to the iconic television series.
Las Vegas Weekly," July 22, 2016",Josh Bell," Works best as a rousing adventure story that celebrates the power of capable, dedicated people working together."
AllMovie," July 22, 2016",Violet LeVoit," Siphoning out the fistfights and exploding spaceships from its two-hour running time would leave about 30 minutes of plot, a sign that this story is essentially an overcomplicated TV episode rather than a movie. "
Rolling Stone," July 22, 2016",Peter Travers, Come to 'Star Trek Beyond' for the pow; stay for the emotional wipeout. 
The New Republic," July 22, 2016",Tim Grierson, Lin and his cast's clear affection for the material helps temper the familiarity. The Enterprise's mission was to explore strange new worlds. This movie's is to give us a smooth ride.

GQ Magazine [UK]," July 22, 2016",Helen O'Hara," If you're a fan, you should offer thanks to the prophets of Bajor, because Star Trek is back on form."
Aisle Seat," July 22, 2016",Mike McGranaghan," The issue is that Beyond tries to be a ""hip"" Star Trek story. Star Trek can be many things; hip is not one of them."
Paste Magazine," July 25, 2016",Curt Holman," For a film so focused on acceleration, it's ironic that Star Trek Beyond spends much of its time coasting on charm."
CineXpress," July 25, 2016",Fico Cangiano," Star Trek beyond is light, full thrilling and lots of fun. [Full review in Spanish]"
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," July 25, 2016",Hilary A White," For all its high-velocity fun and the charm of that cast, your gut tells you that Lin's formulaic contribution to Star Trek could be the perfect way to sign-off before the law of diminishing returns really kicks into gear."
Tampa Bay Times," July 25, 2016",Steve Persall," Nothing ingenious about that plot, but Star Trek is always more about characters than the hoops they're jumping through. "
The Sunday Age," July 25, 2016",Craig Mathieson, The new Star Trek movies are trying to pay homage to a philosophy at odds with Hollywood's current obsessions.

Observer (UK)," July 24, 2016",Wendy Ide, The key to the film's success is knowing what to change - the scale of the special effects is worlds away from that of the original - and what to cling to.
The Blu Spot," July 24, 2016",Jeff Beck," It's a disappointment for sure, especially when it comes to the weak storyline, but there are still a few things here to like, including the cast, some of the action, and the humor."
Kaplan vs. Kaplan," July 24, 2016",Jeanne Kaplan, I simply wish director Justin Lin and his crew had done the franchise justice.
Kaplan vs. Kaplan," July 24, 2016",David Kaplan," At the risk of inciting a riot, I found the movie to be a crashing bore. "

Matt's Movie Reviews," July 24, 2016",Matthew Pejkovic," Star Trek Beyond represents a key factor that separates the great genre films from the mediocre, and that is the stakes at play in a battle between good (no matter how flawed) and evil (no matter how created)."
Impulse Gamer," July 24, 2016",Damien Straker, Beyond could have been more interesting and memorable if it wasn't weighed down so heavily by its combat moves.
Cairo360," August 2, 2016",Marija Loncarevic, The story is solid and the execution even more so with Lin taking successfully taking the franchise the exciting new direction that Star Trek into Darkness scratched the surface of.
Under the Radar," August 1, 2016",Austin Trunick," Star Trek Beyond may stick to the series' standard decorum, but by Spock's ears it does it well."
ReviewExpress.com," July 31, 2016",Diana Saenger, Star Trek Beyond' Thrills Former and New Fans
Creative Loafing," July 30, 2016",Matt Brunson," With the same level of heroism and determination exhibited by Enterprise crew members as they overcame Klingons, Romulans and William Shatner's stint in the director's chair, this overcomes a troubled history to emerge as another winner in the franchise."
Phantom Tollbooth," July 29, 2016",Marie Asner, There is never a dull moment.
Austin Chronicle," July 29, 2016",Kimberley Jones, Maybe if Star Trek Beyond were stupider it wouldn't feel like such a chore.

Nerdist," July 28, 2016",Michael Arbeiter," Star Trek Beyond is instead happy to rest on the laurels of simple, sublime familiarity."
Laramie Movie Scope," July 28, 2016",Robert Roten," The first big action sequence seemed very chaotic and poorly lit. The story is also pretty convoluted and not very convincing as far as why the characters behave the way they do, particularly the villains and their minions."
Graffiti With Punctuation," July 27, 2016",Blake Howard," Beyond is totally engrossing. Travelling along at warp speed, and thanks to writers Simon Pegg and Doug Jung, Beyond is the funniest, and most poignant entry into the rebooted timeline."
MovieCrypt.com," July 27, 2016",Kevin A. Ranson," ... the crew dynamic glosses over plenty of story shortcomings... if you enjoyed the first Abrams Star Trek and felt the sequel came up short, this is the best of the three... "
"Metro Weekly (Washington, DC)"," July 27, 2016",Randy Shulman," By constantly reminding us of previous Treks, the new Star Trek can never fully claim triumph of its own accord. It's a mimicry of the original, lost in its own nebula."
Cinemixtape," July 27, 2016",J. Olson, Roughly as adventurous as a stop at a theme park information center.
Ex-Press.com," July 27, 2016",Katherine Monk," Beyond questions nothing, which is another big reason why it's such a colossal disappointment as it cruises through one franchise trope after another without a good reason to leave space port in the first place."
PopMatters," July 27, 2016",Bill Gibron," Star Trek Beyond successfully straddles the fine line between Star Wars' high tech toy merchandising and the serious ideas fostered by concept creator, Gene Roddenberry. It's also a stone cold blast. "
Reel Film Reviews," July 27, 2016",David Nusair," Though riddled with problems, Star Trek Beyond nevertheless stands as a very mild improvement over its immediate predecessor, 2013's Star Trek Into Darkness..."
Q Network Film Desk," July 26, 2016",James Kendrick," a more modest film than its immediate predecessors, with ambitions that don't go much farther than using familiar characters and situations to show the audience a rollicking good time"
Salon.com," July 26, 2016",Nico Lang," ""Beyond"" is undoubtedly messy, like a Starfleet ship that's taken its fair share of beatings, but it is frequently a reminder of how good the series can be when all its engines are in working order."
John Hanlon Reviews," July 26, 2016",John Hanlon, A traditional but energetic ride.
Cine Vértigo," September 13, 2016",Ernesto Diezmartinez, Not as good as the previous films but manages to succeed because of its cast chemistry. [Full review in Spanish]

Butaca Ancha," September 6, 2016",Carlos Del Río, Star Trek Beyond is an entertaining manifestation of a very special affection for the original TV series. [Full review in Spanish]
ABC Radio Brisbane," August 27, 2016",Matthew Toomey, The crew spout a bunch of scientific words and come up with solutions that feel too easy. There's not much in the way of character progression either.
Independent Online (South Africa)," August 26, 2016",Theresa Smith," The script is funny, the film is tauter, but less uptight, than Into Darkness and it charms you along in old-school Star Trek fashion with its emphasis on teamwork."
Mark Leeper's Reviews," August 23, 2016",Mark R. Leeper," We are given a lot of action, as we might expect with Lin, but the story has is an old MacGuffin plot, search for a super-special thingamajig. "

Sensacine," August 12, 2016",Xavi Sánchez Pons, It breaks the mold created by the first two films in a good way. [Full review in Spanish]
National Review," August 11, 2016",Armond White," Star Trek Beyond trivializes social issues like militarism and race by downplaying moral seriousness, and replacing it with ""action"" and genre familiarity. It's cinema as comfort food."
"Quad City Times (Davenport, IA)"," August 10, 2016",Linda Cook, 'Star Trek Beyond' is an outer-space thrill ride.
ColeSmithey.com," August 9, 2016",Cole Smithey," Like a jigsaw puzzle where the pieces don't fit, ""Star Trek Beyond"" jumps between giant action set pieces lacking in context, nuance, and expositional background. The narrative is a sloppy mess."
Reno News and Review," August 6, 2016",Bob Grimm," It's an okay enough Star Trek movie, but nothing to get too excited about. "
Film School Rejects," August 4, 2016",Neil Miller," A combination of smarts and sparks make Beyond a brisk, exciting ride with a classically Star Trek positivity."
"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," August 3, 2016",John Beifuss," The summer's most contra-Trumpian blockbuster, as the stalwarts of the starship Enterprise again demonstrate that teamwork beats ego-driven strongman aggression."
Killer Movie Reviews," August 2, 2016",Andrea Chase," nifty and imaginative CGI, clever twists and turns, plus what science fiction can do so well, comment on the present from another perspective, not to mention taking stock of what it means to live an authentic life "
