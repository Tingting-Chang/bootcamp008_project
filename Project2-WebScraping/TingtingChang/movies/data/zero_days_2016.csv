Flick Filosopher," January 12, 2017",MaryAnn Johanson, Fascinating and horrifying. A gripping detective story and an impassioned call for public debate over terrifying weapons that have already been loosed.
Georgia Straight," January 11, 2017",Ken Eisner, The two-hour movie makes it disturbingly clear that our dependence on wired communication and integrated controls has left the whole planet vulnerable to countless manipulations.
Observer (UK)," January 8, 2017",Wendy Ide, Be very afraid.
CineVue," January 8, 2017",Matthew Anderson, A chilling expose of state-sponsored cyber warfare and the enemy within.
The Arts Desk," January 6, 2017",David Kettle," It's a dense, demanding film, but Gibney's Zero Days is an urgent warning, and an exceptional investigative documentary."
Times (UK)," January 5, 2017",Kate Muir," This documentary might be better titled Day Zero, because it features a doomsday scenario in which cyberwarfare shuts down the electricity grids and other networks of entire countries, using computer malware."
Independent (UK)," January 4, 2017",Geoffrey Macnab, Gibney plays up the thriller elements of his story.
East Bay Express," January 1, 2017",Kelly Vance," It's open-ended, challenging, and may keep you awake at night. What better recommendation for outrage junkies?"
Financial Times," December 29, 2016",Nigel Andrews," Gibney's new cyber-war documentary brilliantly unpacks the story behind the Stuxnet virus, created by the CIA and US government to sabotage the Iran nuclear programme."
The Sunday Age," December 9, 2016",Craig Mathieson," [Gibney's] reveal is that one nation altered the [Stuxnet] code, which revealed it to other countries, which are now growing their unchecked cyber warfare capabilities."
Laramie Movie Scope," December 2, 2016",Robert Roten, Cyber warfare policy is clearly a very complex issue. Director Alex Gibney makes a convincing argument that it is time for this to be brought out into the open so it can be fully examined and discussed.
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," November 20, 2016",Dennis Schwartz, Provocative and unsettling documentary thriller on cyberwar.
The Nation," October 24, 2016",Margaret Spillane, The visual intelligence at work everywhere in Zero Days allows a picture necessarily built on talking heads and streams of code to be surprisingly beautiful.
FILMINK (Australia)," October 13, 2016",Travis Johnson, ...laying bare a hidden technological arms race...
Cinemalogue.com," July 30, 2016",Todd Jorgenson," ... becomes too dense with its historical context and geeky code talk, yet with regard to broader issues, the even-handed approach makes the impact more provocative."
Medium," July 27, 2016",Chris Barsanti, ...a prescient warning for the new world of conflict we are blundering into without so much as a flashlight. 
Spirituality and Practice," July 22, 2016",Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, An incredibly important documentary tracing the opening salvos of cyberwarfare which have been shrouded in secrecy.
Austin Chronicle," July 21, 2016",Marc Savlov," Unnerving and likely to give viewers some bitter food for thought, Zero Days is Gibney's most important work yet."
The Daily Beast," July 15, 2016",Nick Schager," Zero Days makes clear that we're already enmeshed in this terrifying new cyber-reality. And unfortunately for us all, we'll need more than John McClane to help avert forthcoming global disaster."
Salt Lake Tribune," July 15, 2016",Sean P. Means," StuxNet may have worked to slow down Iran's nuclear ambitions, but it also opened up a Pandora's Box of issues about how cyberwarfare is conducted, issues that can't be debated because of the terrifying secrecy around them."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," February 18, 2016",Tim Robey," As with We Steal Secrets, his 2013 Edward Snowden doc, the secrecy of this topic gives Gibney a cool, throbbing, spy-thriller aesthetic to paint with, and he trots through everything he can tell us with typical, value-for-money intelligence."
Guardian," February 17, 2016",Peter Bradshaw," Zero Days is an intriguing, disturbing watch."
Hollywood Reporter," February 17, 2016",Boyd van Hoeij," Because it wants to be a primer on a serious subject, an exciting cinematic expos√© and an argument for more openness and some kind of regulatory framework, the necessities of these different strands end up getting in each other's way."
Screen International," February 17, 2016",Jonathan Romney, A must-see for anyone interested in how cybertech is changing politics; even if a more cool-headed analysis would be welcome in this informationally cluttered film.
Variety," February 17, 2016",Peter Debruge," While most people weren't looking, America went and changed the rules of engagement, and with ""Zero Days,"" Gibney urgently suggests how little time the world has to clarify its stand before the wrong party goes too far."
Blu-ray.com," July 7, 2016",Brian Orndorf," As critical as the message is in ""Zero Days,"" Gibney is just going through the motions here, with this feature adhering closely to his formula, becoming more of a lecture than a warning siren."
Wall Street Journal," July 7, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," You'll want to see ""Zero Days""-just not when you're counting on a good night's sleep a few hours later."
Los Angeles Times," July 7, 2016",Justin Chang," The future is now, Gibney's documentary persuasively argues, and what it holds for all of us is as scary to contemplate as it may be impossible to ward off."
Entertainment Weekly," July 7, 2016",Joey Nolfi," An ideal movie for Internet conspiracy theorists displeased with the powers that be, though Gibney deserves credit for doing more than just fanning the flames of paranoia."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," July 7, 2016",Colin Covert," Still worried about old-school nuclear weapons? Enter the 21st century, and prepare for some brand-new nightmares."

Seattle Times," July 7, 2016",Soren Anderson, It's a detective story. It's a spy thriller. It's a cautionary tale. And it's true.
Boston Globe," July 7, 2016",Mark Feeney," This is a world very few of us have familiarity with, which makes it all the more fascinating to learn about."
San Francisco Chronicle," July 7, 2016",Mick LaSalle, The film is a two-hour investment and the rewards are a handful of facts and ideas that could have been expressed in half that time. But those who want more detail will find it here.
SF Weekly," July 6, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," Zero Days doesn't offer any answers, or even hope -- how could it? -- but at least it shines a light on a major, and majorly terrifying, issue."
AV Club," July 6, 2016",Mike D'Angelo," Gibney compiles an extensive montage of apologetic non-answers to his questions; after a while, it starts to seem a shame that another recent film already claimed Stonewall as a title."
PopMatters," June 30, 2016",Cynthia Fuchs," [Gibney] takes up the strategies he's used so skillfully in Taxi to the Dark Side... These back-and-forths are fun and energetic, the stories they reveal at once transfixing, preposterous, and melodramatic."
Christianity Today," March 30, 2016",Alissa Wilkinson, Terrifying and essential ...
BBC.com," February 23, 2016",Nicholas Barber," It is still chilling to hear that computer viruses can now cause ""real-world physical damage"" on a scale that experts would have laughed off as 'Hollywood-esque' just a decade ago."
London Evening Standard," February 21, 2016",David Sexton," When you see a documentary as significant and as forcefully made as this, you wonder what you are doing watching any but the best dramas."
The Playlist," February 21, 2016",Jessica Kiang," ""Zero Days"" may be an investigation of the 2010 malware worm known as Stuxnet, but it does a much broader and more important job: relating the airless, abstract concepts of cyber-terrorism and internet espionage to their real-world consequences."
The Film Stage," February 19, 2016",Giovanni Marchini Camia," [Gibney] handles this expansive, technically complex, and ethically abstract subject matter with remarkable cogency."
HeyUGuys," February 19, 2016",Stefan Pape," Another fine offering from this prolific filmmaker, who hasn't shown any signs of slowing down. We certainly aren't complaining."
Willamette Week," July 13, 2016",Chance Solem-Pfeifer," For many viewers, this will be crucial viewing from the technological and military frontier."
Film Experience," July 12, 2016",Glenn Dunks," While it lacks the pop fancies that made Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief such a success, Zero Days is Gibney's best documentary in years."
Film Comment Magazine," July 12, 2016",Michael Sragow," Gibney is surely right in calling for open and informed debate about cyber warfare, but his own movie lacks transparency and persuasiveness. What a terrible moment for this director to go unclear."
EntertainmentTell," July 11, 2016",Stephen Silver," Very illuminating, and has most of the strengths and weaknesses present throughout Gibney's work (Splice Today) "
Nonfics," July 11, 2016",Christopher Campbell," Alex Gibney's most thrilling, chilling and fulfilling film in years."
The Patriot Ledger," July 9, 2016",Al Alexander, Flawlessly spins what could have been a tech-talk heavy bore into an enthralling espionage thriller

TheWrap," July 8, 2016",Sam Adams," Gibney's movies are professional and solidly executed, informative if you go in underinformed but rarely surprising or aesthetically noteworthy."
Rolling Stone," July 8, 2016",David Fear, Zero Days is ... under attack from little stylistic worms that threaten to turn an otherwise solid doc on the evil that 21st-century hackers do into a hack job.
Boston Herald," July 8, 2016",James Verniere," Another piece of investigative-journalism cinema from Alex Gibney. Talky and too long, but also terrifying and gripping."
Village Voice," July 8, 2016",Chuck Wilson," Since no terrorist group or nation state has ever claimed credit for Stuxnet, Gibney can only hypothesize about its origins, but he makes an alarmingly lucid (if circumstantial) case for the culpability of the United States and Israel."
San Diego Reader," July 8, 2016",Matthew Lickona," Don't be distracted by the ominous score, the layered displays of code, the juxtaposition of bursting balloon and mushrooming cloud; that's just (alarm) bells and whistles. "
Christian Science Monitor," July 8, 2016",Peter Rainer," By necessity, far more questions than answers are raised in Zero Days. All of the questions and answers are troubling."
RogerEbert.com," July 8, 2016",Godfrey Cheshire," Easily the most important film anyone has released this year, it is a documentary that deserves to be seen by every sentient citizen of this country - and indeed the world."
Reason Online," July 8, 2016",Kurt Loder," A techno-horror story of the sort the late Michael Crichton might have come up with -- but here the horror is real, not speculative, and it's still out there, lurking."
San Diego Union-Tribune," July 8, 2016",Anders Wright," Though Stuxnet was introduced to the world in 2010, in many ways ""Zero Days"" could not be more timely ..."
Beliefnet," July 7, 2016",Nell Minow, The most terrifying movie you will see this year.
Slant Magazine," July 7, 2016",Steven Wright," Director Alex Gibney does this vital material a disservice, giving it an air of deflated pomposity. "
New York Times," July 7, 2016",Stephen Holden," In documentary filmmaking, as in news writing, there is a fine line between irresponsible alarmism and dispassionate reportage. And Mr. Gibney has a proven record of tiptoeing to the edge without going too far."
New York Post," July 7, 2016",Kyle Smith, Gibney delivers plenty to think about - and fear.
