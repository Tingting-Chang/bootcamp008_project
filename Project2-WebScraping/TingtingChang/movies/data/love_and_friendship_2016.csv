Sunday Times (UK)," December 19, 2016",Camilla Long," Halfway through Love & Friendship... I felt a stab of terrible rage. How had this wonderful book not been adapted before, and why has the hilarious Kate Beckinsale been kept from (intelligent) audiences for so long?"

Tampa Bay Times," November 29, 2016",Jimmy Geurts," The best performance comes from relative unknown Tom Bennett, who makes a fine addition to the all-time great cinematic lunkheads as Sir James Martin, the suitor of Lady Susan's daughter."
Blog de cine," November 23, 2016",Alberto Abuín," A film that gains interest because of Tom Bennett's presence, the perfect character for a story full of gossip, appearances and hidden interests. [Full review in Spanish]"
Seanax.com," November 18, 2016",Sean Axmaker," Susan provides the cutting wit, Sir James the broad comedy and giggling silliness, and filmmaker Stillman the social frame and elegant world to make it all work."
Sensacine," November 17, 2016",Quim Casas," A film where the gestures, the words and what they hide in a subtle way are perfectly interchangeable with the media world of our time. [Full review in Spanish]"
Cinemanía (Spain)," November 15, 2016",Andrea G. Bermejo, A clever film with a great cast that includes revelations like Xavier Samuel and Tom Bennett. [Full review in Spanish]
Cinema Signals," November 5, 2016",Jules Brenner," The trick for Beckinsale was to make it stylish and comedic enough to maintain audience sympathy for such an inscrutable demon, which is actually a bit of an acting tightrope to walk."

Clarín," September 26, 2016",Horacio Bilbao, This adaptation of Jane Austen's novel is a brilliant film about female manipulation. [Full review in Spanish]
Creative Loafing," September 17, 2016",Matt Brunson, More of a piece with Stillman's other films than with such Austen adaptations as Sense and Sensibility and Emma.
Christianity Today," January 29, 2016",Alissa Wilkinson," It's pure fun, suitable for most everyone -- and a worthy addition to the Austen canon."

New Statesman," January 28, 2016",Ryan Gilbey," In the case of Love & Friendship, the match between adaptor and adaptee is exquisite and advantageous to both."
BBC.com," January 28, 2016",Owen Gleiberman," Jane Austen, who used dialogue as a veil that reveals and conceals, and writer-director Whit Stillman, with his love for the elegant pensée, are such an obvious match that you wonder why it took them this long to get together."
The Young Folks," January 28, 2016",Josh Cabrita," ...Whit Stillman's adaptation of Jane Austen's Lady Susan is a surprisingly hilarious period piece that centers on Austen's titular character, played perfectly by a deliciously nefarious Kate Beckinsale"
Daily Telegraph (UK)," January 28, 2016",Tim Robey, Perhaps only by reading the book after you've seen this is the skill of Stillman's treatment to be fully grasped - it's one of the deftest feats of literary interpolation in ages.
TheWrap," January 25, 2016",Alonso Duralde, Stillman's fleet and funny adaptation makes it a pleasure to follow these entanglements (and to understand the strict social rules regulating everyone's behavior).
CraveOnline," January 24, 2016",William Bibbiani," A lovely and intricate web with a seductive spider at the center, played deftly by Kate Beckinsale."
New York Post," January 24, 2016",Kyle Smith," ""Love & Friendship"" is a most particular pleasure."

The Playlist," January 24, 2016",Noel Murray," Sharp insight, coupled with the amusing way that the heroine phrases her quips, make ""Love & Friendship"" pleasurable to watch even when it all starts to feel like too much about too little. "
Hollywood Reporter," January 24, 2016",Todd McCarthy," Although it's difficult even by the end to entirely sort out who's related to whom and how, the actors acquit themselves nicely, and it's always good to have Stephen Fry around in this sort of tony affair ..."
Variety," January 24, 2016",Justin Chang," A supremely elegant and delicately filigreed adaptation of Jane Austen's epistolary novella ""Lady Susan."""
Little White Lies," January 24, 2016",David Jenkins, With his ebullient and scaldingly droll latest - a superlative screwball adaptation of Jane Austen's novella 'Lady Susan' - Stillman may have finally located an ensemble of characters who exist in their own time.
Den of Geek," May 11, 2016",David Crow, Stillman and Beckinsale's collaboration has gifted the actress with what might be a career best performance; it's definitely an endlessly entertaining one.
Brooklyn Magazine," May 11, 2016",Justin Stewart," Stillman's rounded-out and embroidered telling is the kind of movie people call ""delicious,"" ""sparkling,"" and ""a comic romp,"" and it is indeed all of those."

Village Voice," May 10, 2016",Alan Scherstuhl," With the plotting and the epigrams taken care of, Stillman seems liberated as a craftsman: Never before has one of his films been so crisp, so tart, so laugh-out-loud funny."
JoBlo's Movie Emporium," May 10, 2016",Chris Bumbray, Maybe the best big-screen Jane Austen adaptation ever!
Slant Magazine," May 10, 2016",Jake Cole," No Austen adaptation, even the most revisionist ones, has ever felt as vicious as Whit Stillman's Love & Friendship."
New York Magazine/Vulture," May 9, 2016",David Edelstein," The delight of its director, Whit Stillman, enlivens every scene, so what might have seemed stilted is full of human faces in exquisitely subtle states of panic. Heretical as it sounds, Stillman has improved on his source."
We Got This Covered," May 9, 2016",Matt Donato," The charmingly manipulative Love & Friendship shouldn't be as periodically enchanting as it is, but dammit if Kate Beckinsale doesn't hypnotize us from scene one."
Compuserve," May 7, 2016",Harvey S. Karten, Not among the best of Jane Austen's novels is given a decent adaptation.
Film Comment Magazine," May 3, 2016",Emma Myers," Streaked with the director's decidedly modern strain of cynicism, Love & Friendship might very well be the most faithful translation of Austen's biting humor and highly practical feminism to date."
Flavorwire," April 27, 2016",Jason Bailey, Above all (and surely to the relief of those prone to resist costume drama) it's just a very playful picture.
"Capital Times (Madison, WI)"," April 27, 2016",Rob Thomas," The stuffiness of the environment, with the beautiful mansions and elegant gowns, seems to have prodded Stillman to be even more playful than usual here."

The Skinny," February 26, 2016",Josh Slater-Williams, One of the funniest comedies of manners since the heyday of Ernst Lubitsch.
Collider," February 23, 2016",Matt Goldberg," Whit Stillman relishes societal pomposity and self-obsessed characters, and his latest film, Love & Friendship, shows that he's adept at skewering ridiculous relationships and selfish people no matter what setting. "
The Film Stage," February 19, 2016",Dan Schindel, [Stillman's] dry sense and cutting sensibility are suited to the meaner edge this story has in comparison with the rest of Austen's oeuvre.

Epoch Times," May 13, 2016",Joe Bendel," It might be Stillman's first period piece (a quite a lovely production it is), but the droll humor and keen eye for social dynamics can be traced throughout his work."
Reeling Reviews," May 13, 2016",Laura Clifford," ...it features an unsympathetic heroine who, while not getting what she wants, achieves something that is perhaps even better. This is not your usual Austen adaptation, Stillman instilling it with an American forthrightness."
Tribune News Service," May 13, 2016",Katie Walsh, Immensely charming and laugh-out-loud funny.
Under the Radar," May 13, 2016",John McShane, Stillman has made what may be the broadest and most accessible comedy of his career.
RogerEbert.com," May 13, 2016",Matt Zoller Seitz, Austen-isms walk shoulder to shoulder with Stillman-isms so gracefully that it takes a moment to realize which author is likely speaking through these characters.
Beliefnet," May 12, 2016",Nell Minow," Who better to adapt Jane Austen's epistolary novel, Lady Susan, for the screen than our finest contemporary observer of life among the ""haute bourgeoisie,"" Whit Stillman? "
Associated Press," May 12, 2016",Sandy Cohen," The wit comes so quickly, the film demands a second viewing. The heartlessness of the central character, though, makes that option unappealing."
Los Angeles Times," May 12, 2016",Glenn Whipp," ""Love & Friendship"" more than delivers on the comedy of manners front, but it's also a very funny, unapologetic portrait of a diabolically clever woman ..."
New York Times," May 12, 2016",A.O. Scott," It's the Whit Stillman movie that some of us have been waiting a long time for, and also a Jane Austen movie that goes some way toward correcting the record of dull and dutiful cinematic Janeism."
Reverse Shot," May 12, 2016",Nick Pinkerton, One of the most ingenious movies of recent memory and also the funniest.
The Weekend Warrior," May 12, 2016",Edward Douglas, Beckinsale is fantastic and probably has the funniest and snarkiest lines in the movie. It's better than Stillman's last few movies. 
New York Post," May 12, 2016",Farran Smith Nehme," The sharpest, least sentimental and possibly the best version of Austen yet."
Rolling Stone," May 12, 2016",Peter Travers," The language, a lyrical blend of Jane Austen and Whit Stillman, bewitches even as it stings. A sublime Kate Beckinsale digs into the role of her career. Pure pleasure. "

Paste Magazine," May 12, 2016",Kenji Fujishima, As necessarily discomfiting as it is gleefully droll.
ReviewExpress.com," May 21, 2016",Diana Saenger, Superb Enjoyment 
The Patriot Ledger," May 21, 2016",Al Alexander, Its multitude of pleasures rest in dialogue rich in wit and mellifluous in structure. 
Chicago Sun-Times," May 20, 2016",Richard Roeper," Love & Friendship has the air of one of those movies where you sense the actors had the time of their lives on the set, what with getting to wear the garb of the time and reciting such sublime dialogue and performing such exquisitely choreographed scenes."
AARP Movies for Grownups," May 20, 2016",Bill Newcott," Splendid from start to finish. Miss Beckinsale emits a clear sense that her character is not only fully in control of Plan A, but concurrently beetling away at Plan B and, we suspect, subsequent plans up to and including Zed."
Boston Herald," May 20, 2016",James Verniere," Best ever Kate Beckinsale, could have been naughtier"
San Diego Union-Tribune," May 20, 2016",Anders Wright," It's a movie that is not just an achievement in its own right, but the sort that makes one reconsider all of Stillman's previous films."
One Guy's Opinion," May 19, 2016",Frank Swietek," Winningly, and wittily, brought to the screen by writer-director Whit Stillman and a superbly chosen cast...rarely has the fit between author and adapter felt so marvelously right."
People Magazine," May 19, 2016",Alynda Wheat," If Love & Friendship seems more cutting than Austen's usual fare, thank director Whit Stillman."
Boston Globe," May 19, 2016",Ty Burr," ""Love & Friendship"" is a film to make an action fan tear his or her hair out; it's all walking and talking. But what talking!"
Chicago Reader," May 19, 2016",J. R. Jones," Intelligent, nuanced, literate, and dismally dry; there's little of the juice that Stillman brought to his earlier films as a chronicler of his own times."
Washington Post," May 19, 2016",Ann Hornaday," As adaptations go, this is a match made in heaven."
Philadelphia Inquirer," May 19, 2016",Steven Rea," Love & Friendship is a comedy of manners, and manors, and more. It's a comedy of empowerment and sexual politics, dressed up in the best Austen finery."
Arizona Republic," May 19, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz, It's the cinematic version of inventing a chocolate bar that makes you lose weight - something really tasty that's actually good for you.
Chicago Tribune," May 19, 2016",Michael Phillips," It's securely in its proper time and place, but this is an unusual side of Austen, cooler and more nakedly cunning. It feels very modern indeed."
San Francisco Chronicle," May 19, 2016",Mick LaSalle," What a lovely meeting, a novelist who was ahead of her time and a filmmaker determinedly, irretrievably outside his own. It's like two very different people meeting on a blind date, and suddenly sparks are flying."
San Jose Mercury News," May 17, 2016",Karen D'Souza," An intelligent actress too often wasted in butt-numbing action movies, Beckinsale is endlessly captivating as a formidable woman low on funds but high on manipulative genius."
Newcity," May 17, 2016",Ray Pride," An onrushing delight, captured in bright and creamy light... a vessel for Kate Beckinsale's liquid lashings of the tongue, but Lady Susan is of no time, and of this time, and the most modern of characters, as in [Stillman's] earlier near-period pieces."
Truthdig," May 16, 2016",Carrie Rickey," Like Austen, Stillman delights in the considerable distance between what people believe and how they behave."
New Yorker," May 16, 2016",Anthony Lane," For the most part ... ""Love & Friendship"" is a frolic: crisp and closeted rather than expansive, with curt exchanges in drawing rooms, carriages, and gardens."
L.A. Biz," May 13, 2016",Annlee Ellingson," The costumes are gorgeous, fitted constructions in bold colors and beautiful patterns, the formidable uniform of a fierce, independent woman taking control of her own destiny."
Toronto Sun," May 26, 2016",Liz Braun," Love & Friendship is quick, clever and delightful, very funny and hugely entertaining."
Tulsa World," May 26, 2016",Michael Smith," Love & Friendship is Jane Austen's world at its most devilishly delightful, with Kate Beckinsale giving the performance of her career as a woman who is a schemer, a fortune-hunter, a silver-tongued devil."
The Spectator," May 26, 2016",Deborah Ross," Even though this is a walking and talking film, except in those instances when it's a sitting and talking film, Stillman keeps everything moving fast, fast, fast while the script crackles and spits and bites."
St. Louis Post-Dispatch," May 26, 2016",Calvin Wilson, A delightful comic romp that fans of the classic English author will love.
Minneapolis Star Tribune," May 26, 2016",Colin Covert," Following many staid and treacly Austen adaptations, this sublime period romp adds a thrilling splash of bemused, acidic humor."
Seattle Times," May 26, 2016",Moira MacDonald, It's self-consciously mannered and merrily playful; a mixture that Austen herself might find just right.
Guardian," May 26, 2016",Peter Bradshaw, Love & Friendship is a refreshing and invigorating delight.
Austin Chronicle," May 26, 2016",Kimberley Jones, What wicked good fun it is watching this bad girl do her worst.
Miami Herald," May 26, 2016",Connie Ogle," The love part of Love & Friendship is played for laughs; love in this era among such people is a business arrangement, not a romantic match. "
Financial Times," May 26, 2016",Nigel Andrews," Most of this film is a joy. It's Plain Jane compared to some, but its deadpan wit and poker-faced comic naturalism come to seem the ideal to which all Austen cinema should aspire."
Empire Magazine," May 26, 2016",Kim Newman," The funniest, most deliciously venomous Jane Austen movie ever made, and conclusive proof that, a) Kate Beckinsale has been seriously undervalued by the movies and, b) Whit Stillman is a major, distinctive talent."
Las Vegas Weekly," May 25, 2016",Josh Bell, A cheerfully cynical romantic comedy in which the romantic lead is also the villain -- and still somehow finds her way to a happy ending.
"Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)"," May 25, 2016",Ken Hanke," It is Austen -- reasonably at least -- with a touch of Oscar Wilde and full-on Whit Stillman. Funny, appealing, civilized -- and fully aware of the artifice holding it all together."
The Arts Desk," May 25, 2016",Alexandra Coghlan," Love & Friendship is Stillman's first foray into period drama, and it shows -- in a good way."
NOW Toronto," May 25, 2016",Norman Wilner," Deftly staged, briskly paced and very funny, thanks largely to Beckinsale's crack timing and Tom Bennett's breakout performance."
Georgia Straight," May 25, 2016",Ken Eisner," L&F's burnished cinematography and elegant performances offer a droll soulfulness that embodies everything we still love, and like, about Jane Austen."
Your Movies (cleveland.com)," May 25, 2016",John Urbancich," A classic, conniving and cunning Kate Beckinsale steals most of the thunder from the rest of Whit Stillman's droll cast in this funny and mostly accessible ""Downton Abbey""-like lark."
St. Paul Pioneer Press," May 24, 2016",Chris Hewitt (St. Paul)," Love & Friendship is hilarious, maybe the funniest movie of the year, and that it's classic Austen, featuring a sarcastic heroine who thinks she knows what's best for everyone and who probably is right."
Indie London," May 24, 2016",Rob Carnevale, It's refreshing to find a Jane Austen adaptation that's as witty and subversive as Whit Stillman's Love & Friendship.
The List," May 23, 2016",Angie Errigo," Boasting a beautifully calibrated tone, it's wickedly droll and choicely acted by the entire ensemble."
Austin American-Statesman," May 31, 2016",Charles Ealy," It would be easy to make a movie that condemns Lady Susan, but it's much more fun to watch her succeed, especially when Stillman surrounds her with people far from her intellectual equal."
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," May 31, 2016",Aine O'Connor," It is often laugh-out-loud funny, it's beautiful to watch (it was shot around Dublin) and has far broader appeal than standard period drama."
Hot Press," May 31, 2016",Roe McDermott, Love And Friendship proves to be one of the finest ever Austen adaptations.
SSG Syndicate," May 30, 2016",Susan Granger," Snappy, snarky comedy of manners, appealing primarily to women and indefatigable Austen fans."
London Evening Standard," May 29, 2016",David Sexton," I've never been much of a Jane-ite, myself. Converted now, though."
Observer (UK)," May 29, 2016",Mark Kermode," What a treat. Well played, Mr Stillman!"
National Post," May 27, 2016",Chris Knight," This is a sterling comic role for [Beckinsale], and her timing is split-second perfection."
Times (UK)," May 27, 2016",Kate Muir," This is the zingiest Austen adaptation you'll ever see, with the usual pastel palette and slow decorum abandoned in favour of acid colours and acid remarks, which keep the audience in stitches."
Sight and Sound," May 27, 2016",Thirza Wakefield," Love & Friendship is highly entertaining, with Austen's text fitting Stillman's style like a Regency-era glove."
Irish Independent," May 27, 2016",Paul Whitington," Stillman's film unfolds delightfully, is full of fun and wit, and Tom Bennett is superb as the idiotic but inordinately wealthy suitor."
"Deseret News, Salt Lake City"," May 27, 2016",Josh Terry, Whit Stillman skillfully weaves the threads of a story that is more witty than audiences might expect.
Sacramento News & Review," May 27, 2016",Daniel Barnes," Beckinsale is excellent as the pragmatically lusty Lady Susan, wrapping every blockhead man around her finger and coiling her tongue through the deadpan barbs of Stillman's script."
"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," May 27, 2016",Robert Horton," Any doubts that Jane Austen's novels and Hollywood's screwball comedies are close cousins is erased by Love & Friendship, a dryly delightful experience."
Irish Times," May 27, 2016",Donald Clarke," Why, Mr Stillman, we are driven to conclude that, in your match with Miss Austen, you have engineered a union more perfect than any found in divine nature."
Globe and Mail," May 27, 2016",Nathalie Atkinson, Adapted with great warmth and wit ...
Detroit News," May 27, 2016",Adam Graham," Stillman doesn't upend the Austen formula, he burrows into it and embraces all its trappings. The snappy dialogue, meanwhile, rewards a finely tuned ear and will thrill all lovers of language."
Salt Lake Tribune," May 26, 2016",Sean P. Means," The movie is a perfect showcase for Beckinsale, who tears through Austen's verbiage as thoroughly as her character devours any male in her presence."
Sky Movies," May 26, 2016",Tim Evans," It's a comic triumph with script, cast and performances combining to provide a perfect storm of mannered nastiness and an Austen adaptation that makes Pride + Prejudice + Zombies look positively lifeless."
Independent (UK)," May 26, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab," Love & Friendship is an unexpected delight, a very dry and tremendously witty adaptation of a little known Jane Austen novella. "
Daily Express (UK)," May 26, 2016",Allan Hunter, The jaunty irreverence of Whit Stillman's adaptation could almost pass as parody but it is delightfully entertaining.
Flicks.co.nz," July 7, 2016",Steve Newall," Stillman, Beckinsale, and Austen really share the honours here, though, in this witty, watchable, film."
New Zealand Herald," July 7, 2016",Francesca Rudkin," Turns out this strangely titled adaptation, named after another of Austen's novellas, isn't just delightful good fun, it's also terribly funny, sharp and dry, and wonderfully brought to life by an irrepressible Kate Beckinsale."
San Francisco Examiner," July 1, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson, The literary-cinematic marriage between Stillman and Austen is bracingly appropriate.
Common Sense Media," July 1, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson, Wickedly funny adaptation based on Austen novella.
"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," June 23, 2016",John Beifuss," A more fortunate marriage than any suggested in its narrative, Stillman's first period piece makes a perfect match of Austen's timeless comedy and the director's lapidary mise-en-scene."
Cinemalogue.com," June 17, 2016",Todd Jorgenson," Whit Stillman might have been Jane Austen in a past life, because the filmmaker's sense matches the author's sensibility in this frequently amusing adaptation."
Uncut Magazine [UK]," June 17, 2016",Michael Bonner," Stillman directs with the zing of a Howard Hawks comedy while his screenplay fluidly reshapes Austen's formal prose into sharp, accessible dialogue."
The Virginian-Pilot," June 17, 2016",Mal Vincent," Love & Friendship is about little or nothing, yet it exposes to our rushed lives the joys of an era in which people actually talked to each other, not to machines. As a comedy of manners, it delightfully skewers its ""polite society."""
National Review," June 16, 2016",Armond White," Beneath the impertinent, literary banter is a sedate - almost cold - vision of cruelty, greed, and selfishness. It recalls Stillman's The Last Days of Disco (1998), but without the soulful warmth of disco music to buoy the characters' urbane desperation."
Willamette Week," June 15, 2016",Lauren Terry," To call this adaptation of Jane Austen's early novella Lady Susan ""a breath of fresh air"" would not do justice to director Whit Stillman's vicious comedy of manners."
MLive.com," June 15, 2016",John Serba," An effervescent work, acute in its comedy, a tonal nudge in the ribs, with a slight, but perceptible vein of wry cynicism."
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," June 12, 2016",Dennis Schwartz," An engaging spicy rom/com screen adaptation of Lady Susan, Jane Austen's epistolary novel published posthumously in 1871."
Winnipeg Free Press," June 10, 2016",Alison Gillmor," Lady Susan may be a bad person, but with Austen at her sharpest, Stillman at his snappiest and Beckinsale right on form, she is very good company."
"Quad City Times (Davenport, IA)"," June 8, 2016",Linda Cook, Calling all Jane Austen fans: 'Love & Friendship' is a don't-miss.
BuzzFeed News," June 3, 2016",Alison Willmore," Love & Friendship is Jane Austen with the romance drained out, exposing the pragmatism and the economic urgency underneath. That sounds grim, but the result is actually a tart, fizzy delight from Metropolitan director Whit Stillman."
Screen It!," June 3, 2016",Jim Judy," There's enough to enjoy in his adaptation, especially from a dialogue front and particularly from the performances by Bennett and especially Beckinsale who shines in her part. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sexual Content, etc. - Also Available)"
Contactmusic.com," June 3, 2016",Rich Cline," Acclaimed filmmaker Whit Stillman reunites the stars of his 1998 drama The Last Days of Disco, Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny, for what might be the most entertaining big-screen Jane Austen adaptation ever."
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," June 2, 2016",Brian Gibson," Even as he relishes sinuous-sentence lines, Stillman finds a comic sprightliness in his take on Austen. Crafty and exuberant, this film finely dresses up its radical-rebel of a conniving woman in a polished, poised show of eloquent entertainment."
Fort Worth Weekly," June 2, 2016",Kristian M. Lin," Lady Susan is infuriating in her ability to justify whatever she wants to do and you want all her romantic plans to fail, but Beckinsale nevertheless makes her into delightful company."

ABC Radio Brisbane," August 27, 2016",Matthew Toomey," This is a delightful, entertaining comedy filled with wonderful dialogue. "
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," August 26, 2016",Philip Martin," ...has about it something of the feel of a screwball comedy. There's a bit of Preston Sturges in the film, and while the dialogue is set in period vocabulary, it's delivered in a way that feels quite modern."
Graffiti With Punctuation," August 3, 2016",Blake Howard, Whit Stillman said that his primary filmic influence for Love & Friendship was the Steve Martin and Michael Caine slice of genius Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. Scoundrels would be proud to see the result of his love and friendship.
Sydney Morning Herald," July 28, 2016",Sandra Hall," Tone in Jane Austen is all-important, hinging on a delicate balance between the tender and the sardonic. Whit Stillman captures it perfectly in the trailer for Love & Friendship. In the film itself, the hinge creaks a bit."
Sydney Morning Herald," July 22, 2016",Paul Byrnes, Kate Beckinsale takes much of the credit for the film's success.
The Australian," July 22, 2016",Stephen Romei," Austen did like to have fun with her characters to show the stranger sides we all have. Watching this classy adaptation of one of her lesser-known works will remind you of that, and make you laugh."
Daily Telegraph (Australia)," July 20, 2016",Vicky Roach," With this keenly observed comedy of manners, director Whit Stillman has successfully reimagined the period romance for contemporary audiences. Sharp, funny and briskly paced."
Herald Sun (Australia)," July 20, 2016",Leigh Paatsch, From one of Jane Austen's lesser-known works -- the posthumously published novella Lady Susan -- springs one of the finest Austen movie adaptations on record.
Trespass," July 20, 2016",Alex Doenau," Beckinsale is the perfect vessel for this dialogue, rattling off completely un-self aware statements and insults that border on the ridiculous with a straight face."
Jerusalem Post," July 20, 2016",Hannah Brown," The movie, filled with the beautiful costumes and country real-estate porn that are de rigueur for a story set in this period, is fast-paced and enjoyable from start to finish."
RTÉ (Ireland)," July 20, 2016",Sarah McIntyre," This is about as far from a typical Jane Austen adaptation as you can imagine possible, and only serves to highlight the writer's sharp wit and ahead-of-her-times sensibilities."
FILMINK (Australia)," July 20, 2016",Mark Demetrius, Mildly diverting.
Urban Cinefile," July 17, 2016",Andrew L. Urban," Whit Stillman doesn't go far enough, not for me anyway, with his stylised satire about a right bitch of a scheming, lying, selfish woman, Lady Susan Vernon - played to the death by a sparkling Kate Beckinsale"
Urban Cinefile," July 17, 2016",Louise Keller," Love, money and convenience engage in a merry dance, in this engaging comedy of manners adapted from Jane Austen's novella Lady Susan"
Washington Free Beacon," July 14, 2016",Sonny Bunch," Wry and witty, Love & Friendship is one of the funniest films of the year, a costume comedy for the ages."
rec.arts.movies.reviews," July 14, 2016",David N. Butterworth," Alas, there's nobody to root for in any of this: you feel manipulated by Lady Susan, sorry for Frederica, irritated by Reginald, and embarrassed by Sir James."
The Mary Sue," July 13, 2016",Lesley Coffin," t seems to me, if you like Whit Stillman's films, you probably love them. If you truly dislike his humor and preoccupation with the bourgeois lifestyle's preoccupation with codes of conduct, Love & Friendship might just not be your cup of tea. "
ABC Radio (Australia)," July 13, 2016",CJ Johnson," It's a jaunty, spiffy, upbeat and pacy movie, the kind where everyone is too busy being witty, flirtatious and tart to sit down ... a completely worthy addition to the Austen canon by someone who obviously cared very much to contribute."
"The Coast (Halifax, Nova Scotia)"," July 11, 2016",Tara Thorne," The requisite tossed-off zingers and genre subversion abound, with Tom Bennett nearly stealing the show as the charmingly rambling Sir James Martin."
