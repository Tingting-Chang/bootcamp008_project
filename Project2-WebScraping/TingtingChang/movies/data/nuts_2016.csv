Vanguard Seattle," December 2, 2016",Molly Laich," I'm convinced that above anything else, Lane is a master of tone; it makes me eager to see what project she takes on next."
Austin Chronicle," September 1, 2016",Steve Davis," Director Lane and screenwriter Thom Stylinski take a lighthearted, folksy approach to telling Brinkley's life story"

Paste Magazine," August 26, 2016",Michael Snydel," Nuts! is, on the whole, an incredibly entertaining and clever film that understands and constantly sidesteps the easy tropes of the genre."
Film Experience," August 2, 2016",Glenn Dunks," Nuts! is a marvel of storytelling - both in the old fashioned sense of a good yarn, and in the sense that editing and scripting leave the viewer genuinely unaware of where this spectacular story is going. "

The New Republic," July 25, 2016",Evan Kindley," It's a daring formal gamble on Lane's part, but it doesn't completely work."
National Review," July 21, 2016",Armond White," Caught up in the fun of telling this tall tale, Lane never matches the fine, humbling truth of Our Nixon...Lane's wild narrative flirts with Michael Moore-style deceit and contempt. Yet Lane's essential humanity comes through. "

Chicago Reader," July 14, 2016",Andrea Gronvall," I can't imagine anyone believing that goat glands transplanted into human reproductive organs could cure impotence, but as this lively, offbeat documentary proves, plenty of Americans did."
Seattle Times," July 14, 2016",John Hartl," ""NUTS!"" starts out as one kind of character study and turns into a very different one. The gullible believe in miracles, fortunes are built and lost, and an entire generation is deliberately misled."
TheWrap," July 8, 2016",Claudia Puig," This savvy director plays with history and viewers' conceptions of traditional documentary filmmaking, expounding in a way upon Stephen Colbert's concept of ""truthiness."""
Los Angeles Times," July 7, 2016",Robert Abele, [An] entertaining hornswoggle of a movie.
SF Weekly," July 6, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," Nuts! is very entertaining, but it turns out the definitive XERA documentary has yet to be made. Get on it, Ken Burns."

Guardian," January 23, 2016",Jordan Hoffman," Mixing droll animation, stock footage and a restrained number of talking head interviews, the director Penny Lane's biography has all the whimsy of a tall tale, until a late change in tone surprises with genuine emotion. Nuts! is really a kick."

Washington Post," June 30, 2016",Ann Hornaday," ""Nuts!"" is an intriguing, if patronizing, curio from the cabinet of American arcana, a geegaw from the collective attic that, when dusted off, looks grotesquely funny in the light of today."
