The List," December 5, 2016",Katherine McLaughlin, The tension is apparent from the off and this tightly wound and intimate drama delivers on both the intensity and complexity of a black sheep returning to the fold.
Total Film," December 5, 2016",Kevin Harley," A family Thanksgiving reunion starts with a flurry of ""so good to see yous"" and ends in expletive-laden recriminations in this brilliantly feel-bad debut from name-to-remember Trey Edward Shults."
Brooklyn Magazine," November 29, 2016",Benjamin Mercer," A big old family might gather under a single roof in Krisha, but the intriguing indie nonetheless steers clear of home-for-the-holidays formula -- it's more emotional-spiral suspense film than sentimental drama."
LarsenOnFilm," October 23, 2016",Josh Larsen, ...as if we're experiencing that most familiar of American traditions-Thanksgiving dinner-through the eyes of an uncomfortable alien.
Film International," July 11, 2016",Elias Savada," Other than a kitchen catastrophe, there's not a sloppy moment in Trey Edward Shults' micro-budgeted, crowdsourcedKrisha, an incredibly well-constructed debut feature that plays like a home movie gone awry."
Combustible Celluloid," July 1, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," This is boldly independent work, with more than enough painful, searing drama to leave a mark."
Thrillist," June 5, 2016",Matt Patches, Krisha stages these typical festivities with the fury of battling gods. 
MLive.com," May 10, 2016",John Serba," Shot like a creeper of a horror movie, it's intense and focused, seemingly crafted from raw tension, building to boiling catharsis. "
The Young Folks," April 16, 2016",Jon Espino," Ingrained in each scene is a great understanding of every side of addiction, making this family affair into an uncomfortably familiar one for anyone who has dealt with either side of addiction."
Detroit News," April 15, 2016",Adam Graham," ""Krisha"" is a stone cold stunner."
Salt Lake Tribune," April 8, 2016",Sean P. Means," Shults' greatest ally, and greatest find, is his aunt, Krisha Fairchild. She gives a gritty, lived-in performance brimming with soul and heartache."
EntertainmentTell," April 7, 2016",Stephen Silver," Unlike most indie movies with intriguing backstories, Krisha stands on its own as a truly great movie, one of the most powerful of the year. (Splice Today) "
Mark Reviews Movies," April 1, 2016",Mark Dujsik," Shults' camera simply, expertly moves with Krisha as she attempts to maneuver her way into a sense of normalcy with -- of belonging to -- her family again."
Arizona Republic," March 31, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," From the first scene of ""Krisha,"" writer and director Trey Edward Shults puts us off balance, and for the next 83 minutes keeps us that way, almost daring us to look away."
Variety," November 18, 2015",Justin Chang, An intimate and unnerving character study that marks a ferociously impressive feature debut for 26-year-old multihyphenate Trey Edward Shults.
Screen International," November 18, 2015",Tim Grierson," A jittery character drama which mixes tones and influences, the feature debut of writer-director-editor Trey Edward Shults does a very good job of finding fresh emotional terrain in what is a very familiar setup."
Hollywood Reporter," November 18, 2015",Sheri Linden," Trey Edward Shults is hardly the first filmmaker to use the all-American Thanksgiving get-together to expose family anxieties. But with Krisha, his extraordinary debut feature, he brings a bracing originality to a familiar setup."
Austin Chronicle," November 18, 2015",Rod Machen," For some, watching a movie like this can be hard, but Shults does the audience the favor of attacking his story head on. His unflinching eye gives us a cathartic view of the very real pain that can exist in domestic life troubled by addiction."
indieWire," November 18, 2015",Eric Kohn, The final shot once again turns the story over to the contours of Krisha's face and the shades of emotional ambiguity conveyed by it. The uncertainties that define her existence are as riveting as they are tragic.
The Playlist," November 18, 2015",Charlie Schmidlin," The film's brief 83-minute running time only compounds Krishna as a sharp breath with no exhale; shot and paced like a thriller, the film is a dreamlike view into a woman's inner life that ensures a tragic end. "
Vanity Fair," November 18, 2015",Joanna Robinson," The winner of the grand jury award for narrative features at SXSW, Trey Edward Shults's writing and directing debut, Krisha, is an emotional gut punch of a film."

Los Angeles Times," March 18, 2016",Robert Abele," A coiled masterpiece of subjective filmmaking, writer-director Trey Edward Shults' ""Krisha"" is, in the well-worn genre of ruined family holidays, something of an indie gauntlet thrown down."
New York Times," March 17, 2016",Manohla Dargis," Few movies bore into a character's head as deeply as ""Krisha,"" and with such uncompromising ferocity."

Metro," March 17, 2016",Matt Prigge," At once familiar and sui generis, specific and universal, it thoroughly reworks what could have been a thumb-twiddling family saga into something unique and gutting."
AV Club," March 17, 2016",A.A. Dowd," Unfolding across an especially long and awkward Thanksgiving Day, Krisha creates an audio-visual language of social anxiety; it's practically a horror movie about the horror of being the unwanted guest at the party."
AllMovie," March 17, 2016",Daniel Gelb," Despite the familiarity of its conceit, this is a bold debut feature."
The Verge," March 16, 2016",Tasha Robinson," Shults is telling a personal story here, but he's also wisely drawing on a familiar set of tropes, ones that implicate the audience in all sorts of interesting ways."
Guardian," March 16, 2016",Jordan Hoffman," It is a bravura debut from a young film-maker, proving that one can still make a movie for no money at a family member's house and come away with a work of art, not just a calling card."
Paste Magazine," March 15, 2016",Kenji Fujishima," You've seen the plot before, but not quite like this."
The Film Stage," March 15, 2016",Dan Schindel," Trey Edward Shults hardly turns the dark family drama genre on its head, Krisha compensates with exceptional acting and an infectious atmosphere of dread."
Aisle Seat," March 15, 2016",Mike McGranaghan, Krisha is bold and powerful. This Great American Indie will knock you on your ass in the best possible way.
Village Voice," March 15, 2016",Alan Scherstuhl," Brash yet intimate, writer/director/editor Trey Edward Shults's observant, unnerving first feature transcends the notion of a ""promising debut."""
New Yorker," March 14, 2016",Richard Brody," Shults displays a bold visual and dramatic sensibility with his impressionistic rearrangement of time and his repertory of darting, whirling, plunging, and retreating camera moves, which seem to paint the action onto the screen."
Slant Magazine," March 13, 2016",James Lattimer, It rams home the main character's relentless downward spiral though an incessant parade of grandstanding stylistic flourishes.
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," March 3, 2016",Dennis Schwartz, Curious indie drama/comedy.
TIME Magazine," March 31, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," Fairchild's performance is key to the movie: Krisha is witty and chatty one moment, shut down like a deserted fairground the next. We see dazzling warmth in her eyes but also the terror of total system failure."
Philadelphia Inquirer," March 27, 2016",Steven Rea," Krisha may go on a little longer than you'd want, but then, its title character is the kind of houseguest who stays longer than you'd want her to - so even the postscript confrontations and apologies feel right."
The Patriot Ledger," March 26, 2016",Al Alexander," It's raw, unapologetic and in your face."
"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," March 25, 2016",Robert Horton," The film has the off-kilter, claustrophobic feel of a horror movie, and on its own terms it's effective."
Austin American-Statesman," March 24, 2016",Charles Ealy, This is no average tale about awkward homecomings. Fairchild is an extraordinary-yet-relatively-unknown actress. And Shults manages to let her character's story come out with shocking clarity and maximum emotional impact.
Boston Globe," March 24, 2016",Ty Burr, At times you laugh in horror. At other times you shrink from the screen. There are truths here.
Austin Chronicle," March 24, 2016",Josh Kupecki, Krisha is an exceptionally well done slow burn that ushers a striking new talent onto the film scene.
Washington Post," March 24, 2016",Michael O'Sullivan," The director allows us to inhabit not just Krisha's pill-induced zone-out but also her acute distress and, yes, guilt over her past behavior. It's slightly fussy, in-your-face filmmaking, but it's viscerally effective."
Chicago Tribune," March 24, 2016",Michael Phillips," ""Krisha"" is obviously personal for Shults, but there's a limit to that fact. The film's technique transcends the merely personal."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," March 24, 2016",Colin Covert," Here's a pure, penetrating emotional high."
Wall Street Journal," March 24, 2016",Joe Morgenstern, This haunting drama finds new and explosive life in a familiar premise -- a black sheep's return to the family fold for Thanksgiving dinner.
Reeling Reviews," March 24, 2016",Laura Clifford," [Shults'] from-the-inside-out, humanistic look at an addict confidently veers in tone from drama to comedy to outright horror..."
Seattle Times," March 24, 2016",Tom Keogh," For all its strengths, ""Krisha"" can also be self-indulgent and artificial."

Blu-ray.com," March 23, 2016",Brian Orndorf," ""Krisha"" is harrowing work, diving into the abyss of dysfunction with stunning intimacy and creative confidence from the first-time helmer. "
SF Weekly," March 23, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," Shults does indeed display some giftedness on a visual level, keeping his limited locations interesting with numerous camera tricks and movements. But as calling cards go, Krisha should have remained a short."
Rolling Stone," March 23, 2016",David Fear," Krisha is many things: a nightmare, a cry for help, a cringe-comedy with sobbing instead of a laugh track, a cracked family portrait, an apology and a valentine."
San Francisco Chronicle," March 23, 2016",Walter V. Addiego," Shults is a penetrating observer, and hints at many old wounds that will be lanced in the course of a tight 83 minutes."
Entertainment Weekly," March 19, 2016",Chris Nashawaty, Shults builds a creeping sense of dread with the same anxious naturalism that the late indie auteur John Cassavetes brought to such films as A Woman Under the Influence.
Rotten Tomatoes," March 18, 2016",Todd Jorgenson, The confident low-budget visuals and unflinching attention to sensory details add an unsettling layer of tension to the proceedings that sticks with you afterward.
