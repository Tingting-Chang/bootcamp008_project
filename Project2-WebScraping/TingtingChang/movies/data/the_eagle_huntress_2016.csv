We Got This Covered," January 23, 2017",David James," Feminist by nature rather than design and consistently visually dazzling, The Eagle Huntress is top flight documentary cinema."
New Zealand Herald," January 5, 2017",Francesca Rudkin," This a beautiful and gentle documentary, well, except for a sacrificial killing of a goat and fox, and is filled with stunning landscapes."
indieWire," January 2, 2017",Kate Erbland," A soaring, sweet documentary that welcomes its audience into an unexpected new arena."
Austin Chronicle," December 31, 2016",Steve Davis," There's no doubt about the veracity of Aisholpan's inspirational story. She exists, and she's a champion in every sense. But many sequences in the film appear planned out, even staged."
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," December 28, 2016",Aine O'Connor," It's interesting, beautiful and Aisholpan and her dad are so sweet that it makes for lovely viewing."
Irish Independent," December 28, 2016",Paul Whitington," The footage used in Otto Bell's film is breathtaking, but unfortunately it's accompanied by an overbearing soundtrack and commentary that cheapen Aisholpan's achievements."

East Bay Express," December 27, 2016",Kelly Vance, A must-see.
"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," December 26, 2016",John Beifuss," If the girl-empowerment message is unsubtle, the chronology dubious and the occasionally staged action sometimes manipulative, the film also is quite moving, especially as the high-spirited girl develops her remarkable bond with her 15-pound bird."
Financial Times," December 23, 2016",Nigel Andrews, It's spectacular at best; watchable even at worst.
CineVue," December 20, 2016",Matthew Anderson, A wondrously beautiful and beguiling journey into the unknown and a documentary of simultaneously mythic and very modern proportions.
London Evening Standard," December 18, 2016",Charlotte O'Sullivan," This lovely ode to change (which gets you thinking, not just about gender but all hierarchies) contains two powerful youngsters. It should really be called The Eaglet and her Girl."
Observer (UK)," December 18, 2016",Wendy Ide," Whether or not the storytelling here is disingenuous, there remains a manipulative quality to the film-making that is, in the end, off-putting."

New York Daily News," October 31, 2016",Ariel Scotti," ""The Eagle Huntress"" is all at once an inspiring story for children of all ages to believe that they can do anything, a reflection of the unfairness of gender roles and a rare and unique look at a remote part of the world."
Christian Science Monitor," October 28, 2016",Peter Rainer," The film, some of which looks staged, is too slick, and its feminist emphasis, complete with Australian performer Sia singing ""You can do anything"" on the soundtrack, grates. But Aisholpan triumphs over these excesses."

Kaplan vs. Kaplan," November 3, 2016",Jeanne Kaplan," Yes, awards and recognition for your efforts are great, but the most important aspect of Aisholpan's feat is her own feeling of self-satisfaction knowing what she has accomplished, "
Kaplan vs. Kaplan," November 3, 2016",David Kaplan, This is amazing footage unlike anything you've ever seen

San Diego Reader," November 11, 2016",Matthew Lickona, Documentarian Otto Bell's titular huntress - a 13-year-old Kazakh named Aisholpan who hails from a family boasting generations of champion (male) eagle hunters - is impossible not to like and/or root for.
