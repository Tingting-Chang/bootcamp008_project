Eye for Film," January 20, 2017",Jennie Kermode," It's the interaction of a sanguine realism with a celebration of the liberating effect of the imagination that makes the magic happen. That, and the exquisite animation."
Laramie Movie Scope," January 17, 2017",Robert Roten," This film, directed by Mark Osborne is multi-layered, with a story about a writer, an aviator, the Little Prince, and a young, modern day girl, who becomes friends with the aviator and who searches for the Little Prince told in the aviator's story."
Tampa Bay Times," November 29, 2016",Jimmy Geurts, Perhaps it's best to think of it less as an adaptation and more as an appreciation of what the book has meant to the world since its initial publication.
Sydney Morning Herald," September 26, 2016",Michael Idato," It is deeply personal and profoundly moving, a sensitive and affecting portrait of humanity."
Sensacine," September 8, 2016",Carlos Reviriego, A very intelligent update of a classic that contributes by creating a whole new world. [Full review in Spanish]
Cinemanía (Spain)," September 5, 2016",Irene Crespo," Even though it's not a literal adaptation, respects the book by developing in different layers. [Full review in Spanish]"
Combustible Celluloid," August 26, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," A wonderfully creative, soul-soothing work. "
LarsenOnFilm," August 15, 2016",Josh Larsen, There is both a fragility and immediacy to the imagery-as if watching it might give you a paper cut.
Under the Radar," August 15, 2016",J.A. Kordosh," It can't help but be compared to the daring, challenging original."
Cambridge Day," August 11, 2016",Allyson Johnson," An instant classic for young and old, the film capitalizes on the themes of identity, what it means to grow up and the importance of staying curious with a gusto and enthusiasm that matches the film's young lead."
Consequence of Sound," August 11, 2016",Allison Shoemaker," Taken as one piece of art, as one beautiful, self-sustaining creation, this Little Prince is a thing of beauty. "
Paste Magazine," August 10, 2016",Michael Snydel," The film is admirable for its gentle hand when it comes to difficult subjects like the ephemeral nature of life, and its bold visual style, but it's also a film whose final reel seems unwilling to recognize the realities of its own story."
Slate," August 9, 2016",Katy Waldman," If Saint-Exupéry offered readers a petite, queer-tasting square of some delicate cake they'd never heard of, Netflix has served up a familiar, fragrant, well-balanced meal."
Vox," August 8, 2016",Aja Romano," The Little Prince should make a compelling, if not always fully incisive, case for clinging to the lessons of youth."
Deadline Hollywood Daily," August 8, 2016",Pete Hammond," The animation is gorgeous, with contemporary home life scenes in CGI and the world of The Little Prince in stunning stop-motion design."
Punch Drunk Critics," August 6, 2016",Travis Hopson, Saint-Exupery's core themes are never lost despite the contemporary context; rather they are enhanced by the Aviator's memories and the Little Girl's fresh experiences.

HitFix," June 4, 2015",Gregory Ellwood," There is a faith that the story and characters will keep the audience engaged, even if there isn't a bright and shiny thing to distract them in a every single scene."
The Playlist," May 26, 2015",Oliver Lyttelton," ...for the most part the director takes the right liberties, ending up with an extremely beautiful, very charming, thematically rich take that's sure to be one of the better animated movies this year."
Guardian," May 22, 2015",Andrew Pulver," This is a very good-looking film that represents a brave attempt to do justice to a very popular book; it manages it, just."
Screen International," May 22, 2015",Tim Grierson," This heartfelt bauble about a young girl facing the pressures of adulthood is constantly enlivened by its beautiful images, even if one itches for a narrative that's a little less rudimentary."
Variety," May 22, 2015",Scott Foundas," Adds all manner of narrative bells and whistles to the author's slender, lyrical story of friendship between a pilot and a mysterious extraterrestrial voyager, but stays true to its timeless depiction of childhood wonderment ..."

Toronto Star," March 10, 2016",Peter Howell," This first feature screen animation of The Little Prince is a pleasure to behold, but as with any journey the venture is not without risk."
Toronto Sun," March 10, 2016",Steve Tilley," To be fair, this homage to The Little Prince is a lovely story, lovingly told. And for the first two-thirds of the movie, it feels like one of the freshest animated films in ages."
NOW Toronto," March 10, 2016",Radheyan Simonpillai," Saint-Exupéry's darker tones and intense emotions are all here, echoing the Little Girl's own self-discovery in a dual narrative that dares to be more evocative and sophisticated than children are accustomed to."

Slant Magazine," February 12, 2016",Oleg Ivanov," While the scenes with the little prince and the aviator are whimsically charming, they fail to make up for the framing plot's trivialization of the source material, undermining the original story's beguiling, tragic quality."

What Culture," September 25, 2015",Alex Leadbeater, A totally visual experience that feels a bit repetitive thematically.
indieWire," August 4, 2016",David Ehrlich," A strange, satisfying, star-studded adaptation of the kid lit classic."
Entertainment Weekly," August 4, 2016",Leah Greenblatt," At its inventive best-like the creation of a little cloth fox who never speaks but steals almost every scene he's in-it does capture the odd, tender wonder of [Saint-Exupéry's] world."
Newark Star-Ledger," August 4, 2016",Stephen Whitty," The whole movie's done with great skill and artistry, and while some of the original story's more philosophical moments have been toned down, they haven't disappeared."
AV Club," August 4, 2016",A.A. Dowd," Better ... to think of this handsome, inoffensive Little Prince less as an adaptation than as a tribute-one that makes the relationship between the book and those who love it a central focus."
Las Vegas Weekly," August 3, 2016",Josh Bell," Both parts of the movie work well, but they don't always work well together, especially in the final act."
Village Voice," August 3, 2016",Bilge Ebiri," There's a lot of charm, thought and feeling in this film version. It expands on the original without dishonoring it."

The Weekend Warrior," August 3, 2016",Edward Douglas, A wonderful surprise.
Pajiba," August 3, 2016",Kristy Puchko," I'd tell you to watch The Little Prince for its enchanting animation alone. That it's poignant, thoughtful, and warmly thrilling, that's just icing."
RogerEbert.com," August 3, 2016",Brian Tallerico, A film that everyone should be happy to show their children.
Fresno Bee," August 2, 2016",Rick Bentley," Osborne's take on The Little Prince shows a reverence for the original story, plus an understanding of what modern audiences want with a more linear story and bright animation."
"The Coast (Halifax, Nova Scotia)"," July 11, 2016",Tara Thorne," This terrific adaptation of the beloved children's book for adults features a passel of Hollywood voices, but they're beside the point."
Hollywood Reporter," June 27, 2016",Leslie Felperin," An ambitious gamble that looks like a sure bet commercially but which, artistically, shortchanges its source material."
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," June 2, 2016",Brian Gibson," Mark Osborne's feature-length adaptation adds a dominant frame story that, at first, plays off the famous little fable (splendidly animated) within it quite nicely, only to overwhelm the original in its action-adventure third act."
South China Morning Post," April 6, 2016",James Mottram," Even if the kids are left wanting more, purists will doubtless be pleased with Mark Osborne's reverential take on Antoine de Saint-Exupery's 1943 tale."

Slant Magazine," March 15, 2016",Chuck Bowen," As preachy and repetitive as The Little Prince can be, it offers enough moments of poetry to keep it flirting with greatness, or at least goodness."
The Young Folks," March 14, 2016",Gary Shannon," In a time where films and television shows are lauded for how ""faithful"" they are in adapting another person's work, I think what The Little Prince accomplishes is more impressive - a tribute, true to its source material and original unto itself."
Ex-Press.com," March 13, 2016",Katherine Monk," It won't destroy your precious memories of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's classic, but you may feel a frisson of betrayal in the final moments that forces you to scan the bookcase back home for the original. Just to recapture that alien feeling."
National Post," March 11, 2016",Chris Knight," If what is essential is invisible to the eye, then The Little Prince has accomplished the impossible; it has made the invisible visible, and in 3D no less."
San Francisco Chronicle," August 5, 2016",David Wiegand," No child, or adult, for that matter, will be able to resist the considerable charm of The Little Prince."
Christian Science Monitor," August 5, 2016",Peter Rainer, Director Mark Osborne [achieves] some charming effects... But the computer-animated portions that function as a real-world framing device are more tedious than fanciful. 
MTV," August 5, 2016",Inkoo Kang," The Little Prince depends on its viewers' willingness to go along with twee flutterings like ""The stars are beautiful because of a flower that cannot be seen."" I'm too much of an adult to swallow that saccharine bilge, I guess."
Guardian," August 5, 2016",Peter Bradshaw," It's a film with charm and sweetness, but for me is structurally encumbered by this new present-day narrative level: the smarter, zappier modern animated style makes the marionette-style images of the past look a bit low-octane and quaint."
Little White Lies," August 5, 2016",Wilbur Charles-Roberts, Osborne respects the integrity of the original story in this charming adaptation.
Uncle Barky," August 5, 2016",Ed Bark," Beautifully and expressively animated, The Little Prince basically is the story of an old man who still acts like a kid and a kid who's being programmed to be an ""essential"" cog in the grand industrial, soul-deadening scheme of things."

AtHomeInHollywood.com," August 4, 2016",Staci Layne Wilson," The Little Prince is a fond tribute, true to its source material and original unto itself. "
Los Angeles Times," August 4, 2016",Charles Solomon, There are only a few ... delightful moments in an otherwise muddled movie that feels like three films ineptly grafted together.
New York Times," August 4, 2016",Stephen Holden," ""The Little Prince"" is really a movie within a movie; the author's delicate, fanciful story is folded into a harsh, modernist commentary on depersonalization and conformity in the contemporary workplace."
Wall Street Journal," August 4, 2016",Joe Morgenstern, Mr. Osborne has done himself proud. What's essential in his film is the singular beauty of the first half.
School Library Journal," August 4, 2016",Kent Turner, The film comes across as an homage and extravagant promo for the book.
TheWrap," August 4, 2016",Claudia Puig," When the film hews to its source material, the results are enchanting, but the predictable and sentimental framing device around the slim tale undercuts the potency of the book's meditations on love and mortality. "
New York Post," August 4, 2016",Kyle Smith, As fragile and beautiful as the beloved rose guarded by the wee fellow of the title.
Spirituality and Practice," August 4, 2016",Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, A creative and spiritual reworking of Antoine de Saint-Exupery's magical and enlightening 1943 novella.
Chicago Sun-Times," August 4, 2016",Richard Roeper," We've yet to get a masterpiece-level film adaptation of the classic novella The Little Prince, but if and until that day comes, this will do just nicely, thank you very much. "
