Laramie Movie Scope," February 8, 2017",Robert Roten," I did not laugh much, but it is effective on an emotional level, as a portrait of a people trying to cope with gang violence that is spinning out of control in their community."
Lyles' Movie Files," January 20, 2017",Jeffrey Lyles," A more mature installment that seeks to challenge audiences as often as it cracks them up, Next Cut marks a charming and enjoyable evolution of the series."
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," November 14, 2016",Dan Lybarger," For the most part, Lee and company still manage to coax solid laughs and to give the grim facts the gravity they deserve."
Times (UK)," October 10, 2016",Kevin Maher," This one, thankfully, boasts some welcome new cast members (including the rapper Common and Nicki Minaj), a new director in Malcolm D Lee (the cousin of Spike), and a fearless approach to difficult subjects."
Pajiba," September 21, 2016",Rebecca Pahle," It's like a PG-13, dad version of Chi-Raq. The message, if a little preachy and a little schmaltzy, is also worthy and well-meant."
Total Film," August 15, 2016",James Mottram," The barbs are scissor-sharp, making this a threequel that delivers what you want while throwing in some surprises."
Chesapeake Family Magazine," August 2, 2016",Roxana Hadadi, Barbershop: The Next Cut brings topical social issues into the narrative but only starts meaningful conversations without genuinely pushing them forward.
Creative Loafing," July 30, 2016",Matt Brunson," The best of the Barbershop quartet (following 2002's Barbershop, 2004's Barbershop: Back in Business, and 2005's Beauty Shop), Barbershop: The Next Cut offers more laughs and more meaningful commentary than previous installments in the series."
Aisle Seat," July 26, 2016",Mike McGranaghan, The first one to really get a semblance of the first movie's charm back. It's easily the best of the sequels.
San Francisco Examiner," July 1, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," Like its predecessors, the third in the ""Barbershop"" series is rough around the edges, by turns funny, jubilant and sentimental, sometimes forced, but rarely phony."
Daily Express (UK)," June 19, 2016",Brigit Grant," For all the jibes, silly feuds, romances and dancing, it is their decision to take a stand against the violence that impresses most, and their disillusionment with a President they hoped would bring change that stays with you."
HeyUGuys," June 17, 2016",Amon Warmann," What really makes this latest trip to the Barbershop a cut above most comedies is that it manages to be both powerful and timely, without being preachy."
Daily Mail (UK)," June 16, 2016",Brian Viner," The film does have a certain heart, but I can't be the only one hoping not to see a Barbershop 4, whatever the obvious temptation to complete a quartet."
Sky Movies," June 16, 2016",Tim Evans, It's harmless stuff although the swerve into gritty social justice may not win it many fans among a fanbase more concerned with blow-dries than drive-bys.
Radio Times," June 16, 2016",Stephen Carty," In short, it may have been a long time (12 years) coming, but Barbershop 3 is much better than expected."

EntertainmentTell," April 26, 2016",Stephen Silver," A durably funny comedy that balances a likable cast and has something to say about its subject, even if it's not something especially groundbreaking. (Splice Today) "
The Movie Kit," April 23, 2016",Kit Bowen," For a third installment in a series, Barbershop: The Next Cut feels just as original and relevant as if this were the first one."

Forbes," April 13, 2016",Scott Mendelson," Without maligning its predecessors, it might be the best of the three."
Village Voice," April 13, 2016",Melissa Anderson," Glutted even more than its predecessors with ancient fellas-versus-females debates, ungainly sociopolitical commentary, and top-40 superstars trying to diversify their brands."
Associated Press," April 13, 2016",Sandy Cohen, Director Malcolm D. Lee and writers Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver develop each of these characters enough to deliver a winning ensemble comedy with multiple story lines and just the right dose of realistic drama.

TheWrap," April 12, 2016",Alonso Duralde," Spike Lee took a much less prosaic look at Chicago's gang violence in last year's challenging Chi-Raq, but this more straightforward presentation will probably find more traction among mainstream audiences."
CinemaBlend.com," April 12, 2016",Greg Wakeman," Even though it touches upon topical issues, its drama is forced and hinders rather than compliments proceedings."
Hollywood Reporter," April 12, 2016",Frank Scheck, A cut above.
Variety," April 12, 2016",Justin Chang," Ice Cube, Cedric the Entertainer and a fresh cast of hair-cutting cut-ups ground this overly earnest but not-unwelcome third 'Barbershop' feature."
Guardian," April 12, 2016",Jordan Hoffman," The movie doesn't pretend to solve any problems, but shows that community and communication- and in this case laughter - might."

indieWire," April 14, 2016",David Ehrlich," A moderately funny but uncommonly focused ensemble comedy, this isn't just a movie about the gun violence that plagues Chicago's South Side, it's a movie that was made in response to it."
Boston Globe," April 14, 2016",Tom Russo," For a freshly-shaved-chin wag, ""The Next Cut"" covers ambitious ground."

Arizona Republic," April 14, 2016",Barbara VanDenburgh," Calvin's Barbershop is the same familiar comfort it has always been, to both its patrons and filmgoers."
New York Post," April 14, 2016",Lou Lumenick," [Lee] handles the huge, excellent ensemble and tonal shifts with skill as the crew argues about sexism and politics, along the way mocking everyone from President Obama and R. Kelly to Bill Cosby and the Kardashians."
Tampa Bay Times," April 14, 2016",Steve Persall," Ice Cube's life leading to this project - partly defined by the N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton - lends invaluable credibility to this movie's many messages, about violence, respecting women, parenting and accountability. "

NOW Toronto," April 15, 2016",Radheyan Simonpillai," The movie deals tangentially with #BlackLivesMatter but what it's really about is the space: a place where a community can get together to share their anger, pain, faults and joys. That matters too. That's what these movies are."

HollywoodInToto.com," April 15, 2016",Christian Toto, Welcome to the most conservative film of 2016 (so far)
Beliefnet," April 15, 2016",Nell Minow," What makes it work is the talk, the constant banter that sways in and out of heartfelt discussion of all the big issues: race, gender, politics, community, family, and love."
Rolling Stone," April 15, 2016",Peter Travers," It's stagey, often simplistic and it talks too damn much. But, hell, the talk has flavor and snap and a real-world sense of a community in crisis. Not bad for an escapist romp. "

Screen It!," April 15, 2016",Teddy Durgin," The film contains all of the funny byplay, dust-ups, and he-said/she-said back-and-forths of the first two films. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)"
People Magazine," April 15, 2016",Alynda Wheat," If the execution is sometimes clunky, if it tries to fit in too many characters, plot points and conversation threads, at least all of that is in the service of a higher ideal. "
