Under the Radar," January 23, 2017",Alex Segura," Skillful, complex, and purposely understated, The Witness succeeds not just as a re-examination of one of the most talked-about crimes in modern memory, but as a very touching, human tale of a brother trying to get to know the sister he lost too soon."
"News & Observer (Raleigh, NC)"," January 23, 2017",Brooke Cain," ""The Witness"" is fascinating enough for its careful reporting of the circumstances surrounding the infamous murder, but equally as a study of the impact of crimes on those left behind."
Boston Globe," January 23, 2017",Peter Keough," An engrossing detective story, an enlightening sociological study, and a heartbreaking story of unreconciled grief, ""The Witness"" is one of the best documentaries of 2016."
Newsday," January 23, 2017",Rafer Guzman, It's a quietly effective documentary that works on two levels.
LarsenOnFilm," November 1, 2016",Josh Larsen," ...potent journalism, but also leaves the faint whiff of reality television."
Film Experience," October 26, 2016",Glenn Dunks," By the time [Bill Genovese] hires an actress to walk the same stretch of street in Kew Gardens that Kitty walked that night in 1964, having her scream and wail down footpaths and inside stairwells, I was unsettled. But not in a particularly good way."
Slant Magazine," October 18, 2016",Clayton Dillard," The film presents Kitty Genovese's identity as an afterthought, turning her living days and nights into incidental details."
Times-Picayune," September 7, 2016",Mike Scott," A heart-rending, intensely personal portrait of lingering grief and the way a crime - whether iconic or not - forever transforms the lives of those left behind."
Windy City Times," August 9, 2016",Richard Knight, The result is both a loving homage and a truly thought-provoking redress of history.
San Francisco Examiner," July 29, 2016",Anita Katz," As Bill starts focusing on Kitty's life, rather than death, the film becomes even better; it's one of the most satisfying documentaries released this year."
SF Weekly," July 28, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," In addition to being a meditation on the way media falsehoods agreed upon can impact real life, The Witness is also straight-up research porn."
Chicago Reader," July 21, 2016",J. R. Jones," The movie cuts deep on a personal level as well, turning Kitty from a poster child back into a real person."
The Playlist," July 20, 2016",Jordan Ruimy," As the documentary goes along, it becomes clear that Kitty's murder is less about what actually happened, and more about the shadow it has continued to cast on Bill."
Movie Mezzanine," July 12, 2016",Mallory Andrews," The Witness achieves something ... vital: restoring its victim into full, breathing life."
Georgia Straight," July 7, 2016",Ken Eisner," The filmmakers drop these crucial threads in favour of pursuing Genovese's obsession with reconstructing that fatal morning, and the results, while intriguing (especially in low-key animated scenes), are often less than riveting."
Washington Post," June 30, 2016",Pat Padua," ""The Witness"" makes an encouraging case for the argument that society is not as apathetic as we fear. But it also reveals a troubling phenomenon: our willingness to accept all that we are told as truth."
Arizona Republic," June 30, 2016",Barbara VanDenburgh," For all the tedium of the work before William, ""The Witness"" is a riveting deconstruction of a decades-old media narrative."

Cinemalogue.com," June 17, 2016",Todd Jorgenson," The result is fascinating, although more for its investigative process than its revelations."
L.A. Biz," June 17, 2016",Annlee Ellingson," Solomon progressively peels back the layers on not only the case but on Kitty herself, dropping bombshells that hit on a bunch of buzzy themes without forcing topicality."
New York Times," June 2, 2016",Andy Webster," Ultimately, the murder is eclipsed by Mr. Genovese's own struggles - how his obsession exasperates family members, and how the perceived public apathy inspired him to fight in Vietnam, where he lost his legs."
Film Journal International," June 2, 2016",Chris Barsanti," A public crime becomes a private obsession in this sharp, poignant documentary."
Brooklyn Magazine," June 2, 2016",Ryan Vlastelica," The problem is, after The Witness argues the crime wasn't a culture-defining moment, it then tries to make it one by trying to tie it to other societal issues. "
AV Club," June 2, 2016",A.A. Dowd," Perhaps because any real closure is impossible at this point, The Witness eventually embraces its own inconclusiveness, like some documentary cousin to Zodiac."
Epoch Times," June 1, 2016",Joe Bendel," Rarely, has 'true crime' ever been as emotionally devastating as it is in The Witness."
Entertainment Weekly," June 1, 2016",Joe McGovern," Even if you're familiar with debunked details of her murder, moments in the film have the capacity to startle."
Village Voice," May 31, 2016",Alan Scherstuhl, Compelling and sometimes frustrating ...
ColeSmithey.com," May 31, 2016",Cole Smithey, The filmmakers leave no stone unturned in building a tour de force documentary that provides more than just food for thought; it delivers catharsis.
New Yorker," May 30, 2016",Richard Brody," The movie's one reÃ«nactment-an ingenious experiment in forensics and social science-unites drama, journalism, and first-hand experience in a masterstroke of pure cinema."
ReelTalk Movie Reviews," May 28, 2016",Donald J. Levit," The film could not have failed to flesh Kitty Genovese out beyond a number, a statistic, that last night alive, through grainy home movies and memories fifty years later. "
Flavorwire," May 3, 2016",Jason Bailey," What begins as a riveting deep dive into a cultural flashpoint becomes, in its later scenes, difficult, sometimes inappropriate, and always fascinating."

RogerEbert.com," April 18, 2016",Godfrey Cheshire, Thoughtful and satisfying.
Variety," April 18, 2016",Nick Schager," [The film] functions as a project of not only confrontation but resurrection, as Bill's sleuthing sheds new light on Kitty's personality, romances and career, and thus finally re-emphasizes her as a flesh-and-blood person rather than just a famous victim."
Guardian," April 18, 2016",Jordan Hoffman," Despite these revelations, there's still no smoking gun for Bill Genovese, and it is in this frustration where The Witness grows into something more than a cold case crime show."
Hollywood Reporter," April 18, 2016",Frank Scheck," Seen in vintage 8mm home movies, Kitty Genovese emerges as a vibrant, exuberant young woman whose violent death tragically came to overshadow her much too brief life."
Globe and Mail," June 17, 2016",Johanna Schneller," The story deftly switches focus from Bill's quest to Bill himself. We learn how and why the witness apathy story has haunted him for 50 years, his family's reaction to his admitted obsession over it, and how it shaped his life."

National Post," June 16, 2016",Chris Knight, Director James D. Solomon lets the story build slowly. What seems at first like a crusade for justice - how could 38 people have done nothing? - soon evolves into a morass of secondary and tertiary questions. Why did no one call out the Times' story? 
NOW Toronto," June 15, 2016",Norman Wilner, Bill's meeting with the adult son of Kitty's murderer shows how any crime taints the lives of everyone it touches. But it also suggests a much more complex work that might have emerged from this material.

NY1-TV," June 10, 2016",Neil Rosen, It's a fascinating documentary that debunks the myth as it tries to separate fact from fiction and in the process offers up an eye opening history lesson.
Brooklyn Magazine," June 6, 2016",Kenji Fujishima," Gripping, painfully personal, and deeply humane"
Newsweek," June 6, 2016",Alexander Nazaryan," The Witness, from first-time filmmaker James Solomon, is full of arresting moments."

NPR," June 2, 2016",Ella Taylor," At its sharpest, The Witness is a careful inquiry into the tricks memory plays, and into how ambiguous events get reshaped into narratives that fit individual and collective needs."
New York Post," June 2, 2016",Farran Smith Nehme," Solomon's documentary goes deep into what we know about the killing, and what - thanks to flawed original reporting in the New York Times - we only think we know."
Wall Street Journal," June 2, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," ""The Witness"" is remarkable for its emotional impact, and its clarity."
The Film Stage," June 2, 2016",Dan Schindel," Rather than intelligently grapple with the complexities, the filmmakers let various people have their say and then call the whole thing done."
