El antepenúltimo mohicano," January 10, 2017",Ignacio Navarro," There is simplicity and verisimilitude, even emotion and suspense, in the development of the plot but its incompleteness takes away much of the repercussion to which it aspires. [Full review in Spanish]"
Washington City Paper," January 2, 2017",Tricia Olszewski," Even though the audience knows how this story ends up, the film does little to shed light on how it truthfully started."

South China Morning Post," November 22, 2016",James Marsh," The film turns a potentially grating one-trick pony into a fascinating snapshot of America, the black experience and two future leaders in the throes of some kind of awakening."
FILMINK (Australia)," November 9, 2016",Sophia Watson," ...super likable, charming and romantic... "
Times (UK)," October 3, 2016",Kevin Maher, A truly horrible TV movie premise -- let's re-create the first romantic date between Barack and Michelle Obama -- is given serious intellectual and emotional heft in the writer-director Richard Tanne's feature debut
Observer (UK)," October 2, 2016",Wendy Ide," Decent performances notwithstanding, there's a cloying quality to some of the scenes that turns the romance of the president and his first lady into something akin to a magazine photo story."
Radio Times," September 30, 2016",Stephen Carty," The film itself is relatively slight, but it's warm, engaging and likeable. In fact, it's a perfect choice for a first date."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," September 29, 2016",Robbie Collin," As a multi-faceted character study - of a couple, a nation, a racial identity - there are surprises around every corner."
Guardian," September 29, 2016",Peter Bradshaw," A gently likable, Linklaterish movie that ideologically conflates romantic excitement with progressive idealism, bringing in some unexpected subtleties."
Empire Magazine," September 29, 2016",Olly Richards," Even if you didn't know what comes next, this story of the first days of the Obamas would still seduce as a sweet, smart romance."
The Straits Times (Singapore)," September 28, 2016",Boon Chan," Viewers get the sense of the couple as two intelligent, idealistic people simply getting to know each other, and they are admirably fleshed out by the actors."
Hollywood Reporter," February 2, 2016",Todd McCarthy, A warm and surprisingly engaging account of the first date of Barack Obama and Michelle Robinson.
Salt Lake Tribune," February 2, 2016",Sean P. Means, Sumpter and newcomer Sawyers inhabit the roles of the future First Couple with easygoing charm.
indieWire," February 2, 2016",Eric Kohn," It may not offer a fresh perspective on the world's most famous couple, but effectively resurrects their initial appeal in public life by uncovering its roots."
Salt Lake City Weekly," January 31, 2016",Scott Renshaw," On some level, this enterprise was doomed from conception."
Vox," January 29, 2016",Gregory Ellwood," If you set aside the famous names and everything we know about these two characters' futures, what's left is a wonderfully crafted romance between a pair of African-American individuals, in a context rarely seen onscreen."
The Playlist," January 29, 2016",Noel Murray," There'd be no movie here if not for who the characters are; but even if Tanne had changed their names, ""Southside With You"" will still be a charmer."
Consequence of Sound," January 29, 2016",Michael Roffman," Richard Tanne has pieced together a lovely story that rises above its novelty premise. Southside with You is a rewarding bite-sized drama, rich with characters that we already know, but also don't really know."
Independent (UK)," January 28, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab, It deserves success. Moreover it should make stars of Sawyers and Sumpter.
Guff.com," January 27, 2016",Fred Topel," Makes Barack a predator to begin with. He is determined to ignore her boundaries. Fortunately, I don't believe that part is true. It is dramatic license and poorly thought out fiction."

Guardian," January 25, 2016",Jordan Hoffman," Southside With You uses our affection for the Obamas to add urgency in the otherwise simple script. We want these two to get together, and we want them to say things like: ""I just want to do more to help out."""
New York Magazine/Vulture," January 25, 2016",Kyle Buchanan," Fortunately, Tanne didn't have to compromise at all with his two charismatic leads: Not only are they dead ringers for Barack and Michelle, but they go beyond impression to deliver something real and human-sized."
RedEye," January 24, 2016",Matt Pais," A romantic, frustrated, compassionate, quietly moving film."
The Daily Beast," January 24, 2016",Jen Yamato, Barack and Michelle's Before Sunrise-esque first date makes for a charming indie romance.

San Jose Mercury News," August 24, 2016",Tony Hicks," In the end, Tanne has given us a movie that is warm and watchable without overdoing it."
L.A. Weekly," August 23, 2016",April Wolfe," Sawyers seems to have absconded with one of the real Obama's discarded cigarette butts and sucked in his Marlboro Red essence, while Sumpter gives a solid but overshadowed performance ..."
Movie Nation," August 23, 2016",Roger Moore," Not a film freighted with destiny, but a charming first-date romance, an affectionate farewell to a classy First Couple. "

Metro," August 22, 2016",Matt Prigge, It's the pleasant movie we deserve after a needlessly contentious eight years.
Slant Magazine," August 22, 2016",Kenji Fujishima," The film may not announce itself as hagiography, but it's hero-worshipful to its core."
New Yorker," August 22, 2016",Richard Brody," This tender, intimate drama has the grand resonance of a historical epic."
Chicago Sun-Times," August 18, 2016",Richard Roeper," Of course this is a stylized -- and yes, on occasion, idealized -- version of the launching point of a lifelong romance between two young Chicago residents who would go on to make history. That's pretty much the point."

The Film Stage," February 19, 2016",Jordan Raup," In a news cycle which can often make our leaders seem like impassive mouthpieces, Southside With You exceeds in humanizing them. "
MTV," February 2, 2016",Crystal Bell," It's a lovely film about two charismatic people walking, talking and slowing falling in love over ice cream."
RogerEbert.com," February 2, 2016",Nick Allen, How often do we see movies where characters are given the freedom to just walk and talk?
Vanity Fair," February 2, 2016",Richard Lawson," Airy and pleasant, a modest film that gets by on charm and aesthetics. We of course know what mighty things await these two young lovebirds, but for its brief spell, Southside With You's first blushes feel plenty big enough."

Minneapolis Star Tribune," August 25, 2016",Colin Covert," While it contains some minor political elements - as does real life - this is at heart a near-perfect date movie, a nonpartisan walking and talking love story."
New York Times," August 25, 2016",Manohla Dargis," Mr. Tanne has clearly made a close study of his real-life inspirations, yet his movie is soon hostage to the couple's history. His characters feel on loan and, despite his actors, eventually make for dull company ..."

Austin Chronicle," August 25, 2016",Steve Davis," As the one-day POTUS and first lady, Sawyers and Sumpter capture the familiar essence of this now well-known couple without impersonating them, imagining them with a fresh perspective about who they were long before becoming famous."
Rolling Stone," August 25, 2016",Peter Travers," Here's the date movie of the year, about a first 1989 date between Barack Obama (Parker Sawyers) and Michelle Robinson (Tika Sumpter). Both actors are terrific, suggesting the powerhouses they're playing without undue mimickry. "
Brooklyn Magazine," August 25, 2016",Jesse Hassenger," This isn't pure hero worship, either; it's the work of a filmmaker enchanted by his subjects as a couple, not as conduits of history."

RogerEbert.com," August 25, 2016",Odie Henderson, An irresistibly romantic and rousing success. 
Arizona Republic," August 25, 2016",Barbara VanDenburgh," First-time filmmaker Richard Tanne eschews politics and heavy foreshadowing, opting instead to craft a breezy, intimate and tender film about two people making that fateful first connection."
AV Club," August 25, 2016",A.A. Dowd," It's a bit like Before Sunrise, only with the leader of the free world in the Ethan Hawke role."
San Diego Union-Tribune," August 25, 2016",Anders Wright," It's charming, sweet and smart, and it isn't loaded with destiny. Tanne, in his first feature, has found a way to make his point by barely making it at all."
Las Vegas Weekly," August 24, 2016",Josh Bell," An awkward mix of low-key romantic drama and historical foreshadowing, with dialogue that sometimes sounds like the characters reciting their own Wikipedia entries."
NOW Toronto," August 24, 2016",Norman Wilner, Southside With You is a small movie about a big thing -- that moment when two people realize they're going to spend the rest of their lives together.
Washington Post," August 24, 2016",Ann Hornaday, A delightfully low-key portrait that is as universal as it is grounded in a well-chronicled public-private life.
Associated Press," August 24, 2016",Jake Coyle," Nuanced and charming, Southside With You is a sunny, strolling odyssey through African-American life in 1989, filtered through two future icons as they navigate the world around them and their place in it."
TheWrap," August 24, 2016",Sam Adams," One might question why a simple first-date story needs to involve the future president and first lady, but its near-total lack of precursors suggest that if it weren't about one of the most famous black couples, it would likely not have been made at all."
TIME Magazine," August 24, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," As a work of imagination inspired by fact, the film shimmers with warmth."
Chicago Tribune," August 24, 2016",Michael Phillips," Sawyers and Sumpter ... [are] better than the writing, which follows its diagram and lays out the conflicts and personality differences very, very neatly."
San Francisco Chronicle," August 24, 2016",Mick LaSalle," ""Southside With You"" proves once and for all that a romantic film doesn't rely on suspense. We know these people are getting together. What holds us to our seats is wondering how it will happen."
CNN.com," August 24, 2016",Brian Lowry," Nicely conveys a broader, more intimate portrait of the First Couple, the movie probably would have been enriched if Tanne hadn't hemmed himself in so much with the conceit and instead traced more of the early stages of their courtship."
New York Observer," August 26, 2016",Oliver Jones," For a film with relatively modest intentions, Southside With You can stir up some epic and opposing waves of emotion."

Kansas City Star," August 25, 2016",Robert W. Butler," ""Southside With You"" is a terrific film - funny, romantic, respectful without being stuffy and, yes, inspiring."
Seattle Weekly," August 25, 2016",Robert Horton," It's like an extended version of a convention video, crafted to please the faithful and maybe haul in a few uncommiteds."
Reeling Reviews," August 25, 2016",Robin Clifford, The actors prove their ability to make the jump to lead roles and Richard Tanne is off to a great start as a filmmaker of note.
Tribune News Service," August 25, 2016",Katie Walsh," One wouldn't quite say this date movie is political, but this deeply personal portrayal of the President and First Lady is inherently political -- asserting their humanity and the specific life experiences that brought them to the White House."
Beliefnet," August 25, 2016",Nell Minow," Utterly witty, charming, and captivating ."
Philadelphia Inquirer," August 25, 2016",Tirdad Derakhshani," A deceptively simple, remarkably lean, and well-paced indie pic about the young Barack Obama's first date with the young first-lady-to-be Michelle Robinson."
Reeling Reviews," August 25, 2016",Laura Clifford," ...a delight from start to finish. As they begin to fall in love, so do we."
NPR," August 25, 2016",Andrew Lapin," Southside With You has a claim to relevance for anyone who was moved even a little bit by the inauguration, or, almost 20 years earlier, by Do the Right Thing."
Mark Reviews Movies," August 25, 2016",Mark Dujsik, The point is not what they will become but ... the specific connection between these two people at this particular moment in time.
Blu-ray.com," August 25, 2016",Brian Orndorf," Only a chosen few know how accurate the movie is, but to Tanne's credit, most of the effort feels like a documentary."
New York Post," August 25, 2016",Kyle Smith," The mollifying figure on display here bears little resemblance to the hyperpartisan president Obama turned out to be, but it's sweet to remember things could have been different."
One Guy's Opinion," August 25, 2016",Frank Swietek, Tanne's imagining of the first couple's first date should prove both sweet and surprisingly revealing.
Den of Geek," August 25, 2016",Don Kaye," [It's] breezy, warm and romantic, if ultimately somewhat slight. In other words, the complete opposite of the past eight years."
Boston Globe," August 25, 2016",Peter Keough," How pleasant to watch a subtle, sweet-natured romantic tale about Barack and Michelle Obama devoid of the partisan rancor and rhetoric of the ongoing presidential campaign."
Toronto Star," August 25, 2016",Linda Barnard," Tanne presents a Richard Linklater-style examination of a day and evening together, where two people in their 20s - she a lawyer at a downtown firm and he a summer associate at the same shop - slowly come to know each other."
Los Angeles Times," August 25, 2016",Kenneth Turan, A sweet date-night movie about a date that wasn't really a date. Until it was.
St. Paul Pioneer Press," August 25, 2016",Chris Hewitt (St. Paul)," Unlike the vast majority of supposed love stories, ""Southside With You"" is a romance that makes it clear why the lovers are falling for each other."
San Diego Reader," August 27, 2016",Matthew Lickona," President Obama's fans and haters alike will find something to enjoy in this slightly stilted yet oddly fascinating account of the Harvard law student's first date with Michelle Robinson, the woman who would eventually become his wife."
The Young Folks," August 26, 2016",Donald Strohman, Southside with You is unmistakably worthy of a second date.
L.A. Biz," August 26, 2016",Annlee Ellingson," A socially charged and robustly intellectual love story, but a love story nonetheless."
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," August 26, 2016",Philip Martin, A sweet and minor bit of hagiography ...
People Magazine," August 26, 2016",Tom Gliatto," Sawyers is uncannily good as Obama while avoiding plain mimicry. He's the proverbial young man in a hurry, only too cool to let you see him sprint. Sumpter has the trickier, tougher role (the first lady probably knows the feeling). "
Screen It!," August 26, 2016",Jim Judy," The joy in experiencing the movie is simply watching two people getting to know each other, with all of the awkward moments, little sparks and such that occur on first dates. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
HitFix," August 26, 2016",Drew McWeeny," Southside With You is quietly romantic, but more than that, it burns with a deep sense of optimism. "
Pajiba," August 26, 2016",Kristy Puchko," Southside with You stumbles like so many could-be great biopics, by being overly reverential to its subjects."
The Atlantic," August 26, 2016",David Sims," A gentle, rose-tinted piece of political nostalgia-one that glances at the divisions in American society, but still casts a optimistic view toward whatever's next."
SSG Syndicate," August 26, 2016",Susan Granger," Subtly sweet, a heartfelt date movie - aimed specifically at an audience that relishes fictionalized famous romances, like Jacqueline Bouvier/John Kennedy & Prince Charles/Diana Spencer. "
National Post," August 26, 2016",Chris Knight," Southside With You, while sweet and never less than reverent with its subjects, is hardly one of the great on-screen romances. It's also remarkably devoid of tension."
Boston Herald," August 26, 2016",Stephen Schaefer," Southside gives us the background and back stories of this bright, attractive, ambitious couple."
Cinemalogue.com," August 26, 2016",Todd Jorgenson, ... scores by keeping its focus simple and its ambitions modest.
"Deseret News, Salt Lake City"," August 26, 2016",Josh Terry," Southside With You is more than a carefree portrait of young love, but how much more may depend on your ability to keep your political perspectives at arm's length."

Combustible Celluloid," August 26, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson, A surprisingly delightful little treat. 
"Capital Times (Madison, WI)"," August 26, 2016",Rob Thomas," One of the surprising strengths of writer-director Richard Tanne's delightful film is that it doesn't rely on our knowledge that, someday, these two twenty-somethings we're watching will become president and first lady. "
Globe and Mail," August 26, 2016",Barry Hertz, It's breezy and cute and will do absolutely nothing to sway anyone's politics. Which is exactly the point.
Detroit News," August 26, 2016",Adam Graham," ""Southside With You"" plays like ""Before Sunrise"" if those two characters had a really epic epilogue."
Total Film," September 27, 2016",Matt Maytum," First-time filmmaker Richard Tanne conjures an effective sense of time and place -- Chicago, 1989 -- and the leads are a real find, radiating authority, charm and chemistry. "
EntertainmentTell," September 27, 2016",Stephen Silver," A charming, cute, partially fictionalized dramatization of the Obamas' first date- but the film's centerpiece scene fails (Splice Today) "
Little White Lies," September 27, 2016",Matthew Eng," Stumbles occasionally, but still manages to cast a hushed spell that never entirely fades."
Time Out," September 26, 2016",Dave Calhoun," A small, successful sketch of now-great lives."

PopMatters," September 9, 2016",Argun Ulgen," Southside With You transcends ""date"" film terrain to a nuanced character study of the onset of the United States' future presidential family."
"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," September 8, 2016",John Beifuss," They attend 'Do the Right Thing,' and Spike Lee's provocative movie mirrors, in expressionistic fashion, the hours-long debate over racial identity, social responsibility and ""Afrocentric"" art that runs through Barack and Michelle's day together."
Cinemixtape," September 3, 2016",J. Olson," A tremendous walk-and-talk romance that would work just fine devoid of context. But it's that context that puts it over the top - into ""best of the year"" territory."

Newsweek," August 31, 2016",Zach Schonfeld, This is a small-scale romance with small ambitions but fairly big heart.
Willamette Week," August 31, 2016",Lauren Terry," Tanne focuses on showing who they are, not telling us through wordy dialogue. By filling in the blanks with the political landscape, the scope of this one date night broadens to capture the spirit of Chicago in the summer of 1989."
