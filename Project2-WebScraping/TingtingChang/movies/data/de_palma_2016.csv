East Bay Express," December 27, 2016",Kelly Vance, [His] candid commentary reveals him to be a cultivated man with a gut-bucket sensibility trying to make mass-market commercial hits but who rarely finds the right combination of style and substance. At least we now know why he did what he did.

Total Film," September 27, 2016",James Mottram," The man himself is the sole interviewee -- a risky strategy but one that pays off here; whether dissing his Obsession star Cliff Robertson or conceding mistakes on The Bonfire of the Vanities, he's illuminating, hilarious company."

Observer (UK)," September 25, 2016",Wendy Ide," De Palma's work is explored in his own words, and his words only, uncluttered by talking heads and critical evaluations. And frankly, De Palma is such an entertaining and open raconteur, his words are all you need."

Consequence of Sound," October 5, 2015",Blake Goble," Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow's De Palma is a cineaste's dream. Better yet, it's like getting a minor in film studies, with De Palma as the the candid, mensch-y professor."
Guardian," October 1, 2015",Jordan Hoffman, So many documentaries about artists just want you to accept that their subject is an innovator. De Palma breaks it down and shows you why he is.
ColeSmithey.com," September 27, 2015",Cole Smithey," More edited than directed, ""De Palma"" is rightfully content to let the director of such classics as ""Carrie"" and ""Scarface"" tell the story of his career."
The Playlist," September 12, 2015",Jessica Kiang," ""De Palma"" is a joy: a hit of garrulous cinephile cocaine so pure you want to do a Tony Montana, fall face-first into it and inhale it all in one go."
Times (UK)," September 10, 2015",Wendy Ide," In this highly entertaining documentary, directed by Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow, De Palma mounts a robust defence of the more contentious moments of his career, while also taking a few well-aimed potshots at the current state of the film industry."

Reeling Reviews," June 10, 2016",Laura Clifford, This documentary is so endlessly fascinating as DePalma talks about every aspect of filmmaking from costume to camera shots to casting that one can only hope at least several of the hours left on the cutting room floor end up on a blu ray release.

Chicago Reader," June 23, 2016",J. R. Jones," Paltrow and Baumbach simply walk De Palma through his filmography and collect his best stories. But this systematic approach has a nice leveling effect in that his more obscure, offbeat projects get as much attention as his signature films."
