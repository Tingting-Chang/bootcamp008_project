El Pais (Spain)," January 24, 2017",Jordi Costa," A film that has a protagonist with a conventional dramatic arc, but everything that surrounds this predictable characterization is pure imaginative fire, served with devilish dominion of the filmic space. [Full review in Spanish]"

Combustible Celluloid," January 19, 2017",Jeffrey M. Anderson," Often it's the simplest ideas that are the most ingenious. Get this one: zombies... on a train. That's it. Ingenious. And, amazingly, the South Korean film 'Train to Busan' gets just about everything right with this scenario. "
Seanax.com," January 18, 2017",Sean Axmaker," This is viral horror with an organic purity and a cinematic distinction to it, and in its own bloody, diseased way, it's a thing of beauty."
The Blu Spot," January 16, 2017",Jeff Beck," Yeon Sang-ho's Train to Busan may not take the zombie subgenre in any new directions, but it still manages to deliver an engaging, tense, and often thrilling experience that fans are sure to get a kick out of. "
Otroscines.com," January 10, 2017",Diego Battle, An entertaining film for the lovers of the cinema of this genre and a lesson of staging where neither the vertigo nor the visual effects conspire against the understanding and effectiveness of the plot. [Full review in Spanish]
ArtsHub," January 8, 2017",Sarah Ward, There's little about the feature that follows that's unexpected... but there's also little that fails to infect viewers with tension-riddled enthusiasm either. 
San Diego Reader," January 6, 2017",Matthew Lickona," Director Yeon Sang-ho makes smart use of the cramped quarters, and while it's true that his zombies' abilities tend to vary according to the requirements of the moment, it's easy to overlook amid the onslaught of action and emotion."
El Mundo (Spain)," January 5, 2017",Alberto Luchini," A film that is presented as a hyperrealistic comic that plays with all the clichés of the subgenre, to subvert and reinvent it. [Full review in Spanish]"

Proceso," December 19, 2016",Fausto Ponce," If there's something to complain about Train to Busan is that suddenly becomes cheesy, but even thought it's an excellent horror movie and never collapses. [Full review in Spanish]"

We Got This Covered," July 23, 2016",Matt Donato," Train To Busan is so much more than ""Zombies On A Train."""
Flick Filosopher," July 23, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson, This South Korean hit is an oozy doozy of a horror-thriller; confidently spins out its own unique - and breathless - take on familiar genre tropes.
"The Stranger (Seattle, WA)"," July 22, 2016",Andrew Wright," Whatever your current stance on brain-eating, this is a keeper."
The Playlist," July 22, 2016",Kevin Jagernauth," What Train To Busan truly needs, and disappointingly lacks, is heart."
RogerEbert.com," July 22, 2016",Brian Tallerico," The most purely entertaining zombie film in some time, finding echoes of George Romero's and Danny Boyle's work, but delivering something unique for an era in which kindness to others seems more essential than ever."
Los Angeles Times," July 22, 2016",Robert Abele," ""Train to Busan"" is really a feast for the scary, gymnastic bit players: contorting their bodies, baring teeth and running full bore. On this express, they're a first-class menace indeed."
New York Times," July 21, 2016",Jeannette Catsoulis," Sprinting right out of the gate, the director, Yeon Sang-ho, dives gleefully into a sandbox of spilled brains and smug entitlement."
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," July 21, 2016",Cary Darling," Breathless and brutal, the film is akin to someone smashing together 28 Days Later with Snowpiercer and then convincing Mad Max's George Miller to help out on some of the action scenes."
Las Vegas Weekly," July 21, 2016",Josh Bell," A big, effects-driven thriller with some very effective action sequences."
NOW Toronto," July 20, 2016",Norman Wilner, Yeon Sang-ho's Train To Busan is the best fast-zombie picture since the Dawn Of The Dead remake. It's also an awful lot of fun.

Slant Magazine," July 17, 2016",Ed Gonzalez," When divorced of message-mongering, the film's scare tactics are among the most distinctive that the zombie canon has ever seen."
SciFiNow," May 26, 2016",Katherine McLaughlin," Train To Busan is a viciously entertaining ride for the most part, but it's bookended with a needless introductory sequence and an extremely cheesy ending that borders on comical. Removal of these flaccid parts off would have made it a slicker journey."
Screen International," May 15, 2016",Jason Bechervaise," An entertaining ride, as well as providing political commentary when it overtly references the Korean government's response to the MERS virus alongside commenting on the country's class system."

Total Film," October 24, 2016",Matt Glasby," More multilayered Stephen King epic than raw Romero, Train to Busan bowls you over with brains, guts and heart."
Time Out," October 22, 2016",Joshua Rothkopf," Less effectively, the movie has some rather obvious social comeuppances in mind and you'll groan at the contrivances. Just wait a few minutes and you'll get to the next action sequence, in which Yeon is more confident."
Hindustan Times," October 21, 2016",Rohan Naahar," Train to Busan is one of the best surprises of the year; a redemption tale that reminds us how close we are to losing our humanity, but also the compassion we are capable of. All aboard."
Cinéfiloz," October 11, 2016",Emmanuel Báez," A film that offers a crude and critical view of man's humanity in moments of despair, talking about selfishness and companionship in adverse situations. [Full review in Spanish]"
Projected Figures," October 7, 2016",Anton Bitel," Here both zombies and train come to symbolise the blind forward momentum of an all-consuming capitalism, unchecked by the brake of any social principle. "

The Straits Times (Singapore)," August 3, 2016",Yip Wai Yee," Most memorable of this sad lot is not leading man Gong Yoo's cliched dapper businessman, but his scenestealing daughter, played by a fantastic Kim Soo An, 10, who never goes overboard even when she has to bawl in complete fear."
Cinema Crazed," July 26, 2016",Felix Vasquez Jr.," It's a vicious and blood soaked zombie film with heart, humanity, and rich characterization. "

AV Club," December 1, 2016",Charles Bramesco," A zombie movie content not to aspire to any loftier subtextual readings needs little more than a skilled choreographer of action, and there's plenty of evidence that this film had one in Yeon."
Concrete Playground," November 29, 2016",Sarah Ward," An action-packed, zombie-focused dissection of class clashes and today's me-first mindset that its formulaic concept won't quite prepare you for."
El antepenúltimo mohicano," November 10, 2016",José Martín," An honest film, which leaves no room for deception or attempts to innovate the genre, putting all its energy into a frenetic roller coaster of action, full of extreme situations and the right doses of gore. [Full review in Spanish]"

Sacramento News & Review," November 10, 2016",Daniel Barnes," There's nothing original in the content, and the band of survivors contains every zombie-apocalypse movie archetype imaginable, but it's such a fun, fast, tightly crafted genre film that you could care less."
Nerdist," November 4, 2016",Kristy Puchko, Train to Busan is an intense and intimate thrill ride that plays like Snakes on a Plane meets 28 Days Later.

Times (UK)," October 27, 2016",Kate Muir," The zombie movie takes the bullet train in Train to Busan, a smart horror that contrasts the hyper-cleanliness and efficiency of South Korean life with bloody, neck-biting chaos."
Scotsman," October 27, 2016",Alistair Harkness," Sang-ho can't quite resist a last-minute lurch towards sentimentality, but for the most part he keeps this moveable feast for the undead on track with relentless and bloody carnage."
