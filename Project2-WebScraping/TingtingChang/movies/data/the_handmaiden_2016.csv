Laramie Movie Scope," February 8, 2017",Robert Roten," Perhaps not since 'Pulp Fiction' have I seen such a cleverly convoluted story woven together from different perspectives. Act two and three pile on more layers of detail, adding more richness to the story. "
Seanax.com," January 27, 2017",Sean Axmaker," ... has the look of a lavish period drama, the elegance of an arthouse film, the complex plotting of an ingenious caper that only the movies could sustain, and the sex of a classy softcore picture."
Winnipeg Free Press," January 12, 2017",Alison Gillmor," Like everything by Korean auteur Park Chan-wook, The Handmaiden is meticulously controlled in form and bonkers-crazy in content. That's a heady combo."
Creative Loafing," January 10, 2017",Matt Brunson," Intelligent, absorbing and erotic."
Cinema em Cena," January 8, 2017",Pablo Villaça," It combines Chan-wook's best obsessions: his aesthetic virtuosity, his dark sense of humor, his interest of sex as an unstoppable force and his characters penchant for vengeance. [Full review in Portuguese.]"

Legion of Leia," December 29, 2016",Witney Seibold," A wonderfully twisted web of rococo theatrics, melodramatic twists, and deliciously lurid storytelling."
East Bay Express," December 27, 2016",Kelly Vance, Even the most sensational sequences in The Handmaiden fail to do much more than disrupt the plot line. 
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 17, 2016",Tim Brayton," The ending doesn't live up to what precedes it, but while it's working, this is some of the most captivating and effective cinema of 2016, or indeed any of the last several years."

LarsenOnFilm," December 14, 2016",Josh Larsen," ...the more we unfold of its mystery, the deeper we fall into suspicion, desire, and depravity."
Film School Rejects," December 13, 2016",Rob Hunter, A relentlessly beautiful film and one of the decade's most exhilarating and satisfying love stories.
Newcity," December 13, 2016",Ray Pride," The triangle that ensues is voraciously sexual, unabashedly fetishistic. And the crosses, and the double-crosses, and the twists-within-twists are almost as carnal in their voluptuousness. "
The Young Folks," December 12, 2016",Gary Shannon," The Handmaiden is Park Chan-wook's most inspirited and uplifting film, celebrating the liberation of the mind above all else."
El Pais (Spain)," December 9, 2016",Jordi Costa, An intricate story that mixes Gothic melodrama with the folklore of revenge and the libertine novel. [Full review in Spanish]

Blog de cine," December 2, 2016",Mikel Zorrilla, An excellent film that knows how to use the surprises to elevate everything else instead of compensating for possible shortcomings. [Full review in Spanish]

BuzzFeed News," May 26, 2016",Alison Willmore," The Handmaiden is sexy and twisty and so compelling despite this, lodging itself in the points of view of two women who are constantly underestimated by the men around them, and who learn to take advantage of how they're misjudged."

Vanity Fair," May 20, 2016",Richard Lawson," An intelligent, funny erotic thriller, The Handmaiden seems destined for some kind of American remake... that isn't likely to live up to Park's invention, wit, and daring. See this one first, if you can."
AV Club," May 20, 2016",Mike D'Angelo," Starts out looking as if it'll be a deeply serious (and seriously depressing) tale of a Korean ""comfort woman"" forced to service the occupying Japanese military. After about five minutes of grandiose solemnity, Park drops the charade."

AV Club," September 27, 2016",Katie Rife," Female leads Kim Min-hee and Kim Tae-ri are both standouts, conveying the complexity of the film's multi-layered con games with subtle changes of facial expression and tone of voice."
Film Comment Magazine," September 26, 2016",Violet Lucca," The love scenes between Sook-hee and Hideko are beautiful, explicit, and funny, displaying a candor about sexuality that's not intended to shock but to draw you in-it's the most normal thing about this flamboyant, acerbic film."

NOW Toronto," September 9, 2016",Susan G. Cole," Park goes all-out in series of gratuitous, nearly explicit, sex scenes. That's not in itself such a bad thing, but when he opts for a severely sadistic sequence near the end, he goes too far."

Bangkok Post," August 12, 2016",Melalin Mahavongtrakul," Park's adaptation of [Fingersmith] has its own unpredictability. And while it's still largely the same story, there are points where this new interpretation takes its own direction and charges ahead without so much as a look behind."
FILMINK (Australia)," July 31, 2016",Travis Johnson, ... the film practically drips with fetishistic imagery and detail.
The Straits Times (Singapore)," July 6, 2016",John Lui," One part Gothic fantasy, one part softcore thriller... blurs the line between highbrow and sexploitation so skilfully you will be left wondering if you just watched a big-budget skin flick or a particularly smutty arthouse production."
South China Morning Post," June 28, 2016",James Mottram," Billed by some as a lurid lesbian potboiler when it premiered in Cannes, The Handmaiden is much more lavish than this reductive description suggests."
Wall Street Journal," October 20, 2016",John Anderson," Like a Victorian settee infested with vipers, Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden mixes the elegant and the dangerous, the refined and the venomous; it affects refinement and crawls on its belly. It's also apt to bite."

TheWrap," October 20, 2016",Robert Abele," Eschewing his usual modus operandi for the rollicking tension of active kink, Park finds a percolating balance between sensuality and sin, and it might just win him admirers beyond the usual bloodthirsty fanboys."
Los Angeles Times," October 20, 2016",Justin Chang," A teasingly witty and elegant puzzle-box of a thriller whose pleasures are rooted not in visceral shock but in narrative surprise, and which wisely opts to seduce rather than pulverize its audience."
Metro," October 20, 2016",Matt Prigge," The tasteful and the trashy make acrobatic bedfellows in Park Chan-wook's ""The Handmaiden,"" a movie so assured it can do a sex scene where the camerawork is as arresting as the bodies engaged in combat. "
Slate," October 20, 2016",Laura Miller," Both actresses deliver vivid, tender performances; they generate all the movie's fire, but they're obliged to do it inside a chilly, ritualized framework, the aesthetic equivalent of a softcore mausoleum."

SF Weekly," October 27, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," While The Handmaiden is an empirically gorgeous movie no matter what's happening on screen, it also has no business being two-and-a-half hours long. It loses its momentum in the third act -- but lordy, those first two acts."
