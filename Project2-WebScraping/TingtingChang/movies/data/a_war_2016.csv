Salt Lake Tribune," December 31, 2016",Sean P. Means," With intense and contained performances, particularly by Asbaek and Novotny, A War depicts a moral dilemma that is as complicated as it frustrating."
Sunday Times (UK)," December 19, 2016",Edward Porter," [In its early stages,] it is absorbing and occasionally tense. Its second half, however, is disappointing."
MovieMail," December 13, 2016",Mike McCahill," If A War can't, at the last, land the gutpunch of its predecessor, it scores points enough to provide a worthy watch -- and to confirm its writer-director as among the preeminent agonised consciences in contemporary world cinema."
Movie Habit," December 12, 2016",Robert Denerstein," Deeply troubling and appropriately ambiguous, A War is a fine and sobering movie."
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 5, 2016",Tim Brayton," Pilou Asbæk is extraordinary, a bundle of tense, scared misery and self-hatred."
Brooklyn Magazine," November 29, 2016",Benjamin Mercer," In human terms, A War's moral calculus might seem a bit off, but the point certainly hits home -- in the age of ""precision"" remote-controlled weaponry and guerrilla ambushes, war crimes have become all too easy to commit."
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," November 11, 2016",Dennis Schwartz, Observant Afghan war drama.
RTÉ (Ireland)," July 26, 2016",Harry Guerin," [The] performances, and the flawed humanity they so expertly convey, stay with you long after the closing credits, as does the question of what you would do if placed in the same situation as their characters."
4:3," June 13, 2016",Conor Bateman," With A War, Lindholm is once again content working in a sparse visual mode that leaves room for his performers to inject some passion into the film. "
Movie Talk," May 15, 2016",Jason Best," There is no Hollywood heroism or sentimentality here, and the ethically ambiguous courtroom scenes that climax the film provide no easy resolution, either."
Cleveland Plain Dealer," May 12, 2016",Joanna Connors," This is an extraordinary film, not to be missed."
East Bay Express," March 21, 2016",Kelly Vance, The scenario peters out in the last third and leaves us wondering.
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," March 17, 2016",Cary Darling, The haunting and stark A War may be [Tobias Lindholm's] most striking and effective work yet
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," March 11, 2016",Hilary A White," [Director Tobias Lindholm's] cool Scandinavian temperament is at work again in A War, a taut drama that feels genetically linked to A Hijacking, and not just in the understatement of its title."
Clarín," March 10, 2016",Pablo A. Scholz, A great film with big morality dilemmas. [Full review in Spanish]
"City Pages, Minneapolis/St. Paul"," March 9, 2016",Michael Nordine," So comprehensive in its approach, deconstructing the pivotal moment from every possible perspective, as to instill in viewers the impression of being among the jurors presiding over this case."
"Capital Times (Madison, WI)"," March 4, 2016",Rob Thomas," ""A War"" is a movie with little actual combat and none of the war genre conventions we've come to expect. "
Austin Chronicle," March 3, 2016",Marjorie Baumgarten," A quietly searing drama about morality, priorities, and absolute truth."
The Young Folks," March 3, 2016",Jon Espino," The story is only as compelling as the people who keep it moving forward. Pilou Asbæk and Tuva Novotny are both soldiers in their own respect, trying to keep evil at bay. "
The Patriot Ledger," February 27, 2016",Al Alexander," War may be hell, but Lindholm stirringly shows us that it's also indelibly human."
Little White Lies," January 6, 2016",David Jenkins," Just when you think you've got a handle on where the movie's going, there's a knock on the door and everything changes."
The List," January 4, 2016",James Mottram," This is a real 'What would you do?' movie, the sort you'll be turning over in your mind for days after, and the result is first-rate."
The Robot's Voice," November 14, 2015",Luke Y. Thompson," ...whether you're a dyed-in-the-wool troop supporter no matter what, or a hardcore anti-warrior, you can watch and understand why Pedersen does what he feels he has to do"
Film Journal International," February 11, 2016",Ethan Alter," While it builds to an intriguing thematic question, the dramatic situation at the heart of Tobias Lindholm's war-themed procedural is a little too open-and-shut."
Wall Street Journal," February 11, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," Microcosms don't feel micro to those who inhabit them. Such is the case in ""A War,"" a small-scale drama of outsize power."
Film Comment Magazine," February 11, 2016",Michael Sragow," This movie rescues the concept of ""the fog of war"" from cliché and overuse. "
AV Club," February 11, 2016",Mike D'Angelo," The film is low-key and evenhanded to a fault, resisting opportunities for melodrama at every turn; it radiates intelligence and fairness, which, while admirable, don't exactly inspire a strong emotional response."
New York Post," February 10, 2016",Farran Smith Nehme," It's a pity that ""A War"" will be seen by only a fraction of those who turned out for the pieties and yowling stereotypes of ""American Sniper."""
Metro," February 10, 2016",Matt Prigge," Shares a lot of DNA with any number of serious (which is to say downer) looks at what it's like to fight. We might even let our guard down, which is when it really attacks."
Village Voice," February 9, 2016",Alan Scherstuhl," A scrupulous, unglamorized examination of battlefield decision-making - and its potentially devastating impacts, both there and back home."

Observer (UK)," January 10, 2016",Mark Kermode," Ultimately, this is a film about guilt, grief and accountability, the chaos of war clashing with the sterility of an after-the-fact trial as the boundaries between blame and bravery are blurred beyond resolution."
Times (UK)," January 8, 2016",Kevin Maher," Propulsive action drama meets philosophical rumination in A War, a superlative Danish take on the Middle East-set soldier story."
Independent (UK)," January 8, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab," It works both as a war movie and, in its latter scenes, as a finely calibrated courtroom drama."
The Arts Desk," January 8, 2016",Tom Birchenough," There's an understated naturalness that speaks powerfully throughout, both from the leads and from the supporting cast."
Flick Filosopher," January 8, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson, Emotionally tense and smartly nuanced exploration of an ordinary man under extraordinary pressure; a war movie for how we have redefined war today.
London Evening Standard," January 8, 2016",Charlotte O'Sullivan," Like the anti-war saga In the Valley of Elah, A War explores a misuse of power that has horrific consequences. What's different is that here the crime takes place under our noses and, even more disturbingly, feels justified."
Radio Times," January 7, 2016",Trevor Johnston," Lindholm's film has few easy answers to deliver, just strong performances, and a gripping, engaged approach to thorny contemporary issues."
Daily Mail (UK)," January 7, 2016",Brian Viner," It's an intense and at times harrowing drama, tautly written and directed, and brilliantly acted."
Guardian," January 7, 2016",Peter Bradshaw," Standard-issue liberal guilt and hand-wringingly uninteresting dilemmas are the order of the day, with no real surprises or challenges."
Empire Magazine," January 7, 2016",Olly Richards," It's a riveting, complex film that asks one simple question: what do you do when there's no right answer?"
Daily Telegraph (UK)," January 7, 2016",Tim Robey," A film of two halves - one a frazzling visit to Afghanistan's Helmand crossfire in 2003, the second a kind of Hutton Inquiry into the first."
Time Out," January 6, 2016",Anna Smith, A terse tale of men in crisis.
Vox," February 18, 2016",Todd VanDerWerff, [A War] is not a masterpiece. It's as messy and uneven as real life. But messiness is inherent to why A War works. 
SF Weekly," February 18, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," A pattern seems to be emerging as Tobias Lindholm follows up A Hijacking with the equally direct and unsentimental A War, another examination of men under heavy stress."
Arizona Republic," February 18, 2016",Barbara VanDenburgh," The craftsmanship of ""A War"" is unimpeachable. Tight shots and jittery camera work give the film an immediate, intimate feel."
Washington Post," February 18, 2016",Michael O'Sullivan," Like his 2012 film ""A Hijacking,"" Danish writer-director Tobias Lindholm's drama ""A War"" explores the theme of moral compromise with an uncomfortably astringent honesty."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," February 18, 2016",Colin Covert," Writer/director Tobias Lindholm's compelling thriller offers sharp-focus snapshots of conflict on the ground for its first hour, and in a military courtroom for the second."
San Francisco Chronicle," February 18, 2016",Walter V. Addiego," The film is cleanly made and moves quickly, which enhances its effectiveness. It raises moral issues that simply can't be addressed too often."
The New Republic," February 17, 2016",Gwyneth Kelly," A War is the best possible title for Denmark's Oscar nominee, which, scrubbed of the patriotism and politics that define American war films, transcends the war in the Middle East to interrogate the struggle of all conflicted decisions."
Film International," February 16, 2016",Elias Savada, The film's a solid piece of work examining the moral difficulties of war.
New Yorker," February 15, 2016",Richard Brody," The movie is memorable and draining, but ""Full Metal Jacket"" it is not."
NYC Movie Guru," February 14, 2016",Avi Offer," Powerful, gripping, provocative and heartfelt. It's a thinking person's war film."
Cinemalogue.com," February 12, 2016",Todd Jorgenson," Although the territory is familiar, director Tobias Lindholm offers a fresh approach that's both gritty and provocative."
TheWrap," February 12, 2016",Alonso Duralde," While most Hollywood movies are so afraid of moral ambiguity that you'd think the old-school Production Code was in effect, here's a story that eschews easy answers and forces audiences to examine their own consciences while the characters do likewise. "
CinemaBlend.com," February 12, 2016",Eric Eisenberg," A War never shies away from the true horror of its central subject matter, and succeeds in feeling visceral and emotionally powerful."
Entertainment Weekly," February 12, 2016",Joe McGovern," Novotny is a striking screen presence; a fresher film would have told the story entirely from her perspective. But instead, we see the one we're used to - and a wobbly one at that."
Spirituality and Practice," February 12, 2016",Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat," A drama that raises ethically telling questions about war, conscience, compassion, and heroism."
The Playlist," February 12, 2016",Jessica Kiang," Trapped in volatile, stressful and violent situations with ""A War,"" and it is a tremendous, provocative cap to that unofficial trilogy."
RogerEbert.com," February 12, 2016",Glenn Kenny," ""A War,"" as tough to watch as it can be, is an extremely rewarding and disquieting experience."

New York Times," February 11, 2016",Nicolas Rapold," For Denmark, the film, an Oscar nominee in the foreign-language category, might seem quietly radical, but Mr. Lindholm errs too far on the side of quiet."
Reeling Reviews," February 11, 2016",Laura Clifford," Without judgement, we're shown how rules of engagement, both followed and broken, can lead to the loss of innocent lives. "
"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," February 26, 2016",Robert Horton, It doesn't so much bring new ideas to light as confirm our worst suspicions.
San Diego Reader," February 26, 2016",Matthew Lickona, Writer-director Tobias Lindholm's latest is a microcosmic and finely wrought war story in which everyone has their reasons.
Mark Reviews Movies," February 26, 2016",Mark Dujsik, The problems of A War are primarily ones of in the way [Tobias Lindholm] frames this situation.

Detroit News," February 26, 2016",Tom Long," Ethically challenging and occasionally brutal, ""A War"" explores the dicey nature of decisions made in the heat of battle and the grim consequences that may follow."
San Diego Union-Tribune," February 25, 2016",Anders Wright, The movie is adept in both the fog of war and the fog of law that follows it. It poses complicated questions and refuses to offer easy answers.
Seattle Times," February 25, 2016",John Hartl," It's intense without becoming simplistic, and the actors stay focused as the viewpoints shift."
Willamette Week," February 25, 2016",Zach Middleton," While the film is for the most part lively and well-crafted, the characters lose detail as the story blurs toward a conclusion. In the end, it's left to the audience to make meaning of what's just happened."
Chicago Reader," February 25, 2016",J. R. Jones," Only in the second half, after the commander is accused of a war crime and returns home to stand trial, do these two worlds merge and their respective realities clash, with sobering results."

Boston Globe," February 25, 2016",Peter Keough, [It] may ... be among the best war movies of all time.
St. Louis Post-Dispatch," February 25, 2016",Calvin Wilson," ""A War"" is an emotionally complex film that doesn't play by the rules of mainstream cinema."
Newcity," February 24, 2016",Ray Pride," Toils again in a stripped-down, situational urgency suggested by his titles: sleek yet functional, sometimes jagged yet classically composed, vital yet keeping the temperature below the melodramatic range. "
leonardmaltin.com," February 23, 2016",Leonard Maltin," A War pays service to all sides: Danish soldiers, Afghan inhabitants, and the families... Straightforward and absorbing storytelling..."
The Film Stage," February 21, 2016",Tommaso Tocci, So precise and inquisitive that there's not even a hint of padding in sight.
New York Magazine/Vulture," February 21, 2016",David Edelstein," A War confirms the darkest, least mentionable secret of traumatized veterans-that what haunts them is not just what they saw and what was done unto them, but what they did."
Christian Science Monitor," February 19, 2016",Peter Rainer," The courtroom machinations are skillfully played, but here, too, there is a certain stolidity."

Blu-ray.com," February 18, 2016",Brian Orndorf," Again, Lindholm guides tremendous performances and establishes a strong thematic presence, with the questions ""A War"" raises forcing the viewer to confront painful realities of combat and the cost of military service. "
