Film Threat," February 6, 2017",Anthony Ray Bench," The Lobster just loses its charm at a certain point, and nothing interesting or exciting happens with the characters."
Laramie Movie Scope," January 19, 2017",Robert Roten," This movie is like science fiction, except that in it, human nature is altered in some fundamental ways. If you are a romantic like me, you might find this painful to watch, but cynics might love it. I really hated this movie."
MetroActive," December 31, 2016",Richard von Busack," You can see what The Lobster is trying to say so clearly that there's never that refreshing possibility of misunderstanding or ambiguity, essential for a real work of genius."
Columbus Alive," December 31, 2016",Brad Keefe," The unabashed strangeness of the whole affair will mean only some audiences need apply. For me, this is easily the most original movie of the year, and it's also one of the best."
NUVO Newsweekly," December 31, 2016",Edward Johnson-Ott," The Lobster is not for everybody. But if you're adventurous and patient, there are ample rewards to be had."
PopMatters," December 28, 2016",Alex Ramon," Alas, the movie loses its assurance in the over-extended second half."
Financial Times," December 27, 2016",Danny Leigh, Part of the joy of Lanthimos's film is seeing in it any degree of subtext you like.
East Bay Express," December 27, 2016",Kelly Vance," Among the recent crop of dystopias, The Lobster is quite possibly unique -- an actors' workshop exercise that relies almost entirely on dialogue and situations instead of kinetic displays of heroism."
Sunday Times (UK)," December 18, 2016",Edward Porter," Like [Lanthimos's] other films, The Lobster invents a world all its own."
Movie Habit," December 12, 2016",Robert Denerstein, Lanthimos wrings emotion out of human interaction in ways that are both bizarre and funny.
Irish Independent," December 5, 2016",Paul Whitington, A delightfully bleak satire set in a dystopian present.
The Herald (Ireland)," December 5, 2016",Chris Wasser," Farrell and Weisz spark off of one another, delivering a convincing and rather touching on-screen partnership."
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 4, 2016",Tim Brayton," Hardly less kind in its satiric attack on the basic emotional pillars of human existence than Lanthimos's last two films, but it adds a veneer of magical realism."
Scene-Stealers.com," September 26, 2016",Eric Melin," Lanthimos makes brutal, incisive points to make about the absurdity of coupling in the first place, much less society's view of what makes a perfect couple."
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," August 26, 2016",Philip Martin," Lanthimos is obviously after bigger game than a black relationship comedy, every detail (even the most horrifying) in the movie contributes to what is becoming Lanthimos' signature tone of heartbreaking hilarity."
rec.arts.movies.reviews," August 15, 2016",David N. Butterworth," ""The Lobster"" peters out about halfway through but regardless, director Lanthimos and co-writer Filippou have constructed a singular and ambitious vision, rich with symbolism and observant commentary about societal pressures to pair up."
Seanax.com," August 13, 2016",Sean Axmaker," Lanthimos invests his absurdist parable with a dark, deadpan humor and an eerie poetry...."
Japan Times," July 18, 2016",Kaori Shoji," The Lobster is brilliant, but it's bleak."
El Universal," July 11, 2016",Alejandro Alemán, A brutal critique of the hell human relationships can be. [Full review in Spanish]
Common Sense Media," July 1, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos may have positioned himself among the world's great, provocative ""maverick"" filmmakers with this bizarre yet fascinating dystopian nightmare for grown-ups. "
Variety," July 20, 2015",Guy Lodge," Yorgos Lanthimos' first English-language feature is a wickedly funny, unexpectedly moving satire of couple-fixated society."
Guardian," July 20, 2015",Peter Bradshaw, There ... dozens of astonishing and strange and funny moments of the sort that only Lanthimos can conjure.
Empire Magazine," October 15, 2015",Ian Nathan," Inordinately strange and tiresomely glum, but in spots hideously funny."
Time Out," October 13, 2015",Dave Calhoun," This is cinema in quotemarks, tongue-in-cheek storytelling that uses absurdity to hold a mirror to how we live and love. "
Cinema em Cena," October 10, 2015",Pablo Villaça, Seu senso de humor absurdo constantemente surpreende o público.
The Skinny," October 8, 2015",Philip Concannon, Lanthimos' ability to combine arch humour and outbursts of shocking violence is as potent as ever.
The Film Stage," October 5, 2015",Jack Giroux," Yorgos Lanthimos' The Lobster is maybe the most romantic movie of the year. Or maybe it's the most depressing. Or perhaps it's the most funny. Actually, it's all of those things."
Film School Rejects," September 29, 2015",Jack Giroux, Yorgos Lanthimos' The Lobster is maybe the most romantic movie of the year.
AwardsCircuit.com," September 27, 2015",Clayton Davis," It took some time to digest but ""The Lobster"" feels full of life and is a soulful opus on love. Quirky and clever, its black comic tones shouldn't distract from its core narrative and mission; to engage the parimeters and infatuation of devotion."
Slant Magazine," September 27, 2015",Kenji Fujishima, The near-surgical precision with which Yorgos Lanthimos approaches the most surreal of conceits turns out to be a double-edged sword.
What Culture," September 25, 2015",Alex Leadbeater," It's an idea with delicious social parallels ripe to be explored and, for the first half at least, that's exactly what you get."
HitFix," September 14, 2015",Gregory Ellwood, Lanthimos presents a fully formed original vision that hits a perfect tone even when the narrative begins to get away from him a bit.
Hollywood Reporter," September 14, 2015",Leslie Felperin, Richly rewarding but often very disturbing.
NOW Toronto," September 14, 2015",Glenn Sumi," Acclaimed Greek auteur Lanthimos's English language debut is a smart, funny and disturbing allegory about the absurdity of rigid societal norms."
Irish Times," September 11, 2015",Donald Clarke, A poisonously effective work from an utterly singular director. You walk out feeling ever so slightly changed by it. There are few higher compliments. 
We Got This Covered," September 10, 2015",Sam Woolf," A biting and idiosyncratic combination of romance, comedy, and body horror, The Lobster is one wonderful, oddball chimera of a movie."
IGN Movies," August 21, 2015",Leigh Singer, Savagely funny and ultimately tragic.
Junkee," August 21, 2015",Harry Windsor," Lanthimos has a gift for making imagined social conventions plausible and even logical, and in doing so he exposes -- in often brutal, mordantly funny fashion -- the arbitrariness of our own."
SciFiNow," August 21, 2015",Martyn Conterio," Beyond the cruel deadpan humour and icy, muted visuals is a thoughtful romantic tale set in a world where people are forbidden from marching to the beat of their own drum. The Lobster is a defiantly oddball take on the classic dystopian-future narrative."
Austin American-Statesman," August 21, 2015",Charles Ealy," It's a wondrously silly premise, and one that Lanthimos executes with rigorous illogic and immaculate formal control."
The List," July 20, 2015",Katherine McLaughlin," The Lobster is as weird and wonderful as it sounds and will make you think twice before asking the dreaded question, 'Are you still single?'"
Screen International," July 20, 2015",Lee Marshall," Filippou's script takes on a defiant, prickly life of its own, refusing to play as an easy allegory: this is no linear emotional journey dressed in dystopian clothes in the style of Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind."
3AW," October 30, 2015",Jim Schembri, An overlong mess.
Cinema Movil," October 28, 2015",Gonzalo Lira Galván, The Lobster easily gets you involved in it's own universe to tell a story about forbiden love and a man's struggle to overcome the obstacles he has to face because of it - all of this accompanied by slow and dry humor- . [Full review in Spanish]
Cinegarage," October 27, 2015",Erick Estrada," A very well executed scary comedy, supported by cold performances and lead by a splendid Colin Farell. [Full review in Spanish]"
Rolling Stone Mexico," October 27, 2015",Arturo Aguilar," A very peculiar love story about love, jealousy and control, sacrifice and selfishness, where there's little room for a positive side of anything. [Full review in Spanish]"
Sydney Morning Herald," October 26, 2015",Sandra Hall," There's a wealth of bleak comedy in all of this but, having carefully laid out his thesis, Lanthimos doesn't know where to take it or what he really thinks about it. "
The Australian," October 26, 2015",David Stratton," [Lanthimos'] vision remains intact, his humour as dry and at times unfathomable as ever. He is a true original."
Sydney Morning Herald," October 21, 2015",Paul Byrnes," It's certainly one of most original films of the year, although not one of the most consistent... Lanthimos and his co-writer Efthymis Filippou​ give us a fascinating set of questions, but they do not feel the need to answer them."
FILMINK (Australia)," October 21, 2015",Cara Nash," For all the absurdity at play, the genius of The Lobster is its depiction of a society and world view that's unsettlingly not all that unfamiliar."
Starburst," October 20, 2015",Paul Mount," The Lobster is a bit of everything. At times it's hilarious, especially in its first half-hour or so, sometimes it's deeply disturbing and occasionally thought-provoking."
ABC Radio (Australia)," October 18, 2015",CJ Johnson," Lanthimos is an acquired taste ... This is an accessible, fun and occasionally frustrating entry into his body of work."
London Evening Standard," October 18, 2015",David Sexton, A brilliantly funny horror film about dating.
Observer (UK)," October 18, 2015",Mark Kermode," It all gets a bit lost in the woods, but there's enough finely honed madness in the corridors of the hotel to cover the price of a room."
Urban Cinefile," October 18, 2015",Andrew L. Urban," The sheer verve of the filmmakers earned them the Jury Prize at Cannes, where unique and risky filmmaking is rewarded ahead of commercially satisfying fare"
International Business Times," October 16, 2015",Alicia Adejobi, Yorgos Lanthimos's black comedy is entirely strange and a head-scratcher but its core message is certainly relatable to a large demographic.
Independent (UK)," October 16, 2015",Geoffrey Macnab, The Lobster is a European arthouse film par excellence - precisely the kind of project you can't imagine ever being made in Hollywood.
TheShiznit.co.uk," October 16, 2015",Matt Looker," It may seem like ludicrous nonsense on the surface, but what it has to say about love, fidelity and dependency is more revealing than anything Farrell wears under his kecks."
Radio Times," October 15, 2015",Adam Smith, Superficially sharp but easily overcooked and with not quite enough meat to be entirely satisfying.
New Statesman," October 15, 2015",Ryan Gilbey," A film set in an alternate reality must take time to establish the rules of its particular fiction, and most of the joys of The Lobster arise from these early scenes."
Student Edge," October 15, 2015",Simon Miraudo, Freaky-deakies need love too.
Little White Lies," October 15, 2015",Trevor Johnston, Appreciation for the sheer conceptual confidence of the film gathers momentum once you think back over it.
Today's Zaman (Turkey)," March 1, 2016",Emine Yildirim, The Lobster is a refreshingly outstanding film in its simultaneous originality and familiarity. 
The Film Stage," February 21, 2016",Giovanni Marchini Camia," Lanthimos again exhibits his aptitude for creating insular, ruthlessly regimented microcosms through which to unleash his scathing satire."
Salt Lake City Weekly," January 31, 2016",Scott Renshaw," The gag may ultimately wear thin, but it's a hoot while it lasts."
Examiner.com," January 25, 2016",Travis Hopson," To call the film weird would be an understatement, but it's the strange, surreal world and the little details that make it even stranger that are the film's best asset."
JoBlo's Movie Emporium," January 24, 2016",Chris Bumbray," In a way, you could say THE LOBSTER is like a Woody Allen film if Woody did huge amounts of hallucinogenic drugs all through the scripting phase and principal photography."
Consequence of Sound," January 23, 2016",Michael Roffman, Lanthimos trumps the outlandish premise and turns the film into accessible and timeless reverie. It's a spark of ingenuity that doesn't rely on subversions or meta humor. Just originality.
The Young Folks," December 21, 2015",Nathanael Hood," Though many elements are undeniably comedic, The Lobster belongs first and foremost to the horror genre; a fact all the more impressive considering it never seeks to deliberately scare its audience"
The Sun (UK)," December 16, 2015",Grant Rollings," All so weird, intriguing and occasionally amusing. Unfortunately, director Yorgos Lanthimos tries to claw out too many ideas leading The Lobster to drift and go off the boil."
Blog de cine," December 12, 2015",Mikel Zorrilla," An rare movie that some will enjoy with passion, but general audiences might find it too weird. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Big Issue," December 11, 2015",Edward Lawrenson, Easily one of the films of the year.
Tiny Mix Tapes," December 9, 2015",Derek Smith," As expected with Lanthimos, The Lobster is utterly bizarre... it's the director's first film in English, yet also his first to show shades of human side, even as it concludes that we humans are an exceptionally silly and sad little species."
Reverse Shot," December 7, 2015",Nick Pinkerton," [Lanthimos] takes his sweet time in unveiling the full breadth of his film's alternate reality and its governing laws, and the world we are introduced to looks very much like our own in the present day."
Contactmusic.com," November 24, 2015",Rich Cline," Throwing a solid Hollywood cast into a surreal arthouse satire, acclaimed Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos (Dogtooth) makes his English-language debut with a bang."
Rip It Up," November 18, 2015",James McCann," When it chooses to be -- which, thankfully, is often -- the film is so funny as to induce tears. Then, on a dime, it's appallingly sad again."
The Robot's Voice," November 14, 2015",Luke Y. Thompson," It's all pretty deadpan and frequently very funny - punctuated, as is Lanthimos' wont, with brutal violence towards animals"
Nerd Report," November 11, 2015",Fred Topel," The central issue is the inevitable paradox where you can't meet someone when you're lonely, which is when you most want to meet someone."
BuzzFeed News," November 10, 2015",Alison Willmore, The dry wit and pervasively odd sensibility of The Lobster make it very worth cozying up to.
Sensacine," November 4, 2015",Suso Aira, A movie that seems kind and inoffensive... but that will destroy and change your life. [Full review in Spanish]
Butaca Ancha," November 2, 2015",Rafael Paz," In this movie, Lanthimos shows himself as a seasoned director. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Arts Desk," October 30, 2015",Demetrios Matheou," Ultimately, The Lobster is fascinating, funny, but a little under-cooked."
New Yorker," May 9, 2016",Anthony Lane," ""The Lobster"" is more than a satire on the dating game. It digs deeper, needling at the status of our most tender emotions."
Compuserve," May 7, 2016",Harvey S. Karten, The picture's surrealism requires an attentive and particular audience which will find rewards therein.
Correcámara," May 5, 2016",Hugo Lara, A film that doesn't take itself too seriously but it has a lot of great moments thanks to its highly stylish tone. [Full review in Spanish]
Flavorwire," May 3, 2016",Jason Bailey," This viewer appreciated 'The Lobster''s willingness to take this premise all the way, without pulling any punches."
Código espagueti," April 28, 2016",Nicolás Ruiz," The performances are perfect, showing the range and hability of every cast member. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," April 28, 2016",Josef Braun, Lanthimos' films are so laced with cruelty and despair that it can be easy to forget how fascinating and funny they are.
El Financiero," April 26, 2016",Daniel Krauze," Even though The Lobster is full of dark humor, you won't see the characters winking at the viewer. [Full review in Spanish]"
Ibero 90.9," April 26, 2016",Fernando Moreno," Clever and transgressive, sophisticated and intriguing, the film is a brilliant reflection on what society expects of individuals as members of a couple and the stupidity of dogmatism. [Full review in Spanish]"
La Jornada," April 22, 2016",Luis Tovar, Like every great film it's perfectly written and it doesn't adhere itself to the conventions of the genre rising above the plot and development. [Full review in Spanish]
Cine Vértigo," April 11, 2016",Ernesto Diezmartinez, Colin Farrell is formidable in this film. [Full review in Spanish]
Ex-Press.com," April 6, 2016",Jay Stone," The Lobster, like the crustacean itself, is delivered in segments."
La Jornada," March 31, 2016",Carlos Bonfil," An original film, outstanding, a success. [Full review in Spanish]"
Globe and Mail," March 25, 2016",Kate Taylor," The Lobster is a brilliant piece of satire, but largely fails in an attempt to build its wicked wit into a more conventional romance."
Toronto Sun," March 24, 2016",Liz Braun," For this viewer the whole thing ran out of steam halfway through. A general flat affect, mirrored in visuals and performance, eventually stopped being funny."
Toronto Star," March 24, 2016",Peter Howell," Bone-dry dystopian satire, with Lanthimos piling absurdity upon absurdity, results in a film that is by turns entertaining and baffling, but also fully in command of its crazy world."
Collider," March 24, 2016",Phil Brown," Pitched somewhere between Luis Bunuel and Larry David, Lanthimos combines small behavioural comedy and twisted surrealism with darkly cynical edge. "
Film Comment Magazine," March 17, 2016",Yonca Talu," In this half-mythical, half-surrealistic portrait of an innocent Everyman's confrontation with a cold-blooded system, Lanthimos achieves a level of audience identification that his previous films had failed to bring about. "
El Fanzine," March 9, 2016",Gonzalo Lira Galván, A film worthy of being seen (again and again) for tenderize and view with concern the way that our relations have been taking over the years. [Full Review in Spanish]
4:3," March 3, 2016",Conor Bateman, A narrative shapeshifter that gleefully toys with its audience's perception of love and themselves.
Konexión," March 2, 2016",Iván Belmont," In the end, The Lobster is one of the most bizarre (and therefore original) love stories ever told in cinema, exploring deep into human psyche. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Reason Online," May 13, 2016",Kurt Loder," This is not a movie like too many others. Or any, in fact."
Los Angeles Times," May 12, 2016",Justin Chang," ""The Lobster"" is very much its own brand of horror movie, as well as a deranged thought experiment, a stealth love story, and a witty dismantling of the usual barriers separating man from beast."
New York Post," May 12, 2016",Kyle Smith," A boldly imaginative Kafka-esque parable, ""The Lobster"" is loaded with dazzling ideas that don't ultimately pull together."
Rolling Stone," May 12, 2016",Peter Travers, Lanthimos's terrifically twisted satire takes us places most films fear to tread. The symbolism is humanized by a top-flight cast and an ending that manages to be brutal and rapturously romantic at the same time. 
New York Daily News," May 12, 2016",Stephen Whitty," In its own, surreal way, it says something about modern society. Who hasn't felt pressured by parents to pair off? Or by single friends to stay unattached?"
TIME Magazine," May 12, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," The Lobster is a droll piece of work lashed with grim humor. For every moment that makes you laugh, there may be another that leaves you with your mouth hanging open."
Metro," May 12, 2016",Matt Prigge," It's life viewed at its most pessimistic, not just to get us down but to force us, like the best absurdist works, to reexamine what we take for granted."
Entertainment Weekly," May 12, 2016",Chris Nashawaty," The existential rabbit-hole plot of The Lobster couldn't be more bonkers. The premise shouldn't work at all, but it does...and beautifully."
Brooklyn Magazine," May 12, 2016",Benjamin Mercer," Almost before you know it, The Lobster has morphed into a parable about sacrifice in the name of love-all without dialing back the brutal absurdism one bit."
The New Republic," May 12, 2016",Will Leitch," This movie is crazypants, but, man, it is my kind of crazy."
New York Times," May 12, 2016",A.O. Scott," Mr. Farrell, a habitual over-actor, is especially affecting because you can sense his effort to restrain himself. Rachel Weisz ... is perfectly cast as the only person in this world with the normal capacities for warmth, empathy and desire."
AV Club," May 12, 2016",A.A. Dowd," All of this could only have come from the warped imagination of Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos, here making his singularly strange English-language debut."
MTV," May 11, 2016",Amy Nicholson," A cynical sci-fi comedy about life's most clichéd script: pair off or perish. That's been the formula since the first primeval fish, and every living thing since has been a sequel."
Den of Geek," May 11, 2016",David Crow," [The film] grandiosely aims to be a dark comedy reflection of our rigid world, but it is so dark that nothing can be truly gleaned beyond its own satisfied cleverness. "
ColeSmithey.com," May 11, 2016",Cole Smithey, [CANNES 2015] This lobster is a dog.
Village Voice," May 11, 2016",Michael Nordine," The Lobster is Lanthimos's first English-language film - Kinetta, Dogtooth, and Alps were all in his native Greek - but no aspect of his sensibility has been lost in translation."
Paste Magazine," May 11, 2016",Tim Grierson," Imaginatively designed but also intellectually bracing, ""The Lobster"" boasts a nervous unease that pulses throughout the film, lending the story an endless tension and unpredictability. We never have any idea where Lanthimos is going next."
South China Morning Post," May 11, 2016",James Mottram," Darkly funny, it's a perfect example of world-building. ... Set in a dystopian near future, it's the ultimate Bridget Jones nightmare: singletons are being singled out."
Film Journal International," May 10, 2016",Ethan Alter," The English-language debut of Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos is built on a terrific premise, but some cracks appear in the foundation by the final act."
Bangkok Post," May 9, 2016",Kong Rithdee," A sad, warm and genuinely touching story about... how hard it is to form a deep relationship in a society that values artificiality."
Arizona Republic," May 19, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," People say this kind of thing all the time - I'm pretty sure I have a time or two - but ""The Lobster"" is unlike any movie you've ever seen."
Austin Chronicle," May 19, 2016",Josh Kupecki," The Lobster packs a wicked punch, eviscerating modern romance in surprising and evocative ways."
Bullz-Eye.com," May 19, 2016",Jason Zingale," While it starts out as a sharp satire on the horrors of dating, The Lobster stretches so far into absurdity that its various eccentricities overshadow the point it's trying to make."
Movie Nation," May 19, 2016",Roger Moore," Whatever its merits or intellectual pretensions, I am looking forward to never seeing it again. "
San Francisco Chronicle," May 19, 2016",Walter V. Addiego," If you can live with its blemishes, ""The Lobster"" is a bracing experience."
Blu-ray.com," May 18, 2016",Brian Orndorf," Perhaps nearly two hours of this world is more than necessary, but the themes and emotions presented in ""The Lobster"" are deeply felt, even when articulated by blank faces."
The Playlist," May 17, 2016",Oliver Lyttelton," An uproarious yet deadpan satire concerning societal constructs, dating mores and power structures that also manages to be a surprisingly moving, gloriously weird love story. "
New Zealand Herald," May 16, 2016",Lydia Jenkin," Weird, confounding, amusing but perplexing - those are all words which spring to mind when trying to describe The Lobster."
Truthdig," May 16, 2016",Carrie Rickey, [A] seriously funny horror-comedy.
Newcity," May 16, 2016",Ray Pride," Deadpan allegory without a single straight answer... Lanthimos remains one of world cinema's prime proponents of The Weird... The moments of tenderness and weirdness are the movie's highest, most Buñuelesque highs."
CinemaBlend.com," May 16, 2016",Greg Wakeman," The Lobster's delightfully original, disturbing and peculiar opening hour just about makes up for the fact that its second half is disappointingly dull."
Graffiti With Punctuation," May 15, 2016",Blake Howard," The Lobster is a divinely weird satire of romantic conformity from Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos. It's a recipe that's as weird as it is tragic, as philosophically sabre sharp as it is hilarious; this is a film that deserves your time."
NPR," May 13, 2016",Bob Mondello," ...it plays cleverly with the compatibility assumptions behind, say, singles groups and online dating sites."
Christian Science Monitor," May 13, 2016",Peter Rainer," Its tone of deadpan absurdism never really develops into anything truly subversive or visionary. It's a weirdo, sub-J.G. Ballard conceit: J.G. Ballard for Dummies."
Reeling Reviews," May 13, 2016",Laura Clifford," director Yorgos Lanthimos made an art house splash in 2010 with his black comedy ""Dogtooth."" While his latest is still dark in its outlook, it's also more laugh-out-loud funny, it's witty absurdism complemented by its deadpan acting."
TheWrap," May 13, 2016",Dave White," A wild, sad, mordantly funny dystopia that gives sexual desperation the bad name it deserves."
AllMovie," May 13, 2016",Daniel Gelb," Lanthimos takes our intrinsic desire for companionship, filters it through a funhouse mirror, and reflects it back to us brilliantly."
Your Movies (cleveland.com)," May 13, 2016",John Urbancich," This festival favorite becomes a sometimes scary, if darkly humorous take on the future (maybe) in the hands of absurdist director Yorgos Lanthimos."
Under the Radar," May 13, 2016",Austin Trunick," Yorgos Lanthimos has made a film that's disturbingly hilarious, and perhaps even surpasses the benchmarks for discomfort he set with 2010's Oscar-nominated Dogtooth."
RogerEbert.com," May 13, 2016",Sheila O'Malley," While extremely funny, it is a bitter and ruthless film. Lanthimos plays target practice and his aim is deadly."
Philadelphia Inquirer," May 25, 2016",Steven Rea," The Lobster is what would happen if Wes Anderson set about doing Franz Kafka, with a hefty dash of George Orwell thrown into the mix: surreal, comic, sad, strange, beautiful, sublime."
Groucho Reviews," May 25, 2016",Peter Canavese," Investigates the nature of our need for a partner (who else will apply that pain-relief cream to the small of your back?), how we cling to superficial similarities to justify our matches, and our denial, at our peril, of our animal nature."
About.com," May 24, 2016",Christopher Campbell, The best romantic satire since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
LarsenOnFilm," May 22, 2016",Josh Larsen," If we've come to idolize marriage in contemporary Western society, The Lobster has come to desecrate it."
ReviewExpress.com," May 21, 2016",Jean Lowerison, Humor in the Craziness of the Situations
The Patriot Ledger," May 21, 2016",Al Alexander, It's a murky soup of commentary and ideas about modern love and loneliness presented in the most unsettling and imaginative way.
Cinemixtape," May 20, 2016",J. Olson," By the 60-minute mark Lathimos' bag of tricks is empty, kickstarting a long slide into tedium that sinks a project that should have sung."
Chicago Sun-Times," May 20, 2016",Richard Roeper, Farrell absolutely kills it as David. Weisz gives one of her best performances since her Oscar-winning turn in The Constant Gardener.
Associated Press," May 20, 2016",Jake Coyle, [Lanthimos'] commitment to his high-concept tragicomedies is extraordinary.
RedEye," May 20, 2016",Emma Krupp, Loneliness is all-encompassing and human desperation can be disturbing: We've seen these ideas before. It just so happens that The Lobster lets them play out in the weirdest cinematic thought experiment imaginable.
Boston Herald," May 20, 2016",James Verniere," This is proof that you can be uniquely offbeat and utterly boring and nonsensical, too. "
San Francisco Examiner," May 20, 2016",Anita Katz," Farrell makes a convincing sad sack regaining his romantic pulse. Weisz is radiant as, depending on how you see her character, a triumphant or a tragic heroine. Take a chance and go with this one."
Mark Reviews Movies," May 20, 2016",Mark Dujsik," [A]n anti-romance that presents two, extreme ways of living as a means of dissecting the concept of love, tossing its organs on the floor, and then stomping on the carcass."
Nerdist," May 19, 2016",Kyle Anderson," The Lobster is an incredibly weird movie, but its heart is totally on its sleeve and in the right place."
Chicago Reader," May 19, 2016",J. R. Jones," Lanthimos works the premise assiduously, especially after the Farrell character escapes and joins a band of rebel singles in the woods, and though the story slows to a crawl near the end, the poker-faced dramatization of a warped world is compelling."
Boston Globe," May 19, 2016",Peter Keough," It takes a touch of audacity and madness to make a film like this, a screwball, absurdist tragedy that might be a little too long and contrived for some viewers' taste."
The Verge," May 19, 2016",Tasha Robinson," Lanthimos and Filippou keep the audience guessing about their ultimate ends right up to the final shot, and beyond."
Washington Post," May 19, 2016",Stephanie Merry," The movie is worthwhile, thanks to a marriage of peculiar humor and thought-provoking content."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," May 19, 2016",Colin Covert," This kind of art is not on many people's wavelength, but those who connect to it will remember it 20, 30, 40 years later."
Chicago Tribune," May 19, 2016",Michael Phillips," Everyone's excellent in ""The Lobster,"" and the suffocatingly bland settings brake just short of monumental claustrophobia."
Tulsa World," June 2, 2016",Michael Smith," I have an appreciation for absurdist fare, but The Lobster is an overcooked comedy that loses steam about halfway through the experience."
Charlotte Observer," June 2, 2016",Lawrence Toppman," I was caught up almost immediately in ""The Lobster,"" a movie as prickly and difficult to approach as the title character."
Miami Herald," June 1, 2016",Rene Rodriguez, The Lobster argues that the kind of pressure society places on us to find a soulmate can lead to reckless choices. But the movie gives the alternative - people who are happy being single - the same radical treatment.

Times-Picayune," June 1, 2016",Mike Scott," It is weird, but it is also meaningful, emotional and unexpectedly hilarious. Best of all, it's a strikingly original film, a precious thing in homogenous Hollywood."
EntertainmentTell," June 1, 2016",Stephen Silver," It's a satire that's actually biting, and satirical of something not typically satirized. (Splice Today) "
SSG Syndicate," May 29, 2016",Susan Granger," Strange and surreal, an audacious, absurdist satire - it's the most bizarre film I've seen!"

"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," May 27, 2016",Robert Horton," The Lobster is being marketed as a comedy, and it is frequently funny, but only in the way A Clockwork Orange is frequently funny. Go and have a laugh, for sure, but don't be shocked when the claws come out."
KPBS.org," May 27, 2016",Beth Accomando," There is much about this film that I love, and yet I can't embrace it fully. But I adore how Lanthimos creates a kind of ominous oppressiveness combined with a goofy absurdism."
"Capital Times (Madison, WI)"," May 27, 2016",Rob Thomas," ""The Lobster"" is a wild, fun, occasionally mean-spirited satire of the rituals and humiliations of modern dating. But it asks uncomfortable questions of us. It's the best movie I've seen so far this year."

Chicago Reader," May 26, 2016",Leah Pickett," Lanthimos forgoes easy sentiments about the transformative power of love; this may turn off some viewers, but there's a certain liberation and even some relief in knowing that societal pressure to settle down can be just as cruel as loneliness. "
Newsday," May 26, 2016",Rafer Guzman," Highly original and mordantly funny. Perfect for fans of Franz Kafka, Charlie Kaufman and other bleak surrealists."
Salon.com," May 26, 2016",Eileen G'Sell, Lanthimos's unsettling tour de force reminds us of how chained to coupledom dignity remains at both the private and public level.
"Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)"," May 25, 2016",Bob Bloom, 'The Lobster' is a different species of movie; one that takes great pains to create a world you may be hesitant to visit - but one you will definitely be happy to leave.
Willamette Week," May 25, 2016",John Locanthi," Interesting concept, but this vision of the future mostly involves Farrell, John C. Reilly, Rachel Weisz and the rest of cast lurching through their lines in a dull, passionless monotone. "
"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," June 23, 2016",John Beifuss," The social pressure to be part of a couple is taken to Kafkaesque extremes in this poker-faced absurdist critique of the idea -- typically expressed most enthusiastically in commercial motion pictures -- that a successful, happy life requires a mate."

Tri-City Herald," June 10, 2016",Gary Wolcott, Hunger Games. Maze Runner. Divergent. This is how a dystopian movie ought to be made. 
Sacramento News & Review," June 10, 2016",Jim Lane," Its characters are merely single defining characteristics rather than real people; they have nothing, and hence nothing to lose. And as for wit -- without that, satire is just meanness."

amNewYork," June 6, 2016",Robert Levin," It's a doozy of a satirical premise concocted by Yorgos Lanthimos, who directs and co-wrote the screenplay, that evokes the fundamental absurdity of the very real social pressure to find a mate and proceed along a pre-determined path of existence."

Salt Lake Tribune," June 3, 2016",Sean P. Means," Lanthimos and his co-writer, Efthymis Filippou, neatly satirize the societal pressures of mating and the difficulties of finding a soulmate, but the movie runs out of ideas long before it runs out of story."
The Virginian-Pilot," June 3, 2016",Mal Vincent," It is a puzzler that rewards. Fans of Kafka will embrace it. The Lobster also has a little of George Orwell's 1984 and, maybe, behind all the pretense, a hint of good sense. But you've got to work to get to the good sense."
Cleveland Plain Dealer," June 3, 2016",Michael Heaton, It raises more questions than it answers during its fairly tedious and ultimately rather pointless two-hour run.
