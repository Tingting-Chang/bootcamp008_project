Starburst," February 2, 2017",Paul Mount," There's no doubt that this is confident, striking, film-making and if it merely serves as the final step in Gibson's rehabilitation and allows him to forge ahead with his new career as a director of true vision and power."
Film Ireland Magazine," February 2, 2017",Sarah Griffin," Flawed, but entertaining, Hacksaw Ridge celebrates a pacifist in a time when killing was currency, and is a welcome reminder of the brutality of the battlefield in our own modern times, when war is fought at the push of a button."
Hot Press," February 1, 2017",Roe McDermott," It's a good film, not a great one -- but a wise one for Gibson, and an interesting one for the current political climate."
GQ Magazine [UK]," February 1, 2017",Helen O'Hara," In these troubled times, we could do worse for a hero than a man who put his enlistment papers where his mouth is and saved scores of lives."
Cinexcepción," February 1, 2017",Hugo Hernández Valdivia," A film with a lot of muscle, full of testosterone and as correct as patriotic. In conclusion: Hacksaw Ridge is effective...to a certain extent. [Full review in Spanish]"

Observer (UK)," January 29, 2017",Wendy Ide," Gibson's robust directorial technique brings an undeniable punch to the combat scenes ... Elsewhere in the film, however, there's a sledgehammer lack of subtlety that is only partially mitigated by Andrew Garfield's impressive performance."
The Ooh Tray," January 28, 2017",Ed Whitfield, Cornball heroism at its most righteous and manipulative.
Irish Times," January 27, 2017",Donald Clarke," If they gave out awards for ""most movie in a movie"", then no other movie need turn up."
The Arts Desk," January 27, 2017",Adam Sweeting," Gibson's film is clean, sober and shot through with a respectful piety, but somehow this scarcely believable story manages to feel a little flat and somewhat predictable."
iNews.co.uk," January 27, 2017",Matthew Turner, Mel Gibson's career rehabilitation continues. This is a gripping and ultimately powerful tale. 
Times (UK)," January 26, 2017",Kevin Maher," A rousing tale of Pacific War heroism that has more in common with jingoistic Wayne staples such as Sands of Iwo Jima or The Green Berets than anything in the 21st century, this is wearily formulaic film-making."
Sky Movies," January 26, 2017",Tim Evans, It's a thrilling - sometimes unwatchable - action film but has a undeniable nobility at its core.
Scotsman," January 26, 2017",Alistair Harkness," A blunt, brutal, bloody mess of a movie that displays the full range of Gibson's skills as a chronicler of eye-watering suffering on the battlefield and his propensity for corny mythmaking off it."
Contactmusic.com," January 26, 2017",Rich Cline," As a director, Mel Gibson is great at telling vivid stories that evoke intense feelings. And Andrew Garfield delivers another remarkably internalised performance that resonates strongly."
Radio Times," January 26, 2017",Damon Wise," Garfield, previously so passive, proves a surprisingly viable hero in all this mayhem, performing breathtaking acts of courage that one instinctively knows must pale next to the horrors of the real thing."
International Business Times," January 26, 2017",Amy West," While a biopic doesn't usually include such direct nods to the people that it centres on, here, it makes all that you've just watched appear so much more powerful and moving and will have you thinking about it for days after you've seen it."
TheWrap," September 4, 2016",Alonso Duralde," In celebrating this legendary pacifist, Gibson and company ennoble the hell out of violence."
Reel Reviews," October 28, 2016",Frank Wilkins," Makes us realize that if only each of us respected the unwavering principles and convictions of others as stubbornly as we hold onto our own, perhaps we wouldn't have to dig back through some 70 years of history to find our real heroes."
Den of Geek," October 28, 2016",David Crow," Gibson pinpoints an undeniable grace in the life of Desmond T. Doss, and in doing so offers a film that plays to all our better angels, no matter the persuasion."
Slant Magazine," October 28, 2016",Christopher Gray," This is a work of defiantly simplistic, classically structured Hollywood storytelling, and Mel Gibson takes to its hokey plot points with some gusto."

BBC.com," September 9, 2016",Nicholas Barber," As clichéd as it is, Hacksaw Ridge passes muster because it is so uncynical about the man it memorialises. Gibson's reverence, for soldiers and for hardline Christians alike, is disarming."
Daily Mail (UK)," September 8, 2016",Brian Viner, [A] powerful if somewhat calculating film ...
TIME Magazine," September 7, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," A movie that reaches out toward the idea of goodness in the world. And whether you or I like Gibson as a person or not, it's no one's place to deny his reach."

Hollywood Reporter," September 4, 2016",David Rooney, Gibson's forceful comeback is a violent drama about pacifism that succeeds in combining horror with grace.
CineVue," September 4, 2016",John Bleasdale," A gruesome, pounding war film about the courage of a deeply religious man in near-unbelievable circumstances."
The Playlist," September 4, 2016",Jessica Kiang, This tale of real-life heroism seems less a celebration of humanist convictions than a glorification of religious intransigence and a declaration of the moral superiority of the faithful over the faithless. 
The Film Stage," September 4, 2016",Rory O'Connor," A thrilling mainstream war film, laden with broad emotional strokes. "
Guardian," September 4, 2016",Andrew Pulver," As repellent a figure as many may still find Gibson, I have to report he's absolutely hit Hacksaw Ridge out of the park."

Variety," September 4, 2016",Owen Gleiberman," It immerses you in the violent madness of war - and, at the same time, it roots its drama in the impeccable valor of a man who, by his own grace, refuses to have anything to do with war."
Village Voice," November 2, 2016",Bilge Ebiri," Often beautiful, occasionally infuriating and always fascinating."
Newark Star-Ledger," November 2, 2016",Stephen Whitty," Full of Gibson's oldest, but best obsessions - about the power of faith, the strength of selflessness, the stubbornness of courage."
MovieWeb," November 2, 2016",Julian Roman, Hacksaw Ridge is a parable of how values can keep you strong in the worst of places. Mel Gibson returns to directing greatness. Andrew Garfield will be a strong contender for the Best Actor Oscar.
New York Magazine/Vulture," November 2, 2016",David Edelstein," Say what you will about Mad Mel Gibson, he's a driven, febrile artist, and there isn't a second in his war film Hacksaw Ridge - not even the ones that should register as clichés - that doesn't burn with his peculiar intensity."

New York Daily News," November 1, 2016",Joe Dziemianowicz," It's gripping, eye-opening and when it comes to heroics, thought-provoking. But it also suffers from grisliness, sentiment and self-indulgence."

Urban Cinefile," October 29, 2016",Louise Keller," Throwing up an intriguing paradox, Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge is a hard-hitting drama about faith, conviction and conflict. These are themes that Gibson knows well"
RogerEbert.com," November 3, 2016",Matt Zoller Seitz," This film is inept and beautiful, stupid and amazing. It doesn't have the words or images to express how deep it is."
Metro," November 3, 2016",Matt Prigge," Fitting for a film made by someone long out of the game, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a throwback, which in this case means to a type of film that was still popular only seven or eight years ago."
Miami Herald," November 3, 2016",Rene Rodriguez," Subtlety has never been one of Gibson's strengths as a filmmaker. But this amazing story of heroism can take anything he throws at it and keep going, much like Doss himself."
AV Club," November 3, 2016",Ignatiy Vishnevetsky," Hacksaw Ridge is full of broad characterizations and even broader gestures. But it takes a difficult position and holds to it, even as it piles on the shredded limbs, rotting corpses, and zings of sniper fire."
Seattle Times," November 3, 2016",Soren Anderson," With Andrew Garfield in the lead role and Mel Gibson in the director's chair for the first time in 10 years, ""Hacksaw"" is an incredibly powerful picture once it gets to the battle scenes."
Las Vegas Weekly," November 3, 2016",Josh Bell," Gibson lays on the sentiment and the blood and guts in equal measure, and both drown out the genuine heroism of the true story."

Philadelphia Inquirer," November 2, 2016",Tirdad Derakhshani, Garfield melts into his Doss character in a performance that seems impossibly still and tranquil. He's mesmerizing.
RedEye," November 2, 2016",Lauren Chval," There are a lot of war films, but Hacksaw Ridge feels unique in its dogged pacifism."
The Age (Australia)," November 2, 2016",Jake Wilson, [Gibson's] willingness to boil characters down to archetypes gives him a naive strength as a visual storyteller.
Tribune News Service," November 2, 2016",Katie Walsh," Doss is asked time and time again if he's ""crazy."" But when we're on the ground, the film flips that notion on its head. Is it crazy to save lives or to take them? In ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" it's clearly war that's craziest of all. "

AllMovie," November 2, 2016",Daniel Gelb," While [Gibson's] portrayal of Doss' heroism on the battlefield is moving and honorable, neither the tedious setup nor the ham-fisted delivery should get a free pass."
Herald Sun (Australia)," November 2, 2016",Leigh Paatsch," Garfield anchors proceedings with unshowy, yet unfailingly admirable aplomb. The supporting ranks are equally strong, with Australian actors Luke Bracey, Hugo Weaving and Sam Worthington just three of the many standouts."
amNewYork," November 2, 2016",Robert Levin, Mel Gibson is such a polarizing figure that it's easy to forget or underestimate his considerable filmmaking talents.
Pajiba," November 2, 2016",Kristy Puchko," Doss's is a fascinating tale of bravery, but under Gibson's direction it's largely lost amid war-movie cliche and colliding ideology."
Chicago Reader," November 3, 2016",J. R. Jones, The young soldier's pacifism was so profound and so truly lived that it neutralizes the director's characteristic bloodlust.
Toronto Sun," November 3, 2016",Liz Braun," Faith and fighting -- two of Mel Gibson's biggest obsessions -- are at the heart of his excellent new movie, Hacksaw Ridge. It's a war movie about a pacifist."

Chicago Daily Herald," November 3, 2016",Dann Gire," Garfield, in a fiercely committed performance, projects a mix of unwavering principal and emotional vulnerability."
Austin Chronicle," November 3, 2016",Marjorie Baumgarten, Hacksaw Ridge is drenched in the blood of the fallen and the mud forever caked on the boots of those who survived to tell the tale. It's the closest thing to feeling as though you've marched a mile in those shoes.
San Diego Reader," November 3, 2016",Matthew Lickona," When your protagonist is a World War II medic during the campaign to take Okinawa, you can make a poetry of corpses (and near-corpses) without swerving from the cause of realism."
Toronto Star," November 3, 2016",Peter Howell," Hacksaw Ridge is old-fashioned moviemaking of the kind Gibson excels at: where men are men, women are women and champions rise to smite villains in gory combat."
ReelViews," November 3, 2016",James Berardinelli," Hacksaw Ridge embraces many of the clichés of the war movie but, instead of laying them out in a rote fashion, the film synthesizes them into a visceral, ultimately inspirational result."
Newsday," November 3, 2016",Rafer Guzman, An unusual pro-peace war film from director Mel Gibson. Solidly entertaining and impressively faithful to the facts.
Washington Post," November 3, 2016",Ann Hornaday," ""Hacksaw Ridge"" winds up being a rousing piece of entertainment that also happens to be an affecting portrait of spiritual faith and simple human decency."
The New Republic," November 3, 2016",Tim Grierson," There's power in Gibson's simplicity and hardheaded certainty, and there are moments so utterly absorbing that quibbles about the lack of character nuance feel beside the point. And yet, his brand of heroism ultimately feels too one-dimensional."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," November 3, 2016",Colin Covert," This could have been another dime-a-dozen war story about rah-rah patriotism, but Gibson has made something much deeper, artistically and morally."
JoBlo's Movie Emporium," November 3, 2016",Chris Bumbray," A stunning achievement... This is a movie about a gentle man, but it's not a gentle film."

Reeling Reviews," November 3, 2016",Laura Clifford," After a lengthy absence from the Hollywood forefront, director Mel Gibson (""Braveheart,"" ""Apocalypto"") is back with a heroic and brutal war film that checks off all his recurring themes."
Washington City Paper," November 3, 2016",Noah Gittell," There is something refreshing about a commercial film that challenges us with juxtaposition and refuses to placate its base, particularly in this gerrymandered political era."
National Catholic Register," November 3, 2016",Steven D. Greydanus," Can be seen as an examination of war and nonviolence, but it also begs to be seen - like Birth of a Nation, with its #BlackLivesMatter echoes - in light of contemporary issues."
Collider," November 3, 2016",Matt Goldberg," Hacksaw Ridge isn't a pacifist screed, but it shows Gibson's evolving views of depicting violence in his movies."
Entertainment Weekly," November 3, 2016",Leah Greenblatt, Hacksaw never really delves into the moral grays; it's just black and white and red all over.
Bullz-Eye.com," November 3, 2016",Jason Zingale," Hacksaw Ridge isn't as great as some of Gibson's past work, but it's a well-made drama that's bolstered by a superb central performance and the best battle sequences since Saving Private Ryan."
New York Post," November 3, 2016",Kyle Smith," If the film's director were anyone but Gibson, a fixture on or even atop Hollywood's enemies list, it would be expecting several Oscar nominations."
Fort Worth Weekly," November 3, 2016",Kristian M. Lin, Hacksaw Ridge does justice to the courage and conscience of this man of nonviolence. This could have been a great film at 100 minutes or so. Too bad it runs 131.
Concrete Playground," November 3, 2016",Tom Glasson," Mel Gibson returns to the director's chair with a brutal, confronting and uplifting true story of extraordinary heroism."

Paste Magazine," November 3, 2016",Anthony Salveggi," Even accepting that everything depicted about Doss' heroics are true, Hacksaw Ridge delivers them like someone too intent on wanting to make us feel good about ourselves for honoring the bravery and sacrifice of those soldiers."
Associated Press," November 3, 2016",Jocelyn Noveck," [Doss'] is a story you probably didn't know, and will be glad you did. Gibson does well by it."
IGN Movies," November 3, 2016",Alex Welch," At times horrifying, inspiring, and heart-wrenching, Hacksaw Ridge is one of the most successful war films of recent memory."
Ex-Press.com," November 3, 2016",Katherine Monk," You can't argue with war, but there's a sense of Gibson's Braveheart-styled bloodlust that frames every scene, holding a primal - stifled - yell. Throw Andrew Garfield's spongemop of a screen presence in there, and the whole thing borders on absurd..."
CinemaBlend.com," November 3, 2016",Sean O'Connell," Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge tells a story that's worth telling. That's important to emphasize, because the way that Gibson and his collaborators tell their story isn't always worthy."
Dork Shelf," November 3, 2016",Jason Gorber," The film could use a lot more grey and lot less in the form of jingoistic, manipulative battlemongering."
Wall Street Journal," November 3, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," Impassioned patriotism and religious conviction constitute the core of Hacksaw Ridge, a stirring -- and surpassingly violent -- dramatization of the life of Desmond T. Doss, the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor."

One Guy's Opinion," November 3, 2016",Frank Swietek," Gibson uses tried-and-true tropes so effectively that you don't mind how hokey they actually are, and he stages the battle sequences...with such assurance that those craving violent action will be sated."
Boston Globe," November 3, 2016",Peter Keough," Mel Gibson is a filmmaker with strong beliefs, one of which is the redeeming power of spectacular, voyeuristic pain and violence."
CNN.com," November 3, 2016",Brian Lowry," Hacksaw Ridge has something in common with Loving, another real-life story opening this week... in both instances it's the strength of the underlying narrative, more than the filmmaking, which does most of the heavy lifting."
NPR," November 3, 2016",Chris Klimek," It's good, in a sturdy, muted, unsurprising way."
Killer Movie Reviews," November 3, 2016",Andrea Chase," this film is a harrowing experience, but also one that is jubilantly uplifting in its celebration of quiet courage and the strength of personal belief"
Flicks.co.nz," November 3, 2016",Daniel Rutledge," It ends up with a fairly confused message something like... pacifism is awesome, but violence is also awesome, but God is the most awesome."
Blu-ray.com," November 3, 2016",Brian Orndorf," It's an exceptional picture and Gibson's finest work to date, gracefully but forcefully sharing faith-based interests without resorting to preachiness, putting Godly trust to the test on a merciless battlefield."
Mark Reviews Movies," November 3, 2016",Mark Dujsik, The movie believes that Desmond [Doss] is sincere in his beliefs. It simply doesn't want to believe them.
We Got This Covered," November 4, 2016",Bernard Boo," Though it's a bit of a wobbly mess at times, Hacksaw Ridge ultimately winds up being a deeply moving character study about an unlikely American hero."
Reel Film Reviews," November 4, 2016",David Nusair, ...there just isn't enough material here to sustain the movie's overlong and occasionally oppressive 131 minutes...

Rolling Stone," November 3, 2016",Peter Travers," Hacksaw Ridge is being touted as Gibson's comeback. Is it also an atonement? What's clear is that Gibson has made a film about family, faith, love and forgiveness all put to the test in an arena of violent conflict - a movie you don't want to miss."
New England Movies Weekly," November 3, 2016",Daniel M. Kimmel," Garfield gives an Oscar-worthy performance, showing the medic to be a simple man of conviction and courage."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," November 7, 2016",Robbie Collin, A fantastically moving and bruising war film that hits you like a raw topside of beef in the face - a kind of primary-coloured Guernica that flourishes on a big screen with a crowd.
New Yorker," November 7, 2016",Richard Brody, Gibson has made a movie that's nearly pathological in its love of violence-but he nonetheless counterbalances its amoral pleasures with an understanding of the psychological devastation that war wreaks.

SSG Syndicate," November 6, 2016",Susan Granger," Intense and viscerally stunning, idealized and idiosyncratic, it illuminates the first conscientious objector awarded the Medal of Honor."
ABC Radio Brisbane," November 6, 2016",Matthew Toomey, Andrew Garfield speaks with a slow drawl and comes across as a touch dopey but it's a good fit for the character. He is a man driven by his beliefs rather than common sense.
The Patriot Ledger," November 5, 2016",Al Alexander, Gibson is giddy to once again be granted the all-mighty power to indulge his love of faith-based martyrdom. 
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," November 5, 2016",Dennis Schwartz, A crowd-pleasing conventional war drama.
Winnipeg Free Press," November 4, 2016",Randall King," The performances here keep the film grounded, notably Weaving, typically excellent, and Garfield especially up to the task of layering Christ-like grace notes atop a character who might have... come off as a beatific hillbilly"

Dark Horizons," November 4, 2016",Gary Dowell," It's a blunt-force, but highly effective treatise on the horrors of war as well as those who rise above the brutality to maintain as much humanity as one can on a battlefield."
The Australian," November 4, 2016",David Stratton," As director, Gibson's approach is bold and fearless; this represents his best work to date behind the camera."
National Post," November 4, 2016",Chris Knight," It definitely out-Ryans ol' Saving Private, but the goal is questionable; there comes a point when most viewers will avert their eyes (and hence stop being viewers) just for a respite."

National Review," November 4, 2016",Armond White," What [Desmond Doss] encountered in fulfilling his faith and duty is movingly depicted in the film, but it's the emotional undercurrent that makes Hacksaw Ridge extraordinary. "

Your Movies (cleveland.com)," November 21, 2016",John Urbancich," It's an uncommonly bloody -- and still somehow sensitive -- telling, with the terrific Andrew Garfield, as the aw-shucks hero, mostly mixing and matching with a host of grand actors from Gibson's homeland."
Cairo360," November 16, 2016",Marija Loncarevic," Visually stunning, mercilessly bloody and utterly moving."
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," November 15, 2016",Piers Marchant, Gibson's continued pouring over the blood-soaked effect of close combat doesn't advance the narrative as much as it announces the continued obsessions of its beleaguered progenitor.

Tampa Bay Times," November 10, 2016",Steve Persall," If any filmmaker is ruthless enough to make war truly look like hell, it's Mel Gibson. We saw what he did to Jesus. You can imagine how Gibson cranks the meat grinder with hordes of World War II soldiers, even in tribute to a pacifist."

Film Inquiry," December 5, 2016",David Fontana," At times overly violent, and with clunky exposition, Hacksaw Ridge is also remarkably realistic, as visceral an experience in a theater that you are likely to see all year. "
ArtsHub," December 3, 2016",Sarah Ward," Trying so forcefully to evoke a reaction isn't always a flaw, and pays off when the movie's second half comes around, but Gibson's indulgences are always noticeable."
