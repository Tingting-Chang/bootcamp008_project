Observer (UK)," November 13, 2016",Wendy Ide," It's a striking, sober film - the restrained use of music contrasts the exquisite devotional song of the sisters with the ugliness of their situation; the black and white of the habits is echoed in the stark winter landscape outside the convent walls."
