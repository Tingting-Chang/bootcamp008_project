Total Film," January 2, 2017",Stephen Puddicombe," Catherine Corsini's film highlights the successes of second-wave feminism, but it's when the lovers move to the countryside that the film really finds its theme: the difficulties of growing up gay in a conservative community."
AwardsCircuit.com," January 1, 2017",Shane Slater," The moderate highs and lows of Delphine and Carole's may not go down as a classic love story. But the sincerity of its actresses (including Noémie Lvovsky as Delphine's quietly observant, unyielding mother) keeps you fully invested in their journey."
Junkee," November 15, 2016",Lauren Carroll Harris," La Belle Saison is far from groundbreaking, but perhaps that's where its newness lies: in simply bringing queer women's concerns into mainstream arthouse filmmaking."
Times (UK)," October 10, 2016",Kate Muir, Summertime is a gorgeously shot film by the French director Catherine Corsini that swoons over a lesbian love affair between Cécile de France and Izia Higelin.
The Australian," September 16, 2016",David Stratton," The film is distinguished by magnificent photography by Jeanne Lapoirie and by the insightful screenplay by the director and Laurette Polmanss. It's enjoying a very limited cinema release, but is well worth checking out."

MovieMail," August 25, 2016",Mike McCahill," Far from the final word on its particular chapter of feminist history, but a very watchable, accessible primer -- a startpoint for further rumination, discussion, and perhaps even action."
Georgia Straight," August 18, 2016",Craig Takeuchi," La belle saison, is more fitting than the English one, for the film manages to capture the natural, if ephemeral, beauty that arises from life as it is, that we all should be so lucky to enjoy at least once in our lives."

RogerEbert.com," July 22, 2016",Glenn Kenny," What makes Summertime really refreshing is that it doesn't treat its central romance as anything but wholly normal, despite the attitude of other characters, or indeed, the tenor of the time in which it is set."

Village Voice," July 18, 2016",Melissa Anderson," For all of its wise, welcome focus on the libidinal, Summertime additionally succeeds in presenting the far-left fervor of the time without devolving into school-play pageantry."
Financial Times," July 18, 2016",Nigel Andrews, Five stars for good intentions; two for the path to cinematic platitude they pave.
