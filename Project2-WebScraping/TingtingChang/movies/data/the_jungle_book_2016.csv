Film Inquiry," December 7, 2016",Mike Daringer," The Jungle Book encompasses vivid illustrations of archetypal stories, and manages to be accessible and pleasurable for children of all ages. "

Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," November 14, 2016",Piers Marchant," Favreau's film, virtually entirely CGI save for a human child lead, is a serviceable mix of action, computer-provided visual splendor, Disney-approved morality, and fine voice work from its star-studded cast."

Consequence of Sound," April 13, 2016",Dominick Mayer," The Jungle Book features some of the more astounding visuals in recent film. For a film that's overwhelmingly digital, there's a remarkably tactile quality to so many of the film's setpieces."
Miami Herald," April 13, 2016",Rene Rodriguez," The better these talking beasts look, the more the film resembles a gorgeous screen saver. You admire The Jungle Book, but you can't lose yourself in it. "

Times-Picayune," April 13, 2016",Mike Scott," Favreau has crafted a movie that, contrary to the fears of Disney purists, in no way betrays Uncle Walt's vision. Rather, it honors it -- and even enhances it."
Daily Star," April 13, 2016",Andy Lea, The four-legged stars are more Discovery Channel than Disney Channel but it's the old school art of voice casting that makes this astonishing spectacle really sing.
New York Daily News," April 13, 2016",Stephen Whitty," Disney's latest take on ""The Jungle Book"" has the bare necessities, but not much more."
Groucho Reviews," April 13, 2016",Peter Canavese, Favreau and Marks have obviously put some thought into the film's visual approach and the messages...: the animal kingdom's unexpected threats and opportunities...the work Mowgli puts in to come of age...his casual kindheartedness...
Entertainment Weekly," April 12, 2016",Chris Nashawaty, It's the first talking-animal movie I've seen where CGI seamlessly bridges the uncanny gap between fantasy and reality. It's also one of the few 3-D movies that actually benefits from being in 3-D.
Sensacine," April 12, 2016",Paula Arantzazu Ruiz," Bill Murray's Baloo is the best part of the film. The end credits are amazing, It takes a little while to get things going, but when it starts, the movie flies by itself. [Full review in Spanish]"

Chicago Sun-Times," April 12, 2016",Richard Roeper," Thanks to director Jon Favreau's visionary guidance and some of the most impressive blends of live-action and CGI we've yet seen, The Jungle Book is a beautifully rendered, visually arresting take on Rudyard Kipling's oft-filmed tales."
Comic Book Resources," April 12, 2016",Kristy Puchko," Disney's The Jungle Book, is Favreau's masterpiece."
Metro," April 12, 2016",Matt Prigge," Doesn't try to be anything more than a well-known story retold simply, but we're reminded even a painfully familiar tale can, when done right, still bring the magic."
The Film Stage," April 12, 2016",Brian Roan, Its visuals are so undeniably convincing and intricate that the sheer wonder of how they achieved any of this will be enough to distract -- from the story's missteps and even the film itself.
ScreenCrush," April 12, 2016",Matt Singer, At its best in moments of visual splendor.
MovieWeb," April 12, 2016",Julian Roman, Disney's 'The Jungle Book' is an incredible cinematic experience that will dazzle children and adults.

TheFilmFile.com," April 14, 2016",Dustin Putman," Employing some of the most photorealistic computer-generated visual effects ever put to film, ""The Jungle Book"" creates a fantastic world alive with all the wonder and possibility one's imagination is capable."
AV Club," April 14, 2016",Ignatiy Vishnevetsky," Talking animals have never looked so good, which is a bigger feat than it sounds."
San Francisco Chronicle," April 14, 2016",Peter Hartlaub," It's amazing to think that throughout this nearly two-hour film, there is just one flesh-and-blood character who spends more than a few seconds on screen, and he's arguably among the least defined."
Chicago Tribune," April 14, 2016",Michael Phillips, Favreau's fundamental decency and relatively light touch serve him well. He has a knack for straight-ahead pacing and for tightening the screws (the movie is 81 percent life-and-death peril and 19 percent comic relief) without being maniacal about it.
Seattle Times," April 14, 2016",Moira MacDonald," The film moves us swiftly from one breathtaking scene to another: a dramatic mudslide; a climb up a near-vertical rock face (by a bear who'd really rather take a nap); a fairy-tale-misty lagoon, where water blends seamlessly with sky."
Flick Filosopher," April 14, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson," Goes right up to the bleeding edge of cinema to tell a story that is strapping yet simple, and hugely appealing. Disney found a good reason to redo an old film."
Las Vegas Weekly," April 13, 2016",Josh Bell," The tone is an awkward mix of savage jungle naturalism and cuddly animal antics, and it only confuses things further when the filmmakers throw in a couple of songs from the original movie."
Herald Sun (Australia)," April 13, 2016",Leigh Paatsch, Such is the immediacy and authenticity of The Jungle Book's spellbinding imagery that you barely notice the storytelling never quite comes together in the same satisfying way.
Newsday," April 13, 2016",Rafer Guzman," Stunning animation and big-screen thrills, but be warned that this is a much scarier movie than the animated 1967 version."
NUVO Newsweekly," April 13, 2016",Edward Johnson-Ott, The Jungle Book is a visually stunning adventure film.
San Jose Mercury News," April 13, 2016",Tony Hicks," Disney did pretty much everything right here. Favreau and screenwriter Justin Marks created a winning foundation, and Disney certainly cast the right voice actors."
NOW Toronto," April 13, 2016",Norman Wilner," While cartoon panthers, bears and orangutans singing, dancing and fighting is the stuff of pure joy, watching lifelike animals do the same thing isn't nearly as pleasurable."
Starburst," April 13, 2016",Iain McNally, The Jungle Book is one of those rare beasts; a loving update to an enduring tale that actually works.
Honolulu Star-Advertiser," April 13, 2016",Burl Burlingame," The point where it breaks loose is when the movie shifts mood and tone in order to reprise the cheesy pop songs from the 1967 animated film. Way to renew copyright, Disney!"
honeycuttshollywood.com," April 13, 2016",Kirk Honeycutt, 'The Jungle Book' transports you back to childhood games surrounded by a photo-reality that commands awe with every frame.
Us Weekly," April 13, 2016",Mara Reinstein," A dazzling, charming and utterly immersive 3-D experience, it's sure to capture the imagination of moviegoers of all ages. "
Wall Street Journal," April 14, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," The new production, computer-animated except for a living, breathing boy at the center of the action, isn't pretty or sweet but utterly stunning, as well as very funny."
Collider," April 14, 2016",Matt Goldberg," The Jungle Book could be a much tighter movie, both narratively and thematically, and yet emotionally, it has a lot of heart."
Christianity Today," April 14, 2016",Alissa Wilkinson," The real question, as for any remake, is simple: does it hold up? In the case of this Jungle Book... yes, and yes against all odds,"
The Spectator," April 14, 2016",Deborah Ross," You won't care it's been done before, because it's never been done like this."
Chicago Daily Herald," April 14, 2016",Dann Gire," Jungle Book merges these astonishing visuals with classic Disney story conventions to create a movie that stands on its own achievements, while paying musical homage to Disney's 1967 original Jungle Book."
IGN Movies," April 14, 2016",Terri Schwartz," Disney's return to the story of The Jungle Book might feel bigger and look better than anything that's come before, but at its core is a very human tale that resonates just as strongly no matter how spectacular its visual wrappings."
Kansas City Star," April 14, 2016",Loey Lockerby," Although its stumbles are odd and baffling, ""The Jungle Book"" approaches greatness often enough to be worthwhile."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," April 14, 2016",Colin Covert," It is a banquet of storytelling delicacy, exciting light drama, athletic action and computer-generated imagery that is more hyper-real than real. After every delicious scene, I wanted seconds."
St. Louis Post-Dispatch," April 14, 2016",Calvin Wilson," With its combination of state-of-the-art technology and old-school charm, ""The Jungle Book"" should thrill children and adults alike."
Mark Reviews Movies," April 14, 2016",Mark Dujsik," It all works well enough, despite the hiccups and especially as a marker of where CG technology is at the moment."
Tampa Bay Times," April 14, 2016",Steve Persall," After two outdated live action and one beloved animated versions, director Jon Favreau crafts a marvelous hybrid, practically a one-boy show with CGI animal-ated realism. This Jungle Book on screen may look exactly as Kipling imagined."
Reeling Reviews," April 14, 2016",Laura Clifford, You will believe that animals can talk. Director Jon Favreau...has conquered the artificiality of CGI with a team of artists who have recreated an environment and its animals with startling realism.
Associated Press," April 14, 2016",Lindsey Bahr, The Jungle Book is one of the stronger of Disney's live-action adaptations. It's a true family-friendly adventure that's smart and often thrilling.
The Verge," April 14, 2016",Tasha Robinson," It's hard to see any of the Disney remakes as standalone experiences, not living in the shadow of classics. This atmospheric, evocative, and above all, powerful Jungle Book at least makes an effort to come out of those shadows."
One Guy's Opinion," April 14, 2016",Frank Swietek, A pretty conventional if consistently engaging boy's adventure story [that's] a breathtaking visual feast.
Charlotte Observer," April 14, 2016",Lawrence Toppman, This story is a new look at a narrative that was already ancient when Kipling wrote 12 decades ago.
Washington Post," April 14, 2016",Ann Hornaday," Like all classic Disney productions, ""The Jungle Book"" possesses its share of fear, suffering and loss. But somehow the audience comes out whistling - in this case, with joy and quite a bit of awe."

Arizona Republic," April 14, 2016",Randy Cordova," Wow. Just, wow."

BuzzFeed News," April 14, 2016",Alison Willmore, The new Jungle Book proves movie technology still has the power to create a sense of wonder.
National Post," April 14, 2016",Chris Knight," The real jungle may be a fragile place full of endangered species, but in the eyes of a man-cub it is everything, encompassing heaven and hell in equal measure. That's a wide and appealing canvas for a director. No need to colour outside the lines."
New York Post," April 14, 2016",Kyle Smith," The plot is episodic, sewing together several tales by Rudyard Kipling, yet Favreau skillfully covers up the seams by increasing the pressure from Shere Khan."
New York Times," April 14, 2016",Manohla Dargis," Studios are in the recycling business, and while this ""The Jungle Book"" is lightly diverting, it is also disappointing, partly because it feels like a pumped-up version of Disney's 1967 animated film, with more action and less sweetness."
Austin Chronicle," April 14, 2016",Steve Davis," This is a match made in movie heaven, given that the critters in Kipling's stories speak and behave like human beings, perfectly suited to Disney's anthropomorphic tradition of walking and talking animals, which began with Mickey Mouse."
Sydney Morning Herald," April 14, 2016",Jake Wilson," The film itself is technically innovative while also being thoroughly, satisfyingly traditional."
The Sunday Age," April 14, 2016",Craig Mathieson," Near seamless in its reproduction of the mythical Indian jungle of Rudyard Kipling's 19th century stories on Hollywood sound stages and hard drives, Disney's latest take on The Jungle Book has a sense of momentum that mostly succeeds."
The National (UAE)," April 14, 2016",James Mottram," Boasting stunning photorealistic CGI, the 3-D visual effects are nothing short of incredible. Right down to the droplets of water nestling in the animals' fur, every detail is perfect."
Toronto Sun," April 14, 2016",Bruce Kirkland," Walt Disney Studios' splendid new version of The Jungle Book is utterly charming, absolutely gorgeous and perhaps too terrifying for the youngest and most impressionable children."
NPR," April 14, 2016",Andrew Lapin," Though darker in tone, and more suitable for older kids, Disney's new take retains the undeniably fun spirit of the earlier film."
Boston Globe," April 14, 2016",Ty Burr," Favreau has proved he can make big studio contraptions seem warm and nearly human - he's the Baloo of filmmakers - and the great strength of this ""Jungle Book"" is how busy it is with personalities and incident."
Independent (UK)," April 14, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab, The latest attempt to bring Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli to the screen is a triumph - a painstakingly crafted digital 3D movie whose astonishing visual effects are complemented by very sure-footed storytelling and tremendous voice-work. 
New York Magazine/Vulture," April 14, 2016",David Edelstein," It's dazzling - almost no one will dislike it. Its director, Jon Favreau, knows his audience, and he has enough skill and honest enthusiasm to win over all but the most determined skeptics."

Forbes," April 14, 2016",Mark Hughes," [A] remarkable film achievement. It's visually breathtaking, emotionally thrilling... [T]he best Disney live action adaptation..."
Cinemalogue.com," April 14, 2016",Rubin Safaya, The film creates a clear sense of right and wrong; violence and greed are blinding forces that threaten a delicate balance upon which all depend.

WaffleMovies.com," April 15, 2016",Willie Waffle," A thrilling, frightening series of chases, battles and characters facing the ultimate demise at every turn. Then, they sing The Bare Necessities. "
Video-Reviewmaster.com," April 15, 2016",Steve Crum, The story has never been more captivating.

Detroit News," April 15, 2016",Adam Graham," A film that will be celebrated, and rightly so, as one of the year's best family films. It's the rare remake that gets things right, and Favreau makes this ""Book"" a genuine page-turner."

EricDSnider.com," April 15, 2016",Eric D. Snider," With a screenplay that actually added dimension to the familiar characters instead of just giving them more things to say, this could have been a massive achievement instead of just a good one."
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," April 14, 2016",Maricar Estrella," It's one of the few films in which the 3D enhancement is justified. Each scene captures the essence of each animal so vividly that children in the audience were reaching out to the screen to try to ""touch"" the fur."
Lyles' Movie Files," April 14, 2016",Jeffrey Lyles, Magical filmmaking and the new definitive work of Favreau's career.
Examiner.com," April 14, 2016",Travis Hopson," It's hard to imagine a film that can do justice to Kipling's story better than Favreau's ""The Jungle Book"" has done. "
"Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)"," April 14, 2016",Bob Bloom," Overall, ""The Jungle Book"" is enjoyable. But, it would have been better if - like last year's live-action ""Cinderella"" - it had downplayed the animated aspects of its earlier incarnation."

Daily Mail (UK)," April 14, 2016",Brian Viner," The combination of live action and computer-generated imagery works an absolute treat, and director Jon Favreau (whose eclectic CV includes Iron Man and Chef, in which he also starred) teases a nigh-on perfect performance from young Neel Sethi."
Empire Magazine," April 14, 2016",Chris Hewitt (UK)," Wonderful to look at, this is a more adult, more complex affair than its animated, and more entertaining, forebear. Still, it's Disney's best live-action adaptation yet."
Cine Premiere," April 14, 2016",Arturo Magaña, An unnecessary sequel that becomes a perfect homage to the animated classic. [Full review in Spanish]
Fort Worth Weekly," April 15, 2016",Kristian M. Lin," This one has moments of undeniable splendor, but it hasn't uncovered enough new material in the stories to really justify the effort."
