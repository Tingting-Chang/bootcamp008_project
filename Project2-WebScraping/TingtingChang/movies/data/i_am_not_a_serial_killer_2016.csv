sbs.com.au," October 7, 2016",Briony Kidd, This is nothing less than a cult classic in the making.
The Age (Australia)," September 30, 2016",Jake Wilson, Intriguing if not groundbreaking.
The Australian," September 30, 2016",David Stratton, A moderately suspenseful low-budget thriller.
ABC Radio (Australia)," September 28, 2016",CJ Johnson," Curious low-budget thriller, shot on 16mm, has a certain hand-sewn élan ... The whole thing has quite a unique tone - a blend of extremely dry humor, creepy low-key horror, and retro-styled aesthetics - that atone for its somewhat over-extended runtime."
The Sunday Age," September 27, 2016",Craig Mathieson," The humour is bleak, but [Max] Records, one-time star of Where the Wild Things Are, gives the movie a compelling centre before it changes tack once again."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," September 15, 2016",Colin Covert, It's a twisted treasure.
FILMINK (Australia)," September 14, 2016",Travis Johnson, ...a great little thriller with a distinctive voice...
Screen-Space," September 9, 2016",Simon Foster," [Could] A.M.P.A.S. see past the film's genre roots (horror rarely gets noticed) to award Lloyd, one of Hollywood's most beloved ageing icons?"
Salt Lake Tribune," September 8, 2016",Sean P. Means, A cleverly conceived little horror-thriller.
Times-Picayune," August 31, 2016",Mike Scott, A diabolical little genre-defying tale that combines a dash of dark humor with a larger dose of just plain darkness.
Under the Radar," August 29, 2016",Zach Hollwedel, I Am Not a Serial Killer shines in its exploration of what it is like to live with inclinations you wish you didn't have but find it increasingly hard to fight.
NYC Movie Guru," August 27, 2016",Avi Offer," An effective blend of drama, mystery, horror, dark comedy and sci-fi. It deserves to become a cult classic"
RogerEbert.com," August 26, 2016",Simon Abrams, The arbitrary value of life in I Am Not a Serial Killer makes its nature as an ostensibly character-driven mystery that much harder to swallow. 
Reason Online," August 26, 2016",Kurt Loder," A tidy genre mash-up - part teen flick, part gruesome crime tale, and part...well, something else, which I won't go into."
The Film Stage," August 25, 2016",Jared Mobarak, O'Brien pulls no punches bringing this horrific nightmare to life.
New York Times," August 25, 2016",Daniel M. Gold, A well-filmed indie that doesn't let its low budget get in the way of some true chills.
AV Club," August 25, 2016",Katie Rife," A uniquely wry tone sets the film apart. I Am Not A Serial Killer is unmistakably a drama, but it's a strangely cheerful one given its dark subject matter."
Village Voice," August 24, 2016",Michael Atkinson, The idea of witnessing a killing spree from the p.o.v. of a town's funeral home is full of rich discomfort. It's the stuff of the sub-subgenre itself that gives you a boregasm.
We Got This Covered," August 23, 2016",Matt Donato," I Am Not A Serial Killer is a devious production that uses its title as a distraction, only to present a much more interesting story when we least expect it."
Aisle Seat," August 23, 2016",Mike McGranaghan, Exquisitely acted and creepy as hell. Christopher Lloyd gives one of the year's most essential-to-see performances.
Financial Times," December 27, 2016",Nigel Andrews, I Am Not a Serial Killer is Dostoevsky in Minnesota. Spiritually if not literally.
CineVue," December 19, 2016",John Bleasdale, Never quite escapes its adolescent inspiration.
Times (UK)," December 13, 2016",Kate Muir, Enjoyably gory and wry.
Observer (UK)," December 11, 2016",Mark Kermode," [Sinks] its storytelling teeth deep enough to draw blood, while still retaining the flesh-wound frivolity of cackling morbid fun."
Irish Times," December 10, 2016",Tara Brady," A sour, wicked film that neither looks nor feels like the rest of the busy sub-genre."
Radio Times," December 8, 2016",David Aldridge," Originality is hard to come by, especially in horror films, but there's a good dose of it in this stylish and beguiling little chiller based on the first book in Dan Wells's YA book series."
Daily Express (UK)," December 8, 2016",Allan Hunter," I Am Not A Serial Killer may have some gloopy, gory moments but rather than the full-on chiller you might expect, it is slow and brooding, gothic and decidedly odd."
Guardian," December 8, 2016",Mike McCahill, A pleasingly macabre study of a mixed-up teen who could be a Dexter-in-waiting.
Film Ireland Magazine," December 8, 2016",James Phelan, What an unexpected and enjoyably unpleasant surprise this film is.
iNews.co.uk," December 8, 2016",Matthew Turner, Christopher Lloyd delivers his creepiest performance since Roger Rabbit's Judge Doom in this intriguingly off-beat indie thriller.
HeyUGuys," December 8, 2016",Stefan Pape," An alternative, subversive thriller steeped in cinematic tradition."
Empire Magazine," December 8, 2016",Hamish Macbain," O'Brien here both successfully reintroduces Max Records to the world, and elicits Christopher Lloyd's best performance in a long time. His film deserves cult classic status at the very least."
Time Out," December 6, 2016",David Clack, There's a touch of 'Stranger Things' about this lo-fi indie horror. 
The List," December 5, 2016",Katherine McLaughlin, The strong screenplay demonstrates such an intuitive understanding of human emotion and despair that it elevates this genre gem into something strangely tender.
Total Film," December 5, 2016",Matt Glasby," Intelligent, original and committed, it's also a little meandering. But Records cuts a strikingly amoral figure, and the sight of Christopher Lloyd intoning poetry over dying embers reminds us what a wonderful actor he is."
ArtsHub," December 4, 2016",Sarah Ward," Appropriately unnerving yet searching, dark yet cheerful."
RTÉ (Ireland)," December 1, 2016",Alan Corr, A weird little morsel with a lingering aftertaste.
SciFiNow," October 14, 2016",Jonathan Hatfull," The pacing and subject matter may alienate some viewers, but this is the kind of film that deserves to find a cult audience. It's a chilling, surprising and sensitive horror that you won't forget in a hurry."
Sight and Sound," October 8, 2016",Anton Bitel," an affectionate, often funny look at small-town slaughter, with a killer protagonist for whom it is all too easy to root."
Starburst," October 7, 2016",Scott Clark," It's an engrossing feature which grants Christopher Lloyd one of his best roles in years, whilst letting Max Records flaunt his undeniable talents as a sympathetic lead. Horror fans will really enjoy this fresh examination of the nature of monsters."
Slant Magazine," August 23, 2016",Oleg Ivanov, The film comes unsettlingly close to being an apologia for the kind of violence that stems from adolescent disaffection.
Variety," March 29, 2016",Andrew Barker, Max Records gives a sharp performance in this endearing first adaptation of Dan Wells' YA series.
Austin Chronicle," March 15, 2016",Richard Whittaker," Breathtakingly innovative, delightfully ghoulish, and insightfully unconventional."
Screen International," March 15, 2016",Wendy Ide, A sticky vein of macabre humour is a key selling point for this genre-blurring adaptation of the cult novel by Dan Wells.
