Eye for Film," December 2, 2016",Jennie Kermode," Although there have been a number of films about this saga, Edelman's is unique in its thoroughness."
Laramie Movie Scope," November 23, 2016",Robert Roten," This documentary details that long journey from the 1960s to the new millennium in societal and racial changes, as well as changes in the enigmatic O.J.

HeyUGuys," July 12, 2016",Jon Lyus," Ezra Edelman has painted a first-class portrait of the most divisive of icons, juxtaposing his rise and fall with an eventful period of American history. This is an excellent documentary - a credit to ESPN's 30 for 30 series."

Film Experience," June 28, 2016",Glenn Dunks," It's an indictment on so many people it's hard to keep track, but ultimately it's a sad and troubling glimpse into a part of American life and culture that, to this day, remains as relevant as ever."

AV Club," June 8, 2016",Noel Murray," It's a journalistic marvel, assembling fact after fact and observation after observation into a portrait far more complex overall than it appears at any given moment."
Paste Magazine," June 8, 2016",Tim Grierson," Sports are never just sports -- they're an extension of the race and class issues we experience daily. O.J. Simpson symbolized something powerful in our collective unconscious. And as this movie demonstrates, his fall from grace was partly ours."

RogerEbert.com," June 8, 2016",Brian Tallerico," ""OJ: Made in America"" should be a conversation-starter, a way to discuss what happened in the '80s and '90s in terms of race and celebrity and what it says about today. OJ's story may be over. Ours is not."

The New Republic," June 2, 2016",Sarah Weinman," Edelman helps us understand why the O.J. verdict was inevitable; it was, in essence, a grand act of jury nullification.
