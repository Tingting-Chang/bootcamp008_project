PopMatters," February 9, 2017",Elena Razlogova," Loach's downtrodden heroes usually find some way to sustain hope, in family or in humor, in individual ingenuity or collective kindness. But this time, the filmmaker's own anger at systemic, interminable inequities threatens to overcome his optimism."
The Atlantic," February 9, 2017",David Sims," There's a heightened edge to I, Daniel Blake, an embittered streak of comedy that keeps the otherwise miserable plot from weighing too heavily."
South China Morning Post," February 3, 2017",James Mottram," Frank, unsentimental but fuelled by good nature and an earthy humour, the film reminds you of Loach's great works in the early '90s like Raining Stones and Ladybird, Ladybird."
Associated Press," January 6, 2017",Jocelyn Noveck," In the end, the title, seemingly unremarkable, reveals itself as especially poignant. Daniel is crying out for recognition as an ""I"" -- even if he can't contribute, even if he needs help for a while. "
Rolling Stone," January 6, 2017",Peter Travers," This new Ken Loach landmark sums up everything that has kept his muckraking motor running for decades. An old-school social realist, the 80-year-old filmmaker again speaks up for the exploited lower classes,"
Paste Magazine," January 5, 2017",Brogan Morris," If you want reality -- if you want an idea, for one, as to how the British people could become so despairing that they would do something as drastic as vote to leave the European Union -- see I, Daniel Blake."
Entertainment Weekly," January 5, 2017",Chris Nashawaty, Loach's film isn't as stridently political as it probably sounds. These are just proud people who want to be treated with respect.
Common Sense Media," January 3, 2017",Barbara Shulgasser, Grim drama about heartless welfare system; language. 
The Young Folks," January 1, 2017",Gary Shannon," Ken Loach's I, Daniel Blake is so unyieldingly empathetic that even its bleakest moments carry an air of triumph. "
PopMatters," December 30, 2016",Alex Ramon," I, Daniel Blake undoubtedly has its heart in the right place; it's a shame that Loach and Laverty's good intentions haven't resulted, in the end, in better cinema."
Christian Science Monitor," December 30, 2016",Peter Rainer," Loach's low-key naturalism, which barely masks his fury at the injustices perpetrated on screen, is matched by Dave Johns's performance as Daniel."
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 28, 2016",Tim Brayton," A hectoring political op-ed about The State Of Britain Today, but when you've been hectored by Loach, you've been hectored by the very best."

RogerEbert.com," December 23, 2016",Christy Lemire," I, Daniel Blake is an extremely Ken Loach-y Ken Loach film, for better and for worse."
New York Times," December 22, 2016",Stephen Holden," ""I, Daniel Blake"" is a powerful return to form for Mr. Loach, the much-honored left-wing British filmmaker who is now 80 and is still in full command as a filmmaker and a social critic."

Variety," May 12, 2016",Owen Gleiberman," ""I, Daniel Blake"" is one of Loach's finest films, a drama of tender devastation that tells its story with an unblinking neorealist simplicity that goes right back to the plainspoken purity of Vittorio De Sica."
Guardian," May 12, 2016",Peter Bradshaw," This film intervenes in the messy, ugly world of poverty with the secular intention of making us see that it really is happening, and in a prosperous nation, too. I, Daniel Blake is a movie with a fierce, simple dignity of its own."
Screen International," May 12, 2016",Wendy Ide," While it might not break new ground, there is no denying the potency of the film's empathetic anguish and fury."
Hollywood Reporter," May 12, 2016",David Rooney," While the framework and perspective are familiar, the veteran Brit director's films can still have the power to grip us in an emotional chokehold."

La Jornada," May 16, 2016",Leonardo Garcia Tsao," Everything is very noble and the political correctness is added to the film sober correction. However, screenwriter Paul Laverty frequently resorts to sentimentality to make clearer the drama of Daniel Blake. [Full review in spanish]"
El Pais (Spain)," May 16, 2016",Carlos Boyero," Loach doesn't give a break neither to the poor protanonist or the scared viewer. Everything that he display emerges truth, anger, indignation and denial from that prestigious and unreal thing called social justice. [Full review in Spanish]"

The Sun (UK)," October 20, 2016",Jamie East, The bluntly black-and-white approach to characterisation is all that jolts you from an otherwise absorbing narrative.
Radio Times," October 20, 2016",Damon Wise," I, Daniel Blake is a small film about unheard voices that punches above its weight, made all the more relevant in the wake of the EU referendum."
Daily Mail (UK)," October 20, 2016",Brian Viner," Loach is a remarkably accomplished film-maker, with an amazing body of work, but this is not him at the top of his game. Which is not to say I don't recommend seeing it."

Daily Telegraph (UK)," October 20, 2016",Robbie Collin," While it too often sands the complications off what you sense should feel like an uncomfortably splintery issue, in its best moments, it's a quietly fearsome piece of drama."
Sensacine," October 20, 2016",Paula Arantzazu Ruiz, A film with a message in danger of becoming obsolete for a public that needs other representations of economic inequalities far from the cliche of misery.[Full review in Spanish]

NOW Toronto," September 9, 2016",Norman Wilner," Like most of Loach and Laverty's recent output, this is a solidly crafted drama with a couple of piercing moments. But it's also a movie designed to make a point rather than tell a story."

Cinemanía (Spain)," October 25, 2016",Carlos Marañón," Loach returned to cinema staying true to his style, appealing to his social humanism with this film. [Full review in Spanish]"

Daily Express (UK)," October 23, 2016",Henry Fitzherbert," If at times the plotting feels a little manufactured to make certain points, the humanity of the characters and their quiet suffering is moving and aided by outstanding performances; especially from Squires."
Observer (UK)," October 23, 2016",Mark Kermode," A gut-wrenching tragicomic drama (about ""a monumental farce"") that blends the timeless humanity of the Dardenne brothers' finest works with the contemporary urgency of Loach's own 1966 masterpiece Cathy Come Home."

Slate," December 21, 2016",June Thomas," When the system is rigged, trying to do the right thing wears a man down."
Metro," December 20, 2016",Matt Prigge," The ironic thing is that even when Ken Loach has made something that feels topical, it's really just Loach doing Loach. He's always done his thing, whether anyone, particularly anyone in power, was paying attention."
