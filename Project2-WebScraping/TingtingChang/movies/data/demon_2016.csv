Fort Worth Weekly," January 19, 2017",Kristian M. Lin," [Andrzej Wajda] didn't make this horror film, but his spirit hangs over it."
Daily Dead," December 16, 2016",Heather Wixson," We've seen weddings explored as a chaotic setting in cinema numerous times before, but there's something uniquely compelling and wholly original about what Wrona creates with Demon."
NUVO Newsweekly," October 27, 2016",Sam Watermeier, Demon isn't a bad film; it's a disappointing one.
Georgia Straight," October 27, 2016",Adrian Mack, A fistfight between the bridegroom and one of his guests is the least bad thing that happens at the wedding of Piotr (Itay Tiran) and Zaneta (Agnieszka Zulewska).
Portland Mercury," October 26, 2016",Andrew Wright," Ultimately, what lingers most strongly in Wrona's impressive film is less the actual aberration, and more the examination of how people as a group react to it being in their midst."
KPBS.org," October 7, 2016",Beth Accomando," A swift, elegant film about something dark and harrowing resurfacing from the past to cause havoc in the present."
Salt Lake Tribune," September 29, 2016",Sean P. Means, Tiran and Zulewska give powerful performances as a man overtaken by a malevolent spirit and the new bride who fights to save him from it.
San Diego Reader," September 29, 2016",Scott Marks," Though it's based on Piotr Rowicki's play Clinging, director Marcin Wrona's spirited staging keeps it from ever dissolving into canned theater."
Austin Chronicle," September 29, 2016",Marc Savlov, Not only an instant genre classic but also an astute and affecting rumination on the notion that the shades of the past are always with us and can disrupt us to the point of personal and societal collapse.
Under the Radar," September 29, 2016",Jason Wilson, Demon is a fine film steeped deeply in its culture.
NOW Toronto," September 28, 2016",Norman Wilner," Demon feels too crowded by half, unable to build the momentum it needs to really get under our skin."
Film Comment Magazine," September 26, 2016",Ela Bittencourt," For a tale of repressed guilt, Demon sparkles with humor, reveling in the macabre."
Detroit News," September 23, 2016",Adam Graham," ""Demon"" is a testament to a still-budding talent, and it would have been fascinating to see where he went next."
East Bay Express," September 22, 2016",Kelly Vance," The past cannot and will not remain covered up. Demon is worth seeing, if only to re-emphasize that."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," September 22, 2016",Colin Covert," Entertaining and deeply screwed up with historic horrors, this is an all-too-human ghost story that wears several bleeding hearts on its sleeve."
Blu-ray.com," September 21, 2016",Brian Orndorf," It isn't always out a frighten audiences, but Wrona has some strong ideas about the hollowing out of a man's soul that keeps the effort engrossing. "
Newcity," September 18, 2016",Ray Pride," This world and the otherworldly embrace in riotous fashion as the wedding party grows more degenerate and destructive through the night. [D]ark seethes into the greater dark. The ordinary will get you, because the extraordinary is directly beneath it. "
The Patriot Ledger," September 17, 2016",Al Alexander, It's a horror picture that derives from the worst horror of the 20th century -- the Holocaust -- and how its ghosts continue to haunt the people of Poland no matter how hard they try to forget.
San Francisco Examiner," September 16, 2016",Anita Katz," Classy and contained and, at the same time, wickedly crazed."
Cambridge Day," September 16, 2016",Tom Meek," You can almost see the filmmaking process with Wrona chumming the waters with macabre tentacles and philosophical probings only to back away and say ""that's it"" sans an explanation or guide-wires."
Time Out," September 6, 2016",Joshua Rothkopf," Nailing a tricky sense of physical anarchy (as well as some far subtler domestic tensions), Marcin Wrona's Polish import is an eerie, extraordinarily poised piece of horror."

ScreenCrush," August 29, 2016",Matt Singer," Whatever Demon's autobiographical elements, this film feels incredibly personal; like a howl of pain ripped straight out of someone's soul."
Variety," August 29, 2016",Joe Leydon," Ambiguity is a worthy artistic goal, of course. But when Demon ends, the audience is left to sort through a thicket of dangling plot threads."
Hollywood Reporter," August 29, 2016",John DeFore," Things head eventually in an abstract direction that may have played better onstage than it does here (""we must forget what we didn't see here,"" guests are eventually instructed), but a compelling atmosphere lingers."
The Nation," August 29, 2016",Stuart Klawans," This subject matter is not unfamiliar, but Demon is imaginative in its approach, faultlessly modulated in execution, and hauntingly faithful to the original subtitle of Der Dibuk: ""Between Two Worlds."""
The Playlist," August 29, 2016",Kimber Myers," Demon is a film that improves the longer it sits with you, as various images seep into your consciousness and reappear without warning."
Birth.Movies.Death.," July 18, 2016",Meredith Borders," DEMON is a prodigious story, one that terrifies and resonates and remains."

Austin American-Statesman," September 24, 2015",Charles Ealy, I highly recommend it.
Electric Sheep," September 24, 2015",Greg Klymkiw," Demon raises many questions, but supplies no easy answers. What it delivers, however, is one of the scariest, most sickeningly creepy horror films of the year."

Washington Post," September 15, 2016",Alan Zilberman," Wrona jumbles several genres together, including dark comedy, to illuminate larger, more ambitious themes."
ComingSoon.net," September 15, 2016",Howard Gorman," As it reaches its culmination, Demon ends on a particularly mysterious and obscure note but it works all the better for it, ensuring it remains lodged in your thoughts long afterwards."
Chicago Reader," September 15, 2016",J. R. Jones," Tonally the film recalls Andrzej Żuławski's shrieking psychodrama Possession, though the key to that movie was its inexplicability and Wrona's movie, with its conventional horror backstory, is much less perplexing."

Christian Science Monitor," September 9, 2016",Peter Rainer," Wrona keeps everything creepily ambiguous right up to the end, when the foggy dawn breaks and what we have witnessed becomes like a dream within a dream."
Metro," September 9, 2016",Matt Prigge," ""Demon"" isn't afraid to be blunt. But bluntness isn't always a crime, and this is a case where a film tries to make a lack of subtlety work for it, not against it."
Film-Forward.com," September 9, 2016",Nora Lee Mandel," Crackling, spookily atmospheric, intelligent, sometimes funny ghost story. It builds on family secrets to take on wider social and historical resonance for Poles and Jews."

Reeling Reviews," September 9, 2016",Laura Clifford," Wrona's film isn't about demonic possession so much as it a ghost story, a piece of shameful history that refuses to be buried (it is telling that the film opens with a tracking shot of a front loader making its way from an excavation site..."

Entertainment Weekly," September 8, 2016",Chris Nashawaty, It's also so weighted down with mysticism and metaphor it forgets to quicken your pulse or whiten your knuckles.
AV Club," September 8, 2016",Katie Rife," More interesting than the horror imagery is the film's painfully somber message-no matter how far we try to run, the sins of history surround us always."
The Film Stage," September 7, 2016",Jared Mobarak, A comedy of errors similar to Death at a Funeral with the tense atmosphere of the unknown calling to mind The Shining for reasons both general and specific..
Film Journal International," September 7, 2016",Maria Garcia," Skillfully realized story of a dybbuk, a diabolical spirit from Jewish folklore who addresses wrongdoings."
Brooklyn Magazine," September 7, 2016",Elina Mishuris," Cynics and pragmatists suggest that unknown factors surface after marriage. Demon, an often auspicious union of satire and horror, offers a variation. "
