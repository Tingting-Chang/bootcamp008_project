Punch Drunk Critics," January 9, 2017",Roxana Hadadi," As much as April and the Extraordinary World veers around a little too often and gets too self-indulgent with its exposition, the film effectively builds a whole other steampunk-inspired world in which viewers can get lost, gas masks and all."
South China Morning Post," June 1, 2016",Edmund Lee, This hand-drawn animated feature by first-time directors Christian Desmares and Franck Ekinci is a steampunk marvel that will enchant both kids and adults with its high-concept premise.

LarsenOnFilm," May 8, 2016",Josh Larsen," Soot and steam seep into every frame, so that you can almost sense the picture wheezing."
"Deseret News, Salt Lake City"," May 6, 2016",Josh Terry, April is a creative and compelling film set in an alternate historic reality that imagines different results from the Industrial Revolution. It's essentially a steampunk fantasy with subtitles.
Mark Reviews Movies," May 6, 2016",Mark Dujsik, The film seems constantly ready to collapse under the weight of its absurdity ... but it never does.
Salt Lake Tribune," May 5, 2016",Sean P. Means," There's enough imagination in the French-made animated adventure April and the Extraordinary World to spread across 10 movies, and enough visual wonder to match its tricky plot."
Chicago Reader," May 5, 2016",Dmitry Samarov," Should appeal to precocious children... Adults may find it as derivative and simplistic as the steampunk aesthetic to which it's indebted, but for a gateway to more resonant cinema and literature, you could do worse."
Newcity," May 4, 2016",Ray Pride," Smart, clever, ceaselessly dazzling steampunk, drawn entirely from French visual sources, about a family of scientists obsessed with longevity from the pen of artist Jacques Tardi, set in an alternate Paris, where the Industrial Revolution never happened."
Tucson Weekly," April 25, 2016",Bob Grimm," April and the Extraordinary World is really, really weird. It's also really, really great,"

Blu-ray.com," April 13, 2016",Brian Orndorf," It's an oddball animated picture, but often wonderfully so."
The Patriot Ledger," April 9, 2016",Al Alexander," It cavalierly toys with the history of the mechanized world, making you thankful we have luxuries like cars and electricity. But it also makes an equally solid argument that it's those luxuries we depend on that are choking the life out of our planet. "
Washington Post," April 7, 2016",Stephanie Merry," In truth, the story is practically beside the point with all the spectacular visuals."
AV Club," March 22, 2016",Noel Murray, The movie's Jules Verne-esque contraptions are fun to look at -- and will make steampunk fans drool with delight -- but by no means do Tardi and company want viewers to feel nostalgic for this alternate past.
Village Voice," March 22, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," An all-too-rare example of steampunk done right - which also acknowledges that, however pretty such industrial imagery might seem from afar, actually living in such a world would be kind of horrible."

San Francisco Chronicle," April 7, 2016",G. Allen Johnson," If you're a steampunk fan, by all means go. Just don't expect a classic."
The Sunday Age," April 6, 2016",Craig Mathieson," It's a two-dimensional world on the screen, but the imagination at work is definitely in three dimensions."

Vox," March 29, 2016",Todd VanDerWerff," It's a loose, scrappy tale that blends pulpy adventure with a young woman's coming of age, and then adds a healthy dollop of mad science."
