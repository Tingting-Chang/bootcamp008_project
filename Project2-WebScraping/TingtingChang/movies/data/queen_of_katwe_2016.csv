National Review," November 4, 2016",Armond White," Queen of Katwe may suggest the title of a Disney animated princess (like the lamentable The Princess and the Frog), but all possibilities of romantic fantasy are submerged in the film's semi-documentary reporting on eternal Third World poverty."

HeyUGuys," September 11, 2016",Stefan Pape," Nair has created a film with an indelibly enchanting tone, enhanced by the use of traditional African music that helps inform the atmosphere and add a distinctive geniality to proceedings."

San Francisco Chronicle," September 21, 2016",David Lewis," Chess is not the most visual of games, but Nair makes these competitions come alive. She also gets the most out of her mostly nonprofessional African cast, not to mention her two stars, Oyelowo and Nyong'o."
