Clarín," February 9, 2017",Pablo A. Scholz," Pablo Larraín's film, before a biopic, is a movie that plays with the dispute of who is its protagonist, whether the poet or the detective who pursues him. [Full review in Spanish]"
La Nación (Argentina)," February 9, 2017",Alejandro Lingenti," With humor and irreverence, Larraín draws his own Neruda in this provocative and baroque film. [Full review in Spanish]"

One Guy's Opinion," January 29, 2017",Frank Swietek," An engrossing blend of poet and filmmaker, of history and art, done up in florid period style."
Eye for Film," January 27, 2017",Jennie Kermode," Luis Gnecco is perfect in the title role, charismatic but understated, capable of captivating others with his speech but not too good looking, so we never make the mistake of interpreting the feelings he inspires as simple lust. "
Blu-ray.com," January 26, 2017",Brian Orndorf," The essentials of transformation and urgency are well preserved by the production, which strives to turn Neruda's exile into wandering saga of obsession and self-preservation."
Willamette Week," January 25, 2017",Grace Culhane," t is a celebration of Neruda, but it's also a celebration of all that his work celebrates; an ode to the beauty of art and architecture and the natural world in honor of the master of odes."
Killer Movie Reviews," January 22, 2017",Andrea Chase," As a portrait of an artist with imperfections and genius, it has a truth that mere reportage cannot approach. As a portrait of a country grappling with applying abstract ideology to human endeavor, it is unimpeachable."
East Bay Express," January 20, 2017",Kelly Vance," Gnecco, García, and Morán's performances are succinct and beguiling, Larraín's touch is graceful."
Georgia Straight," January 19, 2017",Ken Eisner," The mix of visual spoofs, mind games, and classical music is hugely entertaining, even if the realities of an emerging police state aren't ignored."

San Francisco Examiner," January 13, 2017",Anita Katz," The actors make the robust, confident Neruda and the thin, self-doubting Peluchonneau riveting psychological, as well as physical, complements."
SF Weekly," January 12, 2017",Sherilyn Connelly," Neruda is ultimately about as historically accurate as Miles Ahead, but like that film, it's also more satisfying and poetically truthful than had it just related events as they happened."
San Francisco Chronicle," January 11, 2017",Walter V. Addiego," This is a serious movie that often feels playful, one that has metafictional ambitions but wears them lightly. You can surrender to the enjoyment of the chase at the film's heart, while not losing sight of Larraín's serious aims."
ArtsHub," January 8, 2017",Sarah Ward, The feature's pleasures and resonance only increase as the real and the illusory intertwine.
Under the Radar," January 6, 2017",Jason Wilson," Larrain's film is still worth watching for its highs and despite the odd misstep, it's a fine film that flirts with being something greater."
Film Experience," January 2, 2017",Nathaniel Rogers, Peluchonneau may not always know what he's doing and Neruda himself may also lean similarly towards self delusion but Larraín himself is always in control of this strangely funny but ultimately moving historical drama. 
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 31, 2016",Tim Brayton, A great piece of cinema and a great attempt to engage with history and pro-people politics.

Hollywood Reporter," May 13, 2016",David Rooney," The film at times is more playful than illuminating, but it's also a handsomely crafted and boldly idiosyncratic contemplation of a great artist for whom political compromise was anathema."
RogerEbert.com," October 19, 2016",Brian Tallerico," Neruda culminates in a series of scenes in the snow that are riveting in terms of what they say about art, history, politics and human nature."

El Pais (Spain)," September 23, 2016",Javier Ocaña, A political film about a poet. And a poetic film about a politician. Something far from being a conventional biopic. [Full review in Spanish]
We Got This Covered," September 23, 2016",Lauren Humphries-Brooks," An exuberant visual poem reflecting the life and politics of the Chilean poet, Neruda is much more than a simple biopic."

rec.arts.movies.reviews," September 9, 2016",Louis Proyect," A fascinating examination of the role of radical artist in bourgeois society that prioritizes the drama of an individual rather than the social drama of a crackdown that anticipated Pinochet. Despite that, it is great filmmaking. "
Collider," September 6, 2016",Brian Formo," Neruda's anti-biopic structure allows the poet to play in the noir and Western genres that a writer of odes might have always wished to have done, but didn't."
Sight and Sound," May 20, 2016",Wendy Ide, A playfully unexpected spin on a historical drama.

Toronto Star," December 15, 2016",Bruce Demara," With great supporting performances and an intelligent script, it's an accomplished and engrossing tale."
Wall Street Journal," December 15, 2016",Joe Morgenstern, A fascinating -- though overlong and sometimes slow -- trackdown fantasy with literary and political resonance.
Metro," December 15, 2016",Matt Prigge," ""Neruda"" is meta-sorta-fiction, always calling attention to its own artificiality. But its sincere about wanting to do the impossible: understand, perhaps even forgive, someone who stands for everything you stand against."
Los Angeles Times," December 15, 2016",Justin Chang," Drolly and persuasively, the movie demonstrates that when it comes to evoking the artist and the nature of his art, historical fidelity and literal-minded dramatization go only so far."
AV Club," December 15, 2016",Mike D'Angelo," The more Neruda departs from historical fact, the more trenchant it becomes. Take note, other filmmakers."

Spirituality and Practice," December 13, 2016",Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, A Chilean film that blends fantasy and realism in its treatment of poet Pablo Neruda and a policeman fascinated with him.
Village Voice," December 12, 2016",Melissa Anderson," Larraín, born in Santiago in 1976, takes an oblique approach to his subject, one of his country's most exalted heroes - a strategy that renders the past always labile and dynamic, never static and turgid."
Compuserve," December 10, 2016",Harvey S. Karten," Eschewing the biopic format, Larrain aims to humanize the Chilean poet, giving us insight into human nature."
FilmDrunk," December 9, 2016",Vincent Mancini," Amply clever and easy on the eyes, though it uses all that cleverness and craft more to deflect than to illuminate. "
Associated Press," December 8, 2016",Lindsey Bahr," Not many directors get a one-two punch like Jackie and Neruda in the same season, but it just makes it all the more clear that Larrain is one of the world's most exciting and imaginative filmmakers, whatever the subject may be."
Laramie Movie Scope," December 2, 2016",Robert Roten," This is a wildly romantic biographical drama about the great poet widely known by his pen name, Pablo Neruda.

NPR," December 29, 2016",Ella Taylor," As in all his movies, Larrain is an expert juggler of tones: by turns antic and lyrical, Neruda is shot with a dark, nocturnal beauty and a mournful orchestral score."
PopMatters," December 28, 2016",Alex Ramon, [An] intriguingly idiosyncratic experience.

Paste Magazine," December 19, 2016",Andy Crump," Each [of Larraín's films] has a plan, each film has a backbone, but their airy and ethereal qualities suggest a penchant for riffing, as though he's filling in the gaps between truth and myth sequence by sequence."

Movie Mezzanine," December 16, 2016",Mallory Andrews, The real trouble is that Neruda is never regarded as anything but a figure of mythic status by his allies.
amNewYork," December 16, 2016",Robert Levin," Bathed in expressive natural light and bestowed with a sense of constant movement, the movie also pulls even further back from the specifics of Neruda's story to depict a battle for the essence of a nation at war with itself."
L.A. Biz," December 16, 2016",Annlee Ellingson, The crafting of identity is at the heart of this highly literary and philosophical noir.
