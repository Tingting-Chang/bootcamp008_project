Fort Worth Weekly," January 19, 2017",Kristian M. Lin, The reasons to see this are Na's expert buildup of sickening dread.
Financial Times," December 27, 2016",Nigel Andrews," Very crazy, very Korean, very long: 156 minutes of murder, diabolism, exorcism and things that go bump by day and night."
CineVue," December 20, 2016",Martyn Conterio," In just three films, Na Hong-jin has emerged as one of South Korean cinema's best kept secrets."
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 17, 2016",Tim Brayton, As great as any horror movie of the 2010s to date.
Concrete Playground," December 16, 2016",Sarah Ward, Packed with everything from gorgeously moody landscapes to an increasingly dark atmosphere.
Seanax.com," December 15, 2016",Sean Axmaker, This is dark and disturbing and surprisingly long-over 2 1/2 hours-and directed with a slow build that churns up the tension as it shifts suspicion around. 
Eye for Film," November 30, 2016",Jennie Kermode," Overall, The Wailing is a deeply flawed but nonetheless compelling film which will cement Na's reputation as a force to be reckoned with."
Times (UK)," November 29, 2016",Kate Muir, A complex Korean horror with the surreal village feel of Twin Peaks.
Radio Times," November 24, 2016",Alan Jones," The well-created atmospheres of bleak desolation, shivery seat-edged thrills and sheer-intensity of spirit-world dabbling paper over the more nonsensical sections of the scattershot narrative that does eventually build to quite a chilling crescendo."
Guardian," November 24, 2016",Phil Hoad," The layers of dissembling and self-dissembling pile up so thickly that not only does Na evidently touch on something integral about the nature of evil, but actually seems to be in the process of summoning it before your eyes."
Little White Lies," November 21, 2016",Anton Bitel," By turns funny and despairing, this village noir brings the horror of uncertainty."
Time Out," November 21, 2016",Tom Huddleston," A stupendously entertaining movie, crammed with delights."
The List," November 21, 2016",Matt Glasby," The result is striking, frustrating and - whisper it - ripe for remaking."
Total Film," November 21, 2016",Simon Kinnear," This is a queasily funny, often exhausting but genuinely unnerving watch."
Empire Magazine," November 21, 2016",David Hughes," The Wailing takes its time to burrow under your skin, but by the time it weaves its dark, potent spell, it leaves you with a lingering, unshakeable sense of dread that Hollywood horror films can rarely muster."
Cinemanía (Spain)," November 15, 2016",Rubén Romero Santos," A lesson of classic cinema, script, composition of planes, use of the sound and photography that rubs the perfection. [Full review in Spanish]"
South China Morning Post," November 2, 2016",James Mottram," The Wailing isn't quite dynamic enough to truly terrorise, but ... there are ferocious moments that puncture the stillness."
Starburst," October 21, 2016",Scott Clark," The results are two-fold: firstly, it's an entrancing experience elevated beyond the simple mechanics of what's expected, secondly, it makes a huge group of contemporary western thrillers seem comparatively dispensable."
The Arts Desk," October 14, 2016",Adam Sweeting," Farce frequently threatens to intervene, but the thunderous shamanistic rituals give you your money's worth."
The Blu Spot," October 13, 2016",Jeff Beck," The Wailing features some fine direction from Na Hong-jin, gorgeous cinematography, and an intriguing mystery, but it all ends up being smothered in an excessive 157-minute runtime that the story simply can't fill."
Screen International," May 31, 2016",Jason Bechervaise," Its sheer intensity and ambiguous narrative might put off some viewers, but this latest film could well be regarded as one of the best films to emerge from Korea in recent years."
Hollywood Reporter," May 31, 2016",Deborah Young," The Wailing is long and involving, permeated by a tense, sickening sense of foreboding, yet finally registers on a slightly lower key than the director's acclaimed genre films The Chaser and The Yellow Sea."
Film School Rejects," May 31, 2016",Rob Hunter," A journey fraught with atmosphere, mystery, grim discoveries... and maybe a few laughs?"
The Film Stage," May 25, 2016",Zhuo-Ning Su," Visually speaking, the lurid spookfest is an absolute stunner."
Slant Magazine," May 25, 2016",Chuck Bowen," Na Hong-jin's The Wailing is a work of thriller maximal-ism, a rare case of more actually being more rather than less."
indieWire," May 23, 2016",David Ehrlich, Na Hong-jin's spellbinding and scatterbrained new film is 156 minutes of demented occult nonsense that gradually begins to feel less like a linear scary story than that it does a ritualistic invocation of the antichrist. 
The Playlist," May 21, 2016",Nikola Grozdanovic," A bullet train of laughs, gore, frights and folklore."
Variety," May 19, 2016",Maggie Lee, Korean genre maestro Na Hong-jin turns his attention to a nonsensical yet entertaining supernatural thriller.
Entertainment Weekly," June 9, 2016",Clark Collis," Despite its epic length, The Wailing never bores as Na slathers his tale with generous supplies of atmosphere and awfulness."
Playboy Online," June 9, 2016",Stephen Rebello," The Wailing is a grab-you-by-the-throat stunner, by far the best thrill machine of the year so far."
Arizona Republic," June 9, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," It's an unforgiving film, one whose story you may question when it's over. But you won't forget it."
Smells Like Screen Spirit," June 6, 2016",Chase Whale," A nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat wallop, The Wailing is the most frightening movie of the year. "
Examiner.com," June 3, 2016",Chris Sawin," The Wailing is a soon to be discovered gem that is riveting, brilliantly written, impeccably acted, and masterfully filmed. The Wailing is without a doubt one of the year's best films."
Mark Reviews Movies," June 3, 2016",Mark Dujsik, [Writer/director Hong-jin] Na is not concerned with finding a logical through line for his supernatural tale. He's looking to uncover the emotional one.
Collider," June 3, 2016",Brian Formo, There was a point in The Wailing where I was ready to declare this one of the best exorcism films of all time. It's still high up there for the genre. But then it just kept going and going and going.
Metro," June 3, 2016",Matt Prigge," Like 'Green Room,' it's an extreme genre piece where the heroes are regular folks, who aren't equipped to handle something irregular."
Paste Magazine," June 3, 2016",Andy Crump," Na trades in doubt and especially despair more than in what we think of as ""horror."" He isn't out to terrify us. He's out to corrode our souls, much in the same way that his protagonist's faith is corroded."
RogerEbert.com," June 3, 2016",Simon Abrams," It may be impossible to turn off your brain while watching ""The Wailing,"" but that makes the film's visceral charms that much more admirably vexing."
Los Angeles Times," June 2, 2016",Justin Chang," ""The Wailing"" is the rare commercial thriller whose feverish manipulations can't be dismissed as merely callous or exploitative."
NPR," June 2, 2016",Mark Jenkins," The Wailing is a Hell of a ride, but Na should have given more thought to its destination."
Film Journal International," June 2, 2016",Maitland McDonagh," The Wailing is a wild ride, but it's no generic scare machine."
Reeling Reviews," June 2, 2016",Laura Clifford," reminiscent of ""Memories of Murder"" with its comical cops, awful crimes, rural locations and incessant rain, ""The Wailing"" adds a supernatural aspect which Hong-Jin keeps twisting, throwing us and his protagonist off balance until the very last moments."
Salon.com," June 2, 2016",Andrew O'Hehir," ""The Wailing"" is something like the most gruesome and gripping Scandinavian crime drama you can imagine, transported to a rain-sodden Asian backwater where everyone's in a bad mood and science, religion and superstition are locked in uneasy combat."
We Got This Covered," June 1, 2016",Matt Donato," Swirling an air of majesty, The Wailing is poetry in motion - if your prose were full of mangled corpses, undead spirits, and tales of sinister takeovers."
Den of Geek," June 1, 2016",Edward Douglas," If you're a serious horror fan, then you absolutely must add The Wailing to your must-see list this year."
AV Club," June 1, 2016",Benjamin Mercer," The Wailing might be a somewhat meandering and nonsensical genre recombination, but that spell never breaks over its lengthy running time."
Brooklyn Magazine," June 1, 2016",Keith Uhlich," there's real beauty and devastation in the film's finale, as the harrowing father-daughter relationship reaches its apex"
Village Voice," June 1, 2016",Michael Nordine, Both a high-minded zombie flick and a visceral lament for broken family bonds.
ChaseWhale.com," October 7, 2016",Chase Whale," THE WAILING doesn't rely on many jump scares and what makes it so horrifying is the story. It challenges Heaven and Hell, good versus evil, God, and the Devil, and faith. I'm certain this would be John Milton's favorite film if he were alive today. "
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," September 30, 2016",Brian Gibson, Moments of body-horror and zombie-dom sometimes appall and sometimes seem B-movie-rated. But the possessed Hyo-jin strikes both fear and a kind of awe into the adults around her. If only the film were always so horrifyingly fascinating. 
El antepenúltimo mohicano," August 29, 2016",Ignacio Navarro, A film that brings out the perverse roots of man's doom. [Full review in Spanish]
Vox," August 8, 2016",Aja Romano," The Wailing succeeds at combining a mood of deep unease with visceral gore, buddy cop comedy, and a hallucinogenic mix of horror tropes - a recipe that yields, among other things, an atypical exorcism helmed by an intense Korean shaman."
Austin Chronicle," August 4, 2016",Josh Kupecki," It's a dish with many complex flavors that may seem odd when you see it on the menu, but once you try it, you're not going back to anything else."
JoBlo's Movie Emporium," July 28, 2016",Chris Bumbray," The kind of serious, A-quality horror studios shy away from. A throwback to movies like THE EXORCIST and THE SHINNING. "
The Straits Times (Singapore)," July 27, 2016",Tay Yek Keak," The ensuing suspense and the enveloping paranoia and spookiness -- stretched out by the exhaustive length of the film here -- mean that this film really sucks you in. Even better, there is a terrifically gripping payoff right at the end."
SciFiNow," July 22, 2016",Jonathan Hatfull, This is another superb film from Na Hong-jin.
Salt Lake Tribune," July 15, 2016",Sean P. Means," Na takes his sweet time, more than 2  1/2 hours, to build to his shattering climax -- and yet not a minute of it feels wasted or superfluous. By the end of The Wailing, the audience knows it has been taken on a dark and twisted ride."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," June 30, 2016",Colin Covert, Brace yourself for mythic weirdness.
The Sunday Age," June 27, 2016",Craig Mathieson," Doleful humour, abrasive familiarity, and an avoidance of horror tropes such as shock cuts, anchors the film's mood in the everyday, even as the atmosphere relentlessly darkens."
Chicago Reader," June 23, 2016",Leah Pickett," The film justifies its epic length, meshing ancient east Asian mythology and rituals with more recognizable horror tropes in a way that feels novel and unpredictable."
Newcity," June 23, 2016",Ray Pride," Neighborly distrust, profane banter and insults, dark omens, bedeviled dreams, overt Biblical portent and doomed police investigation"
New York Times," June 20, 2016",Glenn Kenny, The Wailing is the hard stuff. Handle with care.
It's Just Movies," June 19, 2016",Ron Wilkinson," Running a little too long for a scary movie, this film combines precious insight into small town Korean life combined with well-done bad spirit juju."
Cinemalogue.com," June 17, 2016",Todd Jorgenson, ... features some clever twists that consistently ratchet up the tension without succumbing to genre pitfalls.
Film Comment Magazine," June 17, 2016",Jonathan Romney, The film's chaos is offset by often majestic visual grace.
Reverse Shot," June 15, 2016",Adam Nayman, Na certainly has fun with an onscreen world whose rules keep getting rewritten with each new iteration of evil.
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," June 15, 2016",Dennis Schwartz," Better, different and stranger than most exorcist horror pics."
ColeSmithey.com," June 12, 2016",Cole Smithey," [CANNES 2016] While far from a perfect film, this unconventional exploration in horror sends cinematic chills that run right through you."
