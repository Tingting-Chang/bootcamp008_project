Film Ireland Magazine," January 3, 2017",Michael O'Sullivan," Because of Mpunga and Frot, Marguerite is a pleasant and emotive experience."
Total Film," December 28, 2016",Neil Smith," By the end, [Marguerite will] have you crying like Pagliacci."
MovieMail," December 28, 2016",Mike McCahill," It's handsomely turned out in its monochrome palette, and Marguerite's big numbers remain reliably amusing, Frot mangling her standards like a sham-dram Liza or Barbra while Marcon tersely clutches his hunting rifle in the wings."
Brooklyn Magazine," November 29, 2016",Kenji Fujishima," As Dumont, Catherine Frot grasps the character's tragic essence... Whether the director fully supports Frot's empathy, however, is more difficult to assess."
Irish Times," August 8, 2016",Tara Brady, Marguerite's unspeakable voice is counterpointed by cinematographer Glynn Speeckaert's exquisitely composed tableaux. And the denouement yields more than one surprise.
La Jornada," June 30, 2016",Carlos Bonfil," It may be a little conventional, but the main character is too fascinating. [Full review in Spanish]"

Chilango.com," June 23, 2016",Oswaldo Betancourt Lozano," A story that looks like a comedy, but it's really a tragedy. [Full review in Spanish]"

Clarín," June 22, 2016",Pablo A. Scholz, A satire that Xavier Giannoli takes to its limits. [Full review in Spanish]

El Mundo (Spain)," June 22, 2016",Alberto Bermejo, An exciting story transformed into a romantic comedy of sorts with some surreal moments. [Full review in Spanish]
El Pais (Spain)," June 22, 2016",Javier Ocaña, A passionate film. For its subject and how it explores it. [Full review in Spanish]
El Mundo (Spain)," June 22, 2016",Luis Martínez, A fun and particular reflection about art. Opera in this case. [Full review in Spanish]
"Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)"," June 7, 2016",Ken Hanke," Something at once comic and surprisingly thoughtful -- a work of great delicacy and generosity. There's a magical, almost luminous, quality to Frot's portrayal. "
Los Angeles Times," March 10, 2016",Kenneth Turan," A thoughtful examination of an unusual, deeply eccentric woman."
New York Times," March 10, 2016",Stephen Holden," What redeems it is Ms. Frot's subtle, deeply compassionate portrayal of a rich, lonely woman clutching at an impossible dream until reality intrudes."
Wall Street Journal," March 10, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," ""Marguerite,"" in French with English subtitles, declares itself to have been ""inspired by a true story."" That usually means the story's truth was buried beneath layers of contrivance, but the key word here is ""inspired."""
The Film Stage," March 10, 2016",Michael Snydel," Frantic and compellingly unpredictable, even as it heads into comfortable territory."
New York Post," March 9, 2016",Farran Smith Nehme," It's an often witty, smoothly shot film with a couple of extraneous subplots and some last-act psychology that feels contrived. But Frot shines."
Slant Magazine," March 9, 2016",Diego Semerene," Xavier Giannolli consistently glosses every sequence with a stagey kind of humor, albeit at the main character's expense."
L.A. Weekly," March 8, 2016",April Wolfe, Marguerite is a film for those sour enough to enjoy schadenfreude but with enough conscience to prefer that it not be too tragic -- and even a little charming.
Hollywood Reporter," March 8, 2016",Jordan Mintzer," Xavier Giannoli offers up an amusingly entertaining portrait of fortune, infamy and severe melodic dysfunction in the polished French period dramedy, Marguerite."
Variety," March 8, 2016",Peter Debruge, [A] pitch-perfect comedy of manners.
AV Club," March 8, 2016",Benjamin Mercer, The fairly suspenseful last act of the movie hinges on just a few changes of expression that unfold slowly across Frot's face.
Screen International," March 8, 2016",Lisa Nesselson," Despite its running time, the film's suspense lasts until the final frames. The musical score -- both on-and-off key -- is splendid."
CineVue," March 8, 2016",Marco Duse, This is the tragic story of a woman with a dream -- a vision -- but absolutely no skills to achieve it.
Film Journal International," March 8, 2016",Doris Toumarkine," Marguerite will enchant quality-seeking viewers appreciative of originality, spectacle and serious music. "
Compuserve," March 3, 2016",Harvey S. Karten," Featuring Mozart's gorgeous music, ""Marguerite"" is a comedy cum pathos based on the ambitions of a rich woman who thinks she has an operatic voice and an audience of sycophants who refuse to tell her the truth."
Killer Movie Reviews," March 3, 2016",Andrea Chase," an emotional thriller, a soufflé of a farce, and a profound consideration of the fathomless yearnings of the human heart "
CraveOnline," September 7, 2015",Fred Topel, She was basically the original William Hung.
Observer (UK)," March 20, 2016",Mark Kermode," Giannoli and Frot ensure that Marguerite is never the butt of the joke. On the contrary, she embodies something admirably unruly - a devotion to music that transcends the stifling disappointments of real life."
Independent (UK)," March 18, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab," Marguerite is a handsomely shot period affair with all the trimmings. At its core, though, it is a very delicate study of a woman who refuses to accept any of the constraints that her class, gender or lack of talent should place on her."
Times (UK)," March 18, 2016",Kevin Maher," This film, ably directed by Xavier Giannoli, is also based on the Jenkins story, but has switched the setting from Manhattan to Paris and changed the subject's name to Marguerite Dumont (a top-class turn from Catherine Frot)."
Little White Lies," March 18, 2016",Sophie Monks Kaufman, Marguerite suffers from a storytelling tameness that erodes the power of its subject.
Radio Times," March 17, 2016",David Parkinson," Frot is superb as the oblivious chanteuse, with her touchingly excruciating warbling hiding a pain that cannot be staunched after she discovers her husband's shortcomings."
Guardian," March 17, 2016",Benjamin Lee," It's a film that relies on our sympathy for her and she flawlessly commands it, without ever resorting to sentimentality."
Financial Times," March 17, 2016",Nigel Andrews," It has the dramatic density, social sweep and sardonic bite of great French fiction. Think Balzac, Maupassant."
Film Comment Magazine," March 17, 2016",Kristin M. Jones, Beneath the antic plot and sentimental portrayal of her marriage is a moving portrait of a woman who searches for an audience and loses herself.
The Arts Desk," March 15, 2016",Tom Birchenough," Most poignantly, we come to feel that it has been Marguerite's long-ignored need for love that has contributed at least in part to her behaviour."
Film-Forward.com," March 14, 2016",Kent Turner," Its sober tone matches the muted, digitally colorized palette, deflating any expectation of a campy confection."
Time Out," March 14, 2016",Dave Calhoun, Poses sharp questions about the nature of art and who it's for.
The List," March 14, 2016",Emma Simmonds, This sumptuous story of an incompetent songbird will warm your heart as surely as it hammers at your eardrums.
The Playlist," March 12, 2016",Kimber Myers," Biopics and historical films almost exclusively center on subjects who did something exemplary or were talented at their pursuits. But what sets ""Marguerite"" apart is its focus on a woman whose most notable feature is her utter lack of talent."
NYC Movie Guru," March 11, 2016",Avi Offer," Witty, charming and delightful. Catherine Frot is at her best with a charismatic, heartfelt performance. "
leonardmaltin.com," March 11, 2016",Leonard Maltin," A touching portrait of a woman with a dream... leading lady, Catherine Frot, is perfection."
Christian Science Monitor," March 11, 2016",Peter Rainer," Pezzini is a terrific comic creation: an arrogant, money-grubbing divo who, by encouraging Marguerite, must fight every fiber of his being. And yet even here, Giannoli doesn't aim strictly for laughs."
Spirituality and Practice," March 11, 2016",Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, A compelling French dramedy about the yearning of a woman who is passionate about opera music.
Entertainment Weekly," March 11, 2016",Devan Coggan," Frot salvages any of the film's shortcomings with her nuanced performance of Marguerite, a sweet and isolated woman completely oblivious to her lack of talent."
NPR," March 11, 2016",Bob Mondello," Meryl Streep will soon play Jenkins in another movie, but it's hard to imagine anyone improving on the mix of hilarity and heartbreak this transplanted, fictional version achieves."
RogerEbert.com," March 11, 2016",Sheila O'Malley," If someone had said to Marguerite early on, ""Listen. You can't sing,"" would it have made a difference? Would she have been happy? But Marguerite is undeniably happy when she sings. It's an ethical quandary, one the film has a lot of fun exploring."
One Guy's Opinion," March 31, 2016",Frank Swietek, A biting yet strangely affectionate period piece about delusion and love.
SF Weekly," March 31, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," Xavier Giannoli's 127-minute comedy Marguerite would have worked like gangbusters at a zippy 90 minutes, but it's a pleasant enough comedy-of-manners for most of its running time."
San Francisco Chronicle," March 31, 2016",Mick LaSalle," We laugh during ""Marguerite,"" but we don't laugh at Marguerite, because somehow director and co-writer Xavier Giannoli persuades us to see in her the universal tragedy."
Flick Filosopher," March 31, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson," A bravura dramedy that beautifully balances tragedy and comedy and asks a tricky question: Is it better to be cynical about art, or happily undiscriminating?"
Groucho Reviews," March 29, 2016",Peter Canavese," Why is Marguerite so funny to us, and why is her public humiliation allowed to continue for so long? The answers plumb both the best and worst instincts of human nature, and give Giannoli's film a strong heartbeat."
Blu-ray.com," March 25, 2016",Brian Orndorf," So much of ""Marguerite,"" from dramatic focus to tech achievements, is handled with care by Giannoli, who finds more substance in understanding than crude mockery."
Philadelphia Inquirer," March 25, 2016",Tirdad Derakhshani, Marguerite is a powerful film.
Mark Reviews Movies," March 24, 2016",Mark Dujsik," It's a good joke, but more importantly, the first time that [writer/director Xavier] Giannoli allows us to laugh at Marguerite is also the last time."
Chicago Reader," March 24, 2016",J. R. Jones," Catherine Frot gives a heartrending performance as the title character, an aging baroness in 1920s Paris who feverishly pursues a classical singing career despite her utter lack of talent."
Boston Globe," March 24, 2016",Ty Burr," It piles too much on its serving plate, and at 129 minutes it's definitely overlong. But it has Frot, an actress with the wise, patient eyes of a cat, and she invests Marguerite with the multiple meanings the rest of the film elegantly fumbles."
Washington Post," March 24, 2016",Michael O'Sullivan," In the end, the movie gives voice not just to Marguerite's deficiencies as a singer but also to emotional frailties that are too human and familiar."
Chicago Tribune," March 24, 2016",Michael Phillips," ""Marguerite"" achieves what the protagonist herself never managed: perfect pitch."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," March 24, 2016",Colin Covert," Giannoli wisely doesn't treat the deluded diva like an utter laughingstock, but like a nice woman who enjoys sharing her prosaic Sunday paintings in a lavish museum."
Arizona Republic," March 24, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," Frot's performance is so towering, so convincing, that it smooths out all the film's rough edges. It's a triumph."
St. Louis Post-Dispatch," March 24, 2016",Sarah Bryan Miller," The film is a little long; a couple of subplots could be shed with no problem. But ""Marguerite"" is a shining star, a film that will set you laughing and thinking in equal measure."
Newcity," March 23, 2016",Ray Pride," Richly appointed, emotionally confrontational, often rollickingly funny, Marguerite is candied tragicomedy, "
HeyUGuys," March 23, 2016",Jon Lyus, A sumptuous and captivating film that benefits from excellent performances and costume design that perfectly encapsulates the jazz era of 1920s Paris.
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," March 21, 2016",Aine O'Connor," The film looks beautiful. Although it is a little too long, the emotional richness is skilfully delivered and it will stay with you for a long time after the final credits."
Irish Independent," March 21, 2016",Paul Whitington," This very handsome period film had a kind of Downton Abbey watch-ability but is pretty silly, and becomes an out-and-out pantomime at the end."
Daily Express (UK)," March 20, 2016",Allan Hunter," Funny and touching with exquisite production design and impeccable performances, Marguerite is a civilised delight."
Epoch Times," May 18, 2016",Joe Bendel, A film of chaste passion and (admittedly misplaced) artistic devotion. There is something rather touching and maybe even inspiring about the portrait that emerges.
"Capital Times (Madison, WI)"," May 13, 2016",Rob Thomas," ""Marguerite"" tells us that if we work hard and believe in ourselves, we can achieve our dreams. Even if we stink."
Trespass," May 3, 2016",Alex Doenau, Catherine Frot is exceptional in the lead in the most literal sense of the word: she's the exception to an otherwise awful movie.
El antepenúltimo mohicano," April 28, 2016",Ignacio Navarro," Even if Madame Marguerite has some flaws, its virtues stand out with a better result. [Full review in Spanish]"
Herald Sun (Australia)," April 27, 2016",Leigh Paatsch, The tragicomic reasons for Marguerite's pitch-imperfect warblings are beautifully communicated to the audience by the irresistible Frot.
Impulse Gamer," April 24, 2016",Damien Straker, Xavier Giannoli hasn't settled for lavish and funny alone but has also aimed high to make his film surprisingly deep.
FILMINK (Australia)," April 22, 2016",Julian Wood," This could be a weird or sad tale, but it is so well done that, unlike Marguerite's voice, it is more or less pitch perfect."
The Age (Australia)," April 21, 2016",Jake Wilson," Frot gives Marguerite a grandeur, but also an anxious, lost quality, emphasised by Glynn Speeckaert's cinematography with its heavy shadows and tendency to isolate Frot in the middle of the wide screen."
Sydney Morning Herald," April 21, 2016",Sandra Hall, It's a tale of great sadness -- about somebody enchanted by a world she's forever barred from entering.
South China Morning Post," April 18, 2016",James Mottram, Frot is particularly telling in what might also be called Marguerite's last act - her voice both heartfelt and horrendous as comedy gives way to tragedy. The result is quietly heartbreaking.
Urban Cinefile," April 16, 2016",Andrew L. Urban," Winner of four Cesar Awards in France (Nominated for 11), Marguerite is clearly an accomplished work, taking a real American story as its inspiration - and then imaging it in French culture"
Urban Cinefile," April 16, 2016",Louise Keller," Based on a true story about a wealthy Baroness with more money than musical talent, it's comic and tragic all at once as the ripple effect of one little deception impacts on a woman's self esteem, her marriage and the fortunes of the hangers on"
Salt Lake Tribune," April 15, 2016",Sean P. Means," Attitude and aptitude collide in Marguerite, a French drama whose absurdity and tender feelings are more in tune than the story's title character."
The Australian," April 15, 2016",David Stratton," Marguerite -- despite its longueurs -- offers much to enjoy, particularly Frot's ripe, passionate performance."
"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," April 8, 2016",Robert Horton, A funny but thankfully merciful film about a wealthy society lady (Catherine Frot) who - convinced of her talent as a singer - subjects her acquaintances to ear-splitting recitals of her music. 
Detroit News," April 8, 2016",Tom Long," ""Marguerite"" is a dark delight, a cringe comedy that skirts tragedy throughout, examining delusion, entitlement, denial and the question of whether the truth is essential."
Seattle Times," April 7, 2016",Moira MacDonald," Frot's performance, as a woman so caught up in the joy of music that she doesn't quite understand how bad she is, is particularly delightful, and often quite moving."
Sensacine," April 5, 2016",Gerard Casau, The late apparition of its protagonist only amplifies this disaster ridden attempt to honor the opera genre. [Full Review in Spanish]
ReviewExpress.com," April 4, 2016",Jean Lowerison," Giannoli leaves us to ponder Marguerite's philosophy: ""Either we dream life or we accomplish it."""
San Francisco Examiner," April 1, 2016",Anita Katz," A funny, thoughtful, moving story about art, love, passion, delusion and the sad reality that dreams and personal talents don't always jibe."
