Christianity Today," January 23, 2017",Jeffrey Overstreet," Its ambiguities make possible a fusion of dread and intrigue that reminds us of ways in which we've experienced adolescence, alienation, rites of passage, or self-discovery."
Detroit Free Press," December 29, 2016",John Monaghan, What the movie lacks in narrative it makes up for in mood and invention.
Baltimore Magazine," December 29, 2016",Max Weiss," Slow-paced and methodical, filled with arresting long shots."
ArtsHub," December 29, 2016",Sarah Ward," Hightower's masterful performance [is] as successful in detailing Toni's psychological state as Holmer's striking and poetic approach, and as expertly choreographed and yet naturally rhythmic, too."
Columbus Alive," December 29, 2016",Brad Keefe," It's definitely challenging, and I want to give it a second viewing. So let's go ahead and call that really good."
Seven Days," December 29, 2016",Margot Harrison, The Fits combines the energy of a dance film with the obliqueness and eerie atmosphere of an art film. I feel safe in saying I've never seen anything quite like it before.
MetroActive," December 29, 2016",Richard von Busack," One could think of The Fits as an all-ages movie, but only in the sense that The 400 Blows is about children."
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," December 23, 2016",Dennis Schwartz, A fitting psychological portrait of growing up in Cincinnati's West End.
Hammer to Nail," December 5, 2016",Don R. Lewis," I love the way the film reminds me of adolescence itself; fun, silly times shaded with impending seriousness and tinged with darkness."
AwardsCircuit.com," September 28, 2016",Shane Slater, The film envelopes you in its spellbinding narrative. 
Detroit News," September 9, 2016",Tom Long," Using a lot of real-life West End of Cincinnati dancers and athletes in the cast lends the film an authentic feel without ever feeling amateurish, and the specificity of Toni's story resonates outward."
The Australian," August 12, 2016",David Stratton, Anna Rose Holmer's strange but beautifully crafted film is worth seeking out.
FILMINK (Australia)," August 3, 2016",Sophia Watson," ...a captivating, mesmerising, and remarkably painful journey into adolescence and independence. "
Chicago Reader," July 28, 2016",Leah Pickett," [Holmer] and cinematographer Paul Yee infuse the community center, in and around which the entire film takes place, with elements of magical realism to accentuate the protagonist's passage from childhood into adolescence."
LarsenOnFilm," July 25, 2016",Josh Larsen, ...captures approaching adolescence for what it really is: an out-of-body experience.
Boston Globe," July 21, 2016",Ty Burr," The movie is a nearly perfect thing, made with such assurance that every shot holds weight and widens your heart."
Reeling Reviews," July 9, 2016",Laura Clifford," [Holmer's] given us something almost otherworldly, using the phenomenon of mass hysteria as a stepping stone into adolescence. That her film uses little dialogue, instead expressing emotion through movement, makes it that more remarkable."

Seattle Times," July 8, 2016",Moira MacDonald," It's a curious world that Toni is entering, and Hightower's quiet watchfulness takes it all in."

Compuserve," May 28, 2016",Harvey S. Karten," An offbeat look at a pre-teen who wonders to what extent she should give up her individuality to fit in. The title could have a double meaning: epileptic-type spasms, or fitting in."
Film Experience," May 13, 2016",Nathaniel Rogers," There's much to ponder in its metaphysical poetry, thoughtful camera work and editing and, above all else, its persistent fly-on-the-wall curiosity, the camera a soulful twin to Toni's ever-searching eyes."
Screen International," March 23, 2016",David D'Arcy, The Fits benefits from scrapping a three-act structure and avoiding crescendos and easy moralism.

The Playlist," January 29, 2016",Nikola Grozdanovic," ""The Fits"" is unlike any dance film you'll ever see, which doesn't automatically make it good, just different. The film suffers from being diminutively compelling throughout, regardless of how deeply under your skin the score gets. "

Flavorwire," June 6, 2016",Jason Bailey," When I first stumbled out of 'The Fits,' I wasn't entirely sure what to make of it; after a second viewing, I'm still not certain. But I know this much: I've never seen anything quite like it."
Vox," June 6, 2016",Todd VanDerWerff," In terms of capturing that adolescent ennui, it's as good as any movie I've seen."
NPR," June 6, 2016",Andrew Lapin," The Fits is a movie that, if examined scene by scene and frame by frame, confirms its own uniqueness the way a conservationist might identify a member of an endangered species."

The Verge," June 3, 2016",Tasha Robinson," What Holmer does offer is a story about suggestion and nuance, about movement and emotion. It's a narrative film, but it feels like a dance piece itself, and it's strongest in its meaningful silences."
Paste Magazine," June 3, 2016",Michael Snydel," Even in an abbreviated running time, The Fits manages to reinvent the sports story as something both brainy and physically pure."

Consequence of Sound," June 2, 2016",Allison Shoemaker," The Fits is a rare little film. Not only are answers few and far between, but even the questions are hard to pin down. It's quiet and strange and simple."
Wall Street Journal," June 2, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," All ups with no downs, it's a motion picture in the truest sense of the term. I've never seen anything quite like it and I loved every one of its 72 minutes."

AV Club," June 2, 2016",Noel Murray," Part of what's so terrific about The Fits is that so much of it is open to interpretation, even though the film as a whole isn't that oblique."
The New Republic," June 1, 2016",Tim Grierson," Neither cutesy nor needlessly bleak, the debut narrative film from writer-director Anna Rose Holmer possesses a refreshingly intimate, honest tone about adolescence. The modesty of this movie's design has its own sneaky power."

Georgia Straight," June 24, 2016",Ken Eisner," The tale is overly aestheticized, with ponderously aggressive sound editing and self-consciously discordant music constantly reminding viewers just how Important Everything Is."
Washington City Paper," June 24, 2016",Noah Gittell," First-time filmmaker Anna Rose Holmer has crafted a story so poetic and precise that it must be the pure, uncorrupted vision of its creator. It's not a flawless film, but it is perfect in its own way."
Philadelphia Inquirer," June 24, 2016",Molly Eichel," Like its lead Royalty Hightower, whose performance is just as spectacular as her name, The Fits is impossible to look away from. It's gorgeous, poetic, and opaque, and I've never seen any other movie like it."
sbs.com.au," June 23, 2016",Rochelle Siemienowicz," The limited locations, lack of adult characters and the fact we never see the kids at home effectively creates a socially contained world with its own rules and consequences. Then there's Royalty Hightower's knockout lead performance."
Spliced Personality," June 23, 2016",Sean Burns, Hightower has a naturally commanding screen presence. Imagine if Steve McQueen was an eleven-year-old black girl and you're starting to get the idea.
Washington Post," June 23, 2016",Ann Hornaday," ""The Fits"" and its electrifying young star give getting in formation renewed meaning, with inspiring, self-assured verve."
Arizona Republic," June 23, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," You honestly don't know what to expect, and when the film is done, you're not exactly sure what has happened."
"Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)"," June 21, 2016",Ken Hanke, Virtually impossible to synopsize and not even easy to describe. Let me just say that this a rather special movie.

San Francisco Examiner," June 17, 2016",Anita Katz," The trials of adolescence come to life in fresh and mesmerizing ways in The Fits, a low-budget, mood-rich tale about a tomboy, an all-girl dance team, the need to belong, and a baffling sickness."
The Young Folks," June 16, 2016",Allyson Johnson, ... the film has an air of realism that helps tether its viewers to these characters as the storyline aims to sweep them off their feet. 
SF Weekly," June 15, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly, Anna Rose Holmer's The Fits is the best portrait of female teenage alienation since Eliza Hittman's It Felt Like Love.
