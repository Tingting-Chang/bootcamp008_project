Film Inquiry," January 4, 2017",Benjamin Wang, You won't stick with Miss Hokusai because you absolutely must know what happens next. Sometimes it's worth sticking with something just to be immersed.
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," January 1, 2017",Brian Gibson," Miss Hokusai gets jarred by a few too-modern music-moments and some preciousness in Ōi and Onao's sisterhood, but otherwise it's a steady sail through one woman's artscape and life that can't be entirely her own."
Junkee," December 28, 2016",Glenn Dunks," Told through the eyes of Hokusai's daughter as she attempts to forge a destiny of her own out of her father's shadow, Miss Hokusai is animation for adults that packs an emotional punch."
MovieMail," December 13, 2016",Mike McCahill," While the emphasis on suggestion over standard biopic spectacle is novel, one suspects the film probably won't be suggestive, coherent or affecting enough for hardcore Hokusai admirers, leaving it to occupy a curious artistic no-man's-land."
Butaca Ancha," November 24, 2016",Ali López," A film with an appealing sensibility that invites the public into a dream world where eroticism, sarcasm, comedy, and nostalgia dwell in every scene. [Full review in Spanish]"
San Diego Reader," November 11, 2016",Matthew Lickona," The art here is rawer and more idiosyncratic than some other anime, and there is a pleasing matter-of-factness about fleshy matters - drinking, sex, sickness - even as the more abstract question of art's practice and power is under consideration."
Black Girl Nerds," November 3, 2016",Valerie Complex, Visually gorgeous but doesn't adequately capture a compelling figure.
The Young Folks," November 2, 2016",Gary Shannon," ... the film's strongly centralized human nub holds a simple and lucid power, weaving enough deeply felt, fundamental goodness and compassionate integrity to conquer even its wildest and most undisciplined ideas."
National Post," October 28, 2016",Chris Knight," Animation isn't the usual style associated with biopics, though there have been some sterling examples... To those can now be added Miss Hokusai."
Toronto Star," October 28, 2016",Bruce Demara," The animation is superb, with fine attention to period detail, and director Keiichi Hara's use of modern music - some of it rock-infused - is apt accompaniment to a story of a young woman who lives life boldly by refusing to bend to cultural norms."
Globe and Mail," October 28, 2016",Brad Wheeler," This plush anime version of Hinako Sugiura's original manga tells a tale in a poetic, episodic fashion."
Salt Lake Tribune," October 27, 2016",Sean P. Means, A visually rich look at the often messy act of creation.
Georgia Straight," October 27, 2016",Ken Eisner," Japanese animation meets its own origins in Miss Hokusai, a lovingly crafted tale of art and life in early-18th-century Japan."
Blu-ray.com," October 27, 2016",Brian Orndorf," ""Miss Hokusai"" can be an abrupt picture, but it retains sizable charisma and artistry, locating a few emotional moments that work exceptionally well. "
Washington Post," October 27, 2016",Stephanie Merry," Although it's lovely to look at, the movie is disjointed and is told through a seemingly random collection of vignettes, some of which are more memorable than others."
Austin Chronicle," October 27, 2016",Steve Davis," A sumptuous tapestry of color, shadow, and light."
NOW Toronto," October 26, 2016",Norman Wilner," If you adjust to the movie's unusual rhythms and submit to director Hara (whose credits include the similarly singular Colourful), you'll find yourself having a lovely, quietly soulful experience."
Common Sense Media," October 26, 2016",Sandie Angulo Chen, Historical Japanese character study has mature content. 
Examiner.com," October 24, 2016",Chris Sawin," Miss Hokusai bleeds style and grace from every frame to the extent that you can almost smell the ink as it's pressed to a paper canvas. For the imaginative and the admirers of the fantastical, this film is purely and spectacularly a work of art. "
Seattle Times," October 24, 2016",Soren Anderson," The spell ""Miss Hokusai"" casts is a powerful one that lingers long after the lights go up in the theater."
Slant Magazine," October 10, 2016",Elise Nakhnikian," It condenses everyday interactions, memories, and dreams into a potent mix of all the major ingredients of a well-lived life."
South China Morning Post," April 6, 2016",James Marsh, Miss Hokusai is a thoughtful and visually resplendent anime with a playful interpretation of art and artists.
HeyUGuys," February 17, 2016",Daniel Goodwin," Miss Hokusai can sometimes feel a little too light on its feet, with a tendency to meander from the narrative path, but its dipping in and out of various lives and dramas, makes it all the more vibrant and unique. "
Starburst," February 5, 2016",Julian White," With Hinako Sugiura's historical manga 'Sarusuberi' as his inspiration, director Keiichi Hara and screenwriter Miho Maruo have pared down the episodic source material to create a work that is truly magical: must-see storytelling at its finest."
Radio Times," February 4, 2016",David Parkinson," More impressionistic and contemplative than dramatic and analytical, this is an intriguing memoir of a significant female artist."
Times (UK)," February 4, 2016",Kevin Maher," Miss Hokusai is a high-profile Japanese anime that is completely (and refreshingly) devoid of fantastical creatures, floating castles and sharpshooting cyborgs."
Playback:stl," December 10, 2015",Sarah Boslaugh," The beautiful animation is a strong selling point: it's detailed and realistic, with some frames deliberately echoing well-known prints by Hokusai. "
Reeling Reviews," October 22, 2016",Robin Clifford, This historical biography is a quiet examination of a father and daughter/master and apprentice as they ply their copious talents to create works of art for their patrons.
Boston Herald," October 21, 2016",James Verniere," An important and mature film about 19th century Japanese artist Hokusai and his brilliant, perhaps equally talented daughter."
Detroit News," October 21, 2016",Tom Long," There are meditations on mortality, art, relationships, love, fear, sexuality and spirituality in this sumptuous-looking film. They cohere into a portrait of a young woman as complex as any big screen character can be."
SF Weekly," October 20, 2016",Jeffrey Edalatpour," Set in the 1800s during the final years of the Edo period, the film reimagines that era with dozens of lovely details."
Newcity," October 20, 2016",Ray Pride," We watch the visions of her imagination, from dragons in the sky, on down, transformed into art. "
Chicago Reader," October 20, 2016",Andrea Gronvall," Director Keiichi Hara achieves a balance between earthiness and aestheticism, suggesting a Japan on the cusp of modernity."
RogerEbert.com," October 14, 2016",Brian Tallerico," It feels much longer than its 90 minutes, and I left it feeling like I didn't really learn much about its title character or her father."
Reeling Reviews," October 14, 2016",Laura Clifford, Hara's use of exaggerated sound compensating for O'Nao's lack of sight [is] even more compelling than his visuals...easily one of the best animations of the year
The Playlist," October 13, 2016",Andy Crump," A slim, brief affair ... but the brevity may well be part of the reason the film stays with us."
New York Times," October 13, 2016",Glenn Kenny," While it's not entirely kid-friendly, this portrait of an artist is both enchanting and thought provoking."
NPR," October 13, 2016",Mark Jenkins," Creating worlds with images is a form of magic. Miss Hokusai demonstrates that simply, with its extraordinary simulation of sunlight streaming through O'Ei's spread fingers."
Epoch Times," October 13, 2016",Joe Bendel," It is just an exquisitely lovely, emotionally mature film that is deeply satisfying precisely because of the sadness in its soul."
Los Angeles Times," October 13, 2016",Kenneth Turan," [An] unusual, visually adventurous animated feature, simultaneously modern and steeped in Japanese culture and history."
Film Journal International," October 12, 2016",Edward Douglas," A gorgeous animated tale of love, family and art set during Japan's Edo period."
Village Voice," October 12, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," Miss Hokusai is a lovely biopic, even if it never quite picks up and focuses on a single thread. (Then again, neither does life.)"
Total Film," October 12, 2016",Kevin Harley," Magical and melancholy, tender and robust."
AV Club," October 12, 2016",Noel Murray," The ""roaming hands"" dream is one of Miss Hokusai's most memorable set pieces, but it's far from the only standout."
Hollywood Reporter," October 12, 2016",Boyd van Hoeij, That an anime film can explore such complex subjects so beautifully in what's nominally an artist's biopic is a blessing in itself.
Guardian," October 12, 2016",Peter Bradshaw," It is an interesting work, delicately and discreetly animated, with a quiet visual coup in its final moments when the Edo (as it was then called) of 1814 is dreamily replaced by the Tokyo of the 21st century."
Variety," October 12, 2016",Peter Debruge," The annals of Western art are woefully sparse when it comes to female painters, which is just one of perhaps a dozen reasons that Miss Hokusai comes as such a refreshing anomaly among anime exports."
