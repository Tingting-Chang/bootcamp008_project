St. Louis Post-Dispatch," November 17, 2016",Calvin Wilson," A beautiful film about daring to love, without fear or compromise."
St. Paul Pioneer Press," November 17, 2016",Chris Hewitt (St. Paul)," ""Loving"" conveys what it means to be attached to people, to a place - and not to be able to bear being away from them."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," November 17, 2016",Colin Covert, It shows how far America has come in its views of race and equality - and how far is left to go.
SSG Syndicate," December 10, 2016",Susan Granger," Slow, sensitive and subdued - timely primarily because it paved the way for the more recent controversy over same-sex marriage."
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," December 10, 2016",Dennis Schwartz, Inspirational true love story.
Laramie Movie Scope," December 9, 2016",Robert Roten," The acting is excellent by Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga, and the supporting cast. Every story needs a bad guy and Marton Csokas fills the bill as the pitiless, racist Sheriff Brooks, who arrests the Lovings, and feels very justified in doing so."
Screen It!," December 9, 2016",Jim Judy," Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga embody the Lovings through exceptionally strong performances. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Racism, etc. - also Available)"
Cinemixtape," December 7, 2016",J. Olson, Conventional storytelling in its most muscular form. 
BET.com," December 6, 2016",Clay Cane, One of the best films of 2016.
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 4, 2016",Tim Brayton, It works so much better as a character sketch than as a message movie about history that it's frustrating that it keeps half-heartedly feinting in the latter direction.
MediaMikes," December 2, 2016",Michael A. Smith," While ""Loving"" strikes many emotional chords, I was left with more questions than answers."
Washington Free Beacon," December 2, 2016",Sonny Bunch, Nichols and the actors bring the appropriate level of gravity to a tale that calls to mind life in a police state. 
Fort Worth Weekly," December 1, 2016",Kristian M. Lin, This well-intentioned film is so bound up in cotton wool that it doesn't have the impact its story deserves.
Sacramento News & Review," December 1, 2016",Daniel Barnes," Even if all you ever want from a film is moral affirmation and a basketful of the warm-fuzzies, writer-director Jeff Nichols' mildewed biopic Loving is still a fusty and unengrossing watch."
Spirituality and Practice," December 1, 2016",Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, An underwhelming telling of the story of the couple behind the 1967 Supreme Court case that legalized interracial marriages.
El Nuevo Herald (Miami)," November 30, 2016",Pilar Ayuso," A very delicate and sentimental film, with its magnificent characters expressing the impotence, the suffering and the strength of their love. [Full review in Spanish]"
Winnipeg Free Press," November 30, 2016",Alison Gillmor," Combining a scrupulously intelligent script with standout lead performances, Loving is stubbornly modest and profoundly moving."
Georgia Straight," November 29, 2016",Janet Smith," There's understatement, and then there's Loving, a film that tells its real-life story of 1950s interracial marriage with a tone as stubbornly restrained as its subjects."
Las Vegas Review-Journal," November 29, 2016",Christopher Lawrence," There's no swelling music, no histrionics, no eloquent speeches, no impassioned pleas. Loving is as workmanlike as bricklayer Richard. And it's all the better for it. "
The Virginian-Pilot," November 29, 2016",Mal Vincent," In the end, when you think about the film's ""message,"" it is a very simple one. With so much hate in the world, should we suppress any effort to express love?"
WBAI Radio," November 28, 2016",Prairie Miller," A critical story as well about how white rearing in a mostly black rural setting remote from brutal Jim Crow Virginia, lends optimism to spontaneous racial harmony far from institutional repression imposed via unnatural manufactured difference and fear. "
EntertainmentTell," November 27, 2016",Stephen Silver," A small, quiet, low-key film that tells a story not with loud speechifying or any kind of ostentatious filmmaking, but rather with very human quietness. (Splice Today) "
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," November 27, 2016",Philip Martin," ...[a] tender film about ordinary people caught up in an extraordinary moment of our revolving, repeating history."
CineVue," February 1, 2017",Matthew Anderson," Loving is limited, like the shy union it depicts, as an artefact of its own time and creation."
Total Film," January 31, 2017",Kevin Harley," Sensitively directed and subtly acted, this modestly radical romance is a soft-spoken beauty."
The Skinny," January 26, 2017",Philip Concannon," These are good people and Loving is an important story, but that in itself is not quite enough."
El Mundo (Spain)," January 23, 2017",Alberto Bermejo, A concentrated story with an impeccable staging and the dazzling interpretation of Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga. [Full review in Spanish]
Combustible Celluloid," January 19, 2017",Jeffrey M. Anderson," ""Loving"" is the real deal. It's not a sermon. It's just a snapshot that proves we are all more than our skin colors. We are people, and we are capable of great love."
Blog de cine," January 17, 2017",Mikel Zorrilla," A film that, due to its simplicity, works at all times and allows its two protagonists to give us subtle but great performances. [Full review in Spanish]"
Sensacine," January 10, 2017",Israel Paredes," A humane and emotional story in which its melodramatic, and very classic, character is reformulated by a look as current as personal. [Full review in Spanish]"
MovieCrypt.com," January 6, 2017",Kevin A. Ranson," (When) the focus shifts to Mildred taking the lead, and that's when it becomes apparent what Negga brings to the role... should probably be required viewing in schools - lest we forget."
Film Inquiry," January 4, 2017",Mike Daringer," Loving is a restrained film that lacks the atypical, explosive moments of overflowing emotion, but nonetheless is just as moving and engaging in its unusual approach. "
Washington City Paper," January 2, 2017",Noah Gittell," Loving makes you feel like you're in the hands of a confident director who isn't afraid to let the audience find their way into a story. His style prevents the film from being a crowd-pleaser, but it's the right approach for the story."
Seven Days," January 1, 2017",Margot Harrison," This is a showing movie, not a telling movie: The bond between the Lovings is all in their body language."
MetroActive," January 1, 2017",Richard von Busack," Nichols returns to images of Loving bricklaying at work: appropriate for the brick by brick quality of how justice is sought, built upon and finally delivered."
NUVO Newsweekly," December 30, 2016",Edward Johnson-Ott," Jeff Nichols has made a fine, honest portrait of one couple's unwavering love, but he fails to present that portrait in a sufficiently rousing context. Shucks."
Missoula Independent," December 28, 2016",Molly Laich, The lessons here strike me as entirely too safe for the current political climate.
"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," December 26, 2016",John Beifuss," 'We may lose the small battles but win the big war,' Mildred says. These are inspiring words at a moment in American history when racists are emboldened, and they suggest that 'Loving' may be just the movie the country needs. "
"Quad City Times (Davenport, IA)"," December 25, 2016",Linda Cook," You will end up ""Loving"" the couple at the center of an important moment in American history. "
El antepenúltimo mohicano," December 19, 2016",Alberto Sáez Villarino, A film where its protagonists provide a performance full of strength and emotion that fits perfectly in the plot of the film and adapts without abruptness to the style of the director. [Full review in Spanish]
Q Network Film Desk," December 14, 2016",James Kendrick," admirably low key, shunning easy sensationalism and melodramatic politicization in favor of something more delicate and genuine and intimate"
PopMatters," December 12, 2016",Argun Ulgen," It takes artistic conviction to eschew artificial dramatic piques and nadirs for what most of history has to offer, which is usually somewhere in between the two. Loving is to be commended for mostly exploring this region."
The Young Folks," December 12, 2016",Allyson Johnson," Loving is a slow burn that's content to experience solitude, spirituality and nature without ever relenting on the human spirit."
