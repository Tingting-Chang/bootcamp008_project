Film Ireland Magazine," January 3, 2017",James Phelan," Even by Saturday night multiplex standards, the whole thing starts to feel frightfully slight. Amiable performances alone aren't enough."
Washington City Paper," January 2, 2017",Noah Gittell," The Coens, for once, aren't interested in plot at all, instead choosing to luxuriate in the styles of yesteryear. Johansson and Channing Tatum get to do glamorous musical numbers; Clooney has a ball with his swords-and-sandals epic."
MetroActive," December 31, 2016",Richard von Busack, It's easy to be charmed by the gang of actors. It's less compelling to wonder whether Mannix should continue to serve God or Mammon.
The Mary Sue," December 31, 2016",Lesley Coffin," If Llewyn Davis was about an artist learning to appreciate and collaborate with his audience, this reminds us that before the Coens were movie makers, they were movie watchers."
Out Magazine," December 30, 2016",Armond White," Maybe the campiness of Hail, Caesar! can help educate viewers about the history of gay codes and erotic symbolism."
Salt Lake Tribune," December 30, 2016",Sean P. Means," The Coens show their strongest belief, like Eddie's, is an unshakable faith in the power of movies."
Columbus Alive," December 30, 2016",Melissa Starker," If you're among the Coen brothers' faithful, you'll find much to admire and gags that hit like a ton of bricks, though you'll probably wish there were more of them."
MovieMail," December 19, 2016",Mike McCahill," Hail, Caesar! is finally all too effortful, a doodle undertaken by scholars."
Sunday Times (UK)," December 18, 2016",Camilla Long, A bonkers caper.
Movie Habit," December 12, 2016",Robert Denerstein," Hail Caesar! may not rank at the top of Coen's impressive list, but it should do nothing to sour anyone on their work. My advice: Treat the movie as a smorgasbord. Pick what you like; forget the rest."
Film Inquiry," December 6, 2016",Jay Ledbetter," A middling effort by the Coen Brothers' standards is still a damn good film, and that is exactly what Hail, Caesar! is."
Irish Independent," December 5, 2016",Paul Whitington," Hail, Caesar! should be a lot of fun, but is essentially a collection of nicely written scenes held together by nothing."
rec.arts.movies.reviews," August 31, 2016",David N. Butterworth," I enjoyed their films. Particularly the early, good ones."
CineXpress," August 19, 2016",Fico Cangiano," A nice trip to the past thanks to the amazing performances, beautiful photography and light humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
Chesapeake Family Magazine," August 2, 2016",Roxana Hadadi," Hail, Caesar! imagines the inner dealings of Hollywood during the early 20th century ... But the film's point for these shenanigans is possibly nonexistent."
RTÉ (Ireland)," July 26, 2016",Alan Corr," In what could be the most Coen Brothers movie ever, the masters of bone dry irony and quirk line up an all-star cast to pay homage to an era of Hollywood when actors were indeed cattle and movies dripped with glamour and the promise of escape. "
Washington Free Beacon," July 14, 2016",Sonny Bunch," Instant-classic Coen comedy comments upon, and celebrates, the studio system."
El Universal," July 11, 2016",Alejandro Alemán," Not only is this one of the funniest films of the year, it's an irresistible game of references to classic cinema. [Full review in Spanish]"
Antagony & Ecstasy," July 10, 2016",Tim Brayton, It is the Coens' Christian movie - specifically Catholic - in much the same way that their under-appreciated A Serious Man was their Jewish movie.
Seanax.com," June 16, 2016",Sean Axmaker," The Coen mix of subtle wit and broad slapstick is all over the film, which hopscotches across stories and soundstages at a snappy pace, and they poke fun at everything except the joy of movies."
New York Daily News," February 3, 2016",Joe Dziemianowicz," It's fun and entertaining - no more, no less, no exclamation point."
Compuserve," February 2, 2016",Harvey S. Karten," A day in the life of a movie ""fixer"" forms the unifying bond in a delightful film that satirizes and pays homage as well to 1950s pictures."
Village Voice," February 2, 2016",Melissa Anderson," [It] has a certain buoyancy ... The fizziness, though, proves fleeting, and Hail, Caesar! too often goes flat."
Forbes," February 3, 2016",Scott Mendelson, The picture is such an affectionate ode to the business of movies and the potential for cinematic wonder that I'm half-inclined to presume that its flaws are intentional.
Metro," February 3, 2016",Matt Prigge," Another rumination on the distractions that fill our existence, just couched in a film that's catnip to both Coen heads and TCM addicts."
Uproxx," February 3, 2016",Mike Ryan," Hail, Caesar! is just one of those things you have to experience."
Us Weekly," February 3, 2016",Mara Reinstein," George Clooney, Scarlett Johansson, Josh Brolin, Jonah Hill, Ralph Fiennes and Channing Tatum must really, really, really, really, really, really love working with writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen. "
TheWrap," February 3, 2016",Alonso Duralde, The Coens revel in both the glamour and the squalor of post-war Hollywood with a film that more than makes up in wit and flash what it might lack in substance.
CraveOnline," February 3, 2016",William Bibbiani," It may not rank amongst The Coen Brothers' best work, but few films do. It's still a high-spirited comedy of the highest order, smart and hilarious."
Screen International," February 3, 2016",Tim Grierson," After focusing in recent years on somber comedies such as ""A Serious Man"" that tackled existential themes, the Coens have turned their attention to a zany Hollywood-golden-age lark ... which ends up being consumed by some of the same questions."
Hollywood Reporter," February 3, 2016",Todd McCarthy," The Coens' reimagining of a real Hollywood tough guy is interesting for insiders, but in their first order of business, that of making a rousing comedy about the Hollywood of 65 years ago, they've fallen rather short."
Critic's Notebook," February 3, 2016",Martin Tsai," It's basically a 106-minute in-joke on the studio system heyday, complete with lovely period details of sets, costumes and visual effects. "
indieWire," February 3, 2016",Eric Kohn," A charming consolidation of their appeal that both celebrates and mocks its target. In short, catnip for Coen fans."
Guardian," February 3, 2016",Andrew Pulver," Hail, Caesar! is a lot of fun, and beautifully crafted, too. One to savour."
Total Film," February 3, 2016",Jamie Graham," Hail, Caesar! is a love letter inked in arsenic, at once celebrating the artistry of Hollywood and cringing at the crass commercialism and rampant phoniness of it all."
Newark Star-Ledger," February 3, 2016",Stephen Whitty," Set at an ersatz MGM, the film fudges some period details but gets almost everything else right - the studio's rich Technicolor palette, a movie-musical style just teetering on the edge of camp."
USA Today," February 3, 2016",Brian Truitt, The combination of the Coen brothers' filmmaking acumen and George Clooney in absolute buffoon mode is again Hollywood magic.
Variety," February 3, 2016",Justin Chang, An inside-showbiz lark that regards the 1950s studio system with the utmost skepticism even as it becomes an expression of movie love at its purest.
TheFilmFile.com," February 3, 2016",Dustin Putman," An original, unapologetically larkish escapade. ""Hail, Caesar!"" is a blessed blur of movie-style artifice and silly behind-the-scenes exposé of 1950s La La Land."
Movie Nation," February 3, 2016",Roger Moore," A swing, and a miss!"
Time Out," February 3, 2016",Joshua Rothkopf," Hail, Caesar! weds the backstage Hollywood shenanigans of Barton Fink to a more manic pace. It doesn't seem new for them, yet as super polished, mannered, slightly surreal comedies go, the movie feels as rare as a unicorn."
ScreenCrush," February 3, 2016",Matt Singer," One of the Coens' most serious pictures, as well as their silliest."
Slant Magazine," February 3, 2016",Jake Cole, Joel and Ethan Coen's idiosyncrasies elevate the film above the level of a mere creative exercise.
AllMovie," February 4, 2016",Violet LeVoit," It's a strange puzzle box of a movie, as impenetrable in its own way as Mulholland Drive, and its slippery, shape-shifting nature defies all of the usual critical assessments, except one: It's worth seeing."
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," February 4, 2016",Preston Jones," Tinseltown may not make 'em like they used to, but fortunately for 21st-century audiences, the Coen brothers can still make an audience believe."
Philadelphia Inquirer," February 4, 2016",Steven Rea," A goofy conflation of Coenian elements: the numbskull huggermugger of The Big Lebowski, the La La Land surrealness of Barton Fink, the Old Testament overlay of A Serious Man."
Seattle Times," February 4, 2016",Moira MacDonald," ""Hail, Caesar!"" isn't the great film you might like it to be, but it's very, very good fun."
Hollywood & Fine," February 4, 2016",Marshall Fine," Like a long, entertaining shaggy dog story without a punchline...just sit back and let it wash over you in all its witty, if insubstantial goodness."
Las Vegas Weekly," February 4, 2016",Josh Bell, The Coens are less successful at combining those sporadically entertaining elements into a cohesive movie.
Looking Closer," February 3, 2016",Jeffrey Overstreet, This is one of those rare occasions where the Coens' aesthetics upstage their writing and unbalance their momentum.
Movie Guys with Jeff & Dave," February 3, 2016",Jeffrey K. Howard, Too confusing even for The Coen Brothers - lacks any creative direction and stretches itself too thin and falls apart. 
Vanity Fair," February 3, 2016",Richard Lawson," Like life, much of what's funny about Hail, Caesar!, the new film from Joel and Ethan Coen, is also what makes it a little sad."
We Got This Covered," February 3, 2016",Matt Donato," Hail, Caesar!? More like ""Hail, Channing!"" - am I right?"
honeycuttshollywood.com," February 3, 2016",Kirk Honeycutt, The Coen Bros. spin their wheels by calling so much attention to every stab at humor.
San Jose Mercury News," February 3, 2016",Karen D'Souza," Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the film is the nagging feeling that the Coens do indeed have something fascinating to say about the inner workings of Hollywood, but the flailing ""Hail, Caesar!"" isn't it."
Film School Rejects," February 3, 2016",Christopher Campbell," One of the duo's most intricately and wholly thematic movies, and yes, one of their least satisfying in its superficial narrative. Also, extremely silly. Even for the Coens."
Tribune News Service," February 3, 2016",Katie Walsh," Both a love letter to and a gentle skewering of Hollywood's studio system, a wildly entertaining romp through history that also keenly reflects its present."
RedEye," February 3, 2016",Matt Pais, Too funny to dismiss and too mild to endorse.
Entertainment Weekly," February 3, 2016",Leah Greenblatt," It's Coen lite, basically, but still filled with their best signatures: cracked humor, indelible characters, and cinematography so rich and saturated you want to dunk a cookie in it."
Arizona Republic," February 3, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," While individually some of the scenes are terrific, they don't add up to much, making ""Hail, Caesar!"" one of the Coens' lesser comedies, better than ""Intolerable Cruelty,"" say, but nowhere near the genius of ""The Big Lewbowski."""
"City Pages, Minneapolis/St. Paul"," February 3, 2016",Michael Nordine," They may not make them like they used to, but at least they still make them like this."
RogerEbert.com," February 3, 2016",Glenn Kenny," A comic fable that's both deftly clever and irrepressibly goofy. It is also, from stem to stern, the sweetest and sunniest film the Coens have ever made."
Examiner.com," February 3, 2016",Travis Hopson, This journey down memory lane is worth the trip but won't rank among the brothers' more substantial efforts.
Rolling Stone," February 4, 2016",Peter Travers, A wild whoosh of Coen brothers wizardry that left me laughing helplessly and filled with spiritual dread. That's the Coens for you. They're indispensable.
Daily Telegraph (UK)," February 4, 2016",Tim Robey," Hail, Caesar! keeps stumbling over its own best ideas as we stop to appreciate them - ditching momentum, preferring gaps for applause."
One Guy's Opinion," February 4, 2016",Frank Swietek," Impresses more as a fitfully engaging exercise than a fully realized vision... But to render unto 'Caesar' its due, the movie does deliver sporadic amusement and a few absolutely spectacular sequences. "
Charlotte Observer," February 4, 2016",Lawrence Toppman," ""Hail, Caesar!"" Hail? No. Maybe a faint nod of mild approval, but that's all."
Washington Post," February 4, 2016",Ann Hornaday, It's difficult to remember a recent movie so tartly on-point in skewering a power-driven industry obsessed with such seemingly meaningless ephemera as screen-credit and commissary pecking orders.
Slate," February 4, 2016",David Ehrlich," If the Coen brothers' dramas are cautionary tales, their comedies are veritable how-to guides for people who can't help but enjoy a mirthless chuckle at the humility of human existence. Yeah, the joke is on us, but that doesn't mean it isn't funny."
Chicago Daily Herald," February 4, 2016",Dann Gire," It's tappy, slappy, snappy and happy."
Miami Herald," February 4, 2016",Rene Rodriguez," ""Hail, Caesar!"" isn't the first time brothers Joel and Ethan Coen have made a dud comedy. But they've never made one that was this half-baked and lazy."
Chicago Tribune," February 4, 2016",Michael Phillips," The tone of ""Hail, Caesar!"" is even and assured, yet the comic inspiration is sporadic. Something's missing; the momentum sputters ..."
Salon.com," February 4, 2016",Andrew O'Hehir," Underneath the laff-riot and the Hollywood satire, ""Hail, Caesar!"" is a curiously delicate film built on profound affection for American movies and the illusions they build ..."
San Francisco Chronicle," February 4, 2016",Mick LaSalle," ""Hail, Caesar!"" is a flimsy construction that depends on a zany spirit and the charm of individual scenes to hold it together. There are times when this begins to feel like a dubious strategy, but each time the movie rights itself."
TIME Magazine," February 4, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," Hail, Caesar! doesn't completely hang together. But Johansson in a mermaid's tail? Really, why else make movies-or go to them?"
Austin Chronicle," February 4, 2016",Marc Savlov," It's both more and less than the sum of its parts, but its never less than thoroughly watchable."
St. Paul Pioneer Press," February 4, 2016",Chris Hewitt (St. Paul)," If you still get a thrill from seeing the MGM lion or hearing the Twentieth Century Fox fanfare, then that's - or, rather, ""Hail, Caesar!"" is - entertainment."
AV Club," February 4, 2016",Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, Somewhere in there are stretches of the Coens' funniest comedy since The Big Lebowski; it just takes a little patience.
ScreenAnarchy," February 4, 2016",Jason Gorber," A New Testament, a riff on the Coens' references, a love letter to a lost age. It's, in short, kind of astonishing. "
ComingSoon.net," February 4, 2016",Scott Chitwood," If you're a Coen brothers fan, this is well worth checking out in theaters."
Bullz-Eye.com," February 4, 2016",David Medsker," Hail, Caesar! features two slices of bread, some turkey, lettuce, tomato, cheese and mustard, yet at no point does the movie seem to realize that it can take all of those ingredients and make a sandwich."
Film Journal International," February 4, 2016",Kevin Lally," Hail, Caesar! has just enough entertainment value to merit a guarded recommendation. But [...] it likely won't be hailed as one of the Coens' best."
The New Republic," February 4, 2016",Will Leitch," Hail Caesar! is pure Coenism, for better or worse."
Toronto Star," February 4, 2016",Peter Howell," The Coens have replaced the acid in their pens with honey, for now at least, and the result is an affectionate comedy that is also one of their most satisfying achievements."
National Post," February 4, 2016",Chris Knight, Makes for a delightful if forgettable mid-winter treat.
New York Times," February 4, 2016",Manohla Dargis," If this were anyone other than the Coens you might think that success and a couple of Oscars had mellowed them. Not likely. ""Hail, Caesar!"" is one of those diversions that they turn out in between masterworks and duds."
Toronto Sun," February 4, 2016",Bruce Kirkland," Stacked with an all-star cast led by George Clooney, Josh Brolin and Scarlett Johansson, and packed with 1950s details about how the Hollywood studio system operated in all its self-indulgent glory in that era, Hail, Caesar! is a sly satire."
FilmDrunk," February 4, 2016",Vincent Mancini, A brilliant excuse for the Coen Brothers to make sketch comedy out of a series of classic Hollywood genres. I could watch 10 hours of this. 
Times (UK)," February 4, 2016",Kate Muir," Hail, Caesar! is a playful romp through Hollywood's golden studio age when egos and cigars were vast and backlots were filled with divas, communists and salacious gossip."
Film Comment Magazine," February 4, 2016",Michael Sragow," By now, the Coen Brothers are reflexively called ""quirky."" The only perverse thing about this movie, though, is that it salutes a company man."
MTV," February 4, 2016",Amy Nicholson," In the dailies of Hail, Caesar!'s fictional Hail, Caesar!, a title card reads, ""Divine presence to be shot."" To the Coens, is that a promise or a threat?"
The Movie Minute," February 4, 2016",Joanna Langfield, Why don't we leave the Coen Brothers' 1950's Hollywood studio comedy walking on air? 
MovieWeb," February 4, 2016",Julian Roman," 'Hail, Caesar!' has no lack of star power, but falls decidedly flat in insufferably dull stretches. The Coen Brothers have a rare miss with their Hollywood golden age satire."
Tampa Bay Times," February 4, 2016",Steve Persall," The big book of Coen characters must be stuffed with ideas, paper scraps jotted with traits and scrapes for the next Dude, Barton or Marge to get into. Hail, Caesar! is what happens when that book is dumped open, contents fluttering into randomness."
Kansas City Star," February 4, 2016",Robert W. Butler," Go for the laughs. But don't expect the spell of ""Hail, Caesar!"" to stick with you beyond the closing credits."
Paste Magazine," February 4, 2016",Jim Vorel," Hail Caesar! is blandly enjoyable in spurts, based on the strength of key performances, but it wouldn't take much to make it that much better."
IGN Movies," February 4, 2016",Jim Vejvoda," Hail, Caesar! may not be one of the Coen Brothers' finest efforts, but it's nevertheless a fun, charming, and oft-hilarious take on Hollywood's Golden Age."
Cleveland Plain Dealer," February 4, 2016",Joanna Connors," This is one of those movies where the actors are plainly having a great time; they're all terrific and give the Coens loose, funny, deadpan performances."
Newcity," February 4, 2016",Ray Pride," If the Coens embed their japery that deeply, there's more to divine from this seemingly superficial, largely pop-poppy confection."
Chicago Sun-Times," February 4, 2016",Richard Roeper, This is one of my favorite movies ever made about making movies.
AtHomeInHollywood.com," February 4, 2016",Staci Layne Wilson, The Coen Brothers have done it again - made an ensemble crime caper comedy that's pure tinsel town gold!
St. Louis Post-Dispatch," February 4, 2016",Calvin Wilson," Hollywood craziness would seem to be ideal grist for the Coen Brothers' absurdist mill. Unfortunately, ""Hail, Caesar!"" comes across as far less than the sum of its parts."
Empire Magazine," February 4, 2016",Dan Jolin," Likely to fry the mind of anyone who hasn't yet built up a resistance to the brothers' foibles and predilections over the past 16 films, it's easily the most Coen-y Coen movie they've put out. But then, they are stealing from the best."
ABC Tucson," February 5, 2016",Phil Villarreal," All hail the Coens, but you're OK to wait til it's on Redbox for this one. "
HollywoodInToto.com," February 5, 2016",Christian Toto," The Coens rarely bother to craft compelling finales. With Hail, Caesar! they've thrown in the towel on the third act, too."
WaffleMovies.com," February 5, 2016",Willie Waffle, It's boring.
Killer Movie Reviews," February 5, 2016",Andrea Chase," If Douglas Sirk had directed a film noir written by Billy Wilder, it might have looked something like the latest thoughtful tangle of philosophy and whimsy from the Coen Brothers. "
Globe and Mail," February 5, 2016",Kate Taylor, There are an awful lot of subplots and comic characters but none of the actors in this star-studded cast is allowed to build his laughs and the Coens just abandon several of these vivid personalities along the way.
Minneapolis Star Tribune," February 5, 2016",Colin Covert," Rather than adding up to an interwoven story line, it's a long, rambling shaggy-dog story. I know there is a dog in it, anyway. What they intended this confusing tale to be overall, I have no idea."
EricDSnider.com," February 4, 2016",Eric D. Snider," Movies are the Coens' religion, and they're two of the best theologians currently working."
New England Movies Weekly," February 4, 2016",Daniel M. Kimmel, ...like watching Turner Classic Movies while under the influence. 
Beliefnet," February 4, 2016",Nell Minow, Flat-out funny and a love letter to the movies.
Independent (UK)," February 4, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab, This is one of the Coen brothers' jolliest and most carefree films - quite a surprise considering its subject matter. 
Associated Press," February 4, 2016",Jake Coyle," It's something like a summation of Joel and Ethan Coen's films: Meaning is a missing frame, human folly is the star and only the dialogue is divine."
Los Angeles Times," February 4, 2016",Kenneth Turan," A hipster mash note to the way things used to be, it will put a smile on your face and keep it there for the duration."
San Diego Union-Tribune," February 4, 2016",Anders Wright," Will it rile up your emotions, or make you truly question something, anything, like their best films can do, while still making you laugh? Hail the Coens, to be sure, but in this case, it's questionable."
Film Racket," February 4, 2016",Bill Gibron, a cool breeze on a sweltering day
L.A. Biz," February 4, 2016",Annlee Ellingson," A love letter to a silly, exasperating industry ... that nonetheless produces works of art that are mesmerizing, meaningful and, well, ""swell."""
NPR," February 4, 2016",Chris Klimek," They're not the types to go fumbling for profundity, those Coens. Profoundly funny will do."
Austin American-Statesman," February 4, 2016",Joe Gross, An intermittently effective mash note to Hollywood's post-war golden age.
Mark Reviews Movies," February 4, 2016",Mark Dujsik," Hail, Caesar! is an episodic romp, filled with unabashed adoration for the feats, follies, and foibles of Hollywood."
Wall Street Journal," February 4, 2016",John Anderson," ""Hail, Caesar!"" verifies a suspicion long held here, that the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, really hate the movies."
Boston Globe," February 4, 2016",Ty Burr," There are the serious Coen brothers movies, like ""No Country for Old Men"" and, um, ""A Serious Man,"" and there are the not-so-serious ones. ""Hail, Caesar!"" is the opposite of their serious ones, and it is delightful."
Spirituality and Practice," February 5, 2016",Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, A light-hearted dramedy about a good man working in Hollywood.
Suburban Journals of St. Louis," February 5, 2016",Mathew DeKinder," ""Hail, Caesar!"" is little more than a goof and a laugh, but who better to take you on such a low-stakes venture than the Coen Brothers?"
EntertainmentTell," February 5, 2016",Stephen Silver," It's scattered, and full of ideas that don't quite connect with each other. But it's the most I've laughed at a Coen movie since Lebowski (FOX 29 Philly) "
ZEALnyc," February 5, 2016",Thelma Adams, Joyous chaos is what the Coen Brothers harness in their generous-spirited wet kiss to the industry they continue to master and remake. Bliss!
San Diego Reader," February 5, 2016",Matthew Lickona," Remember movies? The Coen brothers do. Westerns, romances, musicals, dance extravaganzas - the works. (All of which are on gorgeous, indulgent display here.) "
Screen It!," February 5, 2016",Jim Judy," The film feels scattershot at best. A few moments are fun or funny. Unfortunately, there are plenty of others that simply drag along for too long. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)"
Thrillist," February 5, 2016",Matt Patches, A deeply personal jaunt for the Coens ... also straight-up bonkers.

Common Sense Media," February 5, 2016",S. Jhoanna Robledo," Coen brothers' madcap, funny take on old Hollywood."
"Capital Times (Madison, WI)"," February 5, 2016",Rob Thomas," Perhaps only the Coens, who have made some of the best movies of the last 30 years, would make a movie celebrating the value of mediocre Hollywood schlock."
Video-Reviewmaster.com," February 5, 2016",Steve Crum," The Coens have laced 'Hail, Caesar!' with enough visuals and double entendres that beg for multiple viewings to appreciate them all. "
Reason Online," February 5, 2016",Kurt Loder, Gorgeous throughout. But the loosely structured narrative through-line isn't all that interesting...
Movie Mezzanine," February 5, 2016",Vikram Murthi," Hail, Caesar! is very, very funny with two or three of possibly the funniest scenes in the Coens' entire career..."
CinemaBlend.com," February 5, 2016",Eric Eisenberg," While it's not as narratively strong as most of the Coens' other great works, there's a good chance we'll be calling it one of the funniest movies of 2016."
Daily Film Fix," February 5, 2016",Jonathan W. Hickman," ""Hail, Caesar!"" is utterly delightful entertainment, eschewing dark moments while teasing big picture ideas. "
"Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)"," February 5, 2016",Bob Bloom," While ""Hail, Caesar!"" may not rank as one of the Coen brothers' best films, it does offer enough flashes of levity, wit and simple entertainment to have you smiling as you leave the multiplex."
Parade Magazine," February 5, 2016",Neil Pond," The Coens' gloriously goofy homage to the glory days of big studios, big stars and the big wheels that churned out the spectacles of Hollywood's dream factory from a bygone era."
Blu-ray.com," February 5, 2016",Brian Orndorf," ""Hail, Caesar!"" remains charming and intermittently hilarious, but there's a suspicious lack of oomph here, with Coen Brothers noticeably winded during this highly specific juggling act."
FromTheBalcony," February 5, 2016",Bill Clark," With Hail, Caesar!, it's baffling to see the Coens deliver something with next to nothing at stake and zero involvement from a character perspective."
ScreenRant," February 6, 2016",Sandy Schaefer," Hail, Caesar! is a funny and madcap, if unfocused, farcical salute to Golden Age Hollywood from the Coen Brothers."
CinemaDope," February 6, 2016",Glenn Lovell," ... obviously meant as a homage to the great Preston Sturges, the Coens' latest disappoints; it's a flimsy, surprisingly dour succession of double entendres, in-jokes, backlot vignettes ... "
The Patriot Ledger," February 6, 2016",Al Alexander," Unless you have a solid feel for Hollywood history, the Coens are going to leave you completely in the dark. But if, like me, you're a TCM junky, ""Hail, Caesar!"" is going to make you grin from ear to ear."
Creative Loafing," February 6, 2016",Matt Brunson," Whenever the Coens produce a breezy and straightforward comedy, many critics and fans grumble that they're simply coasting, they're making movies beneath them, and they're too valuable as filmmakers to simply offer nothing more than nyuks. Nonsense."
Patheos," February 6, 2016",Peter T. Chattaway," As an absurdist romp through Hollywood history and a provocative, deeply ironic riff on politics and religion and the things that give us meaning, Hail, Caesar! is a delight. As Mannix himself might say, the picture has worth."
New York Post," February 6, 2016",Lou Lumenick," Not one of the Coens' major works, but it's a very enjoyable lark, especially for fans of old Hollywood."
Tri-City Herald," February 5, 2016",Gary Wolcott," Ethan and Joel Coen flashback to 1950s Hollywood. It's their best film since O' Brother, Where Art Thou? and when the credits roll we all tip our hats and say Hail, Caesar. "
ReelViews," February 5, 2016",James Berardinelli," The more 1950s movies a person has seen and the greater their love for Hollywood of 60+ years ago, the greater their appreciation will be of what Joel and Ethan have brought to the screen."

Cinemaclips.com," February 5, 2016",Roger Tennis," This is a mixed bag Coen Brothers comedy that works best as a farcical tribute to the Golden Age of Hollywood. Is 'Hail, Caesar!' worth seeing? Hail, yes! "
Reel Reviews," February 5, 2016",Frank Wilkins," Finds a challenging and stimulating way to poke a bit of harmless fun at the brutal hypocrisy of Hollywood's system, while at the same time making it feel like a loving pat on the back."
Aisle Seat," February 5, 2016",Mike McGranaghan," An old Hollywood tale as only the Coen Brothers could tell it. If you love movies from the '40s and '50s, you'll see affection buried within the often uproarious parody of the on- and off-screen cinematic world at that time."
Birth.Movies.Death.," February 5, 2016",Meredith Borders," With HAIL, CAESAR!, Joel and Ethan Coen skewer and celebrate old Hollywood in equal turns, delivering a screwball movies-in-a-movie picture that satisfies in every particular."

Newsday," February 5, 2016",Rafer Guzman," ""Hail, Caesar!"" obeys the first commandment of filmmaking, attributed to the old master Billy Wilder: Thou shalt not bore."
Toledo Blade," February 5, 2016",Kirk Baird," Like most of the Coens' work, Hail, Caesar! has multiple levels to nod at and appreciate -- like the cigarette metaphor and the loving recreations of film genres: westerns, musicals, biblical epics."
NY1-TV," February 5, 2016",Neil Rosen," Hail, Caesar! is a bit disjointed and the story fall apart by the end, but who cares? It is an often-hilarious valentine to movie making in another era, and a good one at that."
Artforum," February 5, 2016",Nick Pinkerton," Joel Coen and Ethan Coen's Hail, Caesar! is the most deliriously enjoyable photoplay to open wide in what's thus far been a pretty barren new year -- and also a seriously funny comedy of ideas."

Laramie Movie Scope," February 11, 2016",Robert Roten," It is the best comedy ever by award-winning directors Ethan and Joel Coen, but much of its content will probably go right over the heads of most people in the audience. This screwball satire is both smart, and silly."

Truthdig," February 10, 2016",Carrie Rickey," In this unapologetically frivolous entertainment about the fixer who has a choice between 27-hour-days at the studio or a 9-to-5 in aerospace, our audience surrogate prefers illusion to reality. And who can blame him?"
Q Network Film Desk," February 10, 2016",James Kendrick," The Coens clearly have something to say about Hollywood's irresolvable dedication to art and commerce, but the uneven, shaggy-dog nature of the film's scattershot comedy buries most of it."

Kaplan vs. Kaplan," February 9, 2016",David Kaplan," For such a star-studded cast, most of the Coen brothers' latest effort, ""Hail, Caesar!"", falls flat. "

The ARTery," February 8, 2016",Sean Burns," Another epistemological prank from cinema's snarkiest philosophers, ""Hail, Caesar!"" is a Passion Play played for giggles, with the Golden Age of Hollywood serving as the garden of Gethsemane for yet another in the Coens' long line of serious men."

The Verge," February 12, 2016",Tasha Robinson," As Coen movies go, this is one of the most upbeat and optimistic, one of the few to suggest that good people can have happy endings. Classic Hollywood wouldn't have it any other way."

NUVO Newsweekly," February 12, 2016",Sam Watermeier," Hail, Caesar! seems like a lark -- an inessential Coen Brothers film. It's not one of their best, but beneath the surface of this Old Hollywood satire lies a comforting statement from the siblings about their plans for the future."
Dark Horizons," February 12, 2016",Gary Dowell," A slap-happy valentine to the Technicolor heyday of Hollywood that lands somewhere between the trippy brilliance of The Big Lebowski and the goofball parable of O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
Cambridge Day," February 12, 2016",Allyson Johnson," Visually the film is stunning, with Roger Deakins returning to the Coen fold with some eye-popping work, the underwater scene and a dusk car scene being particular highlights."
BuzzFeed News," February 12, 2016",Alison Willmore," The Coen brothers' new comedy isn't quite an homage to 1950s Hollywood, but it's not a spoof of it either -- it strikes that tone of crisp drollness that's their specialty and that some people misread as aloofness or contempt. But it's not."
Salt Lake City Weekly," February 12, 2016",Scott Renshaw," Few contemporary filmmakers create works that require more reflection than the Coen brothers -- and that applies even when they're turning out one of their ""lighter"" comedies."

Junkee," March 2, 2016",Clem Bastow," For all its outward glitz and lush ""prestige"" presentation, Hail, Caesar! is curiously empty, narratively and ideologically. It's also frequently and deadeningly dumb."

ABC Radio (Australia)," February 29, 2016",CJ Johnson," The Coen Brothers' 1950s-set Hollywood Studio comedy is an endlessly, effortlessly entertaining flight of fancy. If they only created it to delight themselves - which is how it possibly comes off - I have no beef with that."

3AW," February 26, 2016",Jim Schembri," The elaborate, beautifully slick musical numbers run for minutes on end and suggest the Coen's might have been better off making a full-on, old-style, unironic Hollywood movie rather than an ensemble comedy that merely pays tribute to them."
Sacramento News & Review," February 25, 2016",Daniel Barnes," As an examination of the post-war hypocrisy of Hollywood, the fantasyland of Hail, Caesar! is ten thousand times more righteous than the based-on-fact Trumbo. But as a Coen brothers' movie, it's just OK."

Uncut Magazine [UK]," March 4, 2016",Michael Bonner, Feels as much like a warm tribute to the studio pictures of the Coens' youth as it does an exuberant comedy in its own right.
The Arts Desk," March 4, 2016",Graham Fuller," As satirical fantasies go, Hail, Caesar! is so loving and spectacular a celebration of the Hollywood studio system of the early 1950s that it looks like a riposte to 2006's Hollywoodland.."
The Big Issue," March 4, 2016",Edward Lawrenson," A hugely entertaining romp. But Hail, Caesar! also emerges as a smart and subtly unnerving exploration of the seductive appeal of films over its paying audience - over us. "

Movie Talk," March 13, 2016",Jason Best," The intrigue is engagingly goofy, but the plot is really just an excuse for the Coens to spoof a series of Hollywood genres with gleeful precision. Their pastiche films are a joy, brazenly silly but pulled off with old-school panache."

The Ooh Tray," March 9, 2016",Ed Whitfield," Embrace the movies, says this movie about old movies, and know that the industry and its popular myths are the 20th century's totems, and that to be the bag man for the studio in such an era, was to be as close to godliness as is possible."
