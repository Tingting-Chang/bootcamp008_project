Cinegarage," January 16, 2017",Erick Estrada, A movie that has a seventies sci-fi vibe but is in the thriller where it has its greatest achievements. [Full review in Spanish]
NUVO Newsweekly," December 30, 2016",Sam Watermeier," Maybe it's not an obvious sequel, but this film certainly has the same spirit as Cloverfield, keeping viewers guessing until the last shot."
Financial Times," December 28, 2016",Nigel Andrews," It works best whenever Goodman swaggers into frame, a slack-jawed psycho with a cuddly side."
MovieMail," December 19, 2016",Mike McCahill," 10 Cloverfield Lane arrives as proof that, between the bloated junk and commercial no-brainers, the studio system can still surprise us."
Sunday Times (UK)," December 18, 2016",Edward Porter," Winstead and Goodman are both great, but there are quite a few niggling aspects, too. They include the conclusion, a bolted-on section that might leave you wondering if the film would have been better off with no ties to the Cloverfield brand."
Film Ireland Magazine," December 14, 2016",Colm Quinn," The film is strong. More than strong enough to stand on its own. There was no need to try peg it to Cloverfield's brand. In the end, that's the one thing that weakens it."
Movie Habit," December 12, 2016",Robert Denerstein," Before it's done, 10 Cloverfield Lane takes an unexpected turn or two. So don't be fooled by a bit of rope-a-dope pacing; by the end, the movie delivers a strong punch."
Film Inquiry," December 7, 2016",Mike Daringer, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a movie-lover's wet dream. It boldly tackles still to this day taboo issues of alcoholism while also being a straightforward thriller. 
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 5, 2016",Tim Brayton, A reasonably fast-paced thriller that manages to keep us confused about where precisely it's going even though where it's generally going could not be any more obvious.
rec.arts.movies.reviews," September 18, 2016",David N. Butterworth, A real meat and potatoes proposition -- satisfying *and* tasty!
Cinema Sight," August 22, 2016",Wesley Lovell," When sequels, even lateral ones, outdo their originals, it's a good thing. This is a good thing."
Chesapeake Family Magazine," August 2, 2016",Roxana Hadadi," Set in the same universe as the 2008 monster-focused blockbuster, 10 Cloverfield Lane focuses tightly on a trio of survivors, with solid fear and tension."
Washington Free Beacon," July 14, 2016",Sonny Bunch," [10 Cloverfield Lane is] alternately hilarious and terrifying, horrifying and tender."
Digital Spy," July 11, 2016",Ben Rawson-Jones, All you need to know is that you should see it as soon as you can. It's fantastic.
Brooklyn Magazine," June 28, 2016",Justin Stewart," The one-bunker setting ultimately proves only a little more novel a trick than Cloverfield's shaky cam, and its pressure to deliver the goods lets it down."
MediaMikes," June 21, 2016",Michael A. Smith," A word to the wise; if you go into this film looking for the monsters from J.J. Abrams film ""Cloverfield"" you may be disappointed. However, if you are in the mood for a small and satisfying thriller, then brave the bunker at ""10 Cloverfield Lane."""
Seanax.com," June 16, 2016",Sean Axmaker, It's a mix of high concept premise and old school thriller and director Dan Trachtenberg makes it all work nicely in his feature debut.
Baltimore Magazine," June 13, 2016",Max Weiss," Both Winstead and Gallagher Jr. are great as the young bomb shelter roomies, but it's Goodman's film. He's a Stephen King-style character -- affable and menacing, with both a cheery bonhomie and a hair-trigger temper. "
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," June 2, 2016",Brian Gibson," Its plot is finely calibrated and its atmosphere cannily climate-controlled. A deliciously terrifying treat to swallow down, hard, with a gulp."
ABC News Radio," May 31, 2016",David Blaustein," To tell you all the reasons why 10 Cloverfield Lane is so great would spoil it for you, and this is a movie experience that deserves to be completely unspoiled."
HeyUGuys," March 9, 2016",David Sztypuljak, A rollercoaster ride which will have you clinging to the edge of your seat from start to finish!
Metro," March 8, 2016",Matt Prigge," A crackerjack exercise not just in genre but genres, with exacting direction, three great performances and a genuine respect for audience patience, intelligence and willingness to be go with a story that drags you hither and thither."
TheWrap," March 8, 2016",Alonso Duralde," Even if this tale might have been better served as a 40-minute short than as a full-length movie, first-time feature director Dan Trachtenberg has cast a trio of actors at the top of their game, and they elevate the material. "
Hollywood Reporter," March 8, 2016",Justin Lowe," Although some may miss the immediacy of a rampaging kaiju destroying everything in its path, this is an entirely different breed of movie that's potentially even more effective for its shift in style and tone."
Entertainment Weekly," March 8, 2016",Chris Nashawaty," It's lean, and taut, and tense, and moves with Swiss-clock precision. Still, it's not as scary as you want it to be."
Variety," March 8, 2016",Justin Chang, A sensationally effective semi-sequel that bears virtually no narrative or stylistic resemblance to its predecessor ...
Total Film," March 8, 2016",Jamie Graham, Cloverfield was all about making viewers to gasp and pant; 10 Cloverfield Lane demands you hold your breath. As unnerving as it is surprising.
USA Today," March 10, 2016",Brian Truitt, A well-crafted affair by debuting director Dan Trachtenberg that mixes elements of an intimate stage play with the white-knuckled tension of a cracking good Twilight Zone episode.
RogerEbert.com," March 10, 2016",Brian Tallerico," This is rock-solid entertainment, a film meant to keep you guessing and jumping for 100 minutes before it throws you back into the world to argue about its ending."
Groucho Reviews," March 10, 2016",Peter Canavese," Essentially the picture is one tease after another, misdirecting as fast as it can and amounting to the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" vacuousness of mid-period M. Night Shyamalan. "
Miami Herald," March 10, 2016",Rene Rodriguez," Tamp down those expectations, then tamp them down some more."
MovieWeb," March 10, 2016",Julian Roman, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a taut psychological thriller with superb performances from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman. The measured reveal of the mysterious plot establishes a palpable tension throughout. 
Guardian," March 10, 2016",Jordan Hoffman," All three actors are tremendous, and director Dan Trachtenberg, making his feature debut, must be commended for keeping things tightly focused."
The Standard," March 10, 2016",Matt Neal," Opens like an indie romance, swerves into Saw territory, settles into light comedy, adds large helpings of horror and sci-fi, and wraps the entire thing up in mystery."
Graffiti With Punctuation," March 10, 2016",Blake Howard, 10 Cloverfield Lane is fun vacation into paranoia fallout; now you'll have to see it to find out why.
FILMINK (Australia)," March 9, 2016",Anthony O'Connor, It's a pity that such an unexpectedly effective thriller is so profoundly undone by a tonally disparate denouement.
Urban Cinefile," March 9, 2016",Andrew L. Urban," With its patchwork story, sewn together from disparate plotlines (perhaps collated from discarded script ideas), 10 Cloverfield Lane can be trying on our patience when it should be tightening the tension screws."
Crikey," March 9, 2016",Luke Buckmaster," It's Goodman who cranks the dial to eleven and steals the show, a bouldering force of nature delivering an utterly shit-eating performance. This will be remembered as one of the great roles from one of the great character actors."
Screen-Space," March 9, 2016",Simon Foster," By the time Trachtenberg's remarkably assured direction draws a clear line between the sequel and its predecessor, all contributors have ensured audience involvement is peaking."
The Verge," March 9, 2016",Bryan Bishop, One of the most entertaining genre movies I've seen since Cabin in the Woods.
Us Weekly," March 9, 2016",Mara Reinstein," For the love of Google, don't scour the web for third-act spoilers. Just know that an old-fashioned scary movie can still make you squirm, laugh and gasp for air. "
Screen International," March 9, 2016",Tim Grierson," Forget monsters: In ""10 Cloverfield Lane,"" it's the paranoia and claustrophobia that will kill you."
Movies.com," March 9, 2016",Erik Davis," ...a psychological cinematic chess game stuffed with thrills, chills and a neat little premise that keeps you guessing till the very last shot"
Uproxx," March 9, 2016",Mike Ryan," It's all very exhilarating and, at times, it's one of the scariest movies I've seen in a long time."
4:3," March 9, 2016",Conor Bateman," 10 Cloverfield Lane still feels like the spec script it spawned from, trying vainly to pack tense set pieces and striking moments of violence into its simplistic chamber play."
CinemaBlend.com," March 9, 2016",Greg Wakeman," Concise, suspenseful, yet still playful and smartly orchestrated."
Village Voice," March 9, 2016",Alan Scherstuhl," As a gamelike, simulationist PG-13 horror chamber piece, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a success: well shot and -staged, arrestingly acted, edited with a crisp unpredictability."
Associated Press," March 10, 2016",Jocelyn Noveck," Trachtenberg scares the wits out of us a few times, and then he launches into a climax that will have many talking -- though I found it somewhat disappointing, a little predictable, and frustratingly baffling. But you might love it."
Empire Magazine," March 10, 2016",Jonathan Pile, A thriller that winds you tighter and tighter before its secrets come tumbling out in a cathartic finale.
RedEye," March 10, 2016",Matt Pais, A movie about fear that's not scary or surprising enough.
Seattle Times," March 10, 2016",Soren Anderson," Rather than something truly wild and way, way off the wall, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a variation on the ""don't go down into the basement"" school of scary moviemaking, only this time with a 180-degree twist."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," March 10, 2016",Robbie Collin, The film zips between claustrophobic tension and nervous laughs with hoverfly agility.
AV Club," March 10, 2016",A.A. Dowd," There's a fine, nerve-jangling little psychological thriller here. Pity it couldn't have been allowed to just be that."
Chicago Sun-Times," March 10, 2016",Bill Zwecker," Unpredictability in cinema is frequently a missing element -- especially when we're talking about movies that fall into the horror or science-fiction genres. With 10 Cloverfield Lane, there is no such problem. Trust me."
Charlotte Observer," March 10, 2016",Lawrence Toppman," Abrams has tried to produce a film that stands on its own yet ties into a universe that has yet to fully reveal itself. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" manages to do both - yet in retrospect, the first would have been enough."
Vanity Fair," March 10, 2016",Richard Lawson," An overdone finale aside, there's much to enjoy and admire in 10 Cloverfield Lane, from its sharp performances to its economical, acutely realized sense of scale."
IGN Movies," March 10, 2016",Lucy O'Brien," While its story is smaller than the one told in the original Cloverfield, it is no less effective in its ability to unnerve and excite, and ultimately reminds us that humans can be much more frightening than sharp teeth and tentacles."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," March 10, 2016",Colin Covert, The point of this precisely crafted film is psychological possibility. It creates a kind of Hitchcockian thriller where uncertainty soaks the story and spreads across the atmosphere like blood on a shirt.
San Francisco Chronicle," March 10, 2016",Mick LaSalle," At one point, this movie had me so on edge that I had a fleeting impulse to run out of the theater. It might be weird to say that and mean it as a compliment, but good thrillers work that way sometimes."
New York Daily News," March 10, 2016",Ethan Sacks," The best reveal of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is that the script from Josh Campbell, Matthew Steucken and Damien Chazelle (""Whiplash"") is strong enough to have made a compelling stageplay instead of a creature feature."
Rip It Up," March 10, 2016",David 'Mad Dog' Bradley," Suffice to say that this is damn creepy stuff with fine work from Goodman, Winstead and Gallagher."
Junkee," March 10, 2016",Dave Crewe, First-time director Dan Trachtenberg finds just the right pace to keep us on our toes through all this.
Film Journal International," March 10, 2016",Ethan Alter," A sequel in third act only, 10 Cloverfield Lane successfully switches out monster-movie mayhem for chamber-room chills."
Philadelphia Inquirer," March 10, 2016",Steven Rea, Thumpingly exhilarating ...
TIME Magazine," March 10, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," Not an outright Cloverfield sequel but rather, as Abrams has put it, a ""spiritual successor."" It's also a better movie, one with a sense of humor about itself and its genre."
Arizona Republic," March 10, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," Trachtenberg is patient building this world, and the actors do a good job inhabiting it."
Newark Star-Ledger," March 10, 2016",Stephen Whitty," I sure hope there's an ""11 Cloverfield Lane."""
The Movie Minute," March 10, 2016",Joanna Langfield," If Sam Shepard ever goofed around with the alien horror genre, he might have come up with something like this surprisingly effective thriller."
San Diego Reader," March 10, 2016",Matthew Lickona," Just serviceable bunker thriller that asks the question, ""Would you want to survive The Big One if it meant being stuck [underground] with the kind of guy who spent his life preparing to survive The Big One?"""
Las Vegas Weekly," March 10, 2016",Josh Bell," Trachtenberg keeps the tension high, and even with the knowledge that something monstrous is likely lurking in the background, the movie remains unpredictable."
Portland Mercury," March 10, 2016",Andrew Wright," Takes an instantly fraught premise and never stops stripping the screws. Within its narrow self-imposed parameters, it's just about perfect."
National Post," March 10, 2016",Chris Knight, A claustrophobic thriller with a whip-smart script that never tips its hand too soon.
Mark Reviews Movies," March 10, 2016",Mark Dujsik, This serves as a good reminder that just because a movie can go in a certain direction doesn't necessarily mean it should.
Examiner.com," March 10, 2016",Travis Hopson," It is, in more ways than one, a totally different creature from ""Cloverfield""; one that is frequently jarring, brilliantly controlled, and definitely worth going in blind."
NPR," March 10, 2016",Scott Tobias," Trachtenberg and his screenwriters, Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken, take advantage of the shelter's tight quarters, which contribute to the expected pressure-cooker atmosphere of suspicion and hostility but also open up the punch-drunk comedy ..."
AllMovie," March 10, 2016",Daniel Gelb," Trachtenberg impressively weaves together a delightful amalgamation of past influences, red herrings, and unrelenting tension."
Sydney Morning Herald," March 10, 2016",Jake Wilson," Above all 10 Cloverfield Lane is a showcase for Goodman, a consummate actor whose ability to terrify has rarely been exploited so thoroughly."
Toronto Star," March 10, 2016",Peter Howell," From its Hitchcock opening to its eye-popping ending, Dan Trachtenberg's feature debut keeps us wondering about what's really going on, even as we root for Mary Elizabeth Winstead's spunky entrapped protagonist."
New York Times," March 10, 2016",Jeannette Catsoulis, A master class on narrative pacing and carefully managed jolts.
Flicks.co.nz," March 10, 2016",Tony Stamp," A terrific, compact thriller."
Washington Post," March 10, 2016",Michael O'Sullivan," Goodman's performance, while unhinged, never veers into caricature. Similarly, Winstead avoids the cliche of the tank-top-wearing bimbo/victim, bringing an earthy self-reliance to her role."
Newsday," March 10, 2016",Rafer Guzman," ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is as economical as a stage play but packs in plenty of visceral violence and visual surprises. Whether you've seen the first film or not, this one is a thoroughly entertaining treat."
Consequence of Sound," March 10, 2016",Allison Shoemaker," Approach 10 Cloverfield Lane on its own terms, let Dan Trachtenberg and his top-notch cast yank you into their world, and try not to sweat through your clothes."
TheFrightFile.com," March 10, 2016",Dustin Putman, A chamber suspenser with real armrest-grabbing power.
The Film Stage," March 10, 2016",Dan Schindel, The fact that it's so drastically different from Cloverfield makes it a perfect sequel.
Film Racket," March 10, 2016",Bill Gibron, a whole lot of nail-biting fun.
One Guy's Opinion," March 10, 2016",Frank Swietek," A taut, claustrophobic exercise in tension with a distinctly 'Twilight Zone' vibe...that will keep you guessing."
Lyles' Movie Files," March 10, 2016",Jeffrey Lyles, Chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane as 2016's first great surprise you never saw coming. 
"Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)"," March 10, 2016",Bob Bloom," The cleverness of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is that it continually keeps the audience guessing, offering crumbs of hints, but never revealing its hand - at least for the first 95 of its 105-minute run time."
New York Post," March 10, 2016",Sara Stewart," Winstead also makes a terrific heroine; her character is a problem-solver, not a freaker-outer, and it's a stressful sort of fun watching her devise one plan after another to get around Howard's creepy patriarchal rules."
ReelViews," March 10, 2016",James Berardinelli," Take away the disappointing, disjointed, and anti-climactic final act, and this is an effective white-knuckle psychological thriller."

We Got This Covered," March 10, 2016",Matt Donato," 10 Cloverfield Lane is nothing that you'd expect, which ends up being its greatest and most alluring strength. "
New England Movies Weekly," March 10, 2016",Daniel M. Kimmel," It may not leave you screaming for a sequel, but it won't leave you screaming for your money back either."
The Playlist," March 10, 2016",Kevin Jagernauth," This is all you need to know: when that mystery box is finally opened, you'll be more than satisfied."
Los Angeles Times," March 10, 2016",Mark Olsen," It is designed to be fun, efficient and accessible and delivers precisely and exactly on that and nothing more."
Detroit News," March 10, 2016",Adam Graham," Winstead gives a strong performance as a captive who never gives up her fight. Goodman strikes a fine balance between nurturing caregiver and frightening captor, even if, to the detriment of the story, his end game is never really made clear."
Reel Film Reviews," March 10, 2016",David Nusair, 10 Cloverfield Lane ultimately establishes itself as one of the most effective and downright creepy thrillers to come around in quite some time. 
indieWire," March 10, 2016",Kate Erbland," Trachtenberg ratchets up the tension with ease, and even small things are filled with a stomach-turning dread that keeps the film chugging along until its explosive last act."
Globe and Mail," March 10, 2016",Barry Hertz," This is a work of immense confidence, and the restraint Trachtenberg asks of his leads is remarkable -- Winstead and Goodman quietly excel in what could have easily been wild, loud caricatures."
Toronto Sun," March 10, 2016",Steve Tilley," The more you know about it, the less fun it will be."
AtHomeInHollywood.com," March 10, 2016",Staci Layne Wilson," It's a drama, it's a thriller, horror, sci-fi and mystery all in one."
Salt Lake Tribune," March 10, 2016",Sean P. Means," The title of 10 Cloverfield Lane is a bait-and-switch game, but for the best possible reasons -- because it so perfectly sets you up for one type of thriller that you won't be ready for the real terror as it unfolds."
Chicago Tribune," March 10, 2016",Michael Phillips," Goodman's very good, taking care of job one, which is to keep us guessing Howard's intentions. And Winstead is even better, within the parameters of this genre mashup."
Time Out," March 10, 2016",Joshua Rothkopf," Producer J.J. Abrams, a brilliant marketer, has to eventually open his ""mystery box,"" and the intelligence plummets. Never mind that. Go anyway and watch the arrival of the mighty Winstead, who'd do fine in a Room of her own."
NOW Toronto," March 10, 2016",Norman Wilner," This movie is about its characters rather than its situation, and the actors are quick to fill the emotional space."
Rolling Stone," March 10, 2016",Peter Travers, the movie comes loaded with everything a psychological thriller needs to shatter your nerves - and then kicks it up a notch.

Screen It!," March 11, 2016",Jim Judy," I enjoyed the flick for a being a taut thriller that keeps you rooting for the protagonist and guessing -- until the end -- about what's really happening. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)"
Slant Magazine," March 11, 2016",Chuck Bowen," The legacy of Syd Field's screenwriting manual hangs over 10 Cloverfield Lane, as it does all of Abrams's productions, which never even accidentally cast a whiff of subtext or authorial personality. "
Movie Guys with Jeff & Dave," March 11, 2016",Jeffrey K. Howard, A suspenseful and glorified Twilight Zone episode that provides plenty of thrills and twists to keep you squirming in your seat. John Goodman delivers one of the best performances of his career!

3AW," March 11, 2016",Jim Schembri," It's a tense time in a confined space and director Dan Trachtenberg, taking his cue from Alfred Hitchcock (who would have loved the premise of this film), keeps tightening the screws until the final big reveal."
EricDSnider.com," March 10, 2016",Eric D. Snider, A masterfully suspenseful thriller set in a doomsday bunker with some white-knuckle moments.

San Diego Union-Tribune," March 10, 2016",Anders Wright," Winstead is the glue that holds it all together, but it's Goodman who, as Howard, really runs the show."
Tribune News Service," March 11, 2016",Katie Walsh," Put this down, close this tab, go to your local multiplex and just buy a ticket. Even better if you haven't seen more than a teaser trailer. Do not pass go, do not collect $200, proceed directly to the theater. "
Suburban Journals of St. Louis," March 11, 2016",Mathew DeKinder," ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" certainly wins points for originality and, while its climax will garner its share of eye-rolls, I tip my hat for it at least trying to be a little bit different."

The Australian," March 11, 2016",Michael Bodey," It is best not to know where 10 Cloverfield Lane will take you. Revel in the competence of its craft and the playfulness of its performances. And revel in not knowing, for once."
Huffington Post," March 11, 2016",Brandon Judell," From the opening 'Psycho'-fueled moments to the allusions to 'Notorious' to the surprising twist of a finale, it's hard to recall a recent film that made squirming in one's seat such a pleasurable pastime. "
Tri-City Herald," March 11, 2016",Gary Wolcott, The movie address to find this weekend is 10 Cloverfield Lane. Delightfully entertaining and John Goodman's loose cannon is among his best ever performances. 
Stuff.co.nz," March 11, 2016",Graeme Tuckett," 10 Cloverfield Lane is no masterpiece, but it achieves exactly what it set out to do with a bit of flair, a few real laughs and a couple of perfectly weighted scares. I walked out happy to have seen it. You probably will too."
Vox," March 11, 2016",Todd VanDerWerff," It's a conclusion that won't be to everyone's liking, but I can't fault a climax this weird when it produces a final shot as perfect as 10 Cloverfield Lane's -- though you'll have to go see the movie to find out what it is."
San Francisco Examiner," March 11, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," The filmmakers keep the mystery going, indicating that the movie's not just another dashed-off attempt to cash in. "

Playboy Online," March 11, 2016",Stephen Rebello," It's a credit to director Trachtenberg, in a remarkably self-assured feature directing debut, that he lets the actors, including John Gallagher (The Newsroom), make a good script even better."
MTV," March 11, 2016",Amy Nicholson," Great publicity, dumb move. The title alone is a spoiler. "
Thrillist," March 11, 2016",Matt Patches," It's a have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too horror movie, where the sights and sounds crescendo to the very last beat."
New York Magazine/Vulture," March 11, 2016",David Edelstein, 10 Cloverfield Lane does what it needs to do: make you sit and squirm and want very badly to know. It has the appeal of suspense radio plays from the '30s and '40s and even a touch of Orson Welles's most infamous Mercury Theater broadcast.
The New Republic," March 11, 2016",Will Leitch, The horrors of that bunker far outweigh anything that could be waiting for them outside. Sometimes what is right in front of you is plenty terrifying enough. 
CraveOnline," March 11, 2016",William Bibbiani, I put it to you that ending of 10 Cloverfield Lane sucks. Now let me explain why.
BuzzFeed News," March 11, 2016",Alison Willmore," 10 Cloverfield Lane is rewardingly claustrophobic, keeping its focus tight on the characters and their cramped space while whatever disasters there are loom outside the bunker."
Cambridge Day," March 11, 2016",Allyson Johnson," The film is much more in the psychological thriller genre vein, so hardcore horror fans may be disappointed. But it barely diminishes the shine of the film, an excellent and confident addition to the genre."
Paste Magazine," March 15, 2016",Mark Rozeman," After years spent quietly establishing himself as one of film and TV's go-to character actors, it's fantastic to see [Goodman] receive a big-screen role that truly capitalizes on his outsized talents."
Little White Lies," March 15, 2016",Katherine McLaughlin, A smart and tense chamber piece that builds suspense carefully.
SSG Syndicate," March 15, 2016",Susan Granger," Character-driven, tension-filled tale of psychological terror...."
Laramie Movie Scope," March 14, 2016",Robert Roten," The performances in this film are excellent. Director Dan Trachtenberg does a great job of maintaining the intensity of the suffocating suspense in this thriller. The screenplay sizzles with tension, and it rises to a whole new level at the end."
Bloody Disgusting," March 14, 2016",Brad Miska, Forget all about Cloverfield and just soak in the immense claustrophobia and paranoia that's so unrelenting you'll have to dig your nails out of the theater's armrests.

New Yorker," March 14, 2016",Richard Brody," Trachtenberg ... smothers the action in showy camera work and an overly insistent music score. But, as the mystery unravels, he reveals flashes of a giddily hyperbolic pop imagination."
The List," March 14, 2016",Matt Glasby, Let's hope it's not another eight years before we pass this way again.
About.com," March 13, 2016",John Rico, I couldn't help but see the very visible thread line where the original film ended and the new ending was tacked on to make it a Cloverfield film.
Deadline Hollywood Daily," March 13, 2016",Pete Hammond, There are a lot of cinematic influences here from Hitchcock to War Of The Worlds but the original CLOVERFIELD surprisingly isn't really one of them in this pure anti-sequel that entertains while it surprises.

Kaplan vs. Kaplan," March 12, 2016",David Kaplan," Just when things seem to settle down as Howard, Michelle and Emmett relax with a quiet board game, the movie morphs into a nerve-jangling suspense yarn in seconds flat. "
Creative Loafing," March 12, 2016",Matt Brunson, The terrific performances by the three leads and director Dan Trachtenberg's effective staging are worthy enough to earn this a modest recommendation.

Missoula Independent," March 17, 2016",Molly Laich," I'm not a doctor, but it seems to me like they took a small story about people trapped in a basement, slapped some Cloverfield-like events on it ad hoc and then marketed the movie to us in a shameful cash grab."

Tulsa World," March 17, 2016",Michael Smith, It's a small film crafted beautifully to create a claustrophobic nightmare that can stand alone as a quality thriller or as a companion piece for those looking to make a Cloverfield connection.
Austin Chronicle," March 17, 2016",Marc Savlov," The film stumbles a bit in the end, when the exact nature of the perils within and without are made clear, but up until that point, 10 Cloverfield Lane is scarily suspenseful stuff."
"Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)"," March 17, 2016",Ken Hanke," With or without the Cloverfield business, 10 Cloverfield Lane isn't a bad movie, merely a predictable and largely mediocre one."

The Sunday Age," March 25, 2016",Craig Mathieson," Goodman, too often a worthy supporting player, delivers a captivating performance defined by menace and delusional altruism, but there's a shortage of doubt or even just conflicting allegiances in the screenplay."

Sunday Independent (Ireland)," March 21, 2016",Hilary A White," Trachtenberg's outing is taut, slippery and tremendous value for money. Winstead is all doe-eyed grit right up to and beyond the film's final detonations."
