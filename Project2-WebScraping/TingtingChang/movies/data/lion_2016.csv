Laramie Movie Scope," February 7, 2017",Robert Roten," The based on fact story is a can't miss emotional powerhouse, which manages to overcome some subplots that seem to be time-filling sidetracks."
El antepenúltimo mohicano," February 7, 2017",José Martín," One of the most beautiful and inspiring films of the year, the ones that seem to be thoughtfully detailed to sneak into the award races. [Full review in Spanish]"
LarsenOnFilm," February 5, 2017",Josh Larsen, ...delicate handling of material that easily could have been turned into feel-good slop.
ABC Radio Brisbane," February 4, 2017",Matthew Toomey, It's hard not to feel a tingle down your spine as the film's reaches its climax. My eyes were moist and I wasn't the only one in the audience with that same reaction.
Daily Film Fix," February 3, 2017",Jonathan W. Hickman," In a way, ""Lion"" is a better film than even ""Slumdog"" in that its intimate focus and emotionally engaging story should play deeper and resonate more broadly."
Impulse Gamer," February 1, 2017",Damien Straker," Some films are simply great stories and nothing more. Lion is one such example of this, although its treatment leaves a bit to be desired."
Matt's Movie Reviews," February 1, 2017",Matthew Pejkovic," Patel brilliantly portrays a young man adrift in a sea of uncertainty towards his identity, haunted by a past he barely survived and guilt ridden over loving a family he barely knew. "
El Mundo (Spain)," February 1, 2017",Luis Martínez," What may well have been a reflection on the moral poverty of the world, soon becomes an irritating melodrama. [Full review in Spanish]"
El Pais (Spain)," February 1, 2017",Javier Ocaña, A conventional film with strong tendencies towards being tearful and musical. [Full review in Spanish]
Cinemanía (Spain)," February 1, 2017",Andrea G. Bermejo," Lion's emotional strength lies in its honest approach to adoption, to the feeling of the adoptee and the one adopted, to the stuck pieces, to the inevitable emptiness of not knowing where we come from and who we are. [Full review in Spanish]"
Blog de cine," February 1, 2017",Mikel Zorrilla," An estimable film, especially during its first hour, and that has sufficient virtues that makes it worth to take a look at it. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," February 1, 2017",John Beifuss," The movie's first half is filled with tumult, menace and a vivid sense of place; the second half, which emphasizes the idea that the comfortable and well-educated Saroo is a 'lost' soul (literally), is tedious."
The Sunday Age," January 27, 2017",Craig Mathieson," The movie mostly succeeds in grounding the hard to believe in easy to comprehend circumstances and readily real emotion. It's not a great film, but it's effective in how it sets up and satisfies a life-changing tale."
Blu-ray.com," January 26, 2017",Brian Orndorf," ""Lion"" isn't revolutionary filmmaking, but as comfort food cinema goes, it carries requisite anxiety and release, making it palatable to the mass audience while still retaining some subtlety with periodically intense character examination. "
Junkee," January 25, 2017",Mel Campbell, Lion is a feel-good story that works best when it uses the visual language of cinema to map such inner worlds onto outer ones.
Adelaide Review," January 25, 2017",David 'Mad Dog' Bradley," [Pawar is] remarkably natural and heart-rendingly real, and offers one of the best child performances in years in a very demanding role."
The Standard," January 24, 2017",Matt Neal," Lion starts strong and finishes on a teary high, with its comparatively lesser moments buoyed by the presence of Patel."
3AW," January 24, 2017",Jim Schembri," Unhurried in pace, subtle in tone and simple in structure, this moving, compassionate film engages with the age-old theme of finding one's place in the world, yet through uniquely 21st Century means."
Concrete Playground," January 23, 2017",Sarah Ward," Lion does exactly what it needs to make hearts soar and tears swell. It might do so in a standard fashion, but, boy does it do it well."
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," January 23, 2017",Aine O'Connor, The award-baiting performances are really good and it is beautifully shot by cinematographer Greig Fraser.
HeyUGuys," October 18, 2016",Luke Channell, Dev Patel's most sophisticated and touching performance to date helps hold things together as he expertly portrays Saroo's inner conflict and identity crisis.
The Arts Desk," October 14, 2016",Adam Sweeting," Obviously an extraordinary experience for the real-life protagonists, but for the movie viewer not so much."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," October 13, 2016",Tim Robey," Involves no one you've ever heard of, doesn't star a soul you'll recognise for its first 40 minutes, and will rip you into a thousand pieces."
AwardsCircuit.com," September 28, 2016",Shane Slater, Lion is a triumphant celebration of the beauty of the human spirit.
sbs.com.au," September 22, 2016",Michelle Orange, Richly produced but somewhat inert.
JoBlo's Movie Emporium," September 21, 2016",Chris Bumbray, A terrific true-life tale packed with great performances. 
Film School Rejects," September 17, 2016",Matt Hoffman," True story or not, there is no denying that Lion is a largely empty film. A paint-by-numbers production, Lion is following a simple set of instructions for achieving an emotional response from its audience."
Cinema Movil," September 15, 2016",Oscar Uriel, An emotional film that connects with the audience and resembles those epic films full of sentimentalism. [Full review in Spanish]
The Young Folks," September 14, 2016",Allyson Johnson, Hopefully Lion will be the film that proves [Patel's] leading man capabilities and also shines a line on just how nuanced and charismatic he is in a role written well.
indieWire," September 14, 2016",Eric Kohn," Even as it drags through a pedestrian middle section, Lion remains a cut above the kind of sturdy middlebrow drama its premise calls to mind by doubling down on Patel's performance."
The Film Stage," September 13, 2016",Jordan Ruimy, Davis' talent feels hammered down by Luke Davies' screenplay adaptation that ultimately meanders around until it comes to a lackluster halt.
Vanity Fair," September 13, 2016",Richard Lawson," It's an earnest but not cloying film, one that seems wise about the world and its alternately grim and encouraging complexity."
Uproxx," September 13, 2016",Mike Ryan, You will cry during the greatest Google Maps commercial ever made. Maybe bring a tissue.
The List," September 13, 2016",Allan Hunter," Because it is a true story we may know exactly where Lion is heading but that does nothing to lessen the impact of a film that deals so eloquently with loss, love and our understanding of family."
Guardian," September 11, 2016",Benjamin Lee, It's refreshing to see the complications of a mixed racial identity brought to the screen. It might never roar but it's still a fierce contender.
Hollywood Reporter," September 11, 2016",David Rooney, As enthralling as it is emotional.
The Playlist," September 11, 2016",Kevin Jagernauth," While Lion isn't the kind of drama that demands risky storytelling, it is one that has within it a whole world of emotional topography that is disappointingly scrolled over instead of mapped out."
Collider," September 11, 2016",Matt Goldberg," We spend more time with Saroo looking at maps, looking at Google Earth, and pushing people away than we do with him considering the fact that he's never really assimilated into Australian culture."
Screen International," September 11, 2016",Fionnuala Halligan," A dignified, authentic yet highly-moving crowd-pleaser."
Variety," September 11, 2016",Peter Debruge," While unique, Saroo's story is somewhere between the-guy-who-found-a-lottery-scratcher-worth-fifty-bucks and the-farmer-who-prayed-for-rain-and-got-it."
We Got This Covered," November 23, 2016",Matt Donato," Lion may be a little too Oscar-bait-y, but it's not without loud emotional roars."
Den of Geek," November 23, 2016",Edward Douglas," You'll try your best to hold back the tears, only to find yourself incapable of not being thoroughly moved by Saroo's journey. "
Slate," November 23, 2016",Forrest Wickman," Lion goes again and again where you expect it to, delivering little more than the awards-season equivalent of Homeward Bound."
The Straits Times (Singapore)," November 23, 2016",John Lui, By the film's climax -- even if you know how it will end -- viewers should be a blubbering mess.
Time Out," November 23, 2016",Tom Huddleston," We've watched this young man struggle and fight for answers, only to have them drop into his lap at precisely the right moment. It's a drastic misstep that ruins whatever chance Lion had of doing justice to a fascinating true story."
Slant Magazine," November 23, 2016",Matt Brennan," Lion's faults of structure and pacing might limit its power, but in stretches it still roars."
Film Journal International," November 23, 2016",Shirley Sealy, Lion is one of those rare films which effortlessly manages to put us inside the heads of protagonists and make us believe that their reality is our reality too. 
AV Club," November 23, 2016",Esther Zuckerman," By splitting up the story into different eras of the hero's life, Davis seems to be striving to avoid some of the conventions of melodrama. But coloring within the lines might have done a couple of favors to his actors and the flow of his film."
Us Weekly," November 22, 2016",Mara Reinstein, Ditch the cynicism; take the Kleenex.
Village Voice," November 22, 2016",Alan Scherstuhl," Here's a globe-trotting boy-on-his-own adventure, a narrative of scrappy survival and familial love and many teary reconciliations, tracing the outlines of Brierley's life in a busy two hours."
Nerdist," November 22, 2016",Luke Y. Thompson," ...it misses the mark on the duality-Saroo goes from forgetting his past completely to suddenly being all about it, and it's a lot more complicated than that"
New York Post," November 21, 2016",Kyle Smith," This is a true story, and at times a gut-wrenching one, even if it necessarily sugarcoats some aspects of the plight of lost children."
Entertainment Weekly," November 21, 2016",Darren Franich," Where Saroo goes and what he finds there left me in tears, but you feel that a complicated true story has been airbrushed into a postmodern legend."
New Yorker," November 21, 2016",Anthony Lane," Davis's film is based on a true story; though wrenching, there is barely enough of it to fill the dramatic space, and the second half is a slow and muted affair after the Dickensian punch of the first."
Black Girl Nerds," November 5, 2016",Jacqueline Coley," Patel's constant anger and destitution get a bit tedious, but the uplifting ending will move even the most stoic movie-goer to tears."
Compuserve," November 4, 2016",Harvey S. Karten," If you've ever been lost, and who hasn't? This movie is for you, featuring a five-year-old boy from India who winds up in Australia."
TheFilmFile.com," October 27, 2016",Dustin Putman," The trajectory ""Lion"" takes isn't surprisingit is quite inevitable, actuallybut the film's centerpiece true account is respectful and, ultimately, heartening."
AwardsCircuit.com," October 26, 2016",Clayton Davis," In his feature film debut, director Garth Davis creates a formally riveting and emotionally shattering look into the complexities of family and the ache of separation."
Punch Drunk Critics," October 21, 2016",Travis Hopson," Lion plays safe more often than necessary, but it definitely roars when it counts."
International Business Times," October 20, 2016",Amy West, The characters are wonderfully rounded and each performer brings them to screen with such a sense of realism that you can't help but feel both moved and inspired. 
Film Comment Magazine," December 2, 2016",Michael Sragow, The film ends with that contemporary movie rarity-an authentic and overwhelming display of gratitude.
Reeling Reviews," December 1, 2016",Robin Clifford," ""Lion"" is a good calling card for the new director [Garth Davis]"
Tribune News Service," December 1, 2016",Katie Walsh," Patel easily grows to fill the needs of this complex and conflicted character, a man caught between two worlds, two cultures and two families. "
Movie Nation," December 1, 2016",Roger Moore," An inspiring story of cruel fate, cruel people, the kindness of strangers and childhood traumas that we never forget"
New York Observer," November 30, 2016",Rex Reed, See it and I promise your own heart will skip a beat with happiness and joy.
Associated Press," November 30, 2016",Mark Kennedy," Lion is really two beautifully shot films -- the tenacious story of young Saroo Brierley, lost far from home, and the less dramatic, slightly forced, story of him all grown up and looking for his past."
The Atlantic," November 29, 2016",David Sims," Lion is ultimately an excellent example of its type-a resonant true story told, not with manipulative cliches, but with refreshing confidence."
Spliced Personality," November 28, 2016",Sean Burns, This frustrating film begins with artful evocations of Dickensian squalor and turns into a movie about a guy staring at a laptop. 
Newark Star-Ledger," November 25, 2016",Stephen Whitty, The trite tropes are thick but Saroo's drama remains undramatized and we remain mostly unmoved.
Rolling Stone," November 25, 2016",Peter Travers," Kudos to Kidman, whose unglam, unguarded take on the role is emotionally powerful and true; her scenes with Patel provide just the right blend of grit and grace. Lion is one from the heart. "
TIME Magazine," November 25, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," Lion ... becomes ordinary, even as it moves toward a climax that's moving for all the predictable reasons."
USA Today," November 24, 2016",Brian Truitt," The finale is manipulative in every way, squeezing out the emotions of the audience. But Lion's well-plotted narrative and thoughtful characters suck you in so much that the journey there is totally worth it."
RogerEbert.com," November 24, 2016",Susan Wloszczyna," Let's just say if you are human, there is no way that Lion won't move you."
Los Angeles Times," November 24, 2016",Kenneth Turan," ""Lion"" is blessed with a Ripley's Believe It or Not story line that would warm the heart of a stone."
New York Times," November 24, 2016",A.O. Scott," If you have ever been a child, raised a child, lost a child or met a child - or a mother - this movie will wreck you."
Pajiba," November 24, 2016",Kristy Puchko," This seems exactly the kind of ""based on true events"" tale that filmmakers go gaga for...The plotting lurches, bound by reality, making for a muddled though moving affair."
TheWrap," November 23, 2016",Sam Adams," The movie could have examined the limitations of white liberalism, the damage that well-meaning people can do if they don't educate themselves along the way. Instead, it embodies that well-meaning approach, and all the harm it can do."
Vox," November 23, 2016",Alissa Wilkinson," Lion is moving, beautifully shot, and clear-eyed about its aims. It's the kind of inspirational movie even a film snob could love."
Wall Street Journal," November 23, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," Mr. Patel's commanding presence is complemented by many others... Kidman has done fine work in her career, but nothing that quite matches the hypnotic story Sue tells of a vision she had when she was 12."
L.A. Biz," November 23, 2016",Annlee Ellingson," Anchored by an impossibly adorable new talent and a familiar face showing new dramatic range, Lion explores the power of memory, technology and the pull of home."
EricDSnider.com," December 20, 2016",Eric D. Snider, An inspiring drama that earns tears without jerking them.
Cairo360," December 20, 2016",Marija Loncarevic," Lion, although a little jumbled in its second half, has everything you need from a poignant, awards-preying drama, with the story offering plenty of moments of both beauty and sadness."
Tampa Bay Times," December 20, 2016",Steve Persall, Lion can't avoid seeming lesser in the second half after Davis' mesmeric first but it's solid storytelling nonetheless.
Philadelphia Inquirer," December 20, 2016",Tirdad Derakhshani," Lion celebrates the human will and the human need to find meaning and connection in life. If the final scenes don't have you blubbering, your humanity may need some fine-tuning."
Film-Forward.com," December 17, 2016",Kent Turner," As the protagonist in the first and stronger half, pint-sized powerhouse Sunny Pawar wins the hearts and tears ducts of the audience. He's a tough act to follow."
Under the Radar," December 16, 2016",Zach Hollwedel," Immensely powerful, inspiring, and impossible to forget."
leonardmaltin.com," December 15, 2016",Leonard Maltin," What do you call a movie that has a great first act and a moving finale but bogs down on the way to that conclusion? In this case, you call it Lion. I say this with regret, because the true story it tells is remarkable and it's a shame the film is flawed"
FILMINK (Australia)," December 13, 2016",Erin Free, ...grabs you by the throat from its first frames and never lets you go.
National Post," December 9, 2016",Chris Knight," It could roar if it wanted to, but settles for an expressive, almost infrasonic growl."
Globe and Mail," December 9, 2016",Brad Wheeler," Davis offers sweeping cinematic shots, with a soundtrack that is pleasingly epic, but the second act is a bit skimpy, script-wise."
Toronto Sun," December 8, 2016",Bruce Kirkland," Unless you are an utterly immovable cynic, the Australian melodrama Lion will coax out tears of sadness and of pure joy."
Toronto Star," December 8, 2016",Peter Howell," Rarely does a film plotting the Internet amount to much more than a series of glowing screens. Lion, a fact-based story and auspicious feature debut by Garth Davis, makes for a captivating exception."
Consequence of Sound," December 8, 2016",Clint Worthington," If you think there's still room for the traditional 'true-story' drama, Lion proves these stories still have a little life left in them."
NOW Toronto," December 7, 2016",Glenn Sumi," The final reel, of course, is deeply affecting. But you knew that going in, didn't you?"
San Francisco Chronicle," December 7, 2016",David Wiegand," Because of Patel's electrifying and deeply nuanced performance, Lion ultimately delivers the emotional punch it has promised all along."
Deadline Hollywood Daily," December 6, 2016",Pete Hammond, Lion is an emotional corker of a true story that charts a remarkable journey that redefines the meaning of family and home.
Aisle Seat," December 2, 2016",Mike McGranaghan, Lion tells one of those amazing true stories that only a pure cynic could fail to be captivated by.
Paste Magazine," December 2, 2016",Andy Crump, Be warned: Lion will reduce you to a sniffling wreck.
NY1-TV," December 2, 2016",Neil Rosen," Director Garth Davis has taken this incredible, real life tale and made an emotionally involving film that pulls on your heartstrings every step of the way."
Common Sense Media," December 2, 2016",Sandie Angulo Chen," Great performances in emotional, intense biographical drama. "
Winnipeg Free Press," December 23, 2016",Randall King," Patel, best remembered from Slumdog Millionaire, shows a real, full-blooded star quality here, miles removed from the humble hero of that 2008 film."
Chicago Sun-Times," December 23, 2016",Richard Roeper," Lion is a beautifully told, uplifting story of courage and determination."
Sacramento News & Review," December 23, 2016",Daniel Barnes," Davis and screenwriter Luke Davies aggressively strum the heartstrings, but the film falters as it focuses more on product placement than people."
"Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)"," December 23, 2016",Bob Bloom," A sincere celebration of determination and the human spirit, this film will have you applauding and weeping simultaneously. "
Mark Reviews Movies," December 23, 2016",Mark Dujsik, The emotional impact of Lion is sneaky.
Washington Post," December 23, 2016",Stephanie Merry," ""Lion"" is a complex movie, with its profound themes of home and identity, and its tonally disparate halves. A smartly understated approach to Brierley's story holds it all together."
Detroit News," December 23, 2016",Adam Graham," Its themes are universal. Everyone has a home, and everyone feels connected to it, no matter how far they travel."
Chicago Reader," December 22, 2016",Andrea Gronvall, Garth Davis uses close-ups sparingly and hits no false notes; cinematographer Greig Fraser creates a child's perspective by setting the camera at the hero's eye level and conveys the grandeur of India through sweeping panoramic and overhead shots.
Austin Chronicle," December 22, 2016",Marc Savlov," An exciting, old-school explorer's tale well told (for the most part)."
Your Movies (cleveland.com)," December 22, 2016",John Urbancich," Truth-based lost-and-found stories such as ""Lion"" usually feature dogs or cats. Here, though, it's the rather slow, if moving tale of a poor, 5-year-old Indian boy who falls asleep in a train station and winds up more than 1,500 miles from home."
Seattle Times," December 22, 2016",Moira MacDonald," ""Lion"" has one of those plot lines that feels like a Hollywood screenplay - except it actually happened."
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," December 22, 2016",Cary Darling," While the film is neither novel nor revolutionary, it's the kind of cinematic warm blanket that feels very comforting and satisfying right now...That it's a true story...makes it all the more affecting. "
Fort Worth Weekly," December 22, 2016",Kristian M. Lin," It's incredible that it has taken this long to put an August Wilson play on the screen. This movie redresses that, and its performances are wholly worthy of such a quintessentially American playwright. We're privileged to have them."
Cleveland Plain Dealer," December 22, 2016",Michael Heaton, An emotionally satisfying and ultimately a warm and well-told international adventure of the heart.
Spirituality and Practice," December 22, 2016",Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, The true story that will elicit your empathy through the miracles in the life of a man who goes on a quest to locate his birth family.

Cinemixtape," January 4, 2017",J. Olson," Great performances abound, mixing with some magnificent photography to form one of the premier family dramas of 2016."
Film Experience," January 2, 2017",Nathaniel Rogers, The picture is maybe too frontloaded but the acting delivers in the final stretch.
"Quad City Times (Davenport, IA)"," January 2, 2017",Linda Cook," A beautiful, true-life story about adoption and how connected we all are, regardless of our beginnings or travels. "
SSG Syndicate," January 2, 2017",Susan Granger," It's the intimate, uplifting drama you've been yearning for..."
Seven Days," January 1, 2017",Rick Kisonak, Only the most shrivel-hearted grinch could watch this Christmas release and not be moved. 
Tulsa World," December 30, 2016",Michael Smith, This is awards-season bait aimed straight at your sentimental side that loves a good tearjerker and one which earns most of the tears that it jerks.

Cinemaclips.com," December 27, 2016",Roger Tennis," If you're searching for fulfilling feel-good entertainment, the royal 'Lion' exceeds expectations."
The Patriot Ledger," December 27, 2016",Dana Barbuto," The final scenes, when the action returns to India, can't help but pack an emotional punch because it recalls that vastly superior first act when we fell in love with Saroo. "
ReelViews," December 27, 2016",James Berardinelli," Lion represents a commitment from those involved and, flaws aside, it's an amazing tale of resilience and determination."
One Guy's Opinion," December 26, 2016",Frank Swietek," Designed to be a crowd-pleaser, but after a turbulent, heart-wrenching first act, the second-meant to be touchingly uplifting-instead comes across as rather shallow and pedestrian by comparison."
Ex-Press.com," December 25, 2016",Katherine Monk," ...This story of a small boy lost in a sprawling land finds truly epic proportions, not because it's trying to go big, but exactly the opposite: it's determined to find meaning in the beings, things and feelings we often deem too small to matter."
Creative Loafing," December 24, 2016",Matt Brunson, A heartwarming true-life tale.

Combustible Celluloid," January 19, 2017",Jeffrey M. Anderson, Middlebrow mediocrity served up by the Weinsteins on a silver platter for awards season.

ABC Radio (Australia)," January 18, 2017",CJ Johnson," Director Garth Davis and screenwriter Luke Davies have delivered the tasteful version, one that avoids practically all the story's potential [bombastic, sensational, sentimental] landmines in lieu of honest emotion. It is a film of great integrity."
Herald Sun (Australia)," January 18, 2017",Leigh Paatsch," If the second section of Lion is no match for the first, none of its obvious flaws (most notably, disjointed scripting and more than a few plot holes) detract from the intense emotional connection forged with the viewer throughout."
Baret News," January 18, 2017",Kam Williams," A bittersweet variation on the 'I was lost, but now I'm found' theme of the parable of the Prodigal Son."
Independent (UK)," January 18, 2017",Geoffrey Macnab, The film is moving enough in its own terms but lacks the depth and complexity that might have been expected.
Empire Magazine," January 18, 2017",Dan Jolin," An astonishing true story that's treated with an admirably light and artistic touch, rather than an overly dramatic heavy hand."
News.com.au," January 16, 2017",Wenlei Ma, The source material is so rich that it's easy to forgive Lion's small flaws when the film treats its characters with such empathy.
Student Edge," January 16, 2017",Simon Miraudo," It's a miraculous tale, though one that relies heavily on a device filmmakers have struggled to make cinematic: staring at a computer for long stretches."
Total Film," January 16, 2017",Jamie Graham, Davis' debut is a touch over-stretched but impossible to resist - a classy crowd-pleaser with an especially magical first half.
CineVue," January 16, 2017",Matthew Anderson," By turns tragic, deeply moving and heartfelt."
The Skinny," January 16, 2017",Michelle Devereaux," An old-fashioned, crowd-pleasing film that succeeds on its own admittedly less-than-ambitious terms."
Urban Cinefile," January 15, 2017",Louise Keller, Loss and belonging are the themes of this incredible true story; it is the simplicity of the storytelling that brings it to life. Most crucial is the establishment of the Indian reality
MediaMikes," January 14, 2017",Michael A. Smith," Powerful. That is how I'd best describe ""Lion."""
The Australian," January 13, 2017",David Stratton," Crucial to these early scenes is the casting of Sunny Pawar, a marvellously instinctive child actor who gives an indelible performance as Saroo."

IGN Movies," January 10, 2017",Josh Lasser," Lion offers a tale that is incredibly unique and yet, at the same time, utterly universal."
