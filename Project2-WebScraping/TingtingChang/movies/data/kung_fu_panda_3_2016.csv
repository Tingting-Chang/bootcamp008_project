"The Coast (Halifax, Nova Scotia)"," July 11, 2016",Tara Thorne, It's hard to be cynical about Kung Fu Panda 3-it's part of a series that is so good-hearted and fun and it clocks in at a loose 90.
Antagony & Ecstasy," July 10, 2016",Tim Brayton," A moving character study and an exciting action-adventure-comedy, and it is also desperately gorgeous."
The Straits Times (Singapore)," May 24, 2016",Yip Wai Yee," From the colourful, psychedelic realm of the spirits to the playground-like panda kingdom, the art here is stylish and arresting."
Epoch Times," May 12, 2016",Mark Jackson," A cynical cherry-picked mish-mash of China's spiritual treasures for Hollywood's bottom line, rather than the sincere children's bedtime story it should be? It's still good."
Cinema Sight," April 6, 2016",Wesley Lovell," One of the most pleasing franchises in animation, Po and his stalwart companions mix Western and Eastern tropes together to create a pleasing amalgam with some of the industry's best animation, both traditional and modern."
South China Morning Post," April 6, 2016",Richard James Havis, A plot as patchy as a panda doesn't mar the enjoyment of this third look at the animated high-kicking bear and his fighting animal friends. The animation ... is super-smooth.

The Age (Australia)," March 24, 2016",Philippa Hawker," There is plenty in Kung Fu Panda 3 that echoes the first film and the sequel, but it's not tired recycling. Instead, the movie deftly reinforces and extends what has gone before."

Flicks.co.nz," March 23, 2016",Liam Maguren," We're treated to less of the same, and while that is disappointing, it doesn't deny this trilogy from being one of the best franchises to come out of DreamWorks Animation Studios."

Screen International," January 17, 2016",Tim Grierson," Fitfully amusing and certainly heartfelt, this latest chapter in the likable animated saga will work best with younger viewers, but its life lessons and emotional beats feel slathered on rather than deftly woven into the storyline."
TheWrap," January 16, 2016",Alonso Duralde," Between the witty screenplay, delightful visuals that jump back and forth between 3-D and 2-D animation, and a consistently game voice cast, this third serving never feels like a dull retread or a lazy cash grab."
New York Daily News," January 28, 2016",Katherine Pushkar," Unfortunately, looks aren't everything. The plot is plodding and predictable."
Philadelphia Inquirer," January 28, 2016",Tirdad Derakhshani," It's easy to mistake the simplicity of plot and theme here for simple-mindedness - this isn't Pynchon or Proust. Kung Fu Panda 3 has the economy of a Zen koan, not to mention its inner harmony and wisdom."
Washington Post," January 28, 2016",Sandie Angulo Chen," The directors ... make sure to let Po stay the charming bumbler he's always been. That's what makes him such an earnest, lovable hero."
Orlando Weekly," January 28, 2016",Dan Hudak," The screening I attended was full of youngsters, and the only sound I heard from them was consistent laughter, not chatter. Sounded like an endorsement to me."
Bullz-Eye.com," January 28, 2016",David Medsker," As cute and fun as the Kung Fu Panda movies have been, this seems like a good time to walk away."
San Francisco Chronicle," January 28, 2016",Peter Hartlaub," ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" has a moment or two for everyone, but no chance develop any character beyond a single dimension. The next scene has often arrived before the viewer can process the last one."

Blu-ray.com," January 28, 2016",Brian Orndorf," While the story isn't completely engrossing, character charms and creative visual design remain as beguiling as ever. "
Toronto Star," January 28, 2016",Linda Barnard," Black and white and fun all over, Kung Fu Panda 3 achieves best-of-franchise status with a story that goes deeper than typical kid fare, wrapped in beautifully crafted animation."
New York Times," January 28, 2016",Neil Genzlinger," Lots of comedic fight scenes break up the story's more somber stretches, and the animation, especially in 3-D, is simply gorgeous."
Las Vegas Weekly," January 28, 2016",Josh Bell," At this point, there's really nothing new to discover in a Kung Fu Panda movie, but it's still nice to see old friends every so often."
NOW Toronto," January 27, 2016",Radheyan Simonpillai," If Kung Fu Panda 3 feels like a step down, it's only because it's got a sterling pedigree to live up to."
We Got This Covered," January 27, 2016",Zachary Shevich," Though entertaining at times, Kung Fu Panda 3 isn't entirely different from watching that video of Tian Tian, the Smithsonian's National Zoo panda, rolling in the snow on an hourlong loop"
Arizona Republic," January 27, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," The ""Kung Fu Panda"" formula works, still, and if directors Alessandro Carloni and Jennifer Yuh don't reinvent the panda-as-martial-artist wheel, they avoid making the story seem stale."
Tampa Bay Times," January 27, 2016",Steve Persall," A singular look, an exemplary vocal cast, and a narrative arc like a caress. That'll be the Kung Fu Panda franchise's legacy, the idea that shouldn't have worked but did, beautifully and with its own chi."
Film Journal International," January 27, 2016",Daniel Eagan," Tightly written and marvelously imaginative, [Kung Fu Panda 3] is also one of the loveliest animated features to be released recently."
Entertainment Weekly," January 27, 2016",Christian Holub, Just complicated enough to reward steady viewers and just simple enough for parent escorts to enjoy without much prior knowledge.

Los Angeles Times," January 28, 2016",Gary Goldstein," Writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger ... unfurl the narrative with buoyant clarity, gentle charm and much endearing (read: sweetly hokey) humor. The tale's ""be yourself"" mantra, though nothing new, is also well used."
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," January 28, 2016",Maricar Estrella," The main reason families enjoy the series is Po, thanks to Jack Black's frenetic and friendly approach.

Austin Chronicle," January 28, 2016",Kimberley Jones," This is a visually stunning picture, a rhapsody of saturated color and contrasting texture, from the painstaking detail of coarse panda fur to the painterly dreamscape that is the spirit world. "
Tulsa World," January 28, 2016",Michael Smith," Kung Fu Panda 3 delivers a great message to young people, some of the most gorgeous animation out there, and action-comedy that will amuse those of all ages."

Reeling Reviews," January 28, 2016",Robin Clifford," ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" continues the Po saga, setting up for the next installment, of course, but in a way that makes you want more."
Boston Globe," January 28, 2016",Tom Russo," The whole fightin'-bear jamboree is agreeable enough, but it takes some of the spotlight away from Black being Black, and doesn't jibe with messages about having a sense of self, of what makes you you."
Wall Street Journal," January 28, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," In Hollywood's franchise game, sequels are seldom the best they can be. This one isn't, but it's pretty, perfectly pleasant and good enough."

One Guy's Opinion," January 28, 2016",Frank Swietek, A visually stunning but story-wise pretty threadbare entry in the popular series.
Kansas City Star," January 28, 2016",Jon Niccum," This is a nice, kid-friendly movie. But it also makes some disingenuous choices at key moments that deflate its value."
Film Racket," January 28, 2016",Bill Gibron, DreamWorks' delightful Kung Fu Panda series has only gotten better with age
The Young Folks," January 28, 2016",Jon Espino," Few animated franchises have the honor of reaching this milestone without a sharp decline in quality... Kung Fu Panda 3 remains relevant because it evolves with its audience, introducing deeper themes and messages."
IGN Movies," January 28, 2016",Max Nicholson," Features the same heart, humor and action of the first two films. "

Cinemalogue.com," January 29, 2016",Todd Jorgenson, This latest effort seems designed simply to meet fan expectations rather than try something new.

ScreenRant," January 29, 2016",Ben Kendrick, Kung Fu Panda 3 is a well-meaning piece of escapism for kids - one that shows signs of wear in the larger computer-animated kung fu franchise. 
Killer Movie Reviews," January 29, 2016",Andrea Chase," slick, witty, and not afraid to embrace the essential silliness of a story that finds a Kung Fu rooster taking on a water buffalo, and a bug getting the best of a simian"
Boston Herald," January 29, 2016",James Verniere," Fun, but It's the same movie over again. I've had enough dumplings, thanks. Ski-doosh."
EricDSnider.com," January 29, 2016",Eric D. Snider," We've reached the point, somewhat prematurely, that comes in almost every movie franchise, where the sequels start to feel like episodes."
Suburban Journals of St. Louis," January 29, 2016",Mathew DeKinder, Any spark or originality this series had has been wrung out by this point and is really of no value to anyone other than a desperate parent looking for 90 minutes of non-sensibility-offending distraction for their kids.
New York Post," January 29, 2016",Lou Lumenick," The stunning visuals surpass the high standards set by its predecessors, but storywise, it breaks no new ground."
Screen It!," January 29, 2016",Teddy Durgin," Perfectly solid, diverting family entertainment with well-drawn characters, involving action, and some nice messages. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Scary Scenes, etc. - Also Available)"
Reeling Reviews," January 29, 2016",Laura Clifford," ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" continues the fun while completing a circle, but it fails to reach the trilogy's artistic pinnacle, ""Kung Fu Panda 2."""
Newark Star-Ledger," January 29, 2016",Stephen Whitty," [It's] mostly like those dishes at my old Chinese buffet - stretched thin, badly reheated and really, best taken in very small quantities."
HollywoodInToto.com," January 29, 2016",Christian Toto, Audiences may enter Kung Fu Panda 3 with their arms folded tightly against their chest. Here's betting they'll leave pining for more Po.
Globe and Mail," January 29, 2016",Kate Taylor," The animation is still strong - there are some interesting and refreshingly uncuddly depictions of the spirit world from whence Kai springs - but, mainly, KFP3 is too much of a good thing."
Seattle Times," January 29, 2016",Soren Anderson," It's gloriously colorful, very funny and, better yet, unexpectedly substantive and genuinely moving."
Georgia Straight," February 18, 2016",Janet Smith," Endearing, action-jacked, and self-effacingly funny, Kung Fu Panda 3 simply reaffirms it has a Wuxi Finger Hold on the chop-socky, Taoist, slapstick kids-animation market."
Uproxx," February 17, 2016",Jen Chaney, Kung Fu Panda 3 follows that same template almost to the letter and punctuation mark. But it's so engaging and entertaining that its reliance on that well-worn hero's journey narrative doesn't feel stale.

ChristyLemire.com," February 12, 2016",Christy Lemire," So vividly immersive is Kung Fu Panda 3 - so vibrant, so tactile - it will make you feel as if you've stepped into a fully realized world. And then once you've stepped out, you'll be craving dumplings."
Laramie Movie Scope," February 11, 2016",Robert Roten," If this sounds like a lot of eastern philosophy and religion, it is, but it is also a good story, with strong characters. There is also some kung fu action, of course, but the main story is about the spiritual journey of Po."
Cinema-stache," February 9, 2016",Rob Vaux, Makes January at the movies a little brighter.
Time Out," February 9, 2016",Anna King," The new sequel lacks the tear-jerking revelations and darker edge that characterized its predecessor. Visually though, it's a candy-colored 3-D treat, from the exquisite sunset that shimmers over the panda enclave to the psychedelia of the spirit world."
Movie Guys with Jeff & Dave," February 6, 2016",Jeffrey K. Howard," Fun for the whole family! Funny, creative and by the film's end, you take away lessons for being a better person. A good time. "
National Post," February 4, 2016",David Berry," As Perfect as Black is for Po, Kung Fu Panda 3 is a pretty good indication that everything runs its course. Time to let the bear live on as another actor's impression on Saturday morning TV."
Fort Worth Weekly," February 3, 2016",Kristian M. Lin," As the year of the goat gives way to the year of the monkey, Kung Fu Panda 3 is a nice way to celebrate the calendar turning."
"Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)"," February 2, 2016",Ken Hanke, Absolutely the only thing wrong with Kung Fu Panda 3 is that it's the third film in a series that is starting to show the inevitable signs of strain. 
Tribune News Service," February 1, 2016",Katie Walsh," With a star-studded voice cast (Black in the lead, with Rogen and Cross on backup) there's no shortage of humor. But the animation is the real standout in the film."
Sacramento News & Review," February 1, 2016",Jim Lane," Like the first two, it's stylishly pretty to look at, and the over-the-top fight scenes and visual humor (courtesy of directors Alessandro Carloni and Jennifer Yuh) are amusing."
Chicago Sun-Times," February 1, 2016",Bill Zwecker," I think the secret to the appeal of the entire Kung Fu Panda franchise is the enormous affection we feel for Po, that seemingly bumbling good guy who also can rise to the occasion and showcase true heroism and mystical power."
Movie Nation," February 1, 2016",Roger Moore," Winded, out of ideas and laughs. "
Cinemaclips.com," January 31, 2016",Roger Tennis," With a moderate level of fun, the cuddly 'Kung Fu Panda 3' rises above unbearable. "

Empire Magazine," March 10, 2016",Olly Richards," Rather than the cynical 'one last grab' of the series, Kung Fu Panda 3 might actually be the best."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," March 10, 2016",Tim Robey," The first two films laid down a distinctive visual template which this pushes ever further into trippy, sliced-and-diced abstraction, nodding frenetically to the techniques of the wuxia martial arts genre."

HeyUGuys," March 7, 2016",Stefan Pape," In the case of Kung Fu Panda - it's never been in any doubt that there is the scope in this narrative to fulfil a third entry into the franchise, and warrant a return into this particular world. "
The List," March 7, 2016",Angie Errigo," While the adventure is not as entirely 'Awesome!' as its predecessor, or as its hero proclaims it to be, it is - as he is also fond of exclaiming - 'Sweet!'"
