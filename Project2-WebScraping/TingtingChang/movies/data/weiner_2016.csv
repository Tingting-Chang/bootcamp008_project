Total Film," January 2, 2017",Neil Smith," Watching his campaign derailed by yet more salacious revelations is like a slo-mo car crash, a queasy pleasure we're spared little of thanks to Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg's ever-present camera and Weiner's insatiable thirst for the spotlight."
Seven Days," January 1, 2017",Rick Kisonak," Run, as they say, don't walk to the nearest theater showing Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg's spectacular new documentary."
3AW," December 26, 2016",Jim Schembri," The bizarre, engrossing story of New York Democratic politician Anthony Weiner is captured in all its pathetic glory in a documentary that will do nothing to redress the reputation of politicians as liars, hypocrites and opportunists. "

Sunday Times (UK)," December 18, 2016",Edward Porter," What we do see of Weiner is compelling: he's arrogant and hot-tempered, but quite possibly well-meaning. And the movie is worth seeing just for its behind-the-scenes picture of a brassy American political campaign going seriously [wrong]."
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," October 26, 2016",Dennis Schwartz, A scintillating documentary on the failed NYC mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner.
CNN.com," October 25, 2016",Brian Lowry," What Weiner makes painfully clear is the collateral damage of Weiner's actions... To that extent, it's possible to share his politics and still see him as a fatally flawed vessel for them."

MediaMikes," September 12, 2016",Michael A. Smith," A true ""fly on the wall"" documentary, ""Weiner"" gives the viewer almost unfettered access to the man and his campaign."
MovieMail," August 31, 2016",Mike McCahill," Yet simply to obsess over Weiner's personal failings is to miss a bigger tragedy...how politics and the media have come to collide and collude, and the deleterious-disastrous impact that has had on the world the rest of us have to inhabit."
"Capital Times (Madison, WI)"," August 25, 2016",Rob Thomas," I'm sure Weiner is mortified that his behavior is causing his wife ongoing humiliation to this day. But, after watching ""Weiner,"" I'm not sure he's not secretly happy to see his name in the headlines again."
Reel Film Reviews," August 18, 2016",David Nusair, ...the unjustified downfall of the movie's subject ultimately elevates Weiner above the level of a run-of-the-mill political portrait.
Georgia Straight," August 12, 2016",Ken Eisner," This territory might look parochial to an international audience, but Weiner (winner of the top doc award at this year's Sundance) is a tragicomic entertainment illuminating a number of current trends."

Guardian," January 24, 2016",Lanre Bakare," A compelling, deep dive into a scandal that so many, especially the New York Post and Stephen Colbert, had painted as the simple - and crude - case of one prurient politician."
Newark Star-Ledger," May 19, 2016",Stephen Whitty," According to ""Weiner,"" some politicians are pathological creatures, wrapped in their egos, secure in their narcissism and addicted to constant attention. Yeah, well, tell us something we don't know. Somehow, though, this new documentary manages to."
AV Club," May 19, 2016",Noel Murray," This film doesn't lionize Weiner or justify anything he did. What it does is capture the frenzy of politics, the iron-clad egos of politicians, and the failure of the media to cover the parts of campaigning and government that actually matter."

Entertainment Weekly," May 18, 2016",Chris Nashawaty," As a chronicle of the political process (the heckling, the glad-handing, the soul-sucking fund-raising calls) and of the chum-hungry press corps that feeds on it, Weiner is fascinating."
Village Voice," May 17, 2016",Bilge Ebiri," Weiner is about as entertaining as a film about someone destroying a life and career can be. You can't turn away from the car wreck, and Weiner himself can't stop commenting on it."

New York Magazine/Vulture," May 15, 2016",David Edelstein, Weiner is a tabula rasa doc - one of the most provocative of its kind I've seen. Everyone's bound to have a different perspective.
ReelTalk Movie Reviews," May 14, 2016",Donald J. Levit," Non-judgmental although inviting viewer verdict, 'Weiner' traces with humor a scandal that showcases foolishness, bad taste, idealism, cynicism, ethno-religious animosity, and the media obscenity of popular culture. "

Flavorwire," May 13, 2016",Jason Bailey," What Kriegman and Steinberg put across most vividly is a mixture of sympathy and exasperation for the candidate, and there are moments where Weiner at least flirts with the truth behind opening oneself up for a second round of public flogging. "
ZEALnyc," May 6, 2016",Thelma Adams," ""Weiner"" emerges as the political film for this election cycle, the tragicomedy we deserve. "

Film Comment Magazine," May 3, 2016",Eric Hynes," The problem is that Weiner tells a fully expected story, leveraging laughs out of the politician's pre-mocked predicament, and shaping near-silent appearances by Abedin into a sympathy-courting foil. "
Screen International," April 25, 2016",Tim Grierson, Slickly packaged but also consistently entertaining.
Hollywood Reporter," April 25, 2016",John DeFore," Plenty of political docs let us see a campaign confronting bad news, but this is a doozy, and the level of access here makes the film hard to turn away from."
Collider," April 25, 2016",Matt Goldberg, Weiner feels like a wasted opportunity from filmmakers who were too enamored of their subject and their timing to realize a larger context.
CineVue," April 25, 2016",Ben Nicholson," There was a horrible inevitability to the fact that Anthony Weiner's career in the US Congress would end in sexual scandal, but watching him try to rejuvenate his flagging fortunes amidst a modern media circus is fascinating."
indieWire," April 25, 2016",Eric Kohn," The result is a dramatically compelling saga rife with urgency, but it often pitches into the realm of a black comedy."
Newcity," May 25, 2016",Ray Pride," One of the most appalling, fascinating, even compelling portraits of a modern politician. "

Consequence of Sound," May 21, 2016",Randall Colburn," When you factor in politics or the media, manipulating whatever it is that makes you vulnerable is the only way to survive. Deception, as Weiner shows us, is just part of the game. "

Reeling Reviews," May 20, 2016",Laura Clifford, The unprecedented access given filmmakers Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg is both the film's biggest asset and its most worrisome aspect...it gives the audience a creepy sense of eavesdropping on marital intimacies not meant for public consumption.
TheWrap," May 20, 2016",Tricia Olszewski, Kriegman and Steinberg's incredible access allows you to ride the whole roller coaster.
NPR," May 20, 2016",Mark Jenkins," The documentary's strength is that it doesn't insist on a diagnosis. ""Why have you let me film this?"" asks Kriegman at the end, and his former boss has no answer."
Christian Science Monitor," May 20, 2016",Peter Rainer, It would make a great double bill with Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer.

Los Angeles Times," May 19, 2016",Gary Goldstein," The filmmakers' cameras capture Weiner, perhaps best known for his career-crippling sexting scandals of 2011 and 2013, in a plethora of awkward, squirm-inducing, shameless, even clueless moments."
Newsday," May 19, 2016",Rafer Guzman," Absolutely fascinating, with nearly unlimited and almost unbearably close access. This is the political documentary you never thought you'd actually see."

Wall Street Journal," May 19, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," Weiner, an extraordinary documentary feature about the disgraced New York politician Anthony Weiner, has it all -- the surreal spectacle of contemporary retail politics, the sizzle of media madness and the mysteries of psychodrama. "
Paste Magazine," May 19, 2016",Jeremy Mathews," If the filmmakers had an agenda besides studying Weiner's character, they did a great job of hiding it. Weiner shows many facets of his personality: He can be charming and funny, but he can also be a petulant, entitled jerk."
The Film Stage," May 19, 2016",Jordan Raup," Even divorced from scandal, Weiner makes for a captivating, sadly comical look at the machinations of the political process."
Beliefnet," May 27, 2016",Nell Minow," The superbly edited film, with extraordinary intimate access based on deep trust, has a lot of insights about celebrity culture, media, and what we expect from politicians. "
Philadelphia Inquirer," May 27, 2016",Tirdad Derakhshani," While the documentary is not essential viewing, you're likely to be drawn in if you do decide to watch it, finding yourself engrossed, repulsed, and perplexed in equal measure."
People Magazine," May 26, 2016",Alynda Wheat," It's important to take a break here to understand something: There is nothing preventing Weiner from yelling ""Cut!"" on the whole production... He does not do that."
Aisle Seat," May 26, 2016",Mike McGranaghan," One of the most riveting and remarkable documentaries I have ever seen. If you have even the most remote interest in politics or human behavior, Weiner is a movie you cannot afford to miss under any circumstances."

SSG Syndicate," May 26, 2016",Susan Granger," Shame-filled documentary, relating an excruciating political suicide."
Boston Globe," May 26, 2016",Ty Burr," The movie's a galvanizing, tragicomic work of 21st-century schadenfreude, marred only by a barely repressed giddiness on the part of the filmmakers. But why shouldn't they be dazzled by their good fortune?"

San Francisco Chronicle," May 26, 2016",Mick LaSalle," The movie goes from being interesting to riveting, from ""Yes, this is quite good"" to you-cannot-leave-your-seat-and-don't-even-want-to-blink."
PopMatters," May 25, 2016",Cynthia Fuchs, You can't look away.

New Yorker," May 30, 2016",Richard Brody," His vanity and his political flair, his authentic talent and his weakness of character come off as inseparable."
The Atlantic," May 29, 2016",Christopher Orr," It's hard to shake the sense that Weiner's decision to cooperate so fully with the filmmakers emanates from the same place as his online sexual escapades: a horror of having no one there to listen to him, to help fill, moment by moment, some gnawing void."
The Patriot Ledger," May 28, 2016",Al Alexander," The directors provide the rope, and Weiner willingly ties the knot and slips the noose around his neck. "

Mark Reviews Movies," May 27, 2016",Mark Dujsik, [Weiner is] either hyper-aware that his statements are going to be scrutinized or just flat-out lying ... It's difficult to tell if even he knows anymore.

Kaplan vs. Kaplan," May 27, 2016",David Kaplan, The documentary doesn't delve deeply enough into Anthony Weiner's psychological makeup. But the film is entertaining on some level that satisfies our tacit fascination with celebrities who implode.

Tampa Bay Times," June 15, 2016",Steve Persall," ""Why have you let me film this?"" a voice behind the camera asks disgraced politician Anthony Weiner, who for a change can't spin an answer. It's a question the jaw-dropping documentary Weiner raises repeatedly."

Cleveland Plain Dealer," June 3, 2016",Joanna Connors," If Weiner sounds like an amusing, even funny take-down of a narcissistic politician (and aren't they all), think again. It's illuminating, but not all that much fun, to watch a troubled man disintegrate in public."
