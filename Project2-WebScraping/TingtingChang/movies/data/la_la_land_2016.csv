Boston Globe," December 15, 2016",Ty Burr," It's a film for those who feel a little out of step with the 21st century, as Mia does with her love of classic cinema and Sebastian does with his angry jazz certainty. A lot of us can relate. If you can't, we don't really want to hear about it."
The Vine," December 14, 2016",Tara Watson," It may not be a masterpiece, but it's a refreshing and unabashed joy-filled escape, and after such a woeful year, there is nothing wrong with that."

Baltimore Magazine," December 13, 2016",Max Weiss," La La Land is hopeful, even giddy. And Chazelle directs with heaps of style and charm."
ABC Tucson," December 13, 2016",Phil Villarreal, Relentlessly stunning and possibly life-altering.

ABC Radio (Australia)," December 15, 2016",CJ Johnson," I could feel the large group of critics at the screening I attended sitting on their hands, resisting the uncouth impulse to applaud."
Lyles' Movie Files," December 15, 2016",Jeffrey Lyles," Even with all the awards and Oscars hype, it still won't do enough justice to one of the decade's most magical masterpieces."

One Guy's Opinion," December 15, 2016",Frank Swietek," The swooning, cotton-candy, luxuriantly pastel vibe...has a rather effortful feel, but for those old enough to remember the halcyon days of film musicals, it will be a treat."

San Diego Reader," December 15, 2016",Scott Marks, This is one crowd-pleaser worth getting behind.
Chicago Sun-Times," December 15, 2016",Richard Roeper, It's simply wonderful.
Salt Lake Tribune," December 15, 2016",Sean P. Means," La La Land is more than just a chance to bask in the warm nostalgia of Hollywood musicals. Chazelle captures a feeling reminiscent of the jazz Sebastian so admires: He takes what's familiar, tinkers with it, and creates something new and alive."
Sacramento News & Review," December 15, 2016",Jim Lane," The transition isn't always smooth; the movie sags in the center as the songs grow sparse. But there are virtues, too -- chiefly the proven screen chemistry between Stone and Gosling. (Their song-and-dance chops aren't half-bad, either.)"
Blu-ray.com," December 15, 2016",Brian Orndorf," Chazelle's vision to too candied to dismiss, but this extravagance demands more judicious editing, keeping the picture tight and tender. Its current slackness only emphasizes troubling casting faults and dramatic limitations."

SF Weekly," December 15, 2016",Jeffrey Edalatpour, La La Land suffers from what it endeavors to celebrate: Hollywood's flair for artifice and self-congratulation.
Kansas City Star," December 15, 2016",Robert W. Butler," Despite his tender years, Chazelle is a master of composition, color and camera movement, and there are shots here so drop-dead gorgeous you wonder how he and cinematographer Linus Sandgren pulled them off."
Washington Post," December 15, 2016",Ann Hornaday," Working together for the third time, Stone and Gosling quickly establish an easy rapport with one another, their surpassingly attractive physical features the perfect foils for Chazelle's aesthetic approach of naturalism and extreme stylization."

"Capital Times (Madison, WI)"," December 16, 2016",Rob Thomas," The musical romance from writer-director Damien Chazelle is packed with ""movie magic,"" big, un-self-conscious moments where the characters burst off the screen in song and dance. This is a movie in love with movies."
Under the Radar," December 16, 2016",Shawn Hazelett, [Emma Stone] is so captivating as an actor that we are somehow attentive and interested through lousy songwriting and cliches.
Black Girl Nerds," December 16, 2016",Valerie Complex," The film's highs are its light special effects and whimsical choreography. The ensemble cast is phenomenal, but Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling? Not so much. "

Toronto Star," December 22, 2016",Peter Howell," People say the movie musical is dead. Tell that that to your tapping toes while watching the enchantment of La La Land, one of the year's best films."
FilmDrunk," December 22, 2016",Vincent Mancini, The beauty of La La Land is that is uses an escapist format to tell a story about professional disappointment and the limitations of love. It's a romance for cynics. 
Globe and Mail," December 22, 2016",Barry Hertz, Almost anyone who happens to see it will be converted by minute three. Guaranteed.
The Nation," December 21, 2016",Stuart Klawans, My heart goes out to Chazelle because of his desires; it sinks at how he's compromised them.

Cambridge Day," December 21, 2016",Tom Meek," It's deeply derivative yet wholly original, an odd mix that will keep audiences on their toes."
National Post," December 21, 2016",Calum Marsh, Audiences find themselves carried away. That may be sensible enough. What's odd is that La La Land is not the merry entertainment it sometimes seems to be.
ArtsHub," December 20, 2016",Sarah Ward," Simultaneously escaping into fantasy and reflecting reality, La La Land proves a big-hearted delight... dream-like in style but ultimately melancholy in sentiment."

AV Club," December 30, 2016",Ignatiy Vishnevetsky," It asks what the characters of a Cinemascope musical would have to dream about, and answers with a finale that lifts the film to a higher plane of wish fulfillment and melancholy."
MovieCrypt.com," December 30, 2016",Kevin A. Ranson," ...fans of 2011's big award winner 'The Artist' are in for a treat... greater than the sum of its parts. PG-13 for language and criminal use of the a-ha song ""Take On Me."""

CinemaDope," December 29, 2016",Glenn Lovell," One from the heart ... Chazelle doesn't for a moment wink at the viewer. He's guileless; he really believes in this trompe l'oeil world of violet sunsets, movie star murals, twinkly planetarium stars."
Sydney Morning Herald," December 28, 2016",Paul Byrnes, I don't know if the music will still be sung in 20 or 30 years. I do know that dance schools all around the world are going to see a rush of enrolments.
East Bay Express," December 27, 2016",Kelly Vance," For those who know The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, it's a harmless curiosity, a workable but rather heavily implied time-travel voyage to 50 years ago; for those who don't, it will probably be incomprehensible."

Q Network Film Desk," December 27, 2016",James Kendrick," La Land Land gives us the beauty of the world and its harder realities and intertwines them, leaving us with notes of grace and hope and love that transcend cynicism-bulldozes it, really. And that is lovely."
3AW," December 25, 2016",Jim Schembri," As loving a valentine as the film is to old-school Hollywood, the rapturous reception it has received might be a collective reaction against Hollywood's current trends, as enjoyable, breezy and ceaselessly entertaining as it is."
ABC Radio Brisbane," December 25, 2016",Matthew Toomey," Easy on the eyes and tough on the heart, La La Land is a film I could watch again and again."

Daily Telegraph (Australia)," December 23, 2016",Vicky Roach," While there is much to recommend Damien Chazelle's ode to Hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s, there were times when I found myself curiously out of step with the rambling, retro production and the self-involved nature of the world in which it is set."
Fresno Bee," December 23, 2016",Rick Bentley," The last quarter of La La Land is so beautifully shot and performed, it makes up for the flat opening. It becomes a film that embraces a world where dreamers may seem foolish but eventually are very interesting."

National Review," January 9, 2017",Armond White, Chazelle's depiction of career conflict and erotic attraction in Mia and Sebastian's romance ... prevents La La Land from being a satisfying movie musical. He imitates the generic form but never imbues it with feeling.

Daily Express (UK)," January 16, 2017",Henry Fitzherbert, Chazelle has taken a big gamble with this homage. It could have turned out horribly twee and sentimental. Instead the picture celebrates a movie-making form from yesteryear with dazzling visual technique and a huge dollop of charm.

Hot Press," January 25, 2017",Roe McDermott," Chazelle's vision of LA is unnervingly whitewashed, and the film could do with another original song, but his inventive cinematography and joyous spirit will leave you inspired -- and dying to see what he does next."
