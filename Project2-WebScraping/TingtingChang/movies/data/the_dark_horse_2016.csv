Adelaide Review," August 10, 2016",David 'Mad Dog' Bradley," A hugely chunked-up Curtis, a Kiwi actor who's worked all over the world but returned home to star in and help produce Robertson's film, is masterly here."
The Mary Sue," July 15, 2016",Lesley Coffin," This year, Disney bypassed the feel-good sports movie, and luckily for U.S. audiences, we got a smaller but better version with The Dark Horse."
New Zealand Herald," June 1, 2016",Russell Baillie," A great, deeply affecting movie."
The Young Folks," May 22, 2016",Gary Shannon," ... The Dark Horse understands that it requires more than simple narrative tricks and interesting factoids to make its ""true story"" stand out as a great film."
East Bay Express," April 29, 2016",Kelly Vance," A serious, even solemn, tale of personal redemption."
Film Comment Magazine," April 29, 2016",Michael Sragow, The Dark Horse is a rough beauty of a picture.
Georgia Straight," April 27, 2016",Ken Eisner," The Dark Horse takes us intriguingly deep into subcultures we might not otherwise know. Unfortunately, it uses storytelling devices so overly familiar and so flatly executed, they blunt what we see."
Reeling Reviews," April 25, 2016",Robin Clifford," ""The Dark Horse"" is a showcase for Cliff Curtis and shows the actor can give a convincing, sincere and sympathetic lead performance."
Consequence of Sound," April 15, 2016",Dominick Mayer, It's to The Dark Horse's great benefit that this is the rare inspirational true-life story that doesn't shoehorn a fountain of relentless optimism for the future into the proceedings.
Boston Herald," April 15, 2016",James Verniere," If there were any justice in the Academy Awards, Curtis would be a front runner for Best Actor for this ""Raging Bull""-level performance."
Beliefnet," April 15, 2016",Nell Minow, It might get corny but for Robertson's unaffectedly gritty settings and understanding that modest gains can be enough for checkmate.
Globe and Mail," April 15, 2016",Brad Wheeler," Curtis is 100-per-cent watchable as a puffy, mumbling shuffler whose chess lessons double as life strategies."
National Post," April 14, 2016",Chris Knight, Curtis sells us on both the man's frailty and his drive; his performance alone is enough of a reason to check this one out.
Boston Globe," April 14, 2016",Peter Keough," ""Dark Horse"" falls into the formula of underprivileged kids challenging the elites at their own game. But the outcome is never certain."
Chicago Daily Herald," April 14, 2016",Dann Gire," We've seen a thousand mentor-making-a-difference movies before, but not like this one."
NOW Toronto," April 14, 2016",Radheyan Simonpillai," Potoni can't trust his own instincts, let alone convince others to trust him with vulnerable kids. Curtis makes you see that internal tension, raising the stakes on what would otherwise be a conventional inspirational drama."
Washington Post," April 14, 2016",Ann Hornaday," ""The Dark Horse"" isn't always easy to watch, but Curtis's quietly powerful presence makes it worthwhile."
Arizona Republic," April 14, 2016",Barbara VanDenburgh," Curtis' portrayal of Gen's ever-present, invasive mental illness isn't mere window dressing and lacks showboating. The camera hugs his meltdowns with an uncomfortable perseverance as he talks to himself, hallucinates and turns manic."
Tribune News Service," April 13, 2016",Katie Walsh," The film never shies away from the hard topics, and the actors bring nuance and heart to this intensely dramatic and affecting film. "

Times (UK)," April 2, 2015",Wendy Ide," A committed, compellingly unpredictable central performance from New Zealand actor Cliff Curtis is the driving force behind The Dark Horse."
Guardian," April 2, 2015",Benjamin Lee, A solidly entertaining drama with an intriguingly unconventional lead.
Daily Telegraph (UK)," April 2, 2015",Mike McCahill," Robertson gives himself and his actors time to ponder the board and build convincing relationships and tensions: he's especially deft around his younger performers, allowing them to register as distinct, often defiant personalities - pawns with a purpose."
Contactmusic.com," April 2, 2015",Rich Cline," A relentlessly downbeat tone makes this Kiwi drama sometimes hard to watch, but the true story is genuinely involving, with an inspirational kick that never feels pushy..."

At the Movies (Australia)," November 21, 2014",Margaret Pomeranz, This is a really terrific film.
Sydney Morning Herald," November 21, 2014",Paul Byrnes, This combination of humour and terror makes everything more dramatic.
The Australian," November 21, 2014",Stephen Romei," Curtis commands our attention in every scene, not least because we are unsure of what he will do next."
Herald Sun (Australia)," November 21, 2014",Leigh Paatsch, The scale and significance of Potini's efforts become all the more remarkable when viewed through the filter of Curtis' committed performance.
FILMINK (Australia)," November 21, 2014",Rhiannon Sawyer," The strength of The Dark Horse lies in the conviction of its performances. The child actors are fantastic, but it's Cliff Curtis who carries the film."
sbs.com.au," November 21, 2014",Rochelle Siemienowicz, The triumphs of its characters are always provisional -- much like real life.
Quickflix," November 18, 2014",Simon Miraudo," Small in scope but significant in stature, Robertson delivers in The Dark Horse a sensitive tale with a crowd-pleasing punch, even as it declines to shy away from the bleakness of its characters' lives."
Urban Cinefile," November 15, 2014",Andrew L. Urban," Cliff Curtis delivers a spectacular characterisation, one which will no doubt be compared to Geoffrey Rush as brilliant pianist David Helfgott in Shine, as Gen has a mild mental condition for which he has to take medication"

Los Angeles Daily News," April 1, 2016",Bob Strauss," Curtis truly does find unique strains of tenderness, eccentricity and strength in the role. The actor's work, if not the entire movie, is all about game."
CineVue," April 1, 2016",Ben Nicholson, The deft and highly emotive handling of his condition and the wider ramifications of [Gen's] story make The Dark Horse a lot more than merely the against-the-odds chess story that it may initially appear to be.

Common Sense Media," April 1, 2016",S. Jhoanna Robledo," Soulful story about chess, mental illness, and redemption."
Film Journal International," April 1, 2016",Edward Douglas," A beautiful and truly inspirational film from beginning to end, The Dark Horse [...] [is] a hidden gem well worth tracking down."
RogerEbert.com," April 1, 2016",Sheila O'Malley, It's a feel-good story with the potential to make you feel great.
Los Angeles Times," April 1, 2016",Robert Abele, Curtis is so heartbreakingly convincing in the lead role that he routinely frees you of the feeling you're watching one more adversity saga with scrappy kids and a third-act tournament.
Wall Street Journal," March 31, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," ""The Dark Horse"" brings Cliff Curtis back home, and he gives a performance that's transcendent in more ways than one."

Village Voice," March 31, 2016",Bilge Ebiri," Combines several potentially tired subgenres - the inspirational-teacher drama, the mental illness drama, and the gang thriller - but, helped immeasurably by Curtis's performance, makes something new out of them."
Paste Magazine," March 30, 2016",Nick Schager," Though based on a real-life story, writer-director James Napier Robertson's film plays like a mash-up of Hollywood clichés."
Associated Press," March 29, 2016",Sandy Cohen, Gen is such a big-hearted character that his story is more than just a portrait of overcoming mental illness or a tale of a loving mentor taking his rag-tag team to the top.
Slant Magazine," March 28, 2016",Elise Nakhnikian," Despite the occasional cliché, this film mostly feels as messy as life, and as movingly complicated."
The Sun (UK)," December 30, 2015",Alex Zane, Sensibly this isn't a play-by-play movie which makes you sit through the matches -- chess isn't a great spectator sport -- and you don't need to understand the game to enjoy the film.
rec.arts.movies.reviews," September 25, 2015",Louis Proyect, The finest movie ever made about the game of chess as well as a deeply perceptive take on the brutal conditions indigenous peoples face in New Zealand.
Scotsman," April 6, 2015",Alistair Harkness," The film explores the damaging, uber-masculine gang culture that exists on the fringes of Maori culture, using chess as a simple but effective metaphor for the struggles Potini and his young charges face in the everyday battlefield of life."
Observer (UK)," April 5, 2015",Mark Kermode," At the centre of it is Cliff Curtis, best known internationally for his supporting role in Whale Rider, who dominates the screen as the mercurial Gen. It's a breathtaking performance, note perfect in every gesture, mesmerising in its conviction."
