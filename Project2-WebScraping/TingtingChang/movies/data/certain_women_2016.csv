Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," November 27, 2016",Philip Martin, ...a different kind of modern Western; one where confrontations are deflected and firearms feel impotent. What is most important about these stories is the Beckettian persistence of these women. They can't go on. They go on.
sbs.com.au," November 21, 2016",Michelle Orange," Reichardt operates as usual a specific sort of advocate for her characters, applying close, sustained, and considered attention to their predicaments, and in the process evening the balance of the individual with her surroundings."

L.A. Weekly," September 14, 2016",April Wolfe," Certain Women is a kind, loving, and deeply moving portrait of big-hearted small-town people."

The Young Folks," February 4, 2016",Josh Cabrita," Certain Women is the rare film where every detail is alive: the town breathes through a glacial pace, the characters are nourished or starved by their interactions, the love shelters and warms everyone by way of Reichardt's humanistic vision."
The Playlist," January 29, 2016",Noel Murray," The glacial storytelling has a mesmerizing effect, and gives audiences time to drink in the big skies - against which the humans look so insignificant - and to appreciate the careful way that Reichardt establishes what the heroines are up against. "

Film Comment Magazine," October 13, 2016",Jonathan Romney," Certain Women, despite giving each of its stories a brief encapsulating coda, isn't merely open-ended-it seems to deny the very idea of narrative closure."

New York Daily News," October 10, 2016",Stephen Whitty," Director Kelly Reichardt, who made the great ""Wendy and Lucy,"" likes stories that unfold slowly and simply. Sometimes she'll just let the camera run, making us watch the awkwardness of people who can't connect."

leonardmaltin.com," October 17, 2016",Leonard Maltin," The drama is low-key and the issues far from extraordinary, but the characters are real and recognizable. What's more, they are brought to life by talented actresses who understand Reichardt's less-is-more approach to storytelling."
