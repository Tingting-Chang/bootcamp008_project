Cleveland Plain Dealer," February 9, 2017",John Petkovic," Robinson, who delivers a performance that is alternately ironic and straight, is deft at bringing the whole shebang to life."
Globe and Mail," January 27, 2017",Barry Hertz," This is not a potion fit for everyone, but for a select few, The Love Witch offers powerful magic."
ArtsHub," January 8, 2017",Sarah Ward, A glorious feast for the senses as well as for the mind.
EntertainmentTell," December 23, 2016",Stephen Silver," A wildly assured, confident debut film, and one of the most visually stunning films of the year. (Splice Today) "
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," December 20, 2016",Dennis Schwartz," A retro 1960s film about witches, that puts a spotlight on their supernatural powers to drive men crazy over sex."
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 17, 2016",Tim Brayton," Mercilessly carve out a third of the running time, and suddenly we have one of 2016's best, most subversively smart and deliciously entertaining films."
Detroit News," December 9, 2016",Adam Graham," A modern feminist horror tale that rewards deep exploration beneath its admittedly beautiful surface. What looks like it might be simply a pure exercise in style not only invites multiple viewings, it requires them."
Otroscines.com," December 8, 2016",Carlota Mosegui," Biller sculpts a very unique portrait of that era without putting to shame the films, authors and the elements in which it is inspired. [Full review in Spanish]"
AllMovie," December 8, 2016",Violet LeVoit," . . . unabashedly satisf[ies] female cravings for self-validity, glamour, and, yes, love. "
Vanguard Seattle," December 1, 2016",Molly Laich, [The Love Witch] is different from any other movies you'll see in this or any other year.
Metro," December 1, 2016",Matt Prigge," Though it may seem Biller is mountain an assault on delightfully garish exploitation fare - with overemphatic titles like ""Vixen!"", ""Score!"" and ""The Lickerish Quartet"" - that's not quite what she's doing. "
Daily Dead," November 30, 2016",Heather Wixson," A vibrant and eye-catching homage to the Technicolor films of the 1960s, writer/director Anna Biller's The Love Witch is a seductive and clever twist on the gender politics, witch-centric cinema, and pulp storytelling of that era."
Washington City Paper," November 30, 2016",Noah Gittell," If you're prone to acid flashbacks, watch out. Although it takes place in contemporary times (note the cell phones), Biller films the proceedings with a day-glo palette that resembles the Technicolor movies of a bygone era."
The Playlist," November 30, 2016",Jordan Ruimy," Biller proves to be an auteur in the truest sense of the word: she directed, wrote, produced, and edited the film, and created many of the spectacular costumes and set decorations. She also, quite possibly, has created a new cult classic."
Philadelphia Inquirer," November 30, 2016",Tirdad Derakhshani," Biller's visual splendor is ... wasted on a mediocre script riddled with structural problems. Scenes follow another willy-nilly, as if moved around late in the process."
Entertainment Weekly," November 28, 2016",Chris Nashawaty," It's like a Bewitched episode stretched out to two hours. But boy, is it gorgeous to look at."
Seattle Weekly," November 25, 2016",Robert Horton," Really knows what it's doing. And it's hilariously funny, sometimes in an almost subliminal way."
Seattle Times," November 24, 2016",Soren Anderson," Is ""the Love Witch"" a parody? It sure feels like it. But I'm not sure Biller intended it to be one."
Arizona Republic," November 24, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz, It's a lot of fun.
Newcity," November 22, 2016",Ray Pride," Anna Biller's blissfully strange widescreen appropriation of the trappings of sexploitation, horror and high art, is a rubicund marvel, and a deadpan madhouse comedy... Biller's movie isn't beholden to influence, it's its own wild creature. "
Birth.Movies.Death.," July 17, 2016",Meredith Borders," Biller has created a world of feminine mystique made tangible, colorful and tidy and sensual."
Starburst," July 5, 2016",Andrew Marshall," Much more than just a meticulously constructed throwback, The Love Witch is gorgeous, sexy and mesmerising in every way."
HeyUGuys," July 1, 2016",Steven Neish," There is no denying the fact that The Love Witch is an exercise in self-indulgence, a nostalgia trip, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth indulging in."
Hollywood Reporter," June 22, 2016",Frank Scheck," Destined to be a cult classic, this sophomore effort by Anna Biller is a heady throwback to the American and European sexploitation horror films of the late '60s and early '70s."
The Skinny," June 19, 2016",Rachel Bowles," Nothing less than a tour de force of 21st century queer, feminist film."
Chicago Reader," June 2, 2016",Leah Pickett, This spellbinding ode to exploitation films of the 1960s and '70s is impressive not only for its mock-Technicolor hues and period mise-en-scène but also for what lies beneath.
ShockTillYouDrop.com," April 5, 2016",Chris Alexander," The Love Witch is a kind of horror movie but it's far more than just that. It's as much a vibrant, daring art installation as it is a kind of highly sexualized vintage movie of the week."
SF Weekly," November 10, 2016",Jeffrey Edalatpour, Biller plays with the mixed-up messages that pop culture sends both men and women.
Austin Chronicle," November 10, 2016",Josh Kupecki, [Biller] is a filmmaker unlike any other working today. I just hope it doesn't take another 10 years for her to make her next one.
AV Club," November 10, 2016",Katie Rife, A nuanced statement on gender relations whose morals are as flexible as its formal qualities are rigid.
Los Angeles Times," November 10, 2016",Michael Rechtshaffen, Biller ... emerges as a feminist Russ Meyer skilled at fetishizing archetypal images of narcissism with the exacting eye of a Douglas Sirk.
San Francisco Chronicle," November 9, 2016",G. Allen Johnson," Got to hand it to Biller - she might have made a ""bad"" movie, but it's never boring."
Film Journal International," November 9, 2016",André Hereford," Nails the look and spirit of macabre '60s B-movies, but largely leaves chills and thrills out of the brew, resulting in a handsomely crafted curiosity that's far from magical."
East Bay Express," November 9, 2016",Kelly Vance, Take a deep breath and exhale. The Love Witch is ready to blow your mind.

The Film Stage," October 11, 2016",Josh Hamm," Only writer-director Anna Biller's second film, The Love Witch affirms not only her skill as a director, but as an auteur."
Little White Lies," October 11, 2016",David Jenkins, It's a neo-sexploitation movie with subtle feminist underpinnings.
The Arts Desk," September 9, 2016",David Kettle," If only for the staggering, Rachel Maclean-like alternative reality that Biller creates, The Love Witch is a transgressive joy from start to finish."
CineVue," August 30, 2016",Martyn Conterio, Anna Biller's The Love Witch is a movie aesthetes of kitsch will embrace with open arms.
Screen International," August 24, 2016",Kim Newman," Though a little too languid at two hours, The Love Witch is appropriately seductive."
Sight and Sound," August 18, 2016",Anton Bitel," all this [visual attractiveness] is part of the film's seductive artifice, fashioned to mesmerise the viewer in much the way that witch protagonist Elaine uses makeup, dress and wig to lure male lovers by reflecting their fantasies."
PopMatters," July 28, 2016",J.R. Kinnard," The Love Witch may wear its influences on its sleeve, but those sleeves are beautiful."
We Got This Covered," July 22, 2016",Matt Donato, The Love Witch is a seductive 60s time-capsule that calls back to the technicolor charms of early genre filmmaking.
Variety," July 21, 2016",Dennis Harvey, It's a lovingly crafted ode to little-loved cinema that's secure enough in its obscurantist nostalgia to make a sly joke of its occasional anachronisms ...
SciFiNow," July 19, 2016",Jonathan Hatfull, This is really quite wonderful.
Vox," November 22, 2016",Alissa Wilkinson," While The Love Witch leans heavily on its inspirations, it isn't like anything you've seen before."
Paste Magazine," November 18, 2016",Andy Crump," If The Love Witch overstays its welcome, it at least has the courtesy to be ravishing to behold."
Salt Lake Tribune," November 17, 2016",Sean P. Means," The results are wildly over-the-top, in a Beyond the Valley of the Dolls-meets-Dark Shadows kind of way, but Biller's commitment to her vision is weirdly endearing."
New York Times," November 17, 2016",A.O. Scott," The fear of female sexuality has been a staple of horror movies forever, but ""The Love Witch"" does more than simply subvert or parody the erotic underpinnings of the genre."
Blu-ray.com," November 17, 2016",Brian Orndorf," While ""The Love Witch"" stalls on occasion, it remains original and provocative, maintaining heat and a touch of cheekiness."
Washington Post," November 17, 2016",Pat Padua," As with giallo, ""The Love Witch"" features deliberately wooden acting, and can be a little boring at times. But it's a stunningly photographed, fascinating reinterpretation of classic melodrama."
Time Out," November 17, 2016",Joshua Rothkopf," It's cloaked in a retro wardrobe and soundtrack (much of the music, by Italy's Ennio Morricone, is sourced from '60s thrillers) but loaded with irony and a fluid sense of identity."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," November 17, 2016",Colin Covert," If you're in the mood for a guilty pleasure, ""The Love Witch"" is it."
Boston Globe," November 17, 2016",Peter Keough," It is a true auteur creation that is absurd and exhilarating, a fun-house mirror reflecting our times and the folly of women who seek to control a patriarchal system by submitting to it."
Georgia Straight," November 16, 2016",Adrian Mack, The Love Witch is some sort of classic.
Village Voice," November 16, 2016",Alan Scherstuhl," The best kind of homage or parody, the type that honors every thrill and quirk of the original while improving on it."
Reeling Reviews," November 15, 2016",Laura Clifford, this throwback to Gothic sexploitation horror films of the 60's and early 70's ia a feminist contemplation on sexual equality.

Baret News," November 13, 2016",Kam Williams," A light as a feather, feminist fantasy where flawed males meet their match during creative displays of eroticized violence. "

The Young Folks," November 11, 2016",Andrea Thompson," Before you surrender to it, just remember that you were warned."
TheWrap," November 10, 2016",Robert Abele," Mere seconds into Anna Biller's candy-colored retro-horror film, you realize this movie is an ornate portal with a beckoning, bejeweled finger, and you're as helpless as one of its titular seducer's hexed-and-sexed victims."

Collider," November 10, 2016",Brian Formo, Purveyors of genre curiosities should definitely put The Love Witch on their list; you'll either fall under its pastel and free love spell or find yourself screaming that you can't handle it. Just like Elaine's victims.
