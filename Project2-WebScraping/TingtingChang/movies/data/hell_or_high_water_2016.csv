indieWire," December 31, 2016",Eric Kohn," Just as it taps into a dying corner of American society, Hell or High Water resurrects the power of western mayhem done right."
CineVue," December 31, 2016",Maximilian Von Thun," The only saving graces are the (admittedly excellent) cinematography and production values -- the action scenes are crisp, smooth and packed with tension -- but they feel almost irrelevant when the content they have to work with is this bad."

Seanax.com," December 15, 2016",Sean Axmaker, ... as good an American drama as you'll see this year.
Film Ireland Magazine," December 14, 2016",Michael O'Sullivan," It illustrates that, with enough tweaking and refinement, even a generic story can be made into a tense pacing thriller that can still surprise while trying to be as entertaining as possible."

Cinemalogue.com," November 25, 2016",Todd Jorgenson," ... a contemporary Western that doesn't fall victim to genre pitfalls. In other words, there's more depth and complexity here than a simple manhunt leading to a climactic showdown. Yet it still dishes out some old-fashioned frontier justice."

Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," August 11, 2016",Cary Darling, Texas is as much a riveting character in [this] fascinating crime drama as the brothers turned bank robbers at its heart or the laconic lawman who coolly follows them across the sun-hardened landscape like a hunter on the trail of his next kill.
Boston Globe," August 11, 2016",Ty Burr," They don't make them like this anymore - but they still can, and here's the proof."
Chicago Tribune," August 11, 2016",Michael Phillips," ""Hell or High Water"" has one foot in pulp conventions, and the other in some stimulating, morally tricky contemporary answers to those conventions. What the movie has, above all, is a dramatic line, clean and straight."

New York Times," August 11, 2016",Jeannette Catsoulis," If there's such a thing as an easygoing thriller, then ""Hell or High Water"" is it. The stakes may be steep, but the characters can seem more nonchalant than nervous."

Epoch Times," August 15, 2016",Mark Jackson," Robbing of banks may be very 1800s, but robbing by banks is very 2010s/post-Occupy. Ergo, robbing robber banks makes for a post-Occupy Western. Pine, Foster, and Bridges kill it."

Bangkok Post," August 19, 2016",Kong Rithdee," For all the genre formula -- the robbing, the hideout, the chase, the ambush -- the film is less about thrills than about slow-burning tension, and it stands out with its cultural and socio-economic specificity."

Tolucan Times," September 1, 2016",Tony Medley," While there's some good action while the brothers are holding up the banks, this film is mostly conversation between Pine and Foster, on the one hand, and Bridges and Birmingham, on the other.

Seven Days," September 9, 2016",Margot Harrison, The deft sketches of minor characters - each surviving tough times in their own way - give human faces to the film's messaging. 
The Arts Desk," September 9, 2016",Adam Sweeting, The plot functions with lean efficiency... but the real purpose of screenwriter Taylor Sheridan and director David Mackenzie is to evoke an American south-west that time forgot.
RTÉ (Ireland)," September 9, 2016",Harry Guerin," It really would be a crime if Hell or High Water didn't get some recognition come awards time. It'll definitely leave its dust in your bones, and something in your eye."
Times (UK)," September 9, 2016",Kate Muir, A smartly crafted heist thriller that quietly peels back the layers from its macho male characters to reveal the pain and tenderness inside.
London Evening Standard," September 9, 2016",Charlotte O'Sullivan," As with Starred Up, Mackenzie's family-centric prison drama, Hell or High Water is full of grim nooks and crannies."
Daily Mail (UK)," September 9, 2016",Brian Viner, One of the best pictures I have seen all year.
WOW247," September 9, 2016",Matthew Turner," A gripping cops-and-robbers thriller with a strong sense of place, and a timely thematic undercurrent that packs a powerful emotional punch."
Sky Movies," September 8, 2016",Tim Evans," Elevated by a richly detailed script from Sicario writer Taylor Sheridan, who pens roughly authentic dialogue and fleshes out even the most peripheral characters to give the story a genuine heft."
Radio Times," September 8, 2016",Damon Wise," It's a familiar story but one very well told, skewed by dry detail and snappy dialogue, scoring three top-notch performances with a great dustbowl soundtrack by Warren Ellis and Nick Cave."
International Business Times," September 8, 2016",Amy West," There are plenty of great Westerns and there are arguably even more heist movies... but here, director David Mackenzie seamlessly infuses the two, interpreting the best traditions from each in his own way."
Daily Express (UK)," September 8, 2016",Allan Hunter, What you don't expect is how deeply it cuts and how much you care about the characters and the people caught in the crossfire of their impossible dreams.
Tulsa World," September 8, 2016",Michael Smith," Hell or High Water is one of the year's best pictures, sort of a twist on a modern-day Western with plenty of West Texas flavoring and a hint of Oklahoma spice."
Financial Times," September 8, 2016",Danny Leigh," For Mackenzie, a British filmmaker whose career to date has been nomadic, the movie feels like finally finding the right key for a lock."
Little White Lies," September 7, 2016",Manuela Lazic," Unexpected directions, sharp humour and powerful performances."
Creative Loafing," September 6, 2016",Matt Brunson, The best movie of the summer season.
Empire Magazine," September 5, 2016",Jimi Famurewa," Taut, tense and burnished by Jeff Bridges at his best. This is a deceptively simple tale of Texan cops and robbers that drags the Old West into the modern age."
The List," September 5, 2016",Emma Simmonds," Mackenzie's tenth feature cultivates great compassion for its characters, while making wider points relating to exploitation and community erosion well."

Flicks.co.nz," October 18, 2016",Aaron Yap, One of the year's most pleasant surprises.
Graffiti With Punctuation," October 6, 2016",Blake Howard, Hell or High Water is about the fight or flight instincts at the epicentre of the disintegration of American society. Mackenzie and Sheridan and their players dance with that relative morality gracefully.
Laramie Movie Scope," September 29, 2016",Robert Roten," Hell or High Water is a smartly-written (by Taylor Sheridan of Sicario) well-acted film that closely observes its characters and their relationships, even minor characters, which are often glossed over in lesser films."

Sight and Sound," September 16, 2016",Trevor Johnston, The whole movie offers ample evidence that [Mackenzie] has stealthily achieved an unassuming but utterly genuine mastery of his craft.
CinemaDope," September 13, 2016",Glenn Lovell, ... a forlorn modern-day Western ... Its garrulous style and tumbleweed authenticity will stay in mind long after the plot has faded from memory ... Bridges is essentially doing Tommy Lee Jones 
Contactmusic.com," September 13, 2016",Rich Cline," Every scene bristles with comedy and suspense, and the atmosphere is further enhanced by a moody score and wonderfully evocative songs by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis."
CineXpress," September 13, 2016",Fico Cangiano," Anchored by excellent performances by Chris Pine, Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges, Hell of High Water manages to successfully marry the western and heist genres. [Full review in Spanish]"
Flick Filosopher," September 13, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson, Alongside plenty of heist-movie humor and suspense is a bleak fatalism grounded in depressing reality and resignation to the miserable necessity it demands.
Irish Independent," September 12, 2016",Paul Whitington, It's quite a film.
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," September 12, 2016",Hilary A White," Always an actor of huge vitality, Foster gives a career best while Pine shows he's far more than just a pretty face. The landscape belongs to Bridges, however."
Scotsman," September 11, 2016",Alistair Harkness," Though this is a thriller with a conscience, it doesn't fall back on black-and-white morality to get us on the side of its outlaw protagonists."
Observer (UK)," September 11, 2016",Wendy Ide," art heist, part western for the Occupy generation, this sharply plotted thriller is a triumph for both director David Mackenzie and writer Taylor Sheridan."
The Ooh Tray," September 11, 2016",Ed Whitfield," A contemporary Western, [which] like the best of them, is concerned with the moral character of the frontier, and whether the lawless and the righteous have a foot in each other's territory. "

The Blu Spot," November 21, 2016",Jeff Beck," Hell or High Water has several positive elements, including a great cast and a thrilling finish, but thanks to lax pacing and a narrative that wanders a bit too much, we end up with a film that never truly comes together into a satisfying whole."
Matt's Movie Reviews," November 17, 2016",Matthew Pejkovic," A modern-day set crime western that delves into the themes of right, wrong, law and capitalism with a righteous heart that pulsates within the grey of a morality tale where the pursuit of money turns good men bad."
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," November 14, 2016",Piers Marchant," Bridges, as always, is a joy to experience, digging into his role with unbridled gusto."
Concrete Playground," November 13, 2016",Sarah Ward," A film built dirt-up from the tiniest of details - a parade of sepia-tinted small towns here, a slow drawl masking unspoken pain there."
El antepenúltimo mohicano," November 10, 2016",Alberto Sáez Villarino," At a narrative and stylistic level, is one of the most complete works that we have been able to witness in the last century. [Full review in Spanish]"
Daily Express (UK)," November 9, 2016",Henry Fitzherbert, Bridges is on fine form and Pine and Foster are a combustible duo. Mackenzie doesn't put a horse-shoed foot wrong.

The Straits Times (Singapore)," October 26, 2016",John Lui," There are no real villains, just two brothers who have a code and the rangers who live by another. In the inevitable final clash, as in all good Westerns, it becomes apparent they have a lot more in common than they think."
