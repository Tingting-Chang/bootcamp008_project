Laramie Movie Scope," January 5, 2017",Robert Roten, Director Ava DuVernay ('Selma') has made a very powerful and provocative documentary film which highlights a clear danger to American democracy. It shows how America's enormous prison industry and its largely black population came to be.
Chicago Tribune," December 28, 2016",Michael Phillips," It's a crazy amount of ground to cover, but only rarely does 13th sacrifice clarity for cinematic energy."
Combustible Celluloid," December 28, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson, It's an absolute must-see.
Slate," December 28, 2016",Leon Neyfakh," In its sweeping treatment of the history of American racism, the film brought me closer than I've ever been to understanding how it could be that so many people could have ever grown used to the moral catastrophes that were slavery and Jim Crow."
CNN.com," December 28, 2016",Brian Lowry," Given the concerns about relations between law enforcement and minority communities, 13th could hardly be timelier."
CineVue," December 28, 2016",Matthew Anderson," Ava DuVernay's 13th bites down on the gristly notion of the USA as 'The Land of the Free', chews with bitter discomfort and consequently spits it out, unable to swallow."
Radio Times," December 28, 2016",Trevor Johnston," A partisan view, perhaps, but the film's argument is strong, articulately expressed, and backed up by truly disturbing images of injustices past and present."
The Film Stage," December 28, 2016",Diana Drumm, 13th speaks to a populace jaded by the status quo and encourages them to reexamine their own preconceptions and prejudices.

Film Inquiry," December 6, 2016",Emily Wheeler," With 13th, Ava DuVernay provides a comprehensive and wide-eyed look at the complications of the 13th amendment we aren't discussing."
Medium," December 4, 2016",Chris Barsanti, ...spring-coiled and crucial.
New York Observer," November 9, 2016",Oliver Jones," Manages to capture the depth and insidiousness of more than a century of cultural, societal and economic oppression along racial lines and then condenses it into a brisk 100-minute package that could literally slip right into your pocket."
National Review," November 4, 2016",Armond White, The 13th is full of accusations by opportunists-posing-as-historians who profit from reinforcing the fear that black Americans by and large have not experienced progress.
PopMatters," November 3, 2016",Argun Ulgen," 13th is not so much a ""wake up"" call, but an entreaty to get to work."
Film Experience," October 26, 2016",Glenn Dunks, 13th is an essential viewing for everybody. It is essential for you and for myself. Essential for Americans and those outside its borders. Essential most of all for white people and black people and everybody else. 
ColeSmithey.com," October 25, 2016",Cole Smithey," ""13TH"" is a vital documentary toward understanding America's systemic abuse of blacks that takes on many nefarious forms, not the least of which is this country's prison system that forces prisoners to produce goods for companies like Victoria's Secret. "
WBAI Radio," September 30, 2016",Prairie Miller," A devastating indictment of the loathsome corporate mass incarceration servitude, along with their creeping privatization of everything. And that the Oscars must finally recognize documentaries for awards in the Best Film and Best Director categories."
indieWire," September 30, 2016",Eric Kohn," The broad scope is made palatable by the consistency of its focus, and the collective anger it represents."
Hollywood Reporter," September 30, 2016",Todd McCarthy," DuVernay and Averick never stray far from the itinerary they clearly set for themselves, which was to illuminate the distance the country still remains from its ideal of equality for all."
New York Times," September 30, 2016",Manohla Dargis," By the time her movie ends, Ms. DuVernay has delivered a stirring treatise on the prison industrial complex through a nexus of racism, capitalism, policies and politics. It sounds exhausting, but it's electrifying."
Variety," September 30, 2016",Owen Gleiberman," More than just another documentary, it's a crucial and stirring document - of racism and injustice, of politics and the big-picture design of America - that, I believe, will be watched and referenced for years to come."
Entertainment Weekly," September 30, 2016",Joe McGovern, 13th is a titanic statement by a major American voice. Viewing - right now - should be mandatory.
TheWrap," September 29, 2016",Alonso Duralde," DuVernay isn't interested in the impossible, and often absurd, goal of ""balance,"" despite the squirrely presence of Grover Norquist and a lobbyist-apologist; she wants to make you feel something. And she succeeds."
The Playlist," September 29, 2016",Rodrigo Perez," Intelligently told, and reflective of Ava DuVernay herself: assured, articulate and bold."

Reeling Reviews," October 4, 2016",Laura Clifford," Eugene Jarecki's 2012 ""The House I Live In,"" although more limited in focus, arrived at the same conclusion. DuVernay has expanded on the concept, going a big step further by pointing at the very document which defines our country."
New York Daily News," October 4, 2016",Stephen Whitty," Directed with calm passion and controlled outrage, the movie - named after the amendment which outlawed slavery, but left a significant loophole when it came to criminal convictions - is a study in profits. And power."
RogerEbert.com," October 3, 2016",Odie Henderson," An unflinching, well-informed and thoroughly researched look at the American system of incarceration, specifically how the prison industrial complex affects people of color."
Collider," October 3, 2016",Chris Cabin," A damning, nuanced case against mass incarceration. Ava DuVernay has gone beyond crafting a call for a rebellion. With this masterpiece, she's calling for a revolution."
Little White Lies," October 3, 2016",Joseph Pomp, The US has five per cent of the world's population and a staggering 25 percent of its prisoners. DuVernay's film lays bare both how this has come to be and why it must change.

Den of Geek," October 1, 2016",David Crow," The historical straight line of imprisoning people of color as a substitute for the Jim Crow laws and lynching tactics that had, in turn, replaced slavery is ably and convincingly made by 13th-to the point of outrage."
rec.arts.movies.reviews," October 1, 2016",Louis Proyect, Another work of genius from one of America's outstanding directors and social critics. 
Guardian," October 1, 2016",Jordan Hoffman," ""Prisons are the new plantations!"" may seem like sloganeering from a far-left protestor, but DuVernay's effective film draws a strong, straight line from the abolition of slavery to today's mass incarceration epidemic, explaining its root cause: money."
AwardsCircuit.com," September 30, 2016",Clayton Davis," In the most literal explanation of the film's brilliance, it very well could be one of the defining documentaries this century. It's among the very best ever made. "

Movie Nation," September 30, 2016",Roger Moore," Damning arguments about the impact of the ""Prison Industrial Complex"" are somewhat muted by repetition, and some poor stylistic choices by director Ava DuVernay. "
The Nation," October 24, 2016",Stuart Klawans," With the aid of co-screenwriter Spencer Averick, [DuVernay] marshals witnesses and facts, constructs arguments and charts, buttonholes you in your seat and then tries to yank you upright, not to applaud but to act."

Deadline Hollywood Daily," October 16, 2016",Pete Hammond, Ava DuVernay's searing documentary blows a hole in the constitution and provides serious food for thought in upending what we think we know about our system of justice.
Christianity Today," October 14, 2016",Jeffrey Overstreet," With startling interviews, ugly statistics, kinetically charged animation, and shocking man-on-the-street footage of American history, 13th reintroduces Americans to their very own criminal justice system."
Sight and Sound," October 14, 2016",Fanta Sylla," The documentary teems with facts and archive footage. The mass of information can be intimidating, but the argumentation is well-constructed."
TIME Magazine," October 13, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," 13th ... is dense with information, and it moves fast. But it's also a story told in images, and the ones DuVernay has chosen ring not just with sadness and horror but also cautious optimism."
Truthdig," October 12, 2016",Carrie Rickey," At once devastating, infuriating and bracing, 13th is a landmark documentary that mourns the martyrs and provides a précis of how to make America truly just."

Vox," October 7, 2016",Alissa Wilkinson," Vital, searing, and engaging."
Movie Mezzanine," October 7, 2016",Vikram Murthi," DuVernay has created a vital introduction to a section of modern history of which many are ignorant, and its probable social utility cannot be ignored. That 13th largely works well as a film is the cherry on top of the proverbial sundae."
Metro," October 7, 2016",Matt Prigge," Has an urgency that goes beyond the timeliness of its subject. It may be a talking heads-and-clips affair, but it's designed with such force and fire that it would leave one shaking even if we weren't facing a possible Trump presidency."
Hindustan Times," October 7, 2016",Rohan Naahar," 13th has the urgency of a last-ditch attempt, a final warning sign before the road forks into uncharted, dangerous territory. It is a great film. It's streaming on Netflix, where it'll exist forever. You have no excuse to not watch it."

New York Post," October 5, 2016",Kyle Smith," The film is a morass of distortions, half-truths, calculated omissions, absurd hyperbole and outright falsehoods."
Tampa Bay Times," October 5, 2016",Jimmy Geurts," Many of the points made in the movie will already be familiar to anyone aware of the topic. But the film weaves together so well, and the overall message so necessary, that it remains a vital work."
