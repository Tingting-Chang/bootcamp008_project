Chesapeake Family Magazine," August 2, 2016",Roxana Hadadi," Zootopia pulls together various elements - a neo-noir mystery, a buddy-cop comedy, and timely social themes - into a mostly entertaining animated film. "
Digital Spy," July 11, 2016",Ben Rawson-Jones, Using the animal kingdom as a means to convey so much sense about our own contemporary world is a masterstroke which owes a debt to George Orwell.
El Universal," July 11, 2016",Alejandro Alemán," Behind the gaze of an optimistic and inclusive film, we have a great homage to the hard-boiled film noir of the 1940s. [Full review in Spanish]"
Antagony & Ecstasy," July 10, 2016",Tim Brayton," It is much too willing to abandon boundless creativity to wallow in an endless succession of overfamiliar narrative constraints. But at the same time, it uses those constraints generally quite well."

Cinema Crazed," June 19, 2016",Felix Vasquez Jr., Another stellar Disney film that begs for a second look thanks to its evocative overtones and commentary.
The Straits Times (Singapore)," May 25, 2016",Boon Chan," For all the animal antics on display here, the movie also gently broaches all-too-human issues of stereotyping, prejudice and racism. This is something worthwhile to chew over, even for younger audiences."

"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," April 11, 2016",John Beifuss," Believe it: Disney's latest digitally animated feature is a contra-Trumpian, race-conscious, political-conspiracy neo-noir in the guise of a funny talking-animal cartoon."
MLive.com," April 11, 2016",John Serba," ""Zootopia"" is a vibrant and smart movie... at times, though, it feels more like commercial compromise than the distinctive art of superior animated works."
Cinemixtape," April 7, 2016",J. Olson," If the film is superficially great, a plastered-over screenplay lurks just beneath, poking its ugly head out early and often."
New Zealand Herald," April 7, 2016",Francesca Rudkin," What's so clever about Zootopia is it takes the normal feel-good positive messages, this time about not judging people by their sex or race, and mixes it with something more mature, a vintage Los Angeles-like crime noir."
Laramie Movie Scope," April 6, 2016",Robert Roten, This is the best animated film I've seen since 'The Incredibles.'

South China Morning Post," April 5, 2016",Richard James Havis," Although it would be stretching things to describe Zootopia as a metaphor for modern society, its underlying message of racial tolerance is a useful lesson for everyone."
Seven Days," January 1, 2017",Margot Harrison," Zootopia is a bouncy, candy-colored animation, not an overt political allegory, yet it's an apt movie for this primary season."
Film Experience," December 30, 2016",Nathaniel Rogers, The detective story is actually engaging. It's simple enough to follow (for kids) but complicated enough to offer both genuine surprises and silly amusing detours.
Stuff.co.nz," December 30, 2016",James Croot, Perfect school holiday entertainment for the whole family.
Stuff.co.nz," December 30, 2016",Sarah Watt," Much of Zootopia's charm results from its wonderful animation and captivating energy, but at heart it's the witty, insightful script around deeper socio-political issues which makes it truly satisfying for any grown-up who goes to see it."
Salt Lake Tribune," December 30, 2016",Sean P. Means, A smart four-footed spin on the buddy-cop genre.
Pajiba," December 30, 2016",Kristy Puchko," Sure to speak to kids and grown-ups alike, Zooptopia unfolds a poignant lesson about how prejudice can hurt people, but also how it can be overcome. And it does all this in a wonderfully fun film."
HitFix," December 30, 2016",Drew McWeeny," Zootopia is a reminder of just how beautiful animated films can be. Holy cow, this thing is almost hallucinatory."
The Mary Sue," December 30, 2016",Petra Halbur, Zootopia is an exceptional film and -- dare I say it? -- an important one.
TIME Magazine," December 30, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," There are enough under-the-radar subtleties, rendered with a refreshing lack of smart-aleckiness, to make Zootopia feel current and fresh. It's a modest, unassuming entertainment that's motored by a sly sensibility."
Hindustan Times," December 30, 2016",Soumya Srivastava, Zootopia has great voice performances from Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman who suit their characters perfectly.
PopMatters," December 30, 2016",Bill Gibron," Zootopia is a blast to watch, a wonderful cartoon experience with an extra bit of gravitas for spice and flavor."
Daily Star," December 30, 2016",Andy Lea, The film's messages -- the importance of tolerance and following your dreams -- are pretty standard for a kiddie flick. But there's a political edge that is very unusual for a Disney movie.
CineVue," December 30, 2016",Jamie Neish, An entertaining and endlessly inventive comedy and something with more insight than anyone could have anticipated.

Movie Mezzanine," November 17, 2016",Josh Spiegel, ...a genuinely charming and funny film.
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," November 14, 2016",Dan Lybarger, The [DMV} sequence is so funny that it's oddly forgivable that the rest of Zootopia rarely matches up to that comic plateau.
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," August 26, 2016",Philip Martin," ...an Animal Farm-type fable about racism and sexism -- a shrewd and timely critique of fear-based politics set in a remarkably detailed, endlessly fascinating alternate universe."
TheWrap," February 12, 2016",Robert Abele," With its upfront themes of prejudice and diversity, and its release at a time in which society's biases are under the microscope, Zootopia may be one of the more fortuitously scheduled family entertainments in recent memory."
Time Out," February 26, 2016",Dave Calhoun, The world that Zootropolis creates is intelligent and fascinatingly detailed -- it feels more like a movie by Disney-owned Pixar than a straight Disney film.
Movie Nation," February 25, 2016",Roger Moore," Smart, but better at delivering a message of tolerance than laughs. "
Siete24.mx," February 23, 2016",Mario P. Székely," The most ingenious part of the film is building this designed and raised city for animals, creating the perfect metaphor about how a rabbit and a mouse can represent our dreams, ambitions, talents and flaws. [Full review in Spanish]"

Forbes," February 19, 2016",Scott Mendelson," It's funny, it's clever, it's exciting and suspenseful, and it operates as one of the more potent ""social issues"" pictures that we've seen from a major studio (even during the Oscar season) in quite some time."
Starburst," February 18, 2016",Peter Turner," A wild ride with some noir-ish undertones, Zootropolis packs in plenty to keep the whole family entertained."

The List," February 17, 2016",Emma Simmonds," The be-true-to-yourself and don't-judge-others messages are nicely worked in: while it's robustly right-on, including being cheerfully feminist, it never feels preachy."
El Pais (Spain)," February 15, 2016",Jordi Costa, A noir comedy that carries itself with loads of imagination. [Full review in Spanish]
Screen International," February 12, 2016",John Hazelton," The variety of cute - and occasionally slightly scary - animals should keep younger kids interested for most of the hour-and-three-quarters running time, while older kids and parents will be diverted by the comedy and pop culture references."
Blog de cine," February 12, 2016",Mikel Zorrilla, Zootopia is a big surprise that offers quality fun creating an interesting story that keeps you interested until the end. [Full Review in spanish]
Hollywood Reporter," February 12, 2016",Michael Rechtshaffen," Just when it was looking like animated animal movies had run out of anything original to say, along comes the smartly amusing, crisply relevant Zootopia to handily demonstrate there's still plenty of bite left in the anthropomorphic CG menagerie."
Variety," February 12, 2016",Peter Debruge," Disney offers a decades-later correction to 'Song of the South,' in which rabbits and foxes have a chance to live together in relative harmony."
Dork Shelf," March 2, 2016",Jason Gorber," With a deep, complex yet accessible storyline married to a visually sumptuous telling of an animal tale, the film is an absolute treat, feeling the equal of any classic Disney flick. "
AV Club," March 2, 2016",Jesse Hassenger," By investigating the mechanics of long-held cartoon assumptions (both about the harmoniousness of some cartoon animals, and the characteristics of others), Disney is encouraging viewers young and old to see the world differently and more thoughtfully."
Slant Magazine," March 2, 2016",Kenji Fujishima," The film goes deeper in its allegorizing, tapping into the volatile nature of identity politics."

TheFilmFile.com," March 2, 2016",Dustin Putman," Vividly mounted with a breadth of vision worth celebrating. Disney has hit a home run with ""Zootopia,"" a grand entertainment with an ingeniously developed, socially conscious message."
USA Today," March 2, 2016",Brian Truitt," Its earnest ""You can be anything!"" message is heavy-handedly clear, though Zootopia works best as a funny romp that ingeniously imagines a landscape where hamsters can be businessmen and polar bears are the coolest bodyguards around."
IGN Movies," March 2, 2016",Eric Goldman," Zootopia is a wonderful example of how Disney, at its best, can mix its past and present together in a very cool, compelling way."
New York Daily News," March 2, 2016",Katherine Pushkar," Right there with the likes of ""Up"" and ""Inside Out,"" ""Zootopia"" is so well done I forgot it was animated."
Konexión," March 1, 2016",Israel Acosta Aroche, A film with lots of strong ideas that are much needed in times where xenofobia is still a thing. [Full review in Spanish]
San Jose Mercury News," March 1, 2016",Tony Hicks," ""Zootopia"" dishes its messages the best way possible: colorfully, cleverly, warmly and with humor, all packaged in a strong storyline. It's not among the animated greats, but close enough to certainly be worth a couple hours of a parent's time."
Metro," March 1, 2016",Matt Prigge," A big, sometimes messy, sometimes insightful exploration of bigotry, using animals to preach for a more evolved understanding of each other's innate differences. "
Groucho Reviews," March 1, 2016",Peter Canavese," If Zootopia only reluctantly comes around to its crime-solving story, that's understandable: the good stuff resides in the characterizations and the morality play around them, decrying fear of the other."
The Film Stage," March 1, 2016",Josh Slater-Williams," Zootopia proves a successful amalgamation of disparate influences, much like its eponymous city."
Village Voice," March 1, 2016",Michelle Orange," Heavy with pop allusions and references to other crime underworld movies, including The Godfather and Chinatown, Zootopia is impressive in its visual conception and scope: At once straightforward and densely layered with wit and incident ..."
Entertainment Weekly," February 29, 2016",Chris Nashawaty, Zootopia's message of tolerance is a noble one. But it's loopy moments ... that give this modest film its magic.

The Skinny," February 29, 2016",Michael Jaconelli, A neo-noir buddy cop comedy that will likely entertain children and adults alike thanks to a steady stream of gags and vibrant visuals.
Cine Premiere," February 28, 2016",Diana Sánchez Uranga," It has the quality seal of all Disney films, but stands out because of the details. [Full review in Spanish]"

Rolling Stone," March 3, 2016",Peter Travers," This animated crime caper comes ready to party hard, but also takes a deep dive when necessary, especially when certain species are treated as threats and cause public panic. Listen up, Mr. Trump. "
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," March 3, 2016",Maricar Estrella," On the surface, Zootopia is a witty, wondrous buddy-cop film... At a deeper level, the film allows parents to bring tough topics to the dining-room table, topics such as bullying, stereotyping and inclusiveness."
New York Times," March 3, 2016",Neil Genzlinger," Funny, smart, thought-provoking - and musical, too."

Blu-ray.com," March 2, 2016",Brian Orndorf," A mixed bag when it comes to entertainment value, but for the first time in a long time, Disney's attempting a high wire act with tone and content, making the feature intriguing but not always triumphant. "
Fort Worth Weekly," March 2, 2016",Kristian M. Lin," Zootopia isn't tied down to any specific element in our present-day environment, but nevertheless it emerges as chillingly relevant to our time."
Chicago Daily Herald," March 2, 2016",Dann Gire," This wild and comic political twist on ""Animal Farm"" works for both kids and adults as a reaffirmation of equal justice and opportunity while rejecting racial and gender stereotyping."
Fresno Bee," March 2, 2016",Rick Bentley," When the new animated movie focuses on the critters, it's a funny trip through the animal kingdom. What slows the ark (oops, make that arc) of the film is a crime story that's in need of a few more monkeyshines."
BuzzFeed News," March 2, 2016",Alison Willmore," It's a world in which race does not exist. But species certainly do, and they provide a fuzzier, cuddlier way for Zootopia to get at some thorny issues of prejudice and profiling."
Chicago Sun-Times," March 2, 2016",Richard Roeper," Zootopia is one of my favorite animated movies. Not one of my favorite animated movies of the last year or two, or of the last decade, or in recent memory. It's one of my favorite animated movies, period."
Vox," March 2, 2016",Todd VanDerWerff," It's goofy and joyful. It has an actual message that it's not shy about expressing directly, one that's filled with depth beyond ""be nice to each other."" And its screenplay is surprisingly clever on a structural level."
Cleveland Plain Dealer," March 2, 2016",Laura DeMarco," Yes, the adorable factor is pretty high. But so is the movie's IQ. Zootopia is a thought-provoking film about big ideas like tolerance and diversity and rising above your base animal nature."

NOW Toronto," March 2, 2016",Norman Wilner," Zootopia is a lot of things at once, and all of them are pretty good."
Tampa Bay Times," March 2, 2016",Steve Persall," Good intentions don't always make for good movies. Case in point: Zootopia, a Disney film with more on its mind than animated fun and fuzzies. So much, in fact, that it loses track of what audiences expect, what they're being sold."
San Francisco Chronicle," March 2, 2016",Mick LaSalle, Each bustling frame is packed with so much repeated-viewings-rewarded imagery that the screen must be sampled rather than taken in as a whole.
Newsday," March 2, 2016",Rafer Guzman, Entertaining and thought-provoking.
NUVO Newsweekly," March 2, 2016",Edward Johnson-Ott," Zootopia is stuffed with characters, situations, culture clashes and eye candy."
Beliefnet," March 2, 2016",Nell Minow, Wonderfully imagined -- the animators have a lot of fun with the drastic scale and biome differences.
FilmDrunk," March 2, 2016",Vincent Mancini," If you were raised on Zoobooks and Far Side cartoons, ZOOTOPIA is one of the greatest animated movies ever."
Philadelphia Inquirer," March 3, 2016",Steven Rea," Apart from its anthropomorphic, allegorical angle, Zootopia is also a tale of female empowerment and a classic noir, too."
Kansas City Star," March 3, 2016",Loey Lockerby," Disney's latest is clever and endearing, but it's the animated equivalent of a pro-diversity pep rally."
Toronto Star," March 3, 2016",Peter Howell," Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman lead an aces voice cast, playing good-cop bunny Judy Hopps and con-artist fox Nick Wilde, who must find common turf to solve a crime wave in the title metropolis. Call it fur noir."

ComingSoon.net," March 3, 2016",Alan Cerny," Disney's Zootopia is sweet and addresses social issues with sensitivity. Sometimes it can't quite reach its lofty goals, but it's still wildly entertaining."
National Post," March 3, 2016",Chris Knight, An indication of what good animation can do in the service of a decent story.
Toronto Sun," March 3, 2016",Bruce Kirkland, The result is a slam-dunk candidate for best animated feature in next year's Oscars. But the pleasure now comes in appreciating the sumptuous artistry.
Georgia Straight," March 3, 2016",Janet Smith," It's hard to create wonder with animation these days, but with its mix of the detailed storybook, the 3-D stuffy, and the retro-Disney cartoon, Zootopia conjures an animal kingdom that still manages to astonish."
SF Weekly," March 3, 2016",Sherilyn Connelly," In addition to being a crowd-pleasing Disney cartoon, Byron Howard and Rich Moore's Zootopia works as both a nifty detective story and a parable on institutionalized racism."
One Guy's Opinion," March 3, 2016",Frank Swietek," A clever piece of family entertainment that wittily uses whodunit convention to deliver messages about tolerance, self-confidence and friendship in eye-catching fashion."
Consequence of Sound," March 3, 2016",Dominick Mayer," Zootopia might not be the best of Disney's recent in-house movies, but it's easily the most political film the Mouse House has turned out in a good while."

Dallas Morning News," March 3, 2016",Britton Peele," It strikes a near perfect balance between fun family comedy and message film, never feeling like it's too much of either."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," March 3, 2016",Colin Covert," Fun and funny, beautiful to look at and tempting to get lost in, Disney's fable stands up along anything in the studio's catalog."
St. Louis Post-Dispatch," March 3, 2016",Sarah Bryan Miller," It's smart entertainment that deals effectively with issues of diversity and sexism, while staying light and never preachy."
Austin Chronicle," March 3, 2016",Marc Savlov," Easily one of Disney's more imaginative and detail-oriented CGI offerings in a while, Zootopia uses the classic tropes of anthropomorphized animals and comic references to pop-culture touchstones to slyly puzzle out what it means to be ""civilized."""
Washington Post," March 3, 2016",Jen Chaney," The best animated film of the year, as well as one that conveys a message rarely heard in movies for children: Getting exactly what you hoped for isn't the end of the journey."

AllMovie," March 4, 2016",Violet LeVoit," Even though Zootopia remains whimsical family entertainment and never turns into a polemic, at its core it has more in common with Animal Farm . . . than it does with other classic anthropomorphized Disney fare . . ."

HollywoodInToto.com," March 4, 2016",Christian Toto, Lions and tigers and preconceived notions about others based on their outward appearances ... oh my!
Newark Star-Ledger," March 4, 2016",Stephen Whitty," ""Zootopia"" does have some important things to say about not judging people by what they look like, or what part of the world they come from. Kids will probably nod and embrace that as sensible advice. Now if we could only get some adults to listen, too."
Globe and Mail," March 4, 2016",Kate Taylor," Leaving aside amusing jokes about the wolves trying desperately to contain a group howl or sloths working as bureaucrats, animal behaviour is a troubling metaphor for cultural diversity."
Reel Film Reviews," March 4, 2016",David Nusair, ...a decidedly middle-of-the-road Disney effort...

Austin American-Statesman," March 3, 2016",Nicole Villalpando," [Zootopia is] incredibly entertaining in the beginning as we see how different animals live in different parts of Zootopia that feel very human, indeed... It's the dark middle part that is hard to reconcile in a Disney movie."

New England Movies Weekly," March 3, 2016",Daniel M. Kimmel," Everything you could want in an animated film: creative visuals, solid script, engaging characters. "
Boston Globe," March 3, 2016",Tom Russo," An agreeable hodgepodge, at least, one that aims to be not just a breezy mystery, but also a race-and-ethnicity fable."

Film Comment Magazine," March 3, 2016",Michael Sragow," These filmmakers cross-fertilize social satire with burlesque, parody, and self-parody."
Collider," March 3, 2016",Matt Goldberg, It's got a catchy pop song and a nice message about working to achieve your dreams. But because the directors pushed further- in showing how prejudice seeps into our daily lives-they've made Zootopia a destination you absolutely must visit.
Birth.Movies.Death.," March 3, 2016",Devin Faraci," This charming, pop culture soaked movie admirably takes on racial issues but sags under the weight of its muddled metaphors."
Winnipeg Free Press," March 4, 2016",Randall King," Unlike a certain Pixar property having to do with automobiles, this one warrants a sequel."
"Deseret News, Salt Lake City"," March 4, 2016",Josh Terry," A rich blend of story, message and entertainment."
Salt Lake City Weekly," March 4, 2016",Scott Renshaw, It's confusing when it starts to feel that Zootopia is working against its own message to get easy laughs.

Cinemaclips.com," March 4, 2016",Roger Tennis, The cagey and delightful 'Zootopia' is creature comfort in every way. 
Tribune News Service," March 4, 2016",Katie Walsh," Somehow, Disney has managed to pull off a hard-boiled police procedural thriller about political corruption starring an adorable, large-eyed bunny. As strange as this combination might seem, it works. Who knew bunnies could make such intrepid rookie cops?"
San Diego Reader," March 4, 2016",Matthew Lickona, A buddy-cop comedy crossed with a political thriller and mashed up against a social drama. It's a credit to Disney's collaborative process that the whole thing manages to hold together as well as it does.
CraveOnline," March 4, 2016",William Bibbiani," Teems with sight gags and puns and pop culture references, but it's all an excuse to use the buddy cop genre they way it was always intended, as a form of social commentary."
San Francisco Examiner," March 4, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," The computer-generated creatures have smooth and cheerful lines, like old-style ""stretch-and-squash"" animation. The movie is wonderfully fluid and graceful."

Screen It!," March 4, 2016",Jim Judy," It's the best film so far of 2016 and should easily be at or near the top of the list for Best Animated Film come award season next December and beyond. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Scary Stuff, etc. - Also Available)"
