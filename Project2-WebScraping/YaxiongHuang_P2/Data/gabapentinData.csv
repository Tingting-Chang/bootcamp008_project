Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,10,"""I was diagnosed with RSD on Tuesday. The doctor prescribed me Gabapentin. I'm only taking 1 pill per day for the first week, then taking 2 a day for a week, then moving up to 3 per day. So far, after only taking this pill once a day for 4 days I have seen a huge improvement with my affected foot. My range of motion has increased (with the help of physical therapy) and the constant burning pain has gone down from a pain level of 5 to a 2! The crazy electrical ""zaps"" and ""zings"" have been happening less and are not as intense. I feel way more calm and confident mentally and emotionally. However, the tissue, muscle, and deep bone aches are still severe, but I'm hoping that will subside as I start to raise my dosage. I like these pills so far!"""
Restless Legs Syndrome,10,"""Good for sleeping and my RLS   I take 300 at nite and it works!!"""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I have been using this medication for quite some time. 300mg 3 times a day. It almost completely erases irratability without hindering my ability to think clearly. In fact it helps my concentration considerably. I am able to focus on the task at hand without freaking out about why things arent working right."""
Postherpetic Neuralgia,10,"""I'm on 300mg 3x a day. It's my lifesaver for neuropathy and restless legs.  It allows me to sleep at night.  I find the only side effect is increased appetite."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have had periodic depression for years, and general anxiety problems as well, lately they had been getting worse.

I cannot tolerate the SSRI anti-depressants, can't even tell any effect when I take Buspar, was taking Clonazepam when things got really bad.

I went back to see a Dr. I have great respect for, had another QEEG, he said I have a ""fast brain"" (Gross CNS hyperarousal).

Started me on 300 mg Gabapentin at bedtime.  Noticed a calming, mellowing effect the first day.

Before I could not stop my mind from racing, from obsessing, and would get almost paralyzed to do anything.

I feel so much better, my mind is calm, depression is lifted, and no side effects other than a very, very slight fogginess.

So far, for me - amazing."""
Pain,10,"""Okay, I want to start off by clarifying that this med won't work for everyone. But when it does work, it is amazing. This drug has been a godsend. 

I have Lupus which has caused me to have horrible pains to where I can't sleep.
I now can sleep through the night because of this med. I was on 400 mg of methadone and I still had pain. So, the doctor added gabapentin and started to taper the methadone. I am now only on gabapentin and it is wonderful.

With that being, when you first start taking it, you will feel drink and clumsy. However, those side effects go a way.

This medication works best the longer you take it. Good Luck!"""
Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I was diagnosed with neuro sarcosis. I was in so much pain until I started this medicine. I have taken it for 6 years now and I take 2400mg a day in 3 doses. I like so many others who have commented can feel the pain coming back about 30mins before my next dose. I would not be functional without it. As time has gone on I have noticed more forgetfulness but can blame it all on the medicine."""
Trigeminal Neuralgia,10,"""I have had TN since 1997, and remember only needing 100 mg tid for years...but had to gradually increase that as the pain got more frequent and stronger. I am now taking 800 tid, and if the flare is bad, my neurologist says to take it 4 times a day. It is still helping control the pain, and I have been able to work and live normally. My dentist lets me cancel & reschedule if I'm having a flare. I even have some Emla cream to put carefully on the facial area that is most sensitive. There is also something called Warm Skin that a person can use in the winter, if you live in a cold region. That helps, too. I went to one national mtg and a woman was selling scarves with small pockets in them, to put handwarmer packets in! I'm glad I bought one."""
Hot Flashes,10,"""20 years ago I was experiencing 33 hot flushes (I'm British!) in 24 hours, this had gone on for about five years.  Nothing worked for me.  I read an article on trials that had taken place in the US, took it to my doctor and we started me on Gabapentin.  Well, it was a godsend.  I'm not at the top of the dosage level and so I have some minor 'warm' periods but nothing I can't cope with.  After that my doctor put all her ladies on it who were having a bad time.  I'd recommend it to anyone.

No cost to me because we have the National Health Service in this coutnry."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""Last year I went off gabapentin as I wanted to get a pilots license.  The FAA was so nasty because I have diabetes that I guess I will never get the medical clearance.  Lately the neuropathy got so severe I couldn't stand it so gradually worked my way back up to 9-100 mg a day.  What a difference.  I may need more later.  I did notice a few pounds packed on, and a bit of a blur in my eye with the new lens implant.  Now that I know it is the gabapentin putting the weight on, I can be more careful as I want to maintain my figure.  Lyrica made me nuts and I had terrible mood swings.  Once I got up to 700 mg of gabapentin, I noticed a big relief."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I have Multiple Sclerosis and all that comes with it. After some years of easy going I suddenly found my feet would feel like they were on fire so I arranged an appointment with my Neurologist at the local MS clinic and was prescribed Gabapentin 5% in Lipoderm. This is a creamy compound the chemist has to make each refill order and it does take a couple days notice. Anyway, the very first time I applied the lotion to the feet the pain, which was so severe I would cry in agony, dissipated rapidly and was gone within 15 minutes. I use 
1 ML twice a day to the feet and am pain free. I can not say it does anything to the numbness of the toes and bottom of feet but there is no pain to that so it is not a problem."""
Migraine,10,"""Got botox and been through all the meds for 8 yrs, finally got the nerve decompression surgery and thought I was well on my way then WHAM hit with a massive migraine with vertigo was horrible lasted for weeks then Dr gave me Neurontin and WHAM it pulled me right out of my migraine!!!!!! so I'm confident now, hoping for great results."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,10,"""I had bad rls. It went up my arms and down my legs .I am on lamictal 300mg once a day and trazodone 50mg at night. The trazodone seemed to make it worse.  Mirapex did nothing to help the restlessness .  As soon as I was prescribed neurontin, I felt better. 300mg x5 a day.  I would recommend this drug for anyone with rls."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""Neurontin has been a life saver for me. I've been taking it for 8 years since my first time I was in a drug rehab center. My doctor started giving me neurontin as a mood stabilizer and said that it helps with opioid and heroin withdrawal symptoms. And he was absolutely right. I have been on so many medications and neurontin is definitely the best med I have taken for my symptoms. I recommend this to anyone who has the problem tht I do."""
Postherpetic Neuralgia,10,"""I was first given Neurontin for the shingles, for a few days nothing helped the pain of the shingles, most painful thing I have ever had. After about a week I started feeling better, was sleeping all night and now I have no pain. Even though I still have the shingles best medicine for pain I have ever taken."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I had two major surgeries last year. A total hip and a total knee  while in rehab for the total knee. I started experiencing diabetic neuropathy. The doctor gave me 900 mgs daily for it. I can tell you it was a great improvement and was very pleased. The 1st of the year I tried a herbal medicine and it didn't work.  I did give it a month. I am now back on the gabapentin. I am so thankful for it, never will I go without it."""
Anxiety,10,"""I am 42 yes old and have had social anxiety my whole life. It's been hard to deal with. I became an addict because I couldn't cope. After serving in the military I went to the VA for help. I was on so many medicines I can't remember them all. Gabapentin has changed my life. Been completely clean for years and no anxiety."""
Migraine,10,"""I read the other comments and decided to try it.  It was wonderful! I've been using Neurontin for nerve pain down my leg for 3 months. It's great to know it serves more than one purpose.  Thanks everyone."""
Anxiety,10,"""When my doctor first prescribed gabapentin, normally a seizure medicine, for my anxiety, I was a little confused. She explained to me that if you look at 2 brain scans, one patient with seizures, and one with anxiety, the damage in their brain is very similar.

Within a week, I was able to feel a dramatic difference with my anxiety. Within a month, I truly felt ""normal"" again. I LOVE what this medication does for me, and it's made a huge impact on my daily life. 

I take one 300mg tablet in the morning, and two at night, and I have a very mild twitch that it's also helped to relieve as an extra plus."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I have a c6-c7 compressed disk that has been causing severe arm pain.  The pain medicines didn't help at all but after being prescribed gabapentin the pain has completely dissappeared."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have just recently started taking this medicine and my anxiety has vanished. I have even tried to make myself anxious and it will not happen. I am satisfied so far. """
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I have a diagnosis of Bipolar 1 spectrum that has been classified as treatment resistant as no meds have allowed for me to have much success without dire side effects or polarizing symptoms. I was put on 100mg. 3 times a day. After 4 years of major rapid cycling mood symptoms Gabapentin worked immediately with no side effects. Its so strange to wake up feeling great and to go to sleep at night feeling great. I even have made many new friends and had several job offers since I started this miracle drug. No depression or mania for 2 weeks. So incredibly grateful"""
Vulvodynia,10,"""I started using Neurontin this summer. I was not able to function when my vulvodynia flared up, so many hours and days were spent lying on the couch in pain. Neurontin kicks in pretty fast and helps me be able to be productive. I would be lost without its help!"""
Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I just started taking gabapentin 300 mg 3 times a day... wow my legs feel no more pain...I can walk easy have more desire to do things...it's a miracle. ...I'm so happy to have found this medicine."""
Hot Flashes,10,"""After years of hot flashes.....at least one per hour....plus sleep depriving night sweats....my doctor suggested Gabapentin rather than hormones. Didnt really understand  the drug until I did some research and read how it has helped other women. So, I took it....300mg, at night, as prescribed.....wow!!! I havent slept that well in years!!!!  Zero night sweats! The first two mornings after taking Gabapentin, I felt a little bit foggy headed. But also a sense of calm that I really enjoyed. No more foggy mornings.....its been 1 week since I began taking Gabapentin. Still getting a solid 8 hours of sleep with no night sweats! I am one very happy woman!"""
Pain,10,"""This is the ONLY medicine that helps with my pain!"""
Pain,10,"""I started out at 300mg's 3 times a day approx 1 yr ago. I'm up to 900mg's 4 time a day, I suffer from horrible nerve pain due to having CRPS, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. So much has been taken from me, But the gabapentin helps so much with the nerve pain that I take the good with the bad. I have an awesome support system beginning with my Husband of 36 yrs. Otherwise I don't think I could do this. The gabapentin takes away from me certain things, But I take the good with the bad. My thoughts and prayers go out to all of you who suffer and a have to take gabapentin."""
Pain,10,"""I had a herniated disc problem at L5 S1. Doctors suggested I  take 100 mg daily twice and it works very well."""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""I have spina bififa, scoliosis, osteoarthriti and I am on the bu trans patches. I have been in severe pain, even my eye balls hurt, every joint and muscle agony. I have tried so many medications an was almost at point of giving up. I was put on gabapentin and it has been a wonder drug and life saver. After only taking two all my pain went completely and I feel 20 again"""
Alcohol Withdrawal,10,"""I have been on Gabapentin for 15 months.  My dose is two 600mg tablets a day for a total of 1200mg in a 24-hour period. I was prescribed Gabapentin for alcoholism first, anxiety second.  This medication is a God send.  After drinking 10-15 alcohol drinks a day for 40 years, within a week I quit and had no side effects from withdrawal - plus the anxiety went away. I do NOT crave alcohol at all.  It is so weird.  I thought it wouldn't work until I tried it - and it does work!  It was THAT quick.  I suggest everyone with an alcohol problem that wants to quit but is deathly afraid to do so, ask your doctor for gabapentin.  It is non-addictive like benzodiazepines (Valium, Xanax).  AA never worked for me.  Gabapentin, IMO replaces AA."""
Anxiety,10,"""I've been taking gabapentin for a year for severe anxiety social anxiety and it has been wonderful. I'm a very worrisome person so when I take this medicine I feel more at ease without feeling sedated. I find it funny my Dr said they don't generally use this medicine for anxiety but it works for me and apparently a lot more people then she made it seem. """
Anxiety,10,"""I am 40 years old. I have dealt with social anxiety since my teen years. I have been on Wellbutrin XR 150 mg twice daily for several months, which has given me energy, improved mood, and increase sex drive. I started gabapentin a couple weeks ago for pain relief related to a slipped disc impinging nerves in my back, sciatica. I am taking 600 mg tthree times a day. I am amazed!! Social anxiety is gone! First time in my life. I have actually been chatty and social without breaking into a sweat from nerves. Also haven't reached for my when required Ativan at all since starting gabapentin. I couldn't be happier about this accidental discovery. Life changing. Also note that I am a recovering alcoholic. Maybe defective gaba has been the culprit?"""
Migraine,10,"""Well I have tremors and migraines, so my neurologist gave me 800mg gabapentin and I'm supposed to take 2 x 800mg (1600mg) 3 times a day for my tremors mainly, but a side effect is the absence of migraines."""
Migraine,10,"""I have been having chronic migraines for 5 years now and probably 50 other prescriptions wrote for me and finally gabapentin is like a miracle for me.My migraines were 24/7 with tension in shoulders and neck.  Felt little tired and strange first day but great relief now. My doctor and neurologist all but gave up on me and was filling pretty depressed.  Thank you gabapentin!!!!!"""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I use Gabapentin 1200 mg since 2 weeks for my rapid cycling bipolar. Since one week I feel stable as I have never been for 10 years. It is early to say but it seems to be helpful. It is very difficult condition and difficult for treatment too. I was suffering a lot, but now I just enjoy to my life. I eat normal and also I am calmer. Also I use Depakote and Effexor, a little dose Wellbutrin and Seroquel. I have very mild mood changes now."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I needed neck surgery in 2009. I had the surgery, but after a couple of months, I begin to hurt all over and was so stiff it took me hours to get my routine going. I had trouble at work with horrible pain. I finally found a doctor that would listen to me. He put me on 3600mg, and as long as I take it on time and stay on the schedule I am good to go. I am so glad because my job is in law enforcement and I have to be on my toes in the jail. This medication is a God sent. It's not a narcodic. I hope this note gives everyone a better quality of life,."""
Hot Flashes,10,"""I started gabapentin for nerve pain. My hot flashes stopped after having them for 5 years. It's been a miracle for me, my doctor hadn't heard it worked for hot flashes, but I can't go back to hot flashes that left me with sweat running down my face in the grocery store line or having to have my bedroom at 50 degrees at night so I could sleep somewhat comfortably at night."""
Pain,10,"""This is the first medicine that dropped my back pain from 10 to a 2. I was on increasing oxycodone for years due to crushed back in accident. Had 5 herniated discs L1 - L5 which eventually developed bone spurs and arthritis. Severe radiating leg pain would cause leg numbness and some great falls in public. Surgery was recommended - I declined. 15 years later my psychiatrist prescribed it for anxiety/mood stabilizer to replace Depakote (also an anti-convulsant). 
3 days later I noticed I could get by with Advil and gabapentin. Why didn't my ortho surgeon give me this? I take 900 mg/ day. Only been on it 3 weeks
and I'm a different person."""
Anxiety,10,"""I suffered with severe migraines several times a year.  In my 30s, the migraines became more frequent, longer lasting, more severe. Accidentally discovered Xanax, lifted the migraine immediately. Xanax not being a long-term solution for many reasons, my neurologist prescribed gabapentin.  I haven't had a migraine in over six years.  I take 1200 mg a day, usually before bed, but have discovered that taking 300mg in the afternoon when anxiety kicks in and the rest at night has made a huge difference in anxiety.  Anxiety runs in my family, migraines, too, and this medication works very well for me."""
Hot Flashes,10,"""Gabapentin has been great for reducing my hot flashes! 
I was prescribed this medication after chemotherapy for nerve pain. It stop the nerve pain in my hands and feet. It also helped with restless leg syndrome."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have been hiv positive for 3 years when I asked my doctor if my hiv meds were actually giving me side effects of anxiety and panic attacks. I am taking truvada and isentress and although I am very happy with my meds, I really noticed that When I started the hiv meds, I become  very anxious and paranoid of negative things happening in my daily life. I talked to my doctor and so he prescribed me a very low dosage of 100 milligrams 4 capsules a day of Gabapentin. I immediately noticed the effects within the first week. I am no longer paranoid, worrysome and anxious all the time. I'm very happy my doctor prescribed me this medicine. :)"""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""Bipolar disorder successfully treated with gabapentin for 4 years -900mg daily.Then in Dec 2015, I had general anesthetic for broken leg operation. Then 6 weeks later, fell into deep depression with uncontrollable crying. Convinced this is result of anesthetic. Can anything reverse this state?"""
Restless Legs Syndrome,10,"""Works VERY well for restless legs syndrome and trust me, I have tried them ALL!  Good luck, I know this is a wretched thing to have."""
Hot Flashes,10,"""I started taking Gabapentin two weeks ago. My doctor prescribed it for my hot flashes and night sweats. I was averaging two to three hot flashes an hour and terrible night sweats every night. It was very debilitating and overwhelming. Since starting the Gabapentin the night sweats have vanished altogether and I average two hot flashes a day! it's a lifesaver for me. I take three 300 mg. pills per day, one in the morning, one after dinner and one before bed."""
Anxiety,10,"""I am a 70 yr old woman & have had anxiety & depression my whole life. This medication has changed my life. I took it initially for shingles but noticed immediately that my anxiety was gone so I phoned my psychiatrist (I am bipolar) & asked to be put on it.  He agreed no problem. I take 300 mg 3 times a day. I hope this helps others with anxiety & depression. I am like a new woman!"""
Alcohol Withdrawal,10,"""I was able to withdraw from opiates using Neurontin."""
Insomnia,10,"""I take a 300 mg of Gabapentin along with 10 mg of Melatonin and it's works great for me. I fall asleep about 30 to 40 minutes after taking them and sleep throughout the night."""
Insomnia,10,"""This is my 3rd night of taking this.  I went to my doctor because my depression and anxiety had come back full-force.  I hadn't eaten hardly anything in 3 weeks and couldn't sleep but 3 hours a night.  I was a walking zombie!  She prescribed a SSRI and this and I have slept like a baby on 300 mgs a night plus melatonin.  My anxiety has gone down at least 60% in two days and my depression has already lightened up - although that will take much longer but just getting some decent sleep undisturbed had really helped!  A great side effect of this is that I used to have to get up 5 or 6 times a night to go to the bathroom and now I get up maybe once a night!  What a relief!"""
Hot Flashes,10,"""Started taking this for hot flashes a couple of weeks ago.  I'm on 300mg twice a day and it is wonderful.  I would sometimes get more than 4 hot flashes per hour- I felt like a chameleon.  I had no idea how nice it is to be almost completely hot flash free!  I'm post menopause at 48 and started having flashes at 37.  After awhile it becomes a fact of life, if I had under 10 flashes in a day I thought that was good.  When I started having 2-4 per hour in the afternoons, sometimes more than 30 during waking hours, my oncologist prescribed this.  I can't take hormones because of high risk breast cancer.  Gabapentin is giving me my life back!!!!!"""
Migraine,10,"""I'm actually a chronic cluster headache patient for over 30 years. Started when I got sober in 82. Cleveland Clinic finally figured out what the problem was. Now for about 10 years I've been on the Gabapentin as part of my medical cocktail. We just had to increase the dosage today from 600 to 900 as the clusters were back on a nightly alarm clock basis. Well, tonight I have been headache free and hoping this increase will do the trick. Has worked before but maybe just time for increase in my dosage. Prayers please. These clusters are no fun. Thanks and good luck to all headache patients."""
Anxiety,10,"""Gabapentin has been a God send for me. I have taken several of the benzos for my anxiety and I have a very negative opinion of them. Gabapentin removes my anxiety and allows me to be completely alert and focused at work. It allows me to be friendly and outgoing but at the same time calm. I have tons of energy everyday and sleep really well at night. I started taking gabapentin for nerve damage in my left arm about 2 years ago. Immediately I noticed it to be an extremely effective medication for worry and anxiety. I believe it to be a perfect medication for me. I never want to stop taking it. Makes me feel ""normal""."""
Insomnia,10,"""I was prescribed GABA by my doctor for insomnia. I find it does help to keep me asleep once I get there. I agree it doesn't put me right to sleep however I find that it does allow me to relax my brain and body so they're not going 100 miles an hour which then allows me to fall asleep. I was told to only take it if I had 7 or 8 hours dedicated for sleep so what I found was this. When I take it and am allowed to sleep a full 8 hours before getting up I feel great in the morning. If I take it and have to get up in 6 hours I'm disoriented in the morning and vision is blurry. So with that being said and knowing it takes a couple hours to fall asleep after taking this I've learned my time table of when I take it where I get the best results."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I started the Gabapentin two weeks ago for Fibromyalgia discomfort and this medication has changed my life. 
My chronic lower leg pain I've suffered with for over 5 years is gone and my quality of life has improved a great deal!"""
Hot Flashes,10,"""I was offered gabapentin for nerve pain in my chest. Having had hot flushes and night sweats completely taking over and affectly so many areas of my life, after only a couple of days taking the gabapentin, the flushes stopped!!! I had been suffering for 3 years having gone through treatment for breast cancer at 45. Due to the amount of pain, my GP had me in 1x300mg 4 times aday.  Downside was for the first 3-4 weeks (also because it was a high dose), I felt very drowsy, unable to concentrate, so also unable to drive. I was off work anyway, so was able to cope ok. This only lasted the 2 weeks. My GP had discussed the side affects before hand. I had been on 37.5 mg of venlafaxine 2x1 daily but didn't feel it helped that much. live with in UK."""
Anxiety,10,"""I am on meds for depression and they're working. Thank God. Anxiety is an issue,  so my psychiatrist prescribed gabapentin,  300mg. The suggested dosage is one, 4x per day. I don't do that but instead take it when I'm feeling anxious and it works like a charm. Plus it helps me fall and stay asleep. Am hungrier but I can control that. Great medication."""
Pain,10,"""I've had vague lower leg pain for years that was getting worse each year to the point that it was constant all day long.  I was taking 1600 mg of ibuprofen a day.  I finally mentioned this to a doctor who thought it might be nerve pain and prescribed gabapentin 3 times a day.  It worked almost immediately.  It decreased my dosage to twice a day and it still works.  """
Migraine,10,"""I have had migraines for over 15 years now.  I have tried everything out there from Imitrex to Morphine for reduction of pain, from Propranolol to Nortriptyline for prophylactics and nothing worked.  My doctor was running out of options and suggested Gabapentin and what a difference.  Now because it makes me tired, I only take at night before I go to bed, so I do not have ANY side effects that other people do.  I take a dose of 300 mg at bedtime and so far it has been a life saver.  I have not had any headaches for over a month since starting the Gabapentin.  I had such bad migraines, they would last up to 4 days straight without any relief.  Needless to say, I am quite happy with the medication."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,10,"""300mg at nite in bed ... Sometimes 600mg..... Helps me sleep and no restless legs"""
Migraine,10,"""I have been a migraine sufferer for almost 17 years. I went on and then off birth control as a means of trying to reduce the number of migraines I would get. Often 3-4 times a month. I was given Amerge which was effective. I then switched to Imitrex. An accident last summer caused me great nerve pain and in the fall I was put on Gabapentin for this nerve pain in my arm from my elbow dislocation. Throughout the fall and winter I had a few headaches, nothing that popping a few Excedrins wouldn't take away. Three weeks ago, I stopped taking Gabapentin to try to reduce the drugs I'm taking. Big mistake. For the past week, I have had blinding migraines unresponsive to Excedrin and Imitrex. I will be going back on Gabapentin."""
Trigeminal Neuralgia,10,"""400mg life saver for normal flare ups but not strong enough for bad attacks. Good when used in conjunction with Topamax"""
Pain,10,"""I have herniated disc as well as severe arthritis in my shoulders and arms.  I have had many days of severe pain and restless nights, very painful mornings while being on many different narcotics that didn't help very much.  After starting Neurontin the pain has almost completely gone.  I am still on Roxicodone but the Neurontin has made all the difference in the world.  I can raise my arms above my head, something I haven't done in months.  It does make me a little sleepy but I am sure that will go away, I have only been taking it for a week now.  My opinion it to take it at night, everyone needs a good night sleep anyway.  It is great for me."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I was given Neurontin by my orthopedic surgeon for nerve pain in my back before having a hip replacement. It dawned on me after a week or so, I had no fibromyalgia pain. After going over what I had been doing differently, I figured out it was the Neurontin. I goggled it and found that the University if Cincinnati had tested it yielding positive results in treating fibromyalgia pain symptoms. My Dr has decided to continue the medicine as long as I am getting relief from the pain. I do have to say that the fibro fog is still a bit of an issue and I find my short term memory is a bit glitchy. But, hey that what iPhones are for, right? Being pain free is worth the trade off. My brain us slowly acclimating. It's great to live and not just cope."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I have been on Neurontin for several years.  I take it along with Zoloft for bi-polar disorder.  All I can say is that it works for me!"""
Anxiety,10,"""I have taken Neurontin for 5 days now..400 mg 4 times a day. It is like a miracle medicine for me. I was drinking 18-24 beers a day..one 10 mg Valium, lots of coffee and smoking 1 1/2 - 2 Packs of cigarettes a day. Anxiety levels were High. I feel rested, calm, clear headed and No anxiety. It's been 20 years since I have felt this good. I drank a lot and took a lot of nerve pills. I went to rehab for 3 days. Doctor put me on Neurontin 1600 daily. I feel a little sluggish, but that is a lot better than the way I felt a week ago. I have No caffeine, cigarettes, valium or alcohol. I have saved a lot of money now. ($30) a day habit. I do wear a 21 mg patch though.
 Please give this Drug a try. Get the right dosage for you will help a lot."""
Anxiety,10,"""My husband is on a ""light"" dose of Neurontin (Gabepentin) and the medicine really works to relieve his anxiety.  He has Parkinson's Disease and mild cognitive disorder, as well as Parkinson's depression.  Neurontin works well on his tremor and his anxiety, but higher doses make him ""foggy.""  His dosage is 800mg spread over 12-16 hours, with the option to increase the dose to 1000mg per day, depending on his anxiety level.

Anxiety,10,"""I have been on gabapentin for two weeks now. I'm on 300mg three times a day. It took about a few days for it to start working. But I have to say that this med works! If I do not take it or if I'm getting close to my next dose. I start to feel depressed. I love taking this. It really does help for headache pain, and mood. I got this for depression. Because i do suffer from depression and anxiety a lot. It seems to help with the depression but not anxiety. If anything it makes me more happier. More calmer and more relaxed. I have gotten dependent on this drug for my mood. It doesn't make me sleepy at all. My body has gotten use to taking it. I don't see myself getting off of this. I enjoy being relaxed and feeling calm."""

Fibromyalgia,10,"""I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in 2006 and have been on a very, very low dosage of Gabapentin 300mg at bedtime ever since. My Fibromyalgia is manageable and I have no side effects from the medicine. I lead a very busy life.
I am an Executive Assistant in a fast-paced organization, and a very involved grandmother to 3. Rarely, I will have a flare that is triggered by extreme stress and I will have a day in bed, but most days I am putting in 12 hr days at work. And weekends I am busy with family, so I feel Gabapentin saved my life! It was a miracle from the first few weeks of taking it."""
Pain,10,"""It took a good few years of chronic lower back pain to finally find out I've a dislocated coccyx, I've tried everything from cortisone injections to minor surgical procedures, nothing helped. My GP prescribed gabapentin 300mg 3 times a day, 12 weeks ago with immediate relief. I've had my dose slowly increased and am now on 900mg 3 times a day. I'm waiting for a big operation now to remove the coccyx so until then these are managing my pain. I've even stopped taking tramadol as these gabapentin were so effective!"""
Insomnia,10,"""I was prescribed Gabapentin for anxiety and insomnia. I was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea and had a tough time getting used to my CPAP and didn't sleep for several nights in a row. The first night I took the Gabapentin I slept! And I've slept every night since then. I take 800 mgs during the day and 800 mgs at night for 1600 total. I sleep between 7 and 9 hours every night now. My neurologist also told me that Gabapentin increases slow wave sleep. Before my CPAP (and the Gabapentin) I was getting no N3 slow wave sleep at all. So this drug is amazing for sleep, for me at least."""

About two years ago I started having tooth problems. I discovered major gum recession. Yesterday I had my first round of skin graphs. The doctor knew it was from Neurotin. He has had several patients having taken as little as  2 months to me 16 years. The doctor originally thought I needed 3 grafts. I only had enough to graph two. Three months from today I have to do two more grafts. Had I known this I would of never taken Neurotin."""

Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I have been taking Neurontin 800 mg 4 times a day for several years. I can say it helped me in more ways than one. Been underweight for most of my life, and over the years Neurontin has helped me get an appetite back. Now I am the right weight for my height. Also, after 4 years addicted to Suboxone and Klonopin, I never would have been able to get clean without Neurontin. Overall I feel that Neurontin has saved my life. I haven't attempted suicide since I started on it. But for SEVERE bi-polar like I have, counseling really does help."""

There were time I actually thought I was going to go completely insane. Most night I didn't sleep more than an hour or two. Even then I was not getting a good deep sleep. When I asked my GP about gabapentin, he had no problem prescribing it for me. He even followed recommendation for the dosage. I take 100mg in the morning and at lunch. Before bedtime I take 200 mg.. All I can say is that this has been a godsend for me."""

Later I was rammed into by another car and had whiplash. My lower back had Lamitory surgery that left my left leg with a fairly numb left leg that occasionally had shooting pains. The shooting pains have been helped and the feeling of pains and needles feeling has been greatly reduced too in that leg and foot. I am taking 300mg tablets.

Anxiety,10,"""I have GAD stemming from PTSD due to trauma in my past. I've been taking all sorts of medication for it for years, including Klonopin which I did not realize was habit forming until after I started taking it. Then, last year, I switched doctors, and she refuses to prescribe benzos, especially since I had a problem with alcohol abuse. Last month, she prescribed me Neurontin and I thought it wouldn't work, so I put off getting the script filled. But then it got to the point where I couldn't live with the anxiety so I went and got the script filled just to give it a shot and I'm so amazed at the difference it makes. I do not feel anxiety at all anymore and even though it makes me kind of foggy, I can still function. I love this med."""

Anxiety,10,"""I've been dealing with anxiety my entire adult life (I'm 29). Finally, after a long period of unemployment, I was able to get insurance, and began seeing a psychiatrist. Despite complaining about panic attacks, he prescribed Wellbutrin (buproprion) for my depression (which I'm realizing is more likely ADHD-PI, so the doc was at least half right in prescribing the bupropion.). This greatly exacerbated my anxiety, to the point I was having more panic attacks in a week than I was previously having in a month.

With gabapentin 3x100mg daily, as needed, that's no longer the case. My quality of life is much improved."""

Pain,10,"""I'm a recovering alcoholic/addict with chronic pancreatitis, so having the option to take a non-narcotic to manage chronic pain is critical for me. I have been relatively successful at managing the pancreatitis after it's acute and vicious onset which had me hospitalized and on a diladid drip for seven weeks. Now that after a year the pancreatitis has turned chronic, though I maintain a good diet and exercise often, and so pain management is crucial. However it's pretty dangerous for me to be on narcotics, and it is most certainly not how I want to spend my life. The Gabapentin has truly made the biggest difference for me in both dealing with chronic pain and the anxiety I have about controlled substances. I am relieved and grateful."""

Switched Dr's, and that one gave me a very high dose of benzos, and it almost killed me. Spent time in the icu for that one. Finally got the most amazing Dr now and he started me on gabapentin. It honestly saved my life.It is so hard to survive this illness when you cant get in under control. I had forgetten what it was like to be myself. I was angry and pissed off at everyone.

Restless Legs Syndrome,10,"""Only problem I have found with Gabapentin is the need to increase the dosage over the long run.  I am now up to 2000 MG a night.  Having talked to many using the same medicine, it would seem the limit is 2400 MG, after that no increase seems to help.

I started back in 1999 with 100 MG a night.  Over the last 13 years the need to increase has been gradual but needed.  I am approaching the limit.

Gabapentin has been a Godsend."""

Fibromyalgia,10,"""When it comes to treating fibromyalgia, this medicine is the greatest. In the beginning it was prescribed to me for my Sciatica pain that runs from my low back down both legs and a few months ago when I went to my Pain Management doctor for an epidural he wanted me to come off the Neurontin for a month or few so as to see if the epi's were working and if so, how much.  I politely argued with him quite a bit because I knew how much Sciatica pain I'd be in without the drug but had NO IDEA it even was helping my fibromyalgia.  So I relented and came off the medicine.  By the 2nd week, my fibromyalgia was SO BAD that I was bed-ridden and pretty much stayed that way until my next appointment 2 1/2 weeks later.  It was quite literally a month from hell.  Neurontin Works."""
Alcohol Withdrawal,10,"""I went on gabapentin for alcoholism that troubled me for 10 years when nothing including Alcoholics Anonymous barely worked. I read anecdotal information that it helped with alcoholism, went on 600mg twice daily and it was the first thing that helped me. Now I take 1200mg twice daily and find it works great!

Afterwards I read a study in the Journal of American Medicine, Gabapentin in Alcohol Dependance, 2014 that confirmed it works well in many people for cravings and binge drinking.

This medicine should be further studied to confirm it works well. On this site it is obvious it helps a lot of people struggling with alcoholism which I have, along with Bipolar Disorder. I call Gabapentin my"" happy pills"" that also takes away my anxiety."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have been on gabapentin going on almost a year, I have had anxiety all my life, but even more after I became a heroin, and cocaine user. I started taking Neurontin in prison, and these pills have helped me so much, and now I take 1200 in the morning, and 1200 in the evening, and I'm the happiest girl on earth and I've been clean, they help for real, I'm happy to clean, and cook, and spend time with my son. It's non narcotic, and a blessing."""
Anxiety,10,"""At the beginning of the year, I was diagnosed this medicine for headaches, not anxiety. I did not even tell my doctor about my anxiety since I was used to dealing with it for years on my own. After only a few doses, my headaches were controlled and even better my anxiety was gone! I felt better than I have in years and had control of my life again! I only take a few doses around my menstrual cycle because that's when the worst headaches occur. I will still feel anxiety in certain situations but not in every day life. I'm not a big fan of any pills but I signed up for this site to share my experience with this medicine and hope it works for others as well!"""

Fibromyalgia,10,"""I was prescribed gabapentin at 300mg three times a day. After one week, I'm feeling some relief from my fibromyalgia pain. My upper arms, for example, used to hurt just raising them to brush my hair. That pain is gone. It does still hurt, though, to be pinched in one of the key areas for fibromyalgia pain, like near the elbow. I've only been on the medicine for 10 days and will stick with it to see if in time, all or more of the fibro pain disappears. As to side effects, dizziness and drowsiness are all I've experienced, and those symptoms are annoying but I can live with them as long as the pain is gone. I've come to accept that to get rid of the pain, I'll have to deal with a couple of inconveniences."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I've been on it for 7 years now and it is amazing. I had to go off of it for awhile when I was in the hospital and I got to see how it actually helps me. All of my fibromyalgia pains and everything else came back. I was in so much pain until I went back on it. Now presto it has take 99% of the pain away. I am now able to move around and not let it slow me down or keep me in bed all day. So very effective for me. I tried Lyrica and it made me gain weight and made me very suicidal so I went on this and its a wonder drug. Hope it helps you too."""
Anxiety,10,"""I originally took massive handfuls of this drug for epilepsy over a month a decade or so ago. It was ineffective, but I noticed while I took it the side effect of being happy, sociable, and chatty. Along with other stuff at the massive doses.

So fast forward a decade or two, and had unexpected nasty negative life events and became suicidal. Ended up in a psych ward, and I asked for gabapentin. 

Started taking a pill morning and evening and the overwhelming suicidal thoughts vanished, the daily crying spells vanished, the intense negative emotion state vanished. Feel calm, cheerful, and happy. My blood pressure went from ultrastress 180/120 with pulse 150 to 120/80 pulse 90. It calms me down and helps me cope when I was feeling overwhelmed"""

When it is time for me to take a dose my upper back and my arms will begin to tingle and become cold and my hands will begin to burn. If I wait my arms and back will become very cold and no amount of heat will help. Once I take my dose my symptoms will subside in 15 to 30 minutes.  I take my gabapentin with a 5 mg tab of oxycodone which I take for a variety of serious pain and I think that the combination is much more effective for dealing with neuropathy.  I have not found any studies that support my observation.  I suffer no side effects from this medication."""
Migraine,10,"""I have had chronic almost daily migraines for almost 25 years, have been to many neurologists, had many MRIs, and other tests and have tried many medicines. In last two years, I have had to take Vicodin, because nothing else worked. Well, my doctor prescribed three 100 mg of this pill, and after 1 pill, I woke up to no migraines. I was into a three week migraine. I have had no migraines now for two consecutive days. First time in years and years. 
This is a miracle pill. I feel a little groggy, like I have had 2 drinks, but I have only been on this for 2 days. I cannot believe the FDA won't allow this pill to be marketed for treatment of chronic migraines. This pill should also help with restless legs syndrome, back pain, and anxiety. Wow!!!"""
Migraine,10,"""Gabapentin not only helped with migraines, shortening their intensity, duration and also my recovery time afterward, but it also helped with spasticity, my duration and quality of sleep, muscle stiffness and pain and some cognition.

Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""Started gabapentin at 300 mg daily. Moving up an extra 300 mg every 3 days.  Was extremely sleepy for over two weeks with little or no pain relief...until I started taking 2400 mgs, 600 mgs three times daily. At this dosage my pain level dropped significantly and the drowsiness side effect stopped. The pain had been so intense I'd been feeling suicidal...and even opiates were not controlling it.  Now, with the 2400 mg daily dose of gabapentin my neuropathy pain is very well controlled and life is good again.  I have experienced no side effects since the first few weeks of drowsiness.  Don't let doctors tell you that if 900 mg daily doesn't relieve your pain...that the medicine won't work for you. 1800 mg to 3600 mg is a working dose."""
Pain,10,"""Lumbar fusion, cervical fusion. 12 years of opiate treatment for the pain led to a large tolerance for these medicines. I'm opiate free now. I have been put on Gabapentin. I love it. For me the build up of stiffness is more of a problem than the pain is. Don't get me wrong, it hurts!, but I seize up the more I do a physical activity. I'm on day 4. The stiffness is all gone. The pain is reduced to the lumbar area only, and only a 2 or 3 on the pain scale after a full day of housework. So many good reports out here, I thought I would share...thanks."""
Anxiety,10,"""Neurontin has changed my life dramatically. I suffered from high anxiety with panic and anxiety attacks. I started this medicine at about 19 and had been off and on it the past 13 years. It literally has made me a new person. When I don't use it I notice a lot of fatigue, worry, anxiety, etc. When I am using this medication, I can concentrate on the better side of things and am not so negative. In the beginning it did have some side effects such as a ""loopy"" feeling. Over time that did pass, and now gives me energy to get through the day. I am on 300mg 3 x day. I can also sleep much easier, and my carpal tunnel syndrome is dramatically better. Before I felt very snappy and impatient, now I handle things with a much more calm disposition. Love it."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I had terrible back pain and wasn't diagnosed with fibromyalgia until two months ago. My doctor recommended gabapentin since the fibromyalgia especially took a toll on my mental state. My back has never been better!

I have minor side effects-such as gas- but honestly, I'll take that over the pain anyday."""
Postherpetic Neuralgia,10,"""I have been taking Gabapentin for four months for post herpetic neuralgia. This medicine has been an absolute miracle for me!

Anxiety,10,"""I suffer from generalzed anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and panic disorder. I have been on Neurontin for about three months. At first I was on 300mg/day, and now am on 600mg/day. My doctor wants to ultimately get me up to 900mg/day. This medicine works great. It keeps me on a calm and even keel, plus eliminates some of my physical anxiety symptoms. The only side effect I experienced was some slight clumsiness at first, which disappeared after a few days. I also take Tenormin and Prozac."""
Hot Flashes,10,"""I have been taking gabapentin 600mg, 3 times a day for the past 2 years for hot flashes.  I started taking gabapentin ER for a research study on hot flashes.  It was a miracle drug for me.  The hot flashes almost stopped completely after just 1 week of taking this medicine.  The study lasted for 6 months, and then I was taken off cold turkey.  The withdrawl was horrible.  Hot flashes, couldn't sleep, and just over all irritable to say the least.  I went to my regular doctor and was prescribed gabapentin 600mg.  Again the hot flashes subsided. It is the only medication that I take.  The best part of taking this medication is that my energy level has sky rocketed. At 49 years old, I feel 30."""

Nurse practitioner put me in SSRI and Mobic. SSRI alters pain perception, plus I was crying in her office. Mobic worked but short term. Finally, I went to a pain doctor thinking I was being scheduled for a steroid injection when he said, let's try gabapentin first. Pain is GONE on 300mg 3x daily. Can't wean yet but it works!"""

My lovely girlfriend told me to ask my primary about this medicine and I am so happy. I was at a level 9 pain this morning and now I can be in any position I want without feeling the sciatic pain in my leg.  I have absolutely zero pain now and I am very very happy!

I had 5 courses of bleomycin, Velban and Cisplatin (1980s) When I first took Neurontin to control the pain I was taking 900 to 1200 mgs per day. As the symptoms decreased in frequency I weaned off and now take it only when needed. I can feel the changes in my skin when its going to start. I don't wait for the shooting pain, I now  take 300 mgs gabapentin at the slightest tingling of my scalp. It helps tremendously.  The only problem is saying whatever comes to mind , especially when taking prednisone at the same time."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""My new doctor just prescribed Neurontin.  For the first time in years, I had a good night's sleep and woke up with less pain and stiffness.  It's the first ""Good morning"" I can truly say.  Only 300 mg dosage.  Thrilled. My previous doctor tried other medications, always an epic failure.  My new doctor listened to my ""story"", paid attention, and believed me when I brought up my Fibromyalgia."""
Anxiety,10,"""I am 43. I started taking Gabapentin for neuropathy in my feet, 500mg a day. It really took the tingly pain away. When I was diagnosed with prostate cancer last year, I stopped it, since I was on so many painkillers I didn't think I needed it. Then I began to experience severe anxiety and hopelessness, racing negative thoughts, I didn't know what to do. I had heard that Gabapentin helped with anxiety, so I went back on it, and it is INCREDIBLE! at 600mg a day, I feel calm, chatty, and able to live in the moment. I'm a little clumsy, but I am SO grateful that Gabapentin has this mood stabilizing effect on me, and it worked the first day back on it. Now I can just live my life without anxiety, and I can take less narcotics now too, yet feel even better!"""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""I have a rare disorder: MALS (median arcuate ligament syndrome). Eating has been excruciatingly painful, and I have lost 30 pounds within the past five months. I was started on gabapentin, and the pain is now tolerable enough to keep enough down to have gained around ten pounds back. I honestly do not know what I would do without this medication. I also do not have the sleepiness that is warned with as a side effect, which is a big perk."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have had anxiety disorder with some symptoms of OCD for most of my life. This medicine works wonders. I feel so much more calmer with it. I feel a little slow after taking it but when you have high anxiety your ""slow"" may be the average persons ""normal"". It is certainly worth a shot. I am a 250lb man and I only take 300mg with great results. Never tried a higher dosage yet."""
Anxiety,10,"""In 2012, I was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder from trauma from 9-11-01 events in New York City. I had lived with PTSD for over 10 years unknowingly. Two different doctors put me on anti-depressants because I did not sleep well. All 3 (Zoloft, Amitriptyline, and Trazodone) worsened my mood. I did not have clinical depression; i.e., did not have trouble getting out of bed. A third doctor prescribed gabapentin. I am less reactive, feel more social, and generally more happy. Also, if I wait to take a dose, I can feel the onset of anxiety, unlike in the last 12 years, which is helpful for practicing sensory emotional regulation. With the ability to feel when anxiety sets, I can practice the technique. I hope to be off medication soon."""

Anxiety,10,"""This is my miracle. I was put on it in Germany and had to go off it until I had insurance again. I suffer from depression and anxiety. Often I would find myself stuck in a daydream world because of all the things going on in my life, including my partner of years (15-25). I would have no energy and just feel so low. Finally I had insurance and was put on 1800mg a day. I feel so much better. I feel like I can handle life and set goals for myself. I don't feel anxiety. I don't sit here and think of the negative and focus on a positive life. I am more fun and interactive with my son. 

It literately saved my life. I don't know why."""

I went to so many doctors, went through so many scans, and tests that I actually learned to read MRI sheets before I was a teenager. Apparently there's nothing physically wrong. So I went to PT, and chiropractors and they only helped a bit. 

At 14 I was old enough to start taking the harsher pills. Most turned me into a zombie. And I've only stuck with two in the end.

I have just started having hand joint pains, and possible carpal tunnel, so I was put on a very high dose of Gabapentin. Two days later, headaches were gone. No rhyme or reason. Poof. It makes zero sense, but it's a miracle drug. 100/10 would refer to anyone"""

I also have intense shooting pains in my legs, wrists and sometimes back. I was having to take Vicodin. The Dr started me on 300mg 1/day and to increase by 300 mg every week for the next 3 weeks. When I first took it I got extremely ill with severe nausea, vertigo, dizziness. I stuck it out and every time I went up on the dose it would take 3 days to feel better. It paid off. It gave me a lot of life back. I stopped limping, I stopped having shooting pains. My numb areas got smaller. As a plus, I have dealt with migraines for 25 yrs and they're better. Also off Vicodin! Give it a month to really feel better!"""

After having become fed up with the excruciating whole-body pains I've suffered for the past two years, my research landed on gabapentin as an effective treatment for fibro. I spoke to my doctor, and now having worked up to 600mg, x3/day, I can say gabapentin WORKS!!

As for a back story for the medicines I've tried: all SSRIs, two MAOIs, and one tricyclic antidepressants to try to calm the anxiety and bad dreams, all did nothing but either make me a zombie or made me suicidal with severe panic attacks.  Now on to benzodiazepines:  Xanax, Kolonopin, and Valium, the first and last were not strong enough for me and being a 5'6"" and 110lb woman, I could not get an increase in dosage because I was too small for that.  I was also on Buspar which did nothing but make me have fits of rage and very severe panic attacks.

IMMEDIATELY they took affect and have been an absolutely blessing for about 8 months.... HOWEVER... I have just started to get the night sweats again but not as bad as before. I have been taking 300mg every morning all this time. I was hoping to drop the dosage to 100 mg just because I want to take a little meds as possible.

Within a few days I noticed that I was able to return to daily activities again like laundry, cooking, and playing with my kids and the family pets. My mood and outlook on life has dramatically improved. Still occasional aches but nothing like before, and only occasional Lortab for extreme days. Gabapentin gave me back my life."""

I had severe leg pain and the sciatica pain was very intense. The doctor prescribed gabapentin for residual nerve pain in my left foot. Without gabapentin my foot feels like its on fire but I also discovered how different I was beginning to feel with my depression and anxiety....I felt alive for the first time in decades. I kid you not, it is a wonderful and my doctor has been recording my progress on it with my depression and anxiety. Great medicine."""

After several nightmare drug trials including Geodon, Tegretol, Lithium, Seroquel, and Zyprexa and more... I will never again stray from this medication.  The ones in the list that did help caused horrific side effects mostly being a feeling like restless leg syndrome (except with Seroquel it was all over my body), and with Lithium I have never wanted to commit suicide as strongly as I did on the two times I attempted that medication.

I started at 100mg 3x a day and have now settled into a very comfortable 300mg 3x a day. A little drowsiness at first but my body has adjusted and now I feel no side-effects at all.

Migraine,10,"""My neurologist prescribed me this drug at 600mg at night for my chronic, daily migraines and it is quite literally, a god send. It helms with migraine prevention, anxiety, and even helped with my chronic pelvic pain before my hysterectomy! Taken w/ my 100mg of Topamax, I get maybe one or two migraines a MONTH! I used to have DAILY migraines that required Toradol and Phenergan injections to kill. I will say the only downside was that I gained a pound or two but nothing exercise can't squash. Overall, GREAT drug. Highly recommended if you suffer from chronic migraines!!"""

Since starting on neurontin I have only had to take Xanax 1 time, I am not in chronic pain any longer.  This medication has changed my life in so many ways.

Hot Flashes,10,"""This has been a game changer for me. You are told by so many women, the horror stories of menopause, but until you go through it, you don't really understand how bad it can get.

I have not experienced any negative side effects from the gabapentin; please note that the recommended dosage is 300 mg and I have been able to control my side effects with 200 mg. 

If you are suffering from the side effects of menopause, I would highly suggest that you ask your doctor if this is a drug that you would be eligible to take, taking in consideration any other conditions you have or medications you are taking."""

It is now October 2014 and I am still taking it. My doctor recently increased my dosage to 1200mg daily (600mg 2x daily), due to rheumatoid arthritis symptoms in my hands. This medicine is amazing!

Anxiety,10,"""I am a recovering drug addict suffering from severe anxiety. My drug of choice was benzos so clearly I cannot be prescribed those (or any other narcotics). While I was in rehab I was prescribed gabapentin, 300 mg pill three times a day. I was convinced that it wouldn't work because it was a non narcotic but this drug has helped me so much, I feel like I have complete control over my anxiety. However when I miss A dose or two in a day I do have withdrawal symptoms.. as long as I take it as prescribed I feel amazing with almost no side effects."""
Hot Flashes,10,"""I am on many medications for early menopause. I am 43 years old. I was put on gabapentin 1800mg a day and WOW what a difference. I went from 20-40 hot flashes down to 3-4. I am very happy as well. My mood is better and I feel like I have more energy. I recommend this medication. I am an RN."""
Migraine,10,"""I have tried everything to control my atypical migraines. My migraines are severe and mimic transient ischemic attacks. I was diagnosed at age 14 years old. I am now 28 years old and an ER nurse. I have to be able to function as my job is very demanding. I take a low dose of Topamax 25mg daily and when I get an aura I take Motrin 800mg and 300mg Neurontin. In about 30mins I am able to function again. I love this."""
,10,"""I use to be addicted to xanax even though my first doctor in NC told me the drug was not addicted. I have gone from taking 3mg of xanax to almost not taking the drug at all.  I can focus much better and the sleep is unbelievable. A dreamlike state.  I sometimes sleep through my first alarm,  but eventually wake up.  At first I feel groggy, but after a shower I feel great. I feel like with any other drug your body builds up a tolerance and my doctor has gradually increases my dosage. This is a wonder drug for me.  I wish I would have known about it before getting addicted to xanax. The blurred vision eventually goes away."""
Alcohol Withdrawal,10,"""UPDATE.  I am still on gabapentin.  Dose is 600mg three times a day - total 1800mg in a 24 hour period.  I had not had a drink ""craving"" since August 11, 2014 when I quit. (I did this within one week of starting gabapentin).  I did have a glass of wine at Christmas, one beer on my birthday, and one glass of wine at Easter.  That's it.   I use to have 10 beers a day, and three glasses of wine or gin for bad panic attacks and generalized anxiety.  So for me (not everyone) I can have that occasional drink with friends, at party or any social event - then come home and not touch the stuff and WITHOUT ANY CRAVINGS AT ALL -  as I had during my 40-year binge.  Still, this drug is amazing. AA never worked for me."""
Anxiety,10,"""I've been taking Gabapentin for three years to relieve my anxiety symptoms; 1800mg twice daily. Although I started at a much smaller dose in the beginning and did feel groggy at times my body is now completely accustomed to it. This is the only medication I have tried that allows me to function normally on a daily basis without feeling side effects. I highly recommend it to patients with GAD who don't respond to other medications."""
Migraine,10,"""I tried Imitrex, Fioricet, propanolol all to no avail and then my doctor prescribed me gabapentin 300mg a night. It helped with my sleep and more importantly helped with migraines.

Hot Flashes,10,"""I have been having hot flushes day and night for 16 years 1 every 2 hours i live in Spain and cannot sit in the sun as when I get a hot flush I nearly pass out.

Neuropathic Pain,10,"""I've been taking Gabapentin for neuropathy in my left knee due to a 7.62mm round blew up my knee in combat. It works great. I also take MS Contin 100 mg. in order for me to have enough comfort for a bulging disc in my neck due to a roll over Humm-Vee. If I was not wearing my kevlar it could have been much worse. Probably be a quadriplegic. I'm also suffering from Bipolar I, GAD,SAD, PTSD & Panic Disorder. So on top of pain meds and a lot of psych meds. This dose of 900mg. b.i.d. has helped tremendously. I need to try some Lyrica a.k.a. ""super gabapentin""."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,10,"""I have been suffering from Restless legs syndrome for several years, sometimes very pronounced and frustrating.

That's right, totally. Nada, nunca, none.
I has been two weeks now and I can only pray that this continues."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""This medicine works so well for my bipolar disorder! I've tried so many other medications to no avail. Finally, a doctor put me on this (300mg x 3 times daily) & now I'm up to 600mg three times daily (1800mg daily). It works wonders! I have virtually no anxiety  (I used to wake up & could literally feel the anxiety set in before this medicine) & helps with pain as well. My doc put me on Buproprion 100mg twice a day also. In conjunction these seem to really work for me. All in all, I highly recommend Gabapentin!"""

Fibromyalgia,10,"""Gabapentin has saved my life.  I am able to function now.  Dealing with  Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and fibromyalgia for the past 20 years has been a challenge, not to mention the pain. I felt like I was a guinea pig, trying all the medicines out there and being allergic to most of them while the others didn't come close to working.  But with the gabapentin, I was so tired but after a while that went away. I wanted to up the dosage but my doctor did it very slowly.  Even though I am not 100% pain free at this time, I can function and be happy.  I will always have this medicine with me so I will never miss a dose."""
Anxiety,10,"""I was prescribed gabapintin for ongoing depression, ptsd, & nerve disruption from disease treatment.

Migraine,10,"""I started having migraine headaches when I was 14.  The first time I had one, I was sitting in Biology class and could not see the faces of other students around me.  I was terrified and had a panic attack.  The school nurse thought I was on drugs and called my mother who immediately took me to a doctor.  The migraines continued through out my life and caused me difficulty in my employment.  I am a solo practitioner lawyer.  When I would get one in court, I could not see, speak or think.  Obviously, I had migraines with an aura. My family doctor only treated the pain, but finally I went to a psychiatrist and he prescribed Gabapentin and Lexapro.  My migraines stopped completely.  It has been seven months now and I am migraine free."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I have severe fibromyalgia, severe Crohn's Disease and other conditions associated with these. I've taken pain medicines and Lyrica with little help. I was put on 600 mg of Gabapentin and the results were fantastic. Helped my Crohn's and arthritis also. Very happy."""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""I started on 100 mg at night for about 1 week. Then increased to 300, 600 and finally in about a month I was up to 1200 mgs a day in increments of three. For the first 6 weeks you are tired but it's worth it, as soon as it kicks in your pain is gone! I feel a little loopy somedays and I forget a lot of things but my arthritis and bulging disks are pain free and I can live a great life. I dread getting off of it though. It's going to be hell. If I ever run out its bad diarrhea. And anxiety. Don't run out or take more than your prescribed. Gab is a great drug for nerve pain. And I have no anxiety."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""Extreme peripheral neuropathy in both legs from knee down. Without drug I have extreme burning sensation and muscle cramps in those areas. I had been on 60 mg. Methadone for about 20 years for joint and muscle pain. When I first took Gabapentin I got side effects of extreme nausea, headaches, and general around  not feeling well so I stopped taking the Gabapentin. A new doctor insisted I stopped taking the Methadone pending an electric neural stimulator insertions to my spine. I detoxed from the Methadone at 5 mg. a week and after twelve weeks I was off it.  When I started taking the Gabapentin it worked superbly, problems reduced about 90-95%. Shift to 40-50 mg. Percocet per day took care of joint/muscle pain about as well as Methadone."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""For a long time I have believed that I was bipolar but never took medicine for it. A couple years ago I started taking gabapentin for a herniated disk. I immediately noticed a feel good feeling. That is now the main reason I continue to take it.  

People are warned to not stop taking this abruptly..THEY MEAN IT! I recently had surgery to remove my fibroids and I stopped taking gabapentin due to all the other medicines I was having to take. Shortly after stopping abruptly my husband said something to me I didn't like that hurt my feelings and I THREW A PLATE OF FOOD AT HIM! I have never in my life done this. Afterwards I found out that anxiety is also a symptom of abruptly stopping meds. Make sure to wean off slowly."""
Pain,10,"""I had surgery about 4 years ago on my ankle, and have had nerve damage since then.  I was diagnosed with Complex regional Pain Syndrome recently and put on gabapentin for it, my nerve pain is gone, and as a side effect my sleep has returned to normal.  I have found that if I don't take it with some sort of food, that it makes me pretty non-functional.  All in all I would say this has done wonders for my pain, and I use tramadol for the break through pain.  I have lived with pain for years, and this made me pain free in about 4 days time.  Wonderful drug.  I was on 300mg/day for the first 3 days, taken at bed time, then went to 600mg/day taken at bed time.  No negative side effects, just ones that are actually positive."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have been taking gabapentin for about a week now and it has literally saved my life!  I was having such incredible nervous energy that was affecting my sleep, relationships, daily routine, etc. I was having a meltdown everyday with lots of physical pain (mostly stomach).

I smiled this morning when I woke up for the first time in years!"""

I am meds-resistant to ALL other mood stabilizers & antidepressants. I have TRIED ALL of them. I have always had issues with medications not working, but psychotropics are the WORST. I would write more, but there isn't enough space. I also have tic doloureaux, lucky me. For this, I was given neurontin. My side effect? I was brought nearly back to life. I have no words for the depth of my gratitude."""

Bipolar Disorder,10,"""After years of battling depression, ADHD, PTSD, and serve anxiety my Dr. put me on gabapentin. I was recently diagnosed with mixed bipolar disorder. I have been struggling over 15 years now with Dr.'s trying me on all kinds of meds. I take Paxil, Klonopin, and clonodine, along with the gabapentin that they just increased to help with my ADHD. I don't want to say it's a miracle med., but I see the difference already. My thoughts are more clear, and it helps me concentrate better than I ever had. I wish one of the many Dr.'s over the years could have actually picked up on my current diagnosis, but at least I feel better now and can focus on my therapy to learn better coping skills during this process."""
Hot Flashes,10,"""I am in my 6th year of severe hot flashes.  I had a least 20 during the day and one every 15 minutes at night.  I couldn't take estrogen because the risk of stroke.  I tried herbal remedies, Paxil and lexapro.  While on lexapro I had anxiety stacks and severe depression for 3 months being on lexapro for 2 weeks.  It messed with my brain.  I regret taking that and was very frustrated nothing could help hot flashes.  I did some searching on goggle and found gabapentin.  This is a Godsend!  My first night taking it my hot flashes diminished totally.  I take 300mgx2.  One in the morning and one at night.  If I do get a hot flash it last about 10 seconds and very minimal.  I would recommend gabapentin in place of ERT.  """

Increased to 3*300mg to which I reacted well until general anaesthetic in dec 2015 for operation threw me into a deep depression. Any info on effect of anaesthetic on depression and any antidote?"""
Anxiety,10,"""I started 300mg 2x daily for depression and anxiety last Wednesday. All I can say is wow. This stuff is great. I'm back to jogging and daily activities along with my outpatient therapy.

My doctor is weening me off Valium but I really don't need it but says I have to take it as I ate my whole months script of 60 in 5 days so I'll do what she says. My thoughts and prayers are with all who suffer and if possible give this a try."""
Anxiety,10,"""I was prescribed this for nerve pain in neck and back. It has helped with the pain but the unexpected mood enhancement side affect has been very welcome. I didn't realise how much of my time was taken up with negative thoughts and mild depression. I am much more focused and positive. It's like aspects of my personality that had been wittled away by the rigours of daily life have returned. I am also a  performer and have found it very calming.
After experimenting with dosages and working out the trade off between pain relif and drowsiness I found a level. 
My only side affect which I haven't noticed anyone mentioning in the reviews is that I pee more often. But I'm so laid back these days that it doesn't matter lol."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I've been taking gabapentin for 12 years. I used to have feelings of major irritation and maybe a little paranoia. An example of something that used to happen before i took these was i would be at work, flipping out thinking my mom and my boyfriend(at that time he was painting my parents house) were messing around. Which would NEVER EVER happen. Not only was our son there but so was my father lol. They also kind of disliked him. Point is when I started the gabapentin I laughed at the thought so hard cause it was so ridiculous, I still laugh at the foolishness of it. So i take them every 5 hours and if I had forgotten them my mom or my friend would notice because I would be sooooo irritable. They would be scared to remind me."""
Postherpetic Neuralgia,10,"""Originally prescribed this for post herpetic neuralgia.

I have issues right now with my short term memory and there will be times when I forget to take it and my brain reminds me! Within 20 minutes or less of taking it I am human again. It's a blessing!

Having to keep upping the doses because they stop working and not to mention the serious constipation that comes with these meds. So i woke up today and decided to only take the Gabapentin..all at once (that would be 2400mg). OMG..i am not in pain, my mood is so incredibly happy and my anxiety is also gone.

Anxiety,10,"""I have to agree with so many people who have given positive reviews  for gabapentin. I take 300 mg four times daily, and I am living in peace and can live comfortably in my skin for the first time in my life. I am much more productive, happy, and things just roll off my back that usually would cause me great anger or disruption. I noticed that I sleep better too. What I  like is that this medication does not drug me up the way so many other medicines that I've tried for anxiety have done. I also take it for severe lower back pain, and it helps a great deal as well. I recommend this to anybody who is thinking of trying it."""

Then, when in my 40's, after having migraines for over 25 years, I was put on Neurontin, not for migraines, but as a mood stabilizer. Miraculously, my migraines stopped completely.

I have energy to get things done, and it makes the stiffness I feel in my muscles relax more to ease the pain. I have gained a little weight on this medicine, but when the warmer weather hits, I am going to try and get outside and get some exercise.

So far, fingers crossed, no side effects except feeling very tired and a little 'spaced' out. Recommend this to anyone."""
Migraine,10,"""I was suffering for a week, with my 1st migraine attack. It was going on and on, for days, on the right side of my head. NOTHING helped. I took 400mg and 4 hours later took another 400mg and I did not need any Ambien to get to sleep. By morning, most of my pain was gone. I couldn't it. Now I am up and feel great. It's amazing, please ask your doctor to try this."""
Anxiety,10,"""Started Gaba on 8-7-16. I take 900 mg daily (split my dosage.) Remember, Gaba is an off label used for Anxiety & you can't blame it if it doesn't work for anxiety (I find negative reviews for gaba unfair on this site.) I take Prozac 40 mg; but I still have light anxiety, panicky feeling, nausea & mental agitation. I have to use 4 or 5 mg Valium prn to smooth out Prozac can't fix at times. I suggested trying Gaba w/ my psyche; he agreed. 300 mg first wk, 2nd wk 600, & 3rd wk 900. Gaba added has been effective for anxiety. I feel less anxious & mental agitation reduced.At first, Gaba will make you drowsy & weak. My memory is slightly off but if I really focus I am fine.You might feel shaky at the start. Some bad days, be vigorous. Be positive"""
Hot Flashes,10,"""I was having bad hot flashes and I was taking estrogen, it helps but not much, I did some research, hot flashes are neurological, that's why they work so well! I'm so happy with how they work for me, I hope all women can be helped by this medicine. I Don't take that new medicine called brisdelle it's basically just a 8mg Paxil. neurontin helps with my pain and anxiety also, do research you'll be surprised what meds could help besides estrogen."""
Insomnia,10,"""I have suffered with insomnia for years and no medications improved my condition until I started using Gabapentin. I have been taking it for 7 days and my quality of sleep has greatly improved. I used to wake up 3-4 times per night and found it hard to fall back asleep. Gabapentin puts me to sleep and I am enjoying deeper, more restful REM stages. I highly recommend it for this condition. I was prescribed this for chronic pain and this is a great bonus. Like the other reviewer it will cause residual grogginess the next day for several hours. Extra caffeine is definitely needed!"""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""Neurontin has helped me be able to live a more normal life by cutting my pain levels significantly and allowing me to require less pain meds."""
Pain,10,"""After taking the medicine the first day, The pain in both of my feet has almost disappeared. I have not felt this good since I use to dance back in the year 2000, I'm on my feet all day at my job and I can now move faster without the pain. Thanks for Gabapentin my life is more enjoyable and I look forward to take walks with my wife again"""
Epilepsy,10,"""Has controlled my seizures, in conjunction with Tegretol, for over fifteen years, seizure free."""
Insomnia,10,"""A TRIPLE-CROWN WINNER! First, this wonder drug eliminated my chronic migraines. Second, it has done wonders for mild insomnia.  By ""mild"" I mean go to sleep fast, but wake up in a couple of hours staring at the ceiling. This cycle repeats several times a night. Gabapentin eliminated that problem. Now with only 200 mg before bedtime, I sleep all the way through the night! It also has the added benefit of helping nerve pain in my neck. I take Gab with prescription Advil  (for arthritis in neck) when the pain is at a high level and the combo really helps bring down the intensity of the pain to a manageable level.
Added bonus? Absolutely NO side effects. :)"""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I have suffered silently with bi polar 2 ADHD and PTSD for about 15 years. After debilitating depression and anxiety I finally went to get help. I am only on my 4th day with 300mg 3x daily but the difference in my life is HUGE! I actually sleep at night which is so rare, and my days are spent enjoying my kids instead of sitting on the couch all day. I have had so little anxiety, I forgot what it has felt like to not constantly have a feeling of dread. It is incredible. I do hope that this is a forever feeling! The total for this medication was $93.98 my out of pocket after my insurance was $7.00"""
Trigeminal Neuralgia,10,"""All branches of the Trigeminal firing with chewing, talking, brushing teeth, etc.  Neurontin works wonders. I'm taking 400 mg every 3 to 4 hrs...with relief after 3 doses. HAVE TO TAKE IT REGULARLY. Have taken even higher dose when I had very painful bouts (for 10 yrs) and also had glossopharngeal (9th nerve) neuralgia. Breathe and exercise to keep centered and balanced. No bad side effects like many other medicines I've tried. """
Hot Flashes,10,"""After surgical menopause kicked in, I experienced severe and debilitating hot flashes. Upon speaking to my PCM, I was prescribed gabapentin. I took it at night, so I had a restful nights sleep. I no longer had the hot flashes during the day either, so happy! However, I saw my GYN to discuss other possibilities; estidol was choice at that time. Unfortunately the hot flashes started back up as soon as I stopped taking the gabapentin. I tried to stay with the hormone, but after a month of sleepless nights and severe hot flashes, I gave up! My choice most definitely is the gabapentin, no question about it!!!!"""
Anxiety,10,"""I love this medicine. I used to get incredibly anxious at night - NOTHING could help me. My doctor prescribed this and the FIRST night I felt better. My mind was not cycling through ""scary"" thoughts that used to plague me. I was able to rationalize much easier. I'm just so glad to finally have something that helps."""
Postherpetic Neuralgia,10,"""Ive been on gabapentin 900mg 3 times a day for a month for the shingles . It does help calm down the nerve pain but it makes me tired. You just have to force yourself to keep physically active. If you are age 50 or older and had chicken pox when you were young i HIGHLY recommend that you get the immunization shot. Im into the tenth week with the shingles. Im going to miss almost the entire deer hunting season because of the way i feel. Since ive been on gabapentin i feel better though."""
Pain,10,"""The only thing that has helped my pain."""
Anxiety,10,"""Gabapentin has been a miracle drug for me! I first started it 3 years ago for restless leg syndrome (which felt like painful electric shocks deep inside my legs.) It worked perfectly. I took 300 mg an hour before bed. About a year ago, I started having hot flashes (I'm 52) Instead of HRT, my doctor increased my dose to 600 mg a day, in divided doses, and my hot flashes are much better. Then, 6 months ago, I became the target of a bully in the workplace and my anxiety soared! I found it nearly impossible to concentrate and it was increasingly difficult to function at all! After increasing my dose to 600 mg three times a day, I am able to breeze through my work day and I'm no longer intimidated by the bully!  """

Neuropathic Pain,10,"""Nerve damage to my back occurred as a result of car accident. Nerve misfiring occurred. Electrical stabs of pain of varying degrees occurred randomly throughout my body. When falling asleep, electrical activity picked up such that I had to restrain my arms and legs and head. It took 3500mg/day to suppress the pain. No side effects. I sold my car and walked for years as my body gradually healed and the dosage required dropped eventually to zero. A second type of nerve pain coexisted that Neurontin did not touch, a burning pain that occurred all over my body. By chance (thx Docs) I discovered that Valium works very well in suppressing this type of nerve pain. Also might try a combo of Neurontin and med marijuana and walking."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I started taking Neurontin for fibromyalgia pain about 2 weeks ago. It has made such a huge difference in my life already! I have energy now and I am actually sleeping regularly, first time in over 3 years. The only side effect I am experiencing is clumsiness. I keep dropping everything and tripping. But, I think that's a small price to pay for relief!"""
Anxiety,10,"""I take 900mg every night night for social and generalized anxiety and 100mg several times per day as needed for breakthrough panic attacks--which isn't very often. I had been prescribed several different SSRIs before for my social anxiety, none of which worked, but Gabapentin was like a miracle for me. It was almost as if someone flipped a switch in my head when I started taking it."""
Anxiety,10,"""After decades of battling post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, I finally have found a medication that helps to calm the revved feeling I constantly battle.  It is not complete gone, but I feel as if I can breathe again.  The tightness in my chest has reduced and my upper back no longer hurts because I can relax my shoulders.  It is as if someone has loosened their grip on a rubber band!  Best of all, self-help techniques, like relaxation, now work!!  Gabapentin has helped me to feel like I have a fighting chance against anxiety."""
Insomnia,10,"""Just started Neurontin 2 days ago. Dose is 200mg. It has worked wonders for me."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""Pretty much saved my life. 13 years ago fibromyalgia symptoms (severe pain especially legs and shoulders), started. My father was taking high doses of gabapentin for chronic guillaune barre. He urged me to try it--and it was the first real sleep I had in months!
My rheumatologist had me on 1600mg. 3x, gradually lowered to 1600 mg. 2x.
Studies at Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins show very few (and very mild) side effects, even at high doses.
The only problem I have is if I forget to take them. Then I get flu like symptoms.
I was able to continue my career (elementary school teacher) with no problems. Retired this year age 66 and very active.
BTW my memory seems better than most friends my age."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I love gabapentin, I take 2, 300mg capsules 3 times a day. I have neuropathy, lupus, raynauds, and rheumatoid arthritis. It has helped me so much, I've been able to move around easier and it helps so much with my neutrality and ra pain."""

I've backed down from my 3x day 600mg dosage over the yrs to a 2x 300 mg. with good affect.  Recently at age 72 I had a stroke which left me with aphasia and apraxia.  My body was relatively unaffected, but my speech is a big problem.  Neurologist suggested slowly coming off Gabapentin. I gradually skipped a dose now and again to get to the point of no Gabapentin.   Shooting hot pain returned in my temple and down the right side of my face.  Back on Gabapentin.  This was a good reminder to me as to how much misery Gabapentin was protecting me from. Love Gabapentin!"""
Occipital Neuralgia,10,"""I delivered packages for 32 years. 6 years ago I had such horrible neck pain and the dr did an xray and said bone spurs and take up to 16 ibuprofen a day and stretch.

I retired early because of this, then three weeks ago, slurred speech, dizziness, headache and finally went to a neurologist, he put me on gabapentin, and after 3 days, little pain, I am now on three times a day and ZERO pain pills.....zero for the first time in 6 years!!!

Anxiety,10,"""Gabapentin is the most liberating medicine I have ever used. I have tried Effexor, Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Lamictal, Lithium, Phenibut, Kava, Theanine, -anything with implications of anxiolytic properties. Finding the right dosage can be a little tricky, but when that is tuned, this medication seems superior to any anxiety medication available.  Side effects of too much- dizziness, fatigue.  """
Anxiety,10,"""I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (Before my traumatic event, I was already an anxious person). Neurontin calms me like Klonopin, but helps me focus instead of sedating me. I take 300mg 4x a day, so it doesn't make me tired. It makes me very talkative, which is strange. I talk to random people sometimes, which is unlike me. """

Hot Flashes,10,"""Took it for the first time last night--300 mg. First night in months I have not had hot flashes and slept pretty well. My sister has taken it for years with the same result. I had a hysterectomy at age 60--just 6 weeks ago and hot flashes at night became unbearable."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I've always been an anxious person who stays in a state of mania and the drops into depression. This medication is basically a miracle. It works immediately and I've been taking it for 3 months now with virtually no side effects. I don't have racing thoughts any more and my heart doesn't race a mile a minute. I have reacted to stressful situations a lot more rationally and calmly than I ever have in my life. I am also just starting to take Lamicatal. I believe the combinations is really effective. I also sleep so well and don't feel groggy in the morning! Really give it a shot."""
Alcohol Withdrawal,10,"""I have had quite a few severe alcoholic relapses, and Neurontin is wonderful for me for stopping alcohol withdrawal shakes, which seems to tone down the anxiety. It works quickly too for that purpose."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I was prescribed Gabapentin for peripheral neuropathy in my feet from type II diabetes. It was bad enough that I didn't even like a bed sheets touching my toes at night. I started on 300mg taking one in the morning, one in the evening and two at bedtime.

I was constantly dreading things and felt guilty for no reason. My anxiety bothered me to the point it made me vomit. I started on 300mg 2x a day and it has been amazing.

Pain,10,"""I was diagnosed with neck hernia on c5/c6 with arthritis and Gabapentin (paired with Physical Therapy exercises   foam roller) truly helped out. The one interesting thing about Gabapentin is that it somehow knocked out my anxiety as well. It was real nice to be able to take a medicine which left me with no side effects but also improved on another condition.

I found out that taking Gabapentin with soda (I use Ginger-Ale) actually helps absorb it better than taking it with water. My dosage was 3600mg per day. 

It's worth mentioning that you probably shouldn't drive when you take Gabapentin. Every human is different so try it out, see what works for you. This medicine has the ability to make things appear more 'vivid' while enhancing music/sound as well."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have had panic attacks since I was four, I am 33 now. I was an alcoholic four 10 years cause I was on a high dose of Xanax and I got hooked then my doctor put me on Klonopin because it is a longer lasting medicine.

Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I have neuropathic pain, seizures and bipolar disorder all which can be treated by Gabapentin.  At first it seemed like I wasn't taking anything but after getting on 3600mg/day it has really improved my life.  My pain is tolerable, the simple-partial seizures are well managed and I am calm all the time.  It took a large dose to work for me but I am glad I tried it.  My only complaint is that if I stand up quickly I get dizzy.  But relative to everything else I don't mind."""
Anxiety,10,"""I was started on Neurontin for hot flashes. I am also diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Not only are my hot flashes gone but so is my anxiety!

Numbness and tingling in arms reduced by 70%, sciatica pain gone and as a bonus, the sedating effects are incredibly effective for my anxiety. Also has improved the quality and quantity of my sleep. The biggest side effect which if gets worst I will discontinue gabapentin is the weight gain. I gained 15 pounds in 8 weeks. Slight blurry vision. Great medicine overall with some mitigating side effects."""

I have been sleeping better, my moods are much better, my ""splitting"" has even gotten better. It is definitely making me less depressed, too. I recommend this medicine for anyone with these symptoms or other mental conditions. My thigh has varicose veins and that has gotten better which is a bonus because I'm not taking it for pain. I really think this drug needs to be approved for Bipolar disorder (though I don't have it) and Borderline Personality Disorder. I hope I never have to quit taking it."""
Anxiety,10,"""I've  even taking gabapentin for three years. From the get-go I have felt the benefits of this medicine. I usually take 300mg morning and evening.

Now, I go to the gym, play with my son more, preform better at work, and all my relationships are much better. I can actually think to communicate. Also, I don't go from 0 to 60 in 2 seconds anymore. I'm like ""I got this. Just breathe"" I can't even make myself anxious anymore. I've tried. I am on 3000mg a day of Gabapentin (5-600mg pills a day) and 600mg of Lithium (2-300mg pills a day).

I've tried, since I was 15; I'm now 22, Xanax,Lorazapam,Clonazapam and Valium to the point where I wouldnt know how many I was taking a day. NOTHING helped!! I had a different doctor see me and her first choice was Gabapentin 300mg, 1 capsule 3 times a day. And thats where the miracle began! My life was changed.

At fifty my wife divorced me throwing me into a ten year spin of uncontrollable anxiety. After trying almost every pill made, I tried Gabapentin after one morning and one at lunch.

I have suffered with lower back disc pain for about 30 years but I lived with it, I spent a crazy amount of money on physical therapy, chiropractors, and doctors with zero results. I finally was referred to a surgeon in Feb. of this year and told I have 3 herniated discs that would require surgery in July to repair them with metal ones. At that time I was put on 2 x 10mg of Percocets every 4 to 6 hours.  After 4 months I ended up in the E.R in excruciating pain. Dr. put me on gabapentin 2 times a day, I'm on day 6 and I'm pain free! Dry mouth is only side effect and slight dizziness, and down to 1 Percocet a day!"""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""Gabapentin has been amazing for me! I have been battling bi polar my whole life. I am 50 now and have been on several antidepressants for the last 5 years. Nothing really helped. 

For the last couple years, I would wake up crying for no reason and not wanting to get out of bed.  

The last time I went to see my doc she asked me if bi polar ran in my family. I told her I wasn't sure but though there might be. 

She put me on 300 mg. The first morning I woke up after taking the med, it had an overnight result! I did NOT cry and was able to get out of bed easier. I was amazed that my life changed so much in one day! 

I highly recommend anyone suffering from bi polar to try this med."""

But there is no denying I have peripheral neuropathy, and taking Gabapentin has given me wonderful relief from pain and tingling in both feet.

However, still having sleep issues. She sent me to a neurologist and she changed how I take it, kept the dosage. Now, I take 200mg at noon, and 400mg two hours before I go to sleep. What a difference it made. And it still helps with pain management as it was originally prescribed. Due soon for an increase. It helped reduce my opioid dosage."""
Cough,10,"""I have severe all over body pain. I asked my doctor for Lyrica, but my insurance wouldn't cover it so doctor substituted gabapentin. I have only taken it for 3 days 300mg a day. It has certainly helped the pain, but I have a terrible cough so bad that my sides are sore and I have a restless feeling. I will continue on it because anything is better than the pain."""
Pain,10,"""I spent almost three years dealing with unbearable tingling and burning around my shoulder blade until I just couldn't take it anymore. My GP prescribed me Gabapentin in the hopes that it would put a stop to it, and it did. It took less than a week for me to feel total relief. I'm not saying it's a wonder drug that will work for everyone, but in my case, it's been a lifesaver."""
Benign Essential Tremor,10,"""I am a 45yr old African American female who has had Essential Tremor since birth. I have tried numerous drugs over the years but found Valium to be my medication to control the tremors until I was prescribed Neurontin and Inderal [for my high blood pressure] about two weeks ago. Neurontin was TOTALLY successful in controlling my hand and body tremors. I was able to carry a large drink that didn't have a lid around with me at a concert this weekend without SPILLING IT and I am SO HAPPY that I was prescribed this medicine. I've heard of it during the last couple of years but finally tried it out. Valium wasn't as effective. Now I will feel so much more confident when I go to my boyfriends family's Thanksgiving dinner...So happy."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,10,"""I have been taking Tramadol for RLS for three years. It worked absolutely wonderfully, and any time I ran out or stopped for some reason, I had no withdrawal symptoms at all. Also, I never felt like I was dependent on it, nor addicted to it. It helps that this is a non-narcotic medication. At the beginning of this year, my doctor added gabapentin 300mg/night. With this combination, I must say, I have never had a more restful night's sleep in my entire life. I wake up refreshed, not groggy at all, and ready to hop right out of bed and take on the day and the world."""
Alcohol Withdrawal,10,"""I've detoxed several times.
The last one was really bad.  This time
My Dr. put me gabapentin 300 mg. 3 times a day and Lithium.
I usually suffer withdrawals for 5-7 days.
I did have anxiety for two days, but I'm on day 3, no anxiety and no cravings."""
Pain,10,"""I have suffered from the pain of arthritis and disc degeneration in my lower back and neck. I also have fibromyalgia.  As if that wasn't enough, I have been recently diagnosed with Bi-polar disorder. This medication has been great for me. I've only been on it for 4 days and already my pain has been greatly reduced. I haven't had to take any Percocet which is great. I have had to take a couple Tylenol. It has also really helped reduce my anxiety and depression. I really hope it keeps working. I take 300 mg about 1 PM and two 300 mg capsules at night. Side effects are minimal. I'm still a bit drowsy in the morning but it's nothing a good cup of coffee won't cure.  It has been a great medication for me."""
Postherpetic Neuralgia,10,"""I had pain in my head with shingles. After taking one pill the pain went away, the next day I went to work for a few hours."""
Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,10,"""I had hip replacement surgery on my left hip in 2011.  Surgery went fine, but I developed RSD in my left foot.  It's a long story, with me thinking I was going to die from the pain, to going to the ER one day, on the advice of the home health nurse that came 3 times a week to my house, to my surgeon sending me to a Pain Management Specialist.  He did a nerve block and most of the burning pain was gone.  He put me on a gradually increasing schedule of Gabapentin, which works very well.  If this awful thing had to happen to me, I'm very grateful that Gabapentin works for me and allows me to function.  I have some days when I'm feeling a bit of burning, but it's not bad.  Most days I'm fine.  I have a brace-dropfoot-but I manage.  Thank God!"""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""Gabapentin has saved my life! Like everyone else I was experiencing a lot of anxiety & wanted something non habit forming and addictive. This makes me feel calm about an hour after taking. No more anxious thoughts & irritation. Wonderful medication I can't stress that enough!"""
Hot Flashes,10,"""After a year of suffering from severe hot flashes, I was prescribed Gabapentin and what a relief.  If I forget to take it, hot flashes resume with a vengeance!  This totally works for me!"""
Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I've taken Neurontin for many years now and I know without it I wouldn't be able to walk.  I know this because I tried not taking it and after 18 hours I was climbing the walls and I was in horrible pain. I'm not exaggerating either.  I've tried Lyrica and it didn't help at all. I'm still in a lot of pain but I know without it the pain would be a lot worse.  I do have a few side effects with it, some confusion and loss of words at times, but I'd rather live with the side effects than the pain I'd have without it."""
Pain,10,"""Because I am a recovering alcoholic it is crucial for me to find non-narcotic treatment for the persevering pain of my chronic pancreatitis. I was feeling a bit hopeless with the repeated prescriptions of pain meds (which of course offer only temporary relief, and for me a danger of over-use), until my GI prescribed me Gabapentin. This med has been incredibly successful in mitigating my pain, while also giving me huge energy (I'm a consistent runner so this factor is welcomed), and allowing me to move forward with my sobriety. I give it four stars, though I realize like anything, it's not for everyone. That said, good luck to you all with finding what works."""
Pain,10,"""I love gabapentin, it works I am no longer in constant pain. """
Anxiety,10,"""I was started on Garbapentin for a herniated cervical disc.  At first I was put on 900 mg, which wasn't really helping so my doctor bumped me up to 1800 mg a day.  I've always been somewhat depressed and anxious... I got a side effect I did not bargain for.  Not only did it help my pain, but my mood has been the best it has in years!  I feel happy!!! Calmer.  I can tell as soon as I miss a dose because my mood changes.  I Hope my doctor lets me take this once my pain is gone.  Usually side effects suck, this medication is not only a pain med but a happy pill."""
Pain,10,"""For 5 years I had severe constant pain from arthritis around my right collar bone pressing nerves. Along that journey, I had a nerve ablation done on my C3-C4-C5 vertebrae that helped a pinched nerve there.   Finally found a pain specialist who put me on Gabapentin   Nortriptyline (usually for depression). Gabapentin alone did nothing.  He convinced me the 25mg Nortriptyline is a tiny dose but works great with the Gabapentin.  He was right.  Immediate relieve.  After surprise surgery for a perforated sm intestine, had to hold off all Rx's while in the hospital. Then started lightening bolts of Siatica nerve pain down right leg. EGAD.  Back home, restarted Gaba and Nortrip - Siatica all better.  Wow!"""
Hot Flashes,10,"""After a tussle with breast cancer I was prescribed tamoxifen and immediately started with the hot flushes.  I was waking at least every hour at night and gradually turning into a sleep deprived wreck when I went to see the doctor.  Initially she prescribed clonidine but that did virtually nothing.  She then tried to give me fluoxitine but I read that you should not take that with tamoxifen so she changed it to gabapentin.  From the first dose I got relief.  I still get the flushes but they are more like gentle warming events than the full on sweating nightmares of before.  It has changed my life.  I wish this was more widely known as the change in the quality of life is so extreme."""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""Frustrated with sciatica, I popped a couple Gabapentin (600mg) to see if relief.  (My family member had them for migraines but never used them)     
Two things became evident after about an hour and a half:  1) the sciatica was still there but pain was vague and I didn't care about it; 2) at my usual Saturday night binge drinking hour - 3PM - I had no desire to drink.    Ever since I discovered this miracle drug I've barely drank, no hangovers, just feel great.  Miracle drug may save my liver, life, and marriage."""
Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,10,"""No such side effects. Take 4 per day, every day."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have been on Neurontin since 1997 (2500 mg) for generalized anxiety. Just fear of doing anything. I think most reading this get it without me going into great detail. Buspar was not helpful. My psychiatrist was reluctant to use benzodiazepiness because of alcohol abuse issues. I am on mood stabilizing medicines, and antidepressants and had been for 7 years before my ""life saving"". It took me three months to believe the anxiety wouldn't return as a 24/365 nightmare. I didn't know how bad it was until it stopped. """
Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I have been taking 300mg of gabapentin 4 weeks ago for moderate neuropathy.  My biggest problem was radiating intense pain from the little toe on my right foot.  Within days, my pain was totally gone.  However, I am constantly very sleepy.  Hopefully that will subside over time."""
Postherpetic Neuralgia,10,"""I experienced severe nerve pain following a second bout of shingles less than 3 months apart. During a 2 year period my doctors tried me on regular Gabapentin in combination with other medications - all with severe side effects and no relief from the constant pain and lack of a good night sleep.  I gained over 50 lbs as well.  My neurologist prescribed Horizant twice a day and my life changed almost over night!  I choose not to take it in combination with anything else other than 800 mg Ibuprofen when needed because concerns of past side effects. Eventhough my nerve pain has continued two years later and another bout of shingles I have been able to manage the pain with Horizant."""
Pain,9.0,"""Since my first Gall Stone attack over a year ago, I have unexplainable diarrhea. I would eat something and within about 15 minutes I would have to use the bathroom in a very urgent way. My doctor could not explain the reason for this. At the same time he was trying to treat me for constant numbness and pain in my leg. He gave me Gabapentin for my leg to see if it would help. Funny enough the leg is the same but the diarrhea rarely happens now. I'm glad this could help that issue at least."""
Fibromyalgia,9.0,"""Gabapentin is the best drug I've tried in the last 10 years after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia.  I have taken Amitriptyline, Cymbalta and Savella. These drugs have made me tired, depressed and even gave me heart palpitations.  I take 1500mg at bedtime along with 100 mg trazodone. When I wake up, I'm alert, have energy and I'm excited about starting my day.  Something that I haven't felt in years.  No side affects so far.  When I first started Gabapentin, I got violently sick...threw up, but after my body got used to it, it's WONDERFUL."""
Migraine,9.0,"""When I first started taking this medication, the neurologist told me to just take it with each meal, that it didn't have to be exactly 8 hours between.  Wrong!  My migraines got worse and I couldn't stand it.  I increased from 100 to 300 mg, every 8 hours (I set the alarm on my phone, even at night), and headaches are gone...for the most part.  I was having migraines 4-5 days per week, and now they are minor intensity and only one every 1-2 weeks.  I have been doing this for a few months now.  This week I noticed my hair thinning, not sure if it is related."""
Fibromyalgia,9.0,"""I started taking the drug with very low expectations and am surprised by how much the Fibro has gone away.  Just gone.  I still have pain but now instead of overwhelming my Doctor with a complaint of ""everything hurts,"" I can point point the actual spots in my body where something is structurally wrong.  What a blessing.  I'm taking 300 mg at night, a dosage that I built up to over the course of a month."""
Pain,9.0,"""Helped lower my daily Lortab usage. Was taking 4-5 10mg daily now only 2-3 a day."""
Postherpetic Neuralgia,9.0,"""I had a cyst removed from my spinal cord, cervical (neck) region; I recovered well, but the cyst had permanently damaged my spinal cord. I was eventually given this drug, Gabapentin, which I take 1800mg per day. The pain and other sensations are not completely taken away, but I can do basic household chores for 20 minutes at a time without feeling too hampered. I can also sleep through the night. Side effects for me (female, 38 years) are slight constipation (handy, as I have double incontinence!) and more fuzziness/clumsiness than usual. I felt dizzy and 'doped-up' at times when I first started taking the meds, but this sort of thing improved over the weeks. I recommend trying this drug if typical strong pain meds haven't worked for you."""
Insomnia,9.0,"""I have idiopathic insomnia as well as sleep apnea. Although the CPAP helps the apnea, I still was waking up every hour or two during the night, never getting a restful night sleep. Then I was prescribed gabapentin for nerve pain and discovered that it also works for my sleep. I wake rested and have much more energy. Apparently GABA helps increase slow wave sleep so I am dreaming more also."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I notice it takes away anxiety but leaves me a little foggy  -It's a great nerve pain reliever for my back"""
Postherpetic Neuralgia,9.0,"""After having shingles (most painful experience I have ever had) the nerve pain came and I didn't know there was help. Went to follow up appointment and they gave me Gabapentin and IT WORKED.  I am still on and will stay on as I feel it is allowing me to live life. I have been out of work after 2 weeks in hospital and the recovery with nerve pain since 8-6-14 returning 11-13-14 and saying prayers I can live normally. Side effects worth the good effects. Remembering a word, stuttering, dizzy, blurred vision I'll take it over the pain any day. I am NOT a medicine person, it is the only medicine I take at 57 years old. Worth a try for sure."""
Epilepsy,9.0,"""I've been on this medicine for 10 yrs now and have my seizures under control with 1200 mg a day a neurologist placed me on it after trying Dilantan and Depakote. I didn't realize it could be helping my anxiety and restless legs and migraines. I had terrible headaches before I was on gababentin and now have all these things under control. I did gain 30lbs when we added a antidepressant."""
Insomnia,9.0,"""I've struggled with Restless Leg Syndrome and Insomnia for 14 years. This medication knocked me out! It stopped my legs from jerking and put me to sleep. The only problem is that the first day after I took it, I'd never been so groggy in my life. I could not walk straight and was lethargic all day. The next day the grogginess wasn't as bad and my doc said that that side effect will decrease soon. Other than that, I feel like this is a miracle for restless legs syndrome and insomnia. It's been a 14 year struggle for me but this is the first time anything has helped."""
Fibromyalgia,9.0,"""It honestly helps a lot for my nerve pain, I get it super bad in my arms and It helps so much. I only notice the pain if I don't take it. I take right now 900 ml. I would be in so much more pain without this. It's a blessing. Also I for some reason never get tired from this. I never get tired or anything and can take it in the morning if I forget. It does nothing for my insomnia. Idk if I have a rare reaction to it or what, but my doctor finds it funny. Ha ha"""
Anxiety,9.0,"""Thank God for this medication! After a few major life changes I recently went through I developed an anxiety disorder on top of frequent panic attacks. After trying a few medicines my PCP put me on a Xanax regimen. BAD IDEA! Within 2 1/2 months I was up to 4-5mg/day! I got sick of it and went to a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner. After being appalled that I was prescribed that much Xanax she put me on a Gabapentin regimen. 100mg 3x's a day for one week, then 200mg 3x's a day for my second week. Then a follow up. I just started my second week and I'm already taking less than half of the Xanax I was needing. She said within a month I'll be off the Xanax. I feel great all day. I don't even feel like I need the Xanax."""
Bipolar Disorder,9.0,"""I started taking this for bipolar 2 disorder and am prescribed Xanax for anxiety. My doctor started me out at 100mg of gabapentin (3x/day) after using Topamax to treat my bipolar disorder. The Topamax worked great for my mood, but caused me to lose too much weight, and constant parathesias in my arms, legs and even face. This medication works the same way without the side effects! (I'm now at 300mg 3x/day) I haven't even had need for my Xanax because this helps so much with my anxiety, as well! And it doesn't make me drowsy like Xanax does. I'm so happy I came across this and asked my doctor to try it. I hated antipsychotics but wanted to control my symptoms. I thought that was a no win situation, but gabapentin is my answer!"""
Migraine,9.0,"""Great medicine--I tried tons of other treatments and was down to my last option, I was at 300 MG and it started to work with few side effects besides increased appetite and a little more tired at first-a lifesaver!"""
Migraine,9.0,"""I'm taking Neurontin for my Basilar Migraines. I started out with 600 mg/day and it worked well in controlling my terrible auras (vertigo and double vision) for about 10 months. I started experiencing mild vertigo the past 3 days so it was increased today to 1200 mg/day. Hopefully it will continue to keep my auras in check. 

For me, the downside of this medicine is feeling lightheaded and I sometime have trouble recalling things. Also, sometimes I get a ""high"" feeling, but it's all good."""
Migraine,9.0,"""I used this last night for migraines. I took two pills and felt like I was drunk, even when I woke up. It knocked me out cold for 10 hours and I still felt like that when I woke up. I have been exhausted all day also. My migraine is gone, but I can barely keep my eyes open. """
Pain,9.0,"""Great so far"""
Pain,9.0,"""I jammed my hip about 6 weeks ago.  It had been sore and hurting, but starting 10 days ago the sciatic pain was running down my right leg constantly.  I was eating Aleve and Advil.  Heat did not help.  Ice did not help.  I could barely walk.  I even had to take a day off work because I could not get in a comfortable position.  My doctor gave me a steroid shot and had no effect on the pain.  I had taken Gabapentin before when I had a pinched nerve in my neck from a car accident and the pain was running down my are.  I called my doctor yesterday and asked him if he would call me some in. He did.  100mg, 3 times per day.  I can already tell a difference.  The shooting, stabbing pain running down my leg through my foot has subsided."""
Insomnia,9.0,"""This has been the only medicine to help with my insomnia and I've tried a lot.   Unfortunately, I'm finding I'm also irritable most of the day since I've ramped up to 3 pills per day.  I'm cutting back to two to see if that helps that side."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""Never though of reviewing a med, I do this just for Gabapentin being so great. I've tryed a lot before: Zoloft, Remeron, all types of benzos. I've kept a very bad opinion on them all, especially SSRi's - damn soul and sex killers. Benzos get addictive in the long run. But Gabapentin works like a charm, literally. Takes the edgyness of the days away, most inhibitions and anxiety, gives me the drive to do things and enjoy what i'm doing, I got faithful and... happy (after I almost forgot how it can be constantly felt). FInal note: if taken not too often (like once a week) it can be quite recreational in doses around 1200 mg. I usually take about 600-900 daily, but cut off some times to get the higher reward days later, as tolerance drops."""
Pain,9.0,"""I have been dealing with thigh pain/numbness and tingles for almost two years from a pinched nerve in my thigh and lower back. Doctors always say LOSE WEIGHT! Well easier said than done. I am not that over weight. Finally met with a SMART neurologist. He said throw away the meds they had me on before which did nothing but MAKE me gain weight (Nortriptyline). He put me on Gabapentin 800mg. I was told to take half tablet three times a day unless I needed more, which I don't. It has been three days..First time in almost two years I sleep through the night because the irritation is GONE. I sleep all night like a baby, wake up refreshed, have ZERO pain in my leg. My coworkers say I am pleasant now. I have NO anxiety now as well! LOVE IT!"""
Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,"""This medicine has been life changing! I was always told my rls is in my head and not real. It's just me being worried or nervous. Thankfully, I asked my dr. She told me, it's very real and asked my symptoms. They matched perfectly with all rls symptoms. I take Gabapentin before bed. It takes about 30 minutes to kick in, but when it does, I'm able to relax and sleep. When I get out of bed in the morning, my legs don't ache because I'm no longer moving them all night. Please seek medical help if you are struggling with rls. This medicine might not be for you, but whatever medicine works is worth it!!"""

Neuropathic Pain,9.0,"""I have been having back pain for years maybe 6+ I also have mild scoliosis and sciatic nerve pain. Usually predinsome for a short period will work for a yr or so. My back started in a 9 pain level in 1 to 10 scale. My pain was so bad I could only stand for 5 minutes. My husband got me a nice bar stool with a back while I cooked. It helped. My GP then prescribed Gabapentin Capsules starting at 100MG  1Cap at night for 2 nights then added in the AM. I have had immediate relief. Can stand to cook do dishes etc. Today I have added a 100 MG  mid day. That puts me on 100 MG 3 times a day. I see that others are taking 300 MG or more 3 times a day?

Major nerve damage and left my left leg, mostly my foot and toes numb. Have been on hydrocodone for years and years, which helped, but you build up a tolerance. My new pain doctor asked me if I had ever taken  Neurontin?  I advised no. He wrote me a script of 300mg up to 4 a day.  It has made a major difference in pain level. I only take one hydrocodone a day and that is when I first wake up. Downside is feeling groggy and dry mouth, but I can deal with that. Big difference in my life now.  Much better."""
Vulvodynia,9.0,"""No more horrible constant burning unprovoked vulvar pain! Also helped with my urethra pain from IC. three months on it I am almost back to normal. Able to have sex after two months.

Anxiety,9.0,"""Started taking gabapentin about 18 months ago for depression and anxiety. Almost immediately my symptoms were alleviated. No side effects, and it still works. I take 3600 mg/day, split either in two or three doses. For an acute attack of anxiety I will take an additional 600 or 1200 mg as needed, and that will almost always do the trick.

Anxiety,9.0,"""Went on a trial of gabapentin (300 mg 2x daily) about a month ago for anxiety to augment bupropion xl (150mg 1x daily) for anxiety and depression. Bupropion was working to clear up some clouds, but some underlying situational anxiety persisted. Adding gabapentin has been great! Only downside is mild blurred vision and a slight head-fuzz feeling the first couple of days, but that has dissipated. I'm considering asking my doctor for an increase in the gabapentin dose, but overall I feel much improved. I am pleased that these two medications are having a positive effect with minimal side-effects and that I don't have to go on an SSRI."""
Fibromyalgia,9.0,"""I was diagnosed in 2009 after over a decade of chronic aches and pains that couldn't be described by any physicians. After countless bloodtests, MRIs, CAT scans, and the like, I finally found a Neuro that decided to try Gabapentin. I've been on it now, low dose, for about a week. 

Placebo effect or otherwise, I DO feel better. My normal daily functions seem easier, the pain has almost entirely subsided to a 'dull' ache, my headaches have dwindled to almost nothing, and my energy has increased; which I can only attribute to actually sleeping through the night for more than four days.

I will be gradually increasing my dosage over the next four weeks to see if I get even better. I'm ecstatic that I found this physician and Gabapentin!"""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I'm an MST and PTSD survivor and this stuff along with Lyrica restored me in about a week. Medication that affects SSRI cannot even compare when it comes to treating my condition.

Highly recommended to those with severe anxiety or Post traumatic stress disorder. The side effects are mundane at best."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I suffer from panic attacks that have been occurring for the last four years, the had me on a medication regiment of Xanax, two mgs four times a day and Clonazepam 1mg two times a day, and I in turn became dependant on those. So for the last month I tapered myself off of the Xanax and Clonazepam and was subsequently put on Gapapentin and I have to say I've never felt better. This medication has been the only thing that has helped as much as the better than Benzo's. I must say this medication really is a miracle anxiety drug. Nothing has EVER worked like this and I shoud add I've tryed over 30 medications to stop my severe anxiety, I hope this helps at least one person."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I was prescribed gabapentin when I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It was for my panic attacks and anxiety. I went crazy with it the first couple of weeks taking way more than prescribed but that was the only way it worked for me. My doctor then upped my dose when I told him about it. He just started me off with the small dose to see how my body reacts to it. I love this medicine! Not to the point of addiction but because it calms me down and makes me think clearer whenever I freak out. There are no side effects at all for me. No dizziness, no grogginess no sleepiness. I function normally, I can even drive and work and study. It has helped me a lot. The dose that works best for me is 1500mg, I don't take it everyday anymore, just as needed."""

Bipolar Disorder,9.0,"""I have bipolar disorder, chronic depression, and anxiety and gabapentin has help tremendously without the use of other narcotic medicines. Yea, it makes you feel a little loopy for the first few weeks, but after that it does a wonderful job calming the nerves. One day I decided to go off it and the next day I had insane mood swings until I started it back up 2 days later and then it was like night and day. So that's how I know this stuff works. While I was off it, I threw my back out and after going back on it my back pain was virtually gone. Killed two birds with one stone. It does make my face more oily than normal along with minor fatigue and added hunger, but other than that I love it."""

Then a follow up doc took me off and said I had to take an antidepresseant and Xanax to help me sleep. Huge mistake. Well I went back on the Gabapentin then off again because I thought it was causing a problem but it was really the Xanax. Now, I have been put back on it 300mg 3x a day.

It helps a lot, I still get hot flashes but only a couple times a day and no more night sweats.

Now three months in, I feel so bubbly and chatty, and not afraid to talk to people, and I'm not afraid to take part in social activities that used to terrify me. I was reading about Gabapentin online, and when I found out that it's sometime prescribed for anxiety, it hit me: Wow. Since I've been taking this, I've been feeling so much better. This drug is amazing. I feel like now I'm the person I was always supposed to be."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""Very good medicine. Taking 200 to 300mg daily for anxiety, racing thoughts, poor sleep etc.  Have been on lamotrigine and risperidone for supposed BPD for years. Everything they can't get rid of, gabapentin does.  Never realized there was still so much room for improvement!  One other thing.  For me, MSG or any free glutamate sets off severe anxiety and migraines.  Some of you may have similar problem, so think about your diet too.  
For me gabapentin provides fast relief from a 'meal mistake'.  Benzodiazepines worked pretty well for me, but now that I have this, bye bye. I used to use alcohol more than I should, but now don't feel the need too."""

I saw immediate improvement in my ability to walk and move around.  I am experiencing considerably less pain.

And I have been on most of them at one point or another.  I wake up in a good mood.  The only drawback that I have is that the morning dose makes me sleepy til about 11an but that is it.  But I am not complaining because I would rather be sleepy than anxious and depressed."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,"""Gabapentin has really helped my nasty restless legs.  Before gabapentin life was awful due to the side effects of Mirapex (for 10 years).  In any case, I would have given gabapentin a higher score, but it is only half the reason I now sleep through the night. Another medicine called trazodone when taken with gabapentin does the trick.

That leaves me with 8 hours of sleep in which I don't need the medication. My doc said I can take up to 200mg at a time but I am not sure if I am going to do that.

Went to my rheumatologist who suggested I tried gabapentin prescribed 1 pill 600mg for four days than 2 pills 600mg per day will be starting 3 pills per day.

My 5th doctor who is now my family doctor, put me on 3600 mg of gabapentin a day  and  referred me to a neurosurgeon who found the problem in my neck, surgery was performed to correct the problem plus gabapentin (3600 mg a day), plus other medications I was taking prior to surgery as directed by my new family doctor.
My point being, My symptoms of neck pain, arm pain, and leg pain were initially diagnosed as arthritis by 4 doctors. My family doctor and neurosurgeon in combination with gabapentin, the pain and suffering is now 90% reduced to a livable existence. I am 74 years old."""
Pain,9.0,"""I recently started Neurontin after trying oxycodone with a bad allergic reaction.  Initially, I was tired non-stop with nausea and vomiting the first two weeks.  Now, I have no nerve pain as long as I take it at 300mg three times a day. I do have a nonstop haze that does affect my reading so reading isn't too enjoyable anymore.
I have also packed on 10 pounds.  I still have horrible joint pain that I treat with 800mg Advil three times a day.  My gait is still the same and I still cannot walk without a cane, but the side effects are tolerable."""
Pain,9.0,"""I have fibromyalgia and Pars Defect (slipped disc in L5, S1). I take morphine sulfate 30mg 3 x daily, Neurontin 600mg 3x daily. I have noticed a HUGE improvement in the movement of my body. I can actually bend over without falling to my knees in pain. Before I was taking morphine I could tell a difference on the days where I was not taking daily dose of the Neurontin. My body would ache and the pain would be awful and distracting. My arms, shoulders, lower back and shooting/dull ache down my legs would flare up when driving or sitting for a period of time. Now I am able to sit without needing to lay down every 20-30 minutes. The price is reasonable for those without insurance. Hope this helps!"""
Alcohol Withdrawal,9.0,"""Im a 53 yr old PunkRocker. I drank for Forty Years and have been Sober 7 months, I take Gabapentin 300mg. 3x a day and I no longer have alcohol cravings with the help of this medicine and staying positive. Good Luck Everyone.Peace."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""Gabapentin 200mg. definitely helps my anxiety. I know because I stopped taking it and the symptoms came back..I don't have panic attacks but a low level fear of the future, dread, etc..Gabapentin helps a lot."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""My Doctor gave me this medication because I am going through a very stressful time and I was having an emotional melt down. I take 600 mg before bed or as needed during the day and it always calms me down. It feels like my whole body is numb. It also works good for restless leg syndrome. It can make me forgetful and groggy so I don't drive if I've just taken a dose. It may not be a good medicine for someone who has a job or needs to be very alert and focused. No other side effects. I've been on it for 2 weeks and it's been a lifesaver."""
Fibromyalgia,9.0,"""I'm 53 and have fibromyalgia. I was at the end of my tether with the pain. A new doctor put me on Gabapentin. I take 200mg 3 x a day. It has literally changed my life. My pain levels have reduced dramatically, I don't wake up with the 'fibro fog' and my energy levels are as a 'normal' person's would be. It was been a revelation!"""
Anxiety,9.0,"""After 20 years of every SSRIs for depression and generalized anxiety disorder I have found that Gabapentin is the only medicine that has really helped the anxiety with the exception of Thioridizane (now withdrawn in UK). At first Seroquel seemed to help but 3 months now on Gabapentin and significantly better. Still haven't found the ideal dose (now about 2400 a day) but initial side effects have worn off. My family say that since coming off Seroquel my personality has returned to what it used to be years ago. Give it a good try, and good luck. If you post on here I do think it helps if you mention dosage (and body weight 224lbs)."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,"""Tried Lyrica and could not drive due to impact on awareness.
Tried ibuprofen which works when combined with acetaminophen in nighttime cough medicine but takes too long to relieve pain.
Tried gabapentin(Neurontin)generic 100 mg three times per day.
It works good for the pain in the feet but does not work for my back pain.
Side affects are minor, a slight impact on alertness but not much so I have no problem driving safely."""
Pain,9.0,"""After spinal cord injury and fractured vertebrae (T10) in 05', I had rods inserted to hold spine together and repair spinal cord. After long stay in hospital and rehab facility in Adelaide, Australia I was prescribed Oxynorm and MS Contin for the pain. But as this did not relieve the nerve pain in my legs (okay for back) I was put on to Neurontin 300mg. I've since had to increase my dosage to 1200mg x 3 times per day. I've found Neurontin amazing for the nerve pain. I've had a few side effects (minor). I'm still taking the opiates still but hopefully will be able to ween off them in the not to distant future and see if just the Neurontin will be able handle all of the pain."""
Insomnia,9.0,"""Great medication. I acquired RLS from abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepines, and this has been the only thing that helps. Ambien on its own doesn't put me to sleep, but 5mg in conjunction with 400mg of neurontin helps me so much. I've had insomnia almost every night for the past 2 months, and I am so glad my doctor prescribed me this!!!"""
Pain,9.0,"""This is amazing medication.  It works!  It will take around 4-6 weeks (for me it was 4.5 weeks) and then you will notice the pain is greatly reduced.  I've read some reviews here that say they are pain free.  I didn't believe it when I first started this medicine but I sure do now!
I take Tramadol with the Gabapentin.  I purposely didn't state the doses because everyone is different, so its not important.  I tend to be somewhere about average.
Yes, there are side effects, this is a powerful medicine, so it's to be expected. Not much else I can say except it has changed my life. I literally felt like someone gave me a new lease on life!"""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. My doctor put me on Gabapentin @ 2700mg/day I started with 300 mg/day and worked my way up. I feel good! I never felt this good all my life, I have opened up to the world around me and enjoying life much better. I deal with stress and fear in a totally different way. I'm mostly happy all day haha!"""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I was originally prescribed Gabapentin for internal nerve damage due to extensive colon cancer surgery. It has been about 75% effective in relieving this pain. To my surprise, it has also helped in other ways I was never expecting.  I have a pretty laid back personality (I thought) but after taking Gabapentin for pain relief, I began noticing a calming effect overtake me  - just relaxed.  I used to get lots of negative thoughts come to my mind which I would fight off but now I don't even go there!  My husband has really noticed a difference in my upbeat attitude towards life and after a year of radiation, chemo, surgery etc... it is a wonderful surprise to him also! As a side note - I am also sleeping great and wake up refreshed."""

I began having really bad anxiety and depression...this was also aided by the death of my mother and 3 cousins I was close to.  In any case, it got worse and worse..my doctor doesn't believe in diazapam etc which I think it's a personal thing with her. So I'm changing doctors but can't get in till February.  A friend had a big bottle of Gabapentin after his dog died and told me it had a sedative effect. I hadn't slept more that 1-2 hours a night in months.  I took a 300 mg of Gabapentin  at night for 4 nights, since then I have slept through the night!!! This was HUGE for me..I've only taken it for 4 days... And it's like a miracle"""
Pain,9.0,"""I have Meniere's Disease and have had 3 surgeries for it (shunt, VNS (vestibular nerve section), inner ear removal).  I have piercing, stabbing pain sporadically throughout the day and constant pain (4-5) most days.  It's the cranial nerve X--the vargus nerve that's flaring up or damaged.  I've used Demerol (hydrochloride HCL) to control the pain.  I asked the pharmacist if there was any way to reach that nerve.  He said ask your Dr. about Gabapentin.  My Dr. immediately knew what it was and thought we should try it.  I've been on it for 3 days and haven't had any stabbing yet.  It makes me slightly dizzy/headachy.   Hence, I don't like taking it unless my ear is over a 5 in pain.  I haven't taken Demerol in the past 3 days."""
Pain,9.0,"""I had ongoing pain in my right leg due to stenosis, a cyst on my spine, and a number of issues with my lower vertebrae. I first went to a chiropractor but that didn't help. Had two injections at a pain clinic with very limited results. Went to a spine clinic and the doctor prescribed gabapentin. Went from one 300mg a day to three as prescribed. I have found much relief and have had some good nights of sleep after months  of pain at night. I have not had the side effects described here except it took a couple of times to discover that my tolerance for alcohol is greatly reduced. That may not be a bad thing. I still have a lot of numbness and pain if I walk too far or stand too long but at least I can sleep at night ."""

Fibromyalgia,9.0,"""For the past 5 years I have suffered with fibromyalgia, I wake 4 or 5 times a night and generally feel like I have had flu all that time.  I started on gabapentin 100mg 3 x daily for 4 weeks and did feel I had a bit more energy, my GP then put me up to 300mg x 3 daily and it has made a massive difference.  For the first time in years I get a good night sleep and don't feel like I have been hit by a bus when I wake."""
Trigeminal Neuralgia,9.0,"""Had post herpectic trigeminal neuralgia (one of the worst cases in history according to my doctors). Began treatment with medications available in 1995, which almost destroyed my endocrine system.  I tried Neurontin when it came out and today find I can control what used to be chronic burning pain down the side of my face from my scalp to my upper teeth across my right eye with 600 mg of Neurontin taken before bed."""
Alcohol Withdrawal,9.0,"""I am a sixty year old guy.  I have been drinking since I was 15.  AA gave me a couple of years of sobriety a few times.  I could never describe the magnitude of my cravings (even to other alcoholics).  Though the VA, I started taking Gabapentin about 6 months ago.  I have returned to AA meetings because just reducing the cravings isn't all it's about for me.  I have said that stated in meetings that there is finally a pill that cure's alcoholism.  They don't like hearing that stuff in AA.  It is more true than they will ever think.  Craving's were such a huge part of my inability to control my drinking.  I have been able to do things that I never could before.  Best of luck to you all."""
Epilepsy,9.0,"""I was also given gabapentin along with Keppra for seizures. The seizures seem to be under control and  I am happy with the results but unlike the first comment I have not gained any weight. I have actually lost like 70 pounds."""
Trigeminal Neuralgia,9.0,"""I have had trigeminal neuralgia for about six years, I am 32. Luckily for me the pain has been bearable and I felt I had not needed medication until this year (2014) when the pain became really agonizing. I have been pain free since starting the med. Every now and then I will get a little twitch or pinch from the trigeminal nerve, but nothing like the shooting pain I was having before. I take 300mg every night before bed.  Recently, there was a mix up with the prescription refill and my insurance, and due to these circumstances I went about a week without taking the medication.  The trigeminal pain slowly came back and became more and more intense during the time I had run out. This medicine is great, pain went away soon after taking it again."""
Insomnia,9.0,"""I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for about 5 months now, so my doctor put me on Lexapro. When I went back, they prescribed me a higher dosage, causing me not to sleep but maybe 3 hours all together throughout the night. I told my doctor and she gave me Neurontin 200mg and it has helped me very much! It does work the way I expected. It doesn't just help you sleep, it lets you rest!

Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,"""I am sharing, because I have been searching all over to see if anyone else had experience with restless legs syndrome and gabapentin following an injury. Last year I got hit by a car, broke my femur (in half). Besides the injury I suffered from EXTREME swelling in my lower leg, that often comes with this kind of injury. I also suffered what is called a Morel Lavelle lesion, a very mean injury by itself. All this caused the onset of RLS and the surgeon put me on gabapentin, been taking it for about 10 months. I have tied to reduce it, but no such luck, the sensation without it is crazy. So glad he did and that there is medication to control it."""
Pain,9.0,"""My doctor started me on gabapentin about 4 months ago now for pain from osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia and bad knee pain.  She had me take 100mg, 3 times a day.  Or she said, I could take 1 tablet in the morning and 2 tablets at night, or all 3 tablets at night and nothing else during the day, whatever works for me.  Each tablet is 100mg.  The medication definitely slows my system down and makes me relaxed and sleepy, so when the pain from my diseases starts to act up, I take my pills according to how I feel and they seem to work for me really well taken that way.  No side effects at all from the meds.  I told my doctor I did not want any narcotics at all for my pain, as they are addictive and I did not want to be addicted to any pain med"""
Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,"""Have had peripheral neuropathy and restless legs for over ten years. I take 100 mg of gabapentin before bed. It worked wonders for my RLS for many years, but I may soon need to increase the dose somewhat.  It has not had any apparent effect on my neuropathy."""
Pain,9.0,"""I can exercise now in less pain.  Make sure you get the correct dosage that you feel comfortable with. If you take too little of a dosage, you may still have pain and lose hope in the medicine. It happened to me. I ended up doubling my dosage from 300mg to 600mg a day and feel so much better. I take 300mg twice a day as needed. I was originally on 100mg a day and it did nothing for me. Most people start off with 300mg."""
Hot Flashes,9.0,"""I have been on Gabapentin for just over a year for Fibromyalgia.  About the same time, I started going through menopause.  Everyone kept asking me about hot flashes and night sweats...none of which I get.  I am presuming it's the daily use of Gabapentin.  If I forget to take it, I definitely get night sweats now.  Blessing in disguise I guess!"""
Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,"""Neurontin has been a lifesaver for me.  My chemo left me with severe neuropathy in my hands and feet.  I couldn't feel anything but needles and pain.  I take 1800 mg a day in 3 doses and the pain begins to start again just before time for my next dose.  I don't know what I would do if I had to live with the stabbing needle feeling every minute of every day."""
Pain,9.0,"""This drug really helped my RSD pain."""
Neuropathic Pain,9.0,"""I experienced progressively worsening and frequent nerve pain shooting down both of my legs.  I had almost immediate relief with Gabapentin.  And for the first time in months, I was able to sleep throughout the night.  It was a miracle drug for me.  I got up to 900mg 3x/day.  However, I also experience an array of side effects. I always feel exhausted to the point that it makes it difficult to do daily activities.  I gained 30+ lbs in a few short months... and I have bad acne for the first time ever.   I've started tapering back down and realize that I have more energy.. we'll see about the other side effects now.  It's a balancing act between the side effects and pain."""
Migraine,9.0,"""I have been on Neurontin for about a year now.  I started with 300 mg. a day and now take 400 mg a day.  This medicine has given me my life back.  I was having 4-6 headaches a month, each lasting 1-4 days.  I was taking Zomig 4-6 times a month along with Excedrin Migraine and Fiorinal.  Now I only get 1-2 headaches a month and they are very mild.  I can usually get rid of them with one dose of Excedrin Migraine or Fiorinal.  Side effects are weight gain and some slight brain ""fuzziness"" but nothing serious. I had previously tried a beta blocker and an antidepressant and the side effects were horrible, plus I still had the headaches.  I am very happy with Neurontin."""
Spondylolisthesis,9.0,"""Had L4-5 fusion in 2014 and was back to full time work in 8 weeks. Approximately 22 months later I started having right lower leg excruciating pain and my leg would get so stiff that I would limp along with stinging,burning, and numbness. I went back to see my physician and an MRI was done. I was placed on 300 MG of gabapentin the dose was then increased to 600 mg. After finding out the problem and prior to surgery I was placed on 800 mg three times a day. It has really worked for the numbness,tingling, and burning before and after surgery.  I can really tell a difference if I happen to miss taking it late. I return for my follow up appointment soon I will discuss with my physician about staying on this medication."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""My life has been very difficult to say the least. I was severely abused as a child, have borderline, a mood disorder, became an addict and alcoholic (clean now for 3.5 year), have insomnia and have issues with codependency and in general have an overactive and negative thinking pattern. Since 2005 I have been on and off numerous medicines and in therapy. I went on gabapentin a little over a month ago. It has controlled my anxiety wonderfully so far. I take 600 mg of Seroquel to sleep and Effexor at 150 mg for my depression. The Seroquel works wonders with sleep but the Effexor isn't too good. Gabapentin has allowed me to do things I could only dream about and is a wonderful addition to my regime of spirituality, exercise, AA and work. It calms me."""
Pain,9.0,"""I suffer from cervical spinal stenosis. I had been on 4 a day Vicodin for 2 years. I wanted to get off this desperately. Recently my doctor prescribed gabapentin. I have now been on it for almost two weeks, and now have more mobility and range in my neck. For years it was hard for me to drive and look over my shoulder, left or right. Since being on this I am now able to look right or left almost 90 degrees without the pain I used to experience. I will say the pain or ""feeling"" is still there but not near the pain it used to be. Being on the medicine for only 2 weeks I have noticed it ""wears"" out in between doses but doctor informed me the increase in milligrams will help with that!"""
Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,"""I was recovering from alcoholism and I couldn't sleep because of inexplicable pain in my legs. I may have been masking the pain by drinking before I decided to quit. In any event, the pain was driving me crazy and after 3 months I relapsed just so I could sleep. Finally my doctor prescribed Neurontin and the pain was gone. I slept soundly and now I haven't had drink in 5 years. So you could say Neurontin saved my life."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,"""I had been using gabapentin sucessfully for almost ten yrs for restless legs. I thought I should take a break and gradually reduced my regular dosage of 1500/day  down to zero. What a mistake! I reverted to waking up every two hrs with leg pain, joint pain, and a floating depression. Needless to say, I'm back on the gabapentin."""
Pain,9.0,"""I have a couple damaged discs in my back and the pain became severe after 3-4 years of suffering.  I was instructed to take 300mg per day to start.  I don't like medicines and I decided to take the minimum I possibly could.  I have been on it for 6 months now and my pain is all but gone.  However, I never went beyond 200mg.  I think I am extremely fortunate.  I have my life back.  I had chronic headaches, previous to the medication.  Migraines came on about 2-4 times per month......that's all gone now.  I might take ibuprofen or aspirin once a month....and it used to be every day.  A couple of negatives for me would be:  Sleep pattern is still off and even though I am only taking 200mg per day, I really feel it."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I was taking Lamictal and Klonopin for a long time and doing very well on it.   In 2010 I had to have a lumbar disk replacement from an old hockey injury in college.  Sadly I got hooked on pain pills and when I finally stopped I was spending about 5k to 6k a month on pills which indicates how much I was taking.  Since about Xmas of 2013 I have been going through a period of Major Depression and Severe anxiety.  I just kept getting worse and worse and the Klonopin/Lamictal stopped working.  I had a prescription of Gabapentin sitting in my drawer that I had been prescribed but stopped using because it was making me dizzy.  I decided to try it our of desperation and all I can say is wow.  My anxiety has gone from a 10 to a 2 and no side effects."""
Neuropathic Pain,9.0,"""20 years plus of left arm pain.  Been on just about everything from aspirin to 180mg morphine 3x a day. I am a veteran from the marine corp so my meds came from the VA.

M.D told me better take it easy or you will be cut from meds at VA. Once again I was prescribed gabapentin.  Three times a day.  After a week of taking it, I thought to myself WOW what's going on here.  Cutting back on Ultram and this stuff is working.  I have been through so so, so, much.  I have thought about harming myself because of my pain. First thing that works. Thanks for helping people like me."""
Pain,9.0,"""Greater Trochanteric Bursitis diagnosis, did Physical Therapy, cortisone injections, tight IT bands, stabbing, shooting pain from hip to ankle.

No amount of atavan could help my anxiety. I wasn't sleeping, could barely function and was calling into work sick very often. The first night I took gabapentin I finally slept through the night and I made it through an entire week of work without calling in sick. My anxiety hasn't completely vanished but gabapentin has been such a life saver. I'm currently on 200mg three times a day (sometimes I take an extra 100mg if it's a bad day). I highly recommend it"""

Well recently it's been crazy because it just stopped working & for 2 months I was in an ongoing Flare. So my rheumey dr said lets try lyrica, and wean u off gaba - it huge mistake.

Nothing seemed to  help with the pain until I asked about Gabapentin and started taking 300 mg three times a day along with Ibuprofen 600 mg.   It does help a lot but only when I combine it with Ibuprofen...without I really don't get relief.  It does take some time for your body to adjust to it - I felt very foggy, and drugged.  I had trouble forming sentences for almost 2 weeks.  It's a lot better now."""
Pain,9.0,"""I have suffered with chronic pain from staph infection for the last 30 years. I finally got relief with Medtronics Morphine pain pump. After trying Neurontin for break through pain I have high hopes to replace the Morphine with the Neurontin, which has recently been approved to be used in the pump by the FDA. After staying on the Neurontin slowly but surely all side effects were gone. Just the dry mouth continues but that's okay."""
Fibromyalgia,9.0,"""I was prescribed gabapentin in hospital after enduring two back surgeries. I was given it to help rejuvenate the nerve in one leg that was severely compromised. An unexpected bonus for me is that my excruciating fibromyalgia pain has all but disappeared. I only notice faint pains if I am late for my next dose. I was previously having pains all over my body and each day a new joint would feel like it was broken. I am so thankful and am hoping this is a long term solution. I have been taking it for about 10 weeks, 300mg 3 X per day."""
Neuropathic Pain,9.0,"""The only thing available that works for me."""
Hot Flashes,9.0,"""So glad to hear other women have found relief from hot flashes using this medicine. I thought maybe it was in my head that I was getting some relief. Saw my gynecologist today and she would not prescribe it for me. She was not familiar with this medicine or that it helped hot flashes. Interesting! I found out about the medicine while using it for nerve pain, even my pain doctor was skeptical about it helping with menopause symptoms. The secret is out, there is help out there that is not hormones."""
Pain,9.0,"""I have suffered from chronic pain since I was 19. I've taken just about everything available to treat this curse. After about 5 years of refusing Gabapentin, I finally tried it. Don't let the side effects scare you, try it for at least a week and let your body and mind get used to it. This stuff really works for pain relief. Also, the combination of this with your narcotic pain relievers will help greatly. The key to treating pain is moderation and avoiding alchohol. I have had great success combining my pain reliever with this and Naproxen or APAP. Help with depression , mood and sleeping. Some side effects can be dizziness. As your body gets used to this it will start working subtly and relieve your pain and help you rest."""
Bipolar Disorder,9.0,"""Finally after every medicine known for use in treating Bi-Polar Gabapentin was the key when it was coupled with Lamictal.  """
Bipolar Disorder,9.0,"""I was given gabapentin in addition to my Lamictal. On the two medicines I have developed a little obsessive compulsive disorder. I like having three ink pens to work, like things positioned on shelves in a certain way. After that being said my rapid cycling bipolar is under control. Gabapentin doesn't help joint pain or any other pains I seem to have. I take 400 mg 3x a day. I like it, all the side effects are worth it in my opinion.  I have never felt better in my life! I work out everyday just about and eat healthy. The time I started gabapentin I have energy. I have lost 25lbs and have been doing this life change for 6 months. Please try it! And if you are bipolar try the combination. """
Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,"""I've suffered with restless leg syndrome since the age of 20 and now 40. As I've aged it has worsened and I also get it in my arms and hands.

Pain,9.0,"""I was prescribed this medicine to help with chronic knee pain and restless leg syndrome as a result of nerve damage following knee surgeries. A side effect of this medicine was that it almost cured the chronic fatigue I was suffering with, reduced the migraines that I was having almost daily down to about 1 per week, drastically improved my overall mood, and my appetite has returned and I am finally starting to put some weight back on."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,"""Ronlngbch#1 thank you for your article ; I have had minor l5 budge for 20 years with minor numbness in right thigh three week ago I started getting the worst shooting pain in the middle of night and standing up if I sit in same spot for 15 minuet's the intense pain would last 15 seconds to a minuet but the only way I can describe it is my muscle being ripped off the bone.(WORST PAIN OF MY LIFE)  Dr. started me at 300 mg 3 times a day on day two already feel better I didn't even wake up last night. I was hoping it worked fast on some one else too so I know  its not just a placebo effect . insurance was making me do a whole song & dance to get Lyrical I called Dr. office & he faxed in the gabapentin"""
Hot Flashes,9.0,"""I am 70 and was still having hot flushes more than 20 times in  24 hours, it was showing no signs of ending - ever.  My GP was reluctant to give me HRT again because of my age and the fact that I had a mild heart attack 20 years ago, but she gave me Gabapentin, and it works!  I only take 300mg at night and never have a hot flush or night sweat now.  It is a relief after all these years to be free of the horrible feeling of heat, nausea and pallpitations.  The only down side is light headedness and feeling tired.  I don't think I could take a higher dose because of this, hopefully I won't need to."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""Was prescribed this med years ago for anxiety.   I take 300 mg three times per day. morning, noon, and night.The  doctor is about to up the dose a bit because I've been on the same dose for so long, and sometimes I get extra anxious or can't sleep so asked if I could have the option to take an extra when I need it. This medication is amazing... I can't say enough about it to be honest. It has helped me so much live my life without that constant nagging anxiety, social awkwardness, and it helps regulate my moods as well !"""
Anxiety,9.0,"""Made me very agitated for the first few days. Had lingering side effects on the dose I am on. Often times makes me lightheaded, drunk feeling, high feeling, and gives me blurred vision, HOWEVER, it controls my panic disorder. I am on 600mg 3 times per day, using Klonopin as well to control anxiety. It makes my body physically unable to panic, which quells the anxiety."""
Pain,9.0,"""I have degenerative disc disease and recently blew a disc in my neck which was excruciating.  I've dealt with lower back disc related issues for 30 years, but this pain in my neck left shoulder and arm was beyond anything I could cope with. I wasn't sleeping and functioning was near impossible.  The doctors tried me on Lyrica which was bad for me, then Cymbalta which made me lose a lot of hair and extreme muscle cramps (not to mention the really bad withdrawals), but just a week into taking 200mg of gabapentin before bed I am virtually pain free!  I've gained a little weight, but that's about it.  My fingers and hands are still tingling but the pain associated is almost gone and most definitely tolerable.

I LOVE this stuff so far."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,"""Ex football player through NCAA and a little bit beyond. In my 40's after years of suffering I had a lumbar fusion followed 2 years later by cervical fusion..been on opiate pain relievers for 12 years. Of course many are familiar with what can happen with these medicines over a long period. Long story short, I am off the opiates, but still have my pain at age 56. Got Doc to prescribe Gabapentin. This is the first week and it's gotten rid of all the stiffness (I seize up muscularly with physical activity) and knocked out all but localized pain at the surgery sites. So I add Naproxen Sodium which also adds to the absorption of gabapentin. I'm functioning."""
Bipolar Disorder,9.0,"""Lamictal gabapentin and brintillix combo has really helped my Bipolar 2. Gabapentin is calming and the blurred vision goes away after a week or 2"""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I have just started taking Gabapentin and it has been very effective in leveling me out so I can better handle daily life stress and crisis. It doesn't seem to have any conflicts with several other medicines I take. It may make you drowsy, but I'm very impressed with the results so far. I take three 300 MG capsules per day. I'm very glad my doctor prescribed this drug."""
Insomnia,9.0,"""Was prescribed gabapentin for general anxiety and also to help deal with an exceptionally stressful living situation.  Only take 600 mg. later in the day and most definitely am able to comfortably relax in a way I wasn't always able to. Did notice kind of a ""swimmy"" spaced out feeling and not always able to keep an even keel while walking.  But I'm willing to accept that because I greatly appreciate the peace of mind it affords me."""
Pain,9.0,"""Do not be put off by initial dopey feelings you may get when you start this medicine.  For me, these feelings diminished after a day or so.  I needed to have the dose increased to 3600mg daily to make my pain almost disappear.  Each time the dosage was increased, I felt dopey for a bit, but it was only temporary. The reduction in pain and the good sleep I get is well worth any side effects.  In my case, side effects are minimal.  I have nerve damage resulting from ankle surgery for arthritis.  Before I was put on Neurontin, my outlook on life was pretty bleak.  I couldn't sleep and the pain was excrutiating.  This drug has really helped me."""
Insomnia,9.0,"""I was taking duloxetine for my anxiety but because of some remaining anxiety, I became an extremely light sleeper and would only get about 2 hrs a night. Gabapentin was very much my savior and I now wake up once a night at most. And best, I wake up at 6AM extremely well rested."""
Alcohol Withdrawal,9.0,"""Last year I was hospitalized due to my alcohol consumption. After this I have needed to completely stop. I have been experiencing extreme anxiety. I was recently prescribed gabapentin 600mg*3 times a day. This has helped a ton! I can finally relax and focus on getting my life together! It is definitely helping me through this rough time along with AA and other support groups."""
Pain,9.0,"""In mid May suffered a back injury after heavy squatting in the gym. The pain progressively became worse to the point where you couldn't stand/walk. The Dr (in a UK citizen) started me on Cocodamol and naproxen. This did not help, and I was unable to sleep for more than 2 hrs a night. I was then put on amitriptyline which did not work, as well as slow release morphine, still with no relief. Yesterday (25 Jul 2014) my Dr advised switching from amitriptyline to Gabapentin. I started on 3x300mg tablets. Last night I had my first full night sleep in 8 weeks. I cannot explain the relief I felt to wake up in the morning like a normal person again."""
Pain,9.0,"""Works ok for my degenerative back joint disease.
Only problem I have is headaches, but ibuprofen takes care of that.
Slight manageable dizziness and blurred vision.
I Take about 1800 mg per day.
Eat a lot too!!!"""
Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,"""Before taking gabapentin I had difficulty walking and getting a good night's sleep.  I would constantly get shooting pains up and down my legs, as well as both feet. In just a few days after beginning taking gabapentin, the majority of the shooting pain in the legs subsided.  The pain in the feet is more tolerable as well.  Just wonder how long this ""miracle"" medicine will continue working for me."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""After a hard divorce at a young age I became an addict meds. When I searched for help I found an amazing doctor that I feel cares about my well being not just there to give me meds. One of the medications he had given me was Neurontin(gabapentin) and it has helped not only with my anxiety but I also get horrible sciatic nerve pain ( when I'm sitting for long periods of time and at night when I'm sleeping) it has helped so much. I can take it during the day which helps my anxiety and at night helps me get a good night sleep as well as the nerve pain. I would recommend this medication for anyone struggling with these issues. I hope this helped just one person."""
Pain,9.0,"""Took it for Inguinal Hernia (Post-op Pain). Wow. Wow. Wow.  That's all I can say.  This medicine finally, finally let me have my life back.  Back in Oct 2014 I was diagnosed with an inguinal hernia. It really hurt, it felt like someone was always tugging at my testicle (I know, great right?) and groin pain, and I couldn't work out, and it was terrible.  Anyway, I had surgery in early Dec 2014 and I definitely felt better, but the testicle pain NEVER went away.  I went to the surgeon for 3-4 follow-ups and some days the pain was better and others worse, but it never went away.  

Long story short, Gababentin finally took away 95-99% of the pain.  I started first month on 300mg, 3x day.  Now after 2 months I'm going to 600mg 3x a day.  It's not perfect, but I'm getting close!"""
Neuropathic Pain,9.0,"""I was given 300mg of Gabapentin to take at night (I also take 400mg daily of Carbamezapine).

The Gaba is v. strong & knocks me out, but since it's @ night it's not so bad.

Completely by accident I discovered how depressed I was, because these pills are giving me a new lease of life. My negativity and suicidal tendencies have all gone pretty much. I'm more focused, happy & get on with things. 

Side effects I get: tiredness, mild confusion/forgetfulness and a hand twitch that makes me almost drop things. P.S. I'm from UK so no insurance I pay scripts. yearly"""
,9.0,"""I have just started this med.  I have a spinal cord stimulator and hate it.  I take Norco for constant pain with minimal relief.  I had no good relief from gabapentin but this time release sample has been amazing for the pain.  I have been at a #2 for 2 days in a row and I am very excited.  I called and found that Garlise IS covered under my Part D at 35 per month and 45 next year.  I am experiencing the customary side effects, hoping they will decrease with time.  Dry mouth, dizzy, headache on awakening and heavy feeling.  But the pain is SO much better!!  I will update as my experiences change and time passes.  I am very hopeful after years of Neuropathy."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""Helps very well for my generalized anxiety. I take 800mg 3 times per day.  Seems to stabilize my mood. Only side effect is problems with ejaculation."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,"""I am in my late 20's and have had restless legs since my late teens.  I have been on Gabapentin now for about 2.5 years and it has been wonderful.  RLS stopped almost immediately (to my memory).  For whatever reason, the RLS comes back periodically and I have to tweak the dosage a bit.  At first I increased (at the doc's request) but soon reached my 1800 maximum dosage, 600mg 3x day.  When symptoms popped up again I stopped taking the GP all together; believing that it had stopped working.  Later in desperation, I took some leftover GP and it worked again.  Now I try to stay at a low 300mg dose and take another 300-600 if I feel that familiar RLS itch as I’m settling in."""
Hot Flashes,9.0,"""Was prescribed gabapentin for back pain but noticed very quickly that my night sweats and hot flashes greatly diminished after starting this medication. I also sleep better and don't wake up as often. This has been a blessing due to the fact that I am unable to take any medication normally prescribed for menopausal symptoms due to having thrombosis years ago. :)"""
Pain,9.0,"""This medication relieved my pain while detoxing off of methadone (was taking it for degenerative disc). However, I did have significant side effects. The most problematic were really bad double vision and am still experiencing a foul smell (which is getting better) over time."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,"""Has helped my quality of life incredibly."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,"""I was originally prescribed this medicine because of numbness I had in my feet.  I was an alcoholic for about 10 years and had some nerve damage done to my feet.  As part of quitting I sought help for the side effects of new sobriety.  This medicine makes the pain from numbness go away almost completely. I can finally wear any type of shoes that I want. I also have an issue with anxiety as my body chemistry had been impacted highly from addiction.  This medicine helps me keep a calm and cool head.  I take other things such as Atarax and Trazodone but I notice a big difference if I don't take my Gabapentin.  It makes my anxiety stay at a certain level and not escalate into anger and compulsiveness."""
Migraine,9.0,"""I have suffered with constant daily headaches and frequent debilitating migraines for the past couple of years. In the beginning the only relief I could get was to go to the ER for IV medications. It was to the point where I was either constantly in bed in pain, or at the ER. Finally I was referred to a neurologist who started me on Zonisamide. That helped at first, but then the headaches became constant again. Also, I was losing too much weight on the zonisamide (I was already underweight and had trouble gaining). Finally, my neurologist switched me to gabapentin, and it has helped a lot. I still get some headaches, but they aren't as often or as severe. Side effect was some loss of balance and forgetfulness. And I'm finally gaining weight!"""
Fibromyalgia,9.0,"""Neurontin helps with my pain and gives me a lot of energy but does not help my seizures. I am on 600mg 3 to 4 times a day but the longer I take it the less it helps and the more I have to take."""
Pain,9.0,"""I have a herniated disc at C6 and a pinched nerve that shoots pain down my left arm. I started taking Neurontin 300 mg once a day for a week, then two a day the 2nd week, and now 3 a day. I'm a local truck driver, so reading your reviews had me worried. When I started this medicine, my Doc also started me on Robaxin. Everything was okay until the 2nd week. I got the high feeling for about that whole day. Then the third week, same thing. I stopped taking the Robaxin cause it leaves me groggy and unfocused. I have ALMOST no pain in my arm after 3 weeks on Neurontin, even after I stopped taking the Robaxin. This medicine is awesome. I had doubts about its effectiveness until reading your comments. Thank you everyone. It doesn't affect my driving ability after I stopped the Robaxin."""
Pain,9.0,"""This stuff is great for nerve pain. I have 2 herniated discs in my lower back and 1 in my neck along with a pinched nerve. It takes away my neck pain when narcotic pain relievers and muscle relaxers combined didn't. Taking it alone causes drowsiness. """
Alcohol Withdrawal,9.0,"""This medication is awesome. I have been an alcoholic for 12 yrs. It has been 2 weeks since my last drink. It helps with mood swings, depression, and cravings. The best thing about it is it is not addictive (non narcotic)."""
Pain,9.0,"""This medicine is wonderful, I have been using it for a week along with Zanaflex 1x daily 4mg and the Neurontin 2x daily 300mg.  I suffer from nerve damage in my right shoulder, as well as shoulder instability my arm dislocates frequently at least 2 x a month, trust me putting your arm back in the socket will race you to a 10 on the pain scale instantly. I have blacked out from the pain a couple of times.  The point is when my arm sub-locates the Neurontin can stop the traumatizing pain very quickly, with only a half of a Norco to assist the pain.  It has also allowed me to be more productive at work. It is easier to deal with during day time than Norco constantly.  If you have nerve pain from a traumatic injury/accident I highly recommend."""
Migraine,9.0,"""The first time I used it, it didn't help much. But the second time around after a break from all medication, it has started helping! The slight wobbliness in my gait is a small price to pay for something that actually helps my permanent migraine."""
Fibromyalgia,9.0,"""After being diagnosed four years ago and several different meds I went to a rheumatologist and he put me on gabapentin. I started out with 300mg at night for one week. Over the course of 4 weeks it slowly increased to 600mg 3 times daily. The first 23 hours I notice a difference. By the time I reached 600 mg 3 times daily I felt like a totally different person with my pain level going from a 10 most days to anywhere from 1-5. Well, the last 2 weeks my pain level has went up to 10 and no lower then a 5. I hope when I go back to the doctor. He will adjust the dosage and get it working again.

I also am on 60 mg of oxycontin 2 times a day and take xanax 4 times a day as needed.  My doctor previously didn't prescribe the gabapentin and I've noticed a big difference in nerve pain relief.It does take few days to get full effect of medicine but does work. In my case I may not ever be able to walk but since this medicine I feel I can really give it 110% because it is effective. Just beware not to drive on meds till u get thru side effects. Give it a chance it will help."""
Hot Flashes,9.0,"""I've been literally suffering from hot flashes & night sweats for months now.  Estroven worked for a minute, but they soon returned, & appeared angry for my trying to get rid of them, lol; they were even more severe. I began taking gabapentin 300mg for something else and noticed the diminishing of the hot flashes. At first, I didn't make the connection. I couldn't wait for the time to take one to have more of the drug in my system. Joking aside, I feel like a renewed person after just 4 days of taking them so yes, I'm a little giddy. :) I did feel a little light-headed after the very first pill, but not since then. I have also experienced no other side effects so I'm just so grateful to feel normal again. Its been awful, especially in public."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""Almost no negative side effects, aside from strange and vivid dreams; although I enjoy them and they aren't nightmares. Gabapentin helps me stay at ease when I'm alone. My anxiety used to be bad, even when I was just sitting there but with this, it's gone. I take two 300mg pills each day. However, I still feel anxiety in social settings such as school but it makes life a lot easier, even though its not a 100% fix."""

I spent many years struggling with my symptoms but a new Dr invited me to try Gabapentin. I worked up to a dose of 900mg twice a day and 1200mg at night. I have to say I would not be without it. Gone are the restless legs which kept me awake at night, gone is the interminable insomnia, irritable bladder, IBS flares.. My pains are dulled.

Pain,9.0,"""For nerve pain/damage, this is BETTER than narcotics and tramadol.  For almost any other kind of pain it does little but I suggest you try it if you have any kind of spinal problem.  I apparently have some kind of lesion or scarring after a badly herniated L5/S1, experience zaps and soreness in my low back and legs, and take 900mg/day three times a day and it is a miracle that this medication performs as well as it does.  Great stuff."""
Pain,9.0,"""I have prolapsed disc at C7 in my neck and inoperable spinal stenosis. The pain is relentless and unbearable. I took various NSAIDS and Co-codamol at maximum dosage.  The pain was still very bad. My doctor prescribed Gabapentin. I started at 300mg, 3 times a day and as this took the edge off the pain, I decided to go straight up to 900mg, 3 times a day. At this level, in conjunction with the other medicines, the pain is now generally distant to tolerable which is fantastic, although the efficacy does tend to wear off a little near the time of the next dosage. Ramping up to a high dosage so quickly definitely made me feel a bit tripy, as well as paranoid, irritable and aggressive but this has, thankfully, subsided over time."""
Fibromyalgia,9.0,"""I have had lumbar and cervical neck surgery. I tried to go without medicine and suffered anxiety/depression and was at times overly ruminating on body symmetry, checking myself for lumps bumps and whatever - I guess after the surgeries and being home, I was now switched on to be ever so vigilant to an anxious degree.

Well anyways I went onto cymbalta and that helped greatly with my chemical imbalance that was causing my depression but I needed a little more to simply be in a relaxed mode. I had tried Lyrica 75mg which was fantastic but the insurance company wanted me to go with gabapentin (Neurontin) 600mg cost savings.

So far gabapentin has been very effective in reducing my pain and my anxious responses. Fantastic!"""

Bipolar Disorder,9.0,"""After 31 years of being treated for depression with a panic disorder, and constantly complaining that the diagnosis was wrong, I found a doctor that figured it out. She diagnosed me with Cyclothymia (a form of bipolar disorder). She took me off of SSRI's and started me on Gabapentin. WOW. I feel like a normal person (I think). I'm calm. So far no panic attacks. The fog has lifted. I feel like I'm actually in the room. It's too bad that it took 31 years of my life for the medical community to figure it out, but better late than never."""

I am 63 years old, forced to retire due to excessive back pain (3 surgeries, one spinal fusion) and very bad nerve pain in my feet and hands... I've had no side effects and all my doctors (I've had triple bypass also... No heart attack, thank God.. No damage to my heart) have said there is no reason to discontinue using it !"""

Bipolar Disorder,9.0,"""I was on every type of class of bi-polar medications and the side effects were worse than the condition.  I have been taking gabapentin at night for a year now and I love it. It does not make me fuzzy or groggy the next day and my moods are manageable most of the time. In the long term, I prefer gabapentin."""
Migraine,9.0,"""I just started taking this medication as a preventive migraine treatment this month/August 2012.  I am so impressed. I did have one migraine starting and what is usually a 10  on the pain scale was only about a 3-4, and all I did was take a Percocet 5mg for the pain, got a really hot shower to relax my muscles, took one of my Imitrex Nasal Sprays, laid down, went to sleep and it was totally gone when I woke up in a few hours. YAY! Another positive for Neurontin for me is that I get a lot of neck, shoulder, back pain and with this medicine I have not had to take additional pain pills (Vicodin, etc.) as everything feels 'muted' and very tolerable.  Also, I have cut down from 10 mg to 5 mg on my Ambien and I am working to get off this."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,"""Gabapentin is great for nerve pain. I am a recent amputee due to a fracture that would not heal in my ankle. My surgeon prescribed it for phantom pain. It seemed to do the trick. I take 100mg bid, at breakfast and again at bedtime. I don't take any painkillers what so ever. Pretty good for an amputation that most people would think as being painful."""
Fibromyalgia,9.0,"""It has made a huge difference. I've tried everything including Lyrica, Elavil (which made me gain weight). Those were helpful but I get the best results with 600 mg Neurontin 3 x daily and flexeril 10mg 3 x daily or as needed."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,"""I had severe skin neuropathy pain, so severe I would rate it a 8.5 - 9 out of 10.. I heard about a new clinical study using gabapentin and nortriptyline for neuropathic pain. When I was only on gabapentin, no reduction in pain.. then saw study, asked my doctor and was put on 30 mg Cymbalta. Within three days felt a substantial reduction in pain to a 0.5 - 1 most days, sometimes a 2. No longer had to use pain killers like Tylenol 3! Unbelievable, the combination of the two drugs works on neuropathic pain like you wouldn't believe."""
Bipolar Disorder,9.0,"""I have been taking Neurontin at 1800-2100 mg/day after a nightmare trial on Seroquel. It felt like I was jettisoned up out of a deep, dark hole. Everyone comments on how I am myself again, and I agree. It also helps with nerve pain, sleep, and definitely stabilized my moods. I have only gained 3 pounds, and I attribute that more to the fact I am eating again at all (don't eat when cycling). This medicine is easily metabolized and has few drug interactions. I am grateful that my doctor recommended it, as well as the Cleveland Clinic. It has been around since 1998, so I think we are good to go."""
Neuropathic Pain,9.0,"""I had an intermittent stabbing pain in my thigh that was so painful that it would drop me to the ground. It was so intense that I would stress about it coming back. The only way I could describe it was like be struck by lightening for 10-15 seconds. When I saw my doctor, I was prescribed gabapentin for nerve pain. After the first time I took the pill, the pain was gone. It was a miracle for me! I was worried about possible side effects, even though I knew they were minimal. I took the pill at night so I wouldn't be affected by drowsiness. I had no side effects until I tried going off of the medication a few months later. A couple of days after my last pill, I had a few intense dizzy spells, but it was short lived and worth being pain free."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I was having terrible issue with anxiety which was resulting in severe and unrelenting headaches. Added to the fact that I am pre-menopausal, I had not felt like myself in at least a year.  I went to the psychiatrist who continued my Celexa and started me on a very small dose of Neurontin at 100 mg 3 times daily.  I am only taking it twice daily to avoid the foggy feeling.  It has only been 3 days and I can honestly say, I feel like a new person... or should I say, the person I used to be.  I was skeptical that Neurontin could do so much to relieve my anxiety, but it works for me, and my headache and constant neck tension/pain is gone.  I am so glad my psychiatrist realizes the benefits of this medication and that she prescribed it for me."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I have been dealing with anxiety, depression and was diagnosed as bipolar. I have been on Remeron at night to help me sleep and 1 mg or Klonopins 3 times a day. While that did help my depression, my panic attacks and anxiety still were horrible where I ruined a relationship just a day before I started the gabapentin. Now that I have taken this 3 times a day at 300 mg I have been able to rationalize and reason much better. I do notice I am a little dizzy at times but nothing horrible. If I only had this medication earlier I may not have lost my partner due to my actions."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,"""For years I had itchy ankles. Maddening. Treatment by MDs, dermatologists and podiatrists was hydrocortisone ointment. Worked briefly. Then a year ago I started having symptoms of neuropathy in my feet. Neither podiatrist nor MD could fix it. Went to neurologist. An eye-opening meeting with use of tuning forks and the like. This man knew his job. Put me on gabapentin, 100mg X 3 daily. The foot and leg pain diminished and changed character. It's still there but I can live with it. But the years-long itching disappeared totally. I sent him a fax about that. Downside, have noted mood changes and had to apologize to wife for being a jerk. I am 82."""
Hot Flashes,9.0,"""I had been on the brand name Nuerontin for my complex partial seizure disorder, since 1994. When the generic came out, I began taking it. I began experiencing menopause symptoms within two months. I was 36 years old at that time. Three months ago my neurologist put me back on the name brand. My symptoms have diminished greatly, but not completely. I think my condition is unique in that I took this medication while still in child bearing age. When my age increased, something about the generic formulations bio-availability actually induced menopause symptoms. I also know that the name brand is working as evidenced by weight gain which can be brought back down with exercise. I had lost weight, sleep, memory and sanity while on the generic."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,"""I started having RL at 15. Then I kept it to myself even when I would be up all night sometimes taking 5 hot baths bc I thought it was in my head. My Pdoc actually prescribed it because she had prescribed me adderall for ADD and it got SO bad. When mine hits it's literally like I want to claw/cut my legs off. kick them front to back, left to right, scratch them, hit them. Nothing helped. Gabapentin helped me immediately. To those of you who said it didn't help or it made you too sleepy... I was told to take mine at bedtime. Normally I take it 2-3 hours before. 900mgs. I gave it a 9 because I do have breakthrough spells, and bad clumsiness. Taking it 2-3 hours before makes me only be dizzy and clumsy before bed and not the next morning."""

Trigeminal Neuralgia,9.0,"""I have been on Gabapentin for a few years now and I have found it helping control the Trigeminal Neuralgia pain with 800mg 3x daily.  However, also have found that if I forget to take it consistently, the pain returns immediately.  I am hoping that it will continue to work for as long as needed.  Research I have done indicates that one usually can come off the medicines after 1 yr and that the pain does not return, but have not been so lucky.  I have not had any other side effects so far with it nor any other medication I have been prescribed for conditions.  One word of note, this medication did help but only after being on it for at least 2 weeks, so my recommendation would be - give it a chance to work when starting this medicine."""
Hot Flashes,9.0,"""I was prescribed Neurontin to treat neuropathy caused by chemotherapy.  The chemo had also caused menopause, and that was accompanied by numerous and horrible hot flashes and night sweats.  I honestly felt like I was going to spontaneously combust.  While on the Neurontin, the hot flashes were reduced, but I did not make a connection to the med, and when I was taken off of it (because it wasn't effective for my neuropathy), the hot flashes returned with a vengeance.  While searching online for alternative remedies for hot flashes (I can't take HRT due to cancer), I learned that Neurontin was effective and I made the connection from my previous use of the med.  I went back on it (300mgx3) and the hot flashes are under control again."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,"""I have been taking 1200 mg. twice a day for approx.10 years for peripheral neuropathy.

But I'm going to go up to 3000mg a day. Best medicine that I ever took!"""
Anxiety,9.0,"""Gabapentin is a miracle worker.

Fibromyalgia,9.0,"""I have been on gabapentin for over 15 years. I love this medication for my fibromyalgia. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I do have short term memory loss. That is one of the side effects. It also has been wonderful for my restless legs at night."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,"""I have been taking 600mg two hours before bedtime for a few years now for burning feet at night.  It usually works quite well. I have not had to increase my dosage and I have no side effects other than it makes me sleepy which is great at night."""

Pain,9.0,"""I have a bulging disc and low back that has displaced nerves.  I live with pain everyday due to fibromyalgia and arthritis, but this back pain is off the charts. Nothing helped.  Just started Neurontin this week.  Makes me feel a little tired, but tends to keep me awake.  So far it has knocked pain down to a level I can live with. If take pain medicine with it, don't feel any pain.  Am noticing my hands feel swollen hope it doesn't get worse as I tend to have the rare side effects on any medicine I take."""
Insomnia,9.0,"""My doctor suggested gabapentin for my leg cramps/restless legs and insomnia.  I was unable to sit for any period of time without my legs causing discomfort and would have very painful leg cramps.  I would find it hard to get to sleep and would wake up at 2 or 3 am every night. I have been taking gabapentin for a month and am very pleased....I have not experienced any of the severe symptoms that have been described by others."""
Insomnia,9.0,"""I was on and happy using SEROQUEL for sleep and was highly skeptical about trying GABA. I tried many other medicines to combat insomnia and they all proved not to work. I was pleasantly surprised how GABA worked. It helps keep me in very deep sleep for 6 hours. After that I wake up, but can easily get to sleep. The dreams are very vivid, but not unpleasant. I had to tweak my dosage however. I'm now at 1200 mg at night and sleep with total ease. Full disclosure, my insomnia has roots in anxiety, so this medicine proved to be effective because it helps with Anxiety too. I'm happy!"""
Pain,9.0,"""I suffer from Rheumatoid Arthritis and I've been in constant pain since my diagnosis 4 years ago.  The rheumatoid arthritis medications curbed the pain, but it was still 7 on a scale of 1-10 and it was debilitating.

Yes I minimize my medications, but this seems to help, now."""

Excruciating pain to the point I can't even stand the touch of a brush on my scalp on that side of my head or a face cloth on that side of my face...it's wicked pain that I'd do almost anything to get rid of.
This medicine works well. I take no other pain medicines other than Advil or Tylenol for other minor pain.

I do not have many side effects. I can tell if I miss a dose as withdrawal symptoms come rather quickly. I have not gained or lost weight. I am not overly tired and it does not make me feel restless.

I have taken many anti-diarrhoea medicines with little effect.I can now eat foods that caused cramping and urgent diarrhoea. I now also take laxatives every day.

I  hated the feeling! I thought okay I give it a couple days... During the day the constant pain was almost not persistent. It started hurting only in certain movements. Overall pain was a 3.

Only drawback is possibly some un-before-known mild brain-fog/mental fatigue: difficulty expressing a thought because the appropriate (common) word escapes me, difficulty with information recall (short term memory), ""spacing out"".

I feel much more rested, where as I had been taking naps any day I could, due to insomnia even on Ambien, and hardly need to now.  I do feel somewhat groggy, but I only take it at night, and it is 600 mg. dose."""
Pain,8.0,"""I have suffered from pain in both legs, related to arthritis in knees, ankles and toes. My doctor prescribed gabapentin 300mg (one capsule daily for one week; then twice daily  and thereafter). I got immediate relief of the pain and discomfort.  I felt some minor dizziness and sleepiness, but these effects were not lasting. I am keen to know if gabapentin will be permanently added to the list of medications."""
Fibromyalgia,8.0,"""I started feeling deep hot bone pain about 3 month ago and got worse and worse. My boyfriend  took me to a Rheumatologist.  All she did was touch my body at certain points.  I said ""Oh, that feels good"" and right away she knew it was fibromyalgia.   My dosage has been raised 3 times and now taking 800mg 3x a day.  Then I read it cause weight gain (gasp).  I wish I didn't read that part but overall today the fog is lifting and I have little pain here and there but I take Subutex for that.  I am also on dextroamphetamine  for the chronic fatigue and helps a lot.  Besides I've been diagnosed with ADHD."""
Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,8.0,"""Has been very helpful. However, I have experienced some side effects. I have had some problems with chest pain. After a heart cath, which was normal, I was started on metoprolol. No further cp.

Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,"""My experience began after 3 rotator cuff surgeries I developed swelling in legs&feet.

Pain,8.0,"""This medication is the only one that curtailed the pain of shingles.  I was taking 2 pills, twice a day, and 3 at night.  If you get shingles be sure to ask your Dr what the safest amount is you can take.  At first I was told to take one like, 3 times a day.  I kept going back and telling my dr that my pain was still severe.  It was a long process and a lot of undue pain.  In the very beginning,  gabapentin wasn't even prescribed, and I ended up in the emergency room due to excruciating pain.  The ER dr prescribed it....finally.  My pain was never really managed.  It's been 7 weeks and I feel like I might be able to lessen the dose soon.  Shingles is an awful disease."""
Anxiety,8.0,"""I was prescribed Gabapentin for anxiety/depression, after trying amitryptylline and citalopram, both of which did not work. My dose was 300mg Gabapentin 3x a day, however, this dose was causing me to have really achey joints so I stopped taking the evening one and now have one when I get up, and one at lunchtime. I can really feel the effects of the morning one, as, an hour after taking it I feel a little light headed and drunk, but very focused and determined. I am also sleeping better as my head isn't full of worries when I go to sleep like it used to be. Gabapentin does not make you feel sluggish and zombie-like like other meds, in fact I find them to be the opposite - I get loads done in a day which also helps me sleep."""
,8.0,"""I'm taking this as a trial to see if it will help with facial nerve damage from Bell's Palsy. The first and second dose made me feel like I was drunk. After the third dose, I felt fine.

Anxiety,8.0,"""AS like so many others have posted, I too have had major depression,bi-polar disorder,and anxiety.

I'll try ANYTHING to get my life back. ANYTHING"""
Fibromyalgia,8.0,"""After a nightmare of narcotic meds for my fibro I was put on 900mg a day of gabapentin. It didn't work right away, and I wanted to stop taking it. My doctor explained that it sometimes works like an anti depressant can: slowly. She told me to keep at it. Slowly I began to realize that I felt way better! My pain had eased, my sleep was more regular. I haven't experienced any side effects at all. It it is such a mild medicine and one I thank God for everyday. I am at a 1200mg a day dose and will probably increase that slowly as the need arises. I encourage anyone with fibromyalgia to try this med. It may not be narcotic, but it helps!! And thats all that matters."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,"""After six back related surgeries, I developed peripheral neuropathy. I was placed on Savella which helped some, but my neurologist decided to add Gralise as well. What had been absolutely terrible burning in both legs has been reduced with both of these medications. The Gralise was a helpful addition to the Savella. The question below regarding the insurance coverage; I had a blue cross plan which picked up about 40-50% then I recently purchased another blue cross plan which, at this moment in time, is not covering the Gralise, so my neurologist is trying to get them to authorize it."""
Insomnia,8.0,"""As I understand gabapentin, it was originally used to treat seizures but helps to keep you asleep but not necessarily, put you to sleep. My doctor is very wise but also very conservative but felt it is a rather benign drug so added it to my ambien. The combo has been very effective in giving me a full nights sleep. I live in Washington state so was encouraged by my naturopath to try medical marijuana. I take a capsule with THC only (no CBD as its about $5/pill) and it has been a Godsend with no discernible side effects.  I sleep like a baby. I still add about 200 mg gaba to keep me asleep. My only problem with gaba is I have blurred vision the next day. I understand from the fine print that this can be a side effect."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,"""I've been on Neurontin for over 2 years now, 3200 mg daily / 800 mg four times daily. 
It is the only medication that effectively controls the idiopathic neuropathy in my feet.

Neurontin has restored my quality of life to near normal."""

Bipolar Disorder,8.0,"""So far so good limited side effects."""
Pain,8.0,"""After 3 weeks of excruciating sciatic pain, due to herniated disc at L5-S1, I was prescribed Gabapentin. I was scared about the side effects so I only took a third of my daily dose, alongside naproxen and codeine. I noticed a change in my mood, very tearful and low also. The pain got worse, so I gave in, took the gabapentin as prescribed, continued with codeine and naproxen and then the pain became manageable within 3 weeks. I'm no longer on any drugs now apart from Gabapentin. My mood is better and I am sleeping better. The pain hits me when I walk for 5 minutes, especially going up a hill. Or when I sit/stand for too long. But my quality of life has improved with gabapentin. I am having surgery next week as the disc herniation is large."""
Hot Flashes,8.0,"""My relief from night sweats was totally unexpected. I was prescribed Gabapentin, Valacyclovir and Prednisone for my first shingles outbreak (OMG - the pain). I constantly evaluated my symptoms and side effects for improvement or anything weird. After four days it occurred to me I had not had any night sweats (I don't know exactly when they stopped, because this was something I wasn't monitoring). I have had night sweats for years and always sleep with a fan beside my bed.  So when I noticed no night sweats, I looked up all the medications to see if they affected night sweats. I checked Gabapentin last and was SHOCKED to see its association - and then I hit this forum. It was prescribed for nerve pain, but this side effect for me is AWESOME."""
Migraine,8.0,"""My neurologist put me on this after being on Topamax and propranolol for chronic migraines for 5 months. For the first time in 6 months, I haven't had a headache for 3  consecutive days and it's a miracle! Only thing is that I've been excessively thirsty and having some problems with my vision/dizziness, but she warned me that I would likely experience the dizziness. Such a change in my life."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,8.0,"""Restless legs and peripheral neuropathy. Got rid of restless legs 5 or 6 out of 7 nights.  Hard to say if it tones down neuropathy as it is all over the place.

Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,"""Have bad periheral neuropathy in feet  - with periods of intense burning pain and last few months pain/numbness was getting much worse, especially at night.  Wasn't excited about using gabapentin because of all the possible side effects listed.  Finally went to Doctor who prescribed 300 mg at bedtime, but instructed could do 600 mg if necessary.  Took for first time last night, 300 mg didn't seem to make much of a difference in pain so after about an hour, took another 300 mg.  I was very surprised this morning at how much the burning pain had subsided!  Am feeling a little sluggish/mellow today, hopefully that won't be a lasting side effect after my body gets used to the drug."""
Hot Flashes,8.0,"""I'm a transwoman who after 2+ years on estradiol was taken off it ""cold turkey"" after having a mini-stroke. The hospital doctors figured that the estradiol had contributed to my mini-stroke and took me off it rather abruptly. Within a week of quitting the estradiol I started having terrible hot flashes that would last 15-20 minutes followed by icy cold spells that lasted  5-10 minutes , I was fairly certain I was dying ! My ob/gyn  prescribed Gabapentin 100 mg capsules once a day and within 2 weeks most of the hot flashes subsided. Now I get hot flashes once or twice a day rather than four to six times, I have to say my quality of life has improved considerably !"""
Neuropathic Pain,8.0,"""I got prescribed Neurontin(gabopentin) back last year for nerve pain due to a damaged sciatic nerve from an epidural gone wrong, however I have also noticed that it helps with my seizures as well, and I strained my lower back, and had to go to the ER but got out and took some Neurontin and I have hardly any pain now while I recooperate and the only side effect is that it makes me slow and sleepy. I have been nodding off a lot, but I slept awesomely last night and barely even budged. I also take Wellbutrin and Buspirone as well, for anxiety and depression."""
Pain,8.0,"""Was prescribed gabapentin for. Restless burning legs at nite 300 mg. I heard some bad review is so didn't  really take it. Got hurt at work aggravating my sciatica in my left leg and knee to the point that nothing took the pain away.

Hot Flashes,8.0,"""I have been taking Gabapentin for hot flashes for only about a week and I can sleep at night and I am not soaked in sweat every hour or so.  I can even sleep through most of the night now without waking with hot flashes and hubby is not freezing.  Thank you gabapentin for giving me back my life.  I do have some minor light headed feelings if I stand up or turn quickly but I can live with this.  It's a small price to pay for sleep and not being soaked from hot flashes all the time."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,8.0,"""This is my first night on Gabapentin and I am laying in my bed with my laptop as comfortable as can be. I feel normal.  The past year has been brutal and my restless legs syndrome got exponentially worse which led to higher anxiety issues and depression.

Apparently, this medicine starts working better as time goes by which is great for me."""

These are taken in divided doses. At first I didn't notice anything but today I woke up and I didn't have a headache (I've had daily headaches along with frequent severe migraines for the past 3 straight months).  A mild one came and went a few times today but I feel better.  I'm a bit sleepy and I've been having some trouble remembering things (words, what I've done, etc.) and I've noticed that I've been a little more moody (not by much) but overall I'm happy that my headaches have improved.  They were ruining my life."""

After several weeks I started to get twinges of pain around my left upper lip area which progressed to include the whole left side of my face. Thinking this was all about my teeth I saw my dentist.  He took x-rays and did an examination and told me he thought I had TN.  My NP too suggested TN and will be referring me to a Neurologist.  In the meantime I am taking Neurontin 300mg 3x each day. The pain did not stop but has gradually lessened over the 1st week.  Looking forward to pain free days!"""
Pain,8.0,"""Severe burning nerve pain from Shingles on side of my face and scalp. Pain was so severe it broke me down. Standard pain medications (tylenol, etc) were not strong enough to take even the edge of my pain. 

Doctor prescribed this. Took two days to fully work. Now I'm aprox 90% pain free. Taking 300 mg three times a day. When I first started taking it I right away it made me very drowsy--enough to overshadow the pain to get a bit of sleep. I was grateful for at least that. This drug has also has a nice relaxing effect. It still makes me drowsy. I'm o.k. with that as it is helping me rest so I can recover. I know drugs don't work for everyone, but I'm grateful it is working for me. Winter 2016"""

I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 6 months ago and I am still not certain it just wasn't my back issues now that I had several MRI scans this past month. I was given a cortisone injection in the spin and prescribed this medicine along with Percocet which I find I only need between dosages of Gabepentin if I let it wear off. Amazing, this medicine, the very first dose kicked in 2 hours after taking it. I felt more clear in the mind than ever since I have ADHD as well. I didn't get tired but I did have a very clear calming effect. My pain reduced 10 fold. I really feel great and extremely happy with the result."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,"""I have severe diabetic peripheral neuropathy and I've been administered several different medicines to treat my symptoms.

Pain,8.0,"""I take it for my nerve pain and it helps tremendously.  I usually don't have to take any pain pills due to it anymore.  I also take it for migraine prevention.  I have not noticed much of a difference yet with that, but works great for nerve pain."""

It was usually gone after about a week or so.  

About ten years ago I mentioned it to my family doc who sent me to a nerve specialist.  He diagnosed it right away and prescribed Neurontin.  Now, when I feel the first jab coming on, I take one or 2 pills and follow it up with additional pills until the pain goes away, usually in 2 or 3 days.

I did not take it this morning and am hoping by weekend to be on the 2x a day as doctor prescribed.  I had the first full nights sleep in over 3 years.

Gongenital spinal stenosis from L5 down

This has caused a lot of pressure on my sciatic nerve and severe pain down my entire left leg, mostly at the hip but moves around.

I started with Norco...it was not even as good as ibuprofin for the pain. Stopped after a week

Next was tramadol...same results as norco, barely any relief

Back got worse, needed 2nd surgery and had to get off some medicines, getting off Neurontin was the WORST WITHDRAWALS. 6 months after doctor's put me back on Neurontin but only 1800mg.

Postherpetic Neuralgia,8.0,"""I have nerve damage caused by surgery for removal of a Bartholin's Gland cyst. The nerve damage causes me constant pain, when untreated, from a scale of 8-10. The Gralise (along with Norco) makes it tolerable and in the mornings, sometimes my pain goes all the way down to a 4 (not every morning). The side effects I have are dizziness, inability to find words, blurred vision, and, strangely (because of where my pain is), increased libido. I can't even sit in a chair, yet all I think about all day is sex. The Grailise has helped a lot with my pain, but I only rated it an eight because of all of the potential side effects. As soon as my doctor finds another treatment (like a nerve block), I'm going to get off of it."""

I started the Gabapentin and now am up to 600mg three times daily. I have some side effects such as dizziness, sweating, confusion and headaches but it is beginning to reduce the pain level to almost tolerable. I've only been on it for a couple of weeks but hope it will increase the pain management where I can reduce the Norco to once or twice a day. Thanks for the reviews above. They have helped me."""

Been on Neurontin for 10 days, 300 Mgs 3xday. Headaches are virtually GONE.  Kidneys functioning better now that I'm off of Topamax.  Increased appetite and slightly blurry vision are manageable side effects. My life is back. So far, the headache suffering is OVER. 4 months of hellish headaches ended in one week."""
Pain,8.0,"""I take Norco for chronic pain in my back and leg. My tolerance for was very high, though when I was dosed up on it I could do my job very well (construction laborer). Gabapentin 300mg 3x day has helped. On the first day I expected immediate relief but felt nothing and was going to call the doctor in the morning to complain. When I woke after sleeping through the night for the first time in a while, I was surprised that my back pain was diminished to the point that I was surprised. After reading here other reviews, I going to have my dosage upped to see if it can completely cut off my pain. I am pending an MRI and likely epidural procedure. Side effect though, when I try to work, I can feel my (extensive) injuries."""
Vulvodynia,8.0,"""Neurontin plus physical therapy for my previously unrecognized pelvic bone rotation has basically cured my vulvadynia which also involved horrendous skin irritation (raw, bleeding skin) in the area between my clitoris and vagina. What a miraculous combination! I strongly urge women to find out if they have nerve issues created by pelvic tilt/rotation/etc by going to a women's health/pelvic pain physical therapist. The therapy is sometimes painful but the results are great, and people who specialize in this are very very kind and sympathetic! Neurontin is the icing on the cake for the cure. Calms nerves and allows them to return to normal"""
Insomnia,8.0,"""I was prescribed gabapentin for sleep 200 mg. This is my first week giving it a go, I will post back after one week. I have been ulta sensitive to other given, I am hopeful this one will work. My sister takes it for nerve pain with success..."""
Alcohol Withdrawal,8.0,"""I have been taking gabapemtin now for 7 months and can't believe how good this medication works..not only for RLS, but for craving alcohol. These pills (800mgx3) plus AA is sobriety all the way."""
Migraine,8.0,"""I've been suffering with horrible migraines with stroke like symptoms for years, I didn't think there was anything out there but pain killers for this condition. I have been taking Gabapentin for about 4 months, and I love it. I have never felt so good. No migraines now. Aside for a few heart racing episodes and tiredness in the beginning, the medication is working well."""
Bipolar Disorder,8.0,"""I've only been taking this medication for under a week, 300mg x 3 times/day. Pdoc Rx'd it for my BP1, and as an adjuct treatment for insomnia and anxiety. My first few doses I felt pleasantly drugged and mellow. It had a moderate cannaboid effect and even gave me the munchies and had me babbling. It has lessened quickly. This med must be working on the brains gaba receptors indeed for I've had a general sense of wellbeing and calmness. 
Side effects: increased appetite, some minor drowsiness/loopiness, some dipsomania, and strangely...a frequent need to ""stretch out"" my muscles. I'm going to continue this medication, and even ask about a higher dose. More time on it will reveal how well this treats my conditions."""
Fibromyalgia,8.0,"""So far Gabapentin is working well.  It took about a month and a quick round of Prednisone for it to kick in but I am noticing a marked decrease in the pain. Effexor and Trazodone combined with it has been effective."""
Fibromyalgia,8.0,"""Gabapentin helps a lot with my fibromyalgia pain, although I find that I have to keep taking higher and higher doses to have the same effect. I also have had some weight gain, which I hate. I don't know which is better, being chubby or feeling better. For now I'm going to say with it."""
Anxiety,8.0,"""I way prescribed 300 mg Neurontin for anxiety and it has been amazing.

Am asking if this is normal that pain increased  at 300 mg. Am concerned about increase. Am hoping from reading other reviews that pain will decrease. Had to use oxycodone 5-10 mg a day which I hate because it makes me sleepy."""
Pain,8.0,"""I have been taking this medication for nerve pain in my leg. I have a ruptured disc in my back which is causing me severe nerve pain down my leg. Pain medicines do not work on me so I had been suffering for awhile. No sleep and lots of pain. Not good! My doctor put me on this medicine and I can now function better. I have gotten much needed sleep and overall feel a little better. There are side effects though. I would stay very groggy and would lose some fine motor skills for quite awhile after waking up in the morning. I found that if I lessened the dose the effects were much less. I do have more pain throughout the day but I am more alert and functional. I think the drug has helped me a lot."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,8.0,"""In my research on RLS I found that iron deficiency could also be a contributing factor.  I have found that the combination of 300 mg of Neurontin twice daily and Hemocyte Plus once daily gives me the most relief from the symptoms of RLS than anything in years."""

Pain,8.0,"""For over 6 months severe pain from diabetic neuropathy and nephropathy - constant 6 to 9 in almost every major joint in the body - shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, hips, knees, ankles, feet - except right hip - 3.... not helped at all by musculoskeletal pain killers.

Gabapentin at 900 mg halved those pain levels ... but increased legs edema by 10% and scales weight by 2kg, and added lower back pain stenosis at 8 - discovered that liquid morphine sorted that out.

Even if back not sorted it would still have been wonderful just to have a change in what hurt."""
Pain,8.0,"""Have 24/7 headache ( nonspecific ) from what I personally believe to be from anticholinergic pharmaceuticals. I am highly educated, so I have knowledge about these things. It rates on a scale of level 9 most of the time ( pain ). I had a PCP that put me on nine 600mg. gabapentins a day ( 5,400mgs. per day ). He obviously calculated wrong. On them for about 2 years. I was on heavy doses of other pharms for other reasons. Got off of 9 meds over 10 month period. I was down to 3  600mg gabapentins. Pain level 9. Went up to. three  900mgs. gabs. Pain now level 4. I don't know how long it will last. Only side effects are tingling feet and constipation. I feel like it is a good med. because opiates destroyed me. 10 months opiate free."""
Fibromyalgia,8.0,"""Very good response with pain and stiffness. Added to fibro-fog. This has been very well tolerated with nothing more than a little itching when ready for next dose.

Pain,8.0,"""I had a 23 week gestational premature baby. I was on severe bed rest with an existing compressed disk. My L5 ripped/ruptured and leaks fluid. The surgery to get my daughter out was very invasive and they gave me a spinal tap in my C7/8. They hit a nerve big time. So I am in constant pain. My daughter is fine now. However, I too take pain medicine, which I prefer not to. Vicodin, Norco, Percocet, tramadol and now Gabapentin. Which really works! Very well. Helps the anxiety pain puts you through. Helps withdrawal from pain meds. At first it gets you loopy but your body begins to adapt. But its worth not being on a narcotic for years.

Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,"""I have taken gabapentin for about 10 years for Peripheral Neuropathy. For several years I took the maximum dosage per day. I found my memory slipping and becomming more severe as time passed. I finally quit for about two months, only to return to 300 mg four times daily. This stopped almost all of the memory problems and the lighter dosage keeps the pain down to a low roar. Gabapentin is the best I have found for the pain."""
Insomnia,8.0,"""Zolpidem (Ambien) plus melatonin didn't work very well. I had pain from various conditions, and 5-10 mg of hydrocodone (Norco) helped with the pain, but I don't want to be on narcotics the rest of my life. I tried GABA to help out, at the advice of my sleep doctor. At 600 mg each night, the GABA had no effect at all, so I discontinued usage. Now, however, another doctor has said maybe my dose should be higher, so I've taken 1200 mg each night. Very strong effect at that level and I slept 9 1/2 hours! However, it took a while before it had any effect, and it left me groggy and dizzy the next morning. Next, I'm going to take 1200 mg at 7 pm instead of 9pm.
I suspect that after a few weeks at this dosage, I'm going to become accustomed to it."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,8.0,"""My restless legs syndrome was actually whole body sort of vibrating, and came on very suddenly. 100 mg gabapentin, and I could sleep again! But every month had to add 100mg, got to 1000mg, then tried reducing 100 / month, realized after 2 months that I really needed the 900, not sure if that was withdrawal, but felt like I simply needed that much - so had a really good month. Then suddenly symptoms flared up, and even 1300 only just works. """
Bipolar Disorder,8.0,"""I have been unable to tolerate any if the other mood stabilizers I have been on.  Gabapentin 900 mg daily was my initial dosage and I felt relief from my severe anxiety and irritability for the first couple days, then it subsided and only helped calm it down somewhat.  I just saw doc today & it's going up to 1800 mg daily.  Hopefully I can feel more normal again."""
Hot Flashes,8.0,"""Had been on Gabapentin 600 mg a day for neuropathy in hand from injury.  Had been having hot flashes 12 + times in 24 hours.

Anxiety,8.0,"""15 years old, severe anxiety.  My Dr. prescribed this medication for me to take on occasion when I needed it.  It worked beautifully, and I could go to dances and loud bars and restaurants again.  Although it did not removed my anxiety completely, it did get rid of at least 90%, and that was enough to get me through these situations.  However, very recently I have noticed that it has stopped working and instead gives me horrible dizziness and lets my anxiety roam free.  I do take another medication for anxiety as well as another for depression.  Anyhow, my gabapentin has been fought off by my body and I am going to have to switch meds again (I was on another medicine that I became immune to 4 months ago and have to switch then).  Sigh."""

After taking ropinirole I am up for at least 2-3 hours wrestling with my legs.  Tonight I decided to skip ropinirole, and take another 300mg of gabapentin.  Not sure yet if it will work.  Going to bed soon.  I am standing while writing this."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,"""Feet had severe pain, legs were jumping at night. Dr. put me on 300mg per evening per day. My feet and legs are much much better and able to sleep during the night.  After 3 weeks, I feel like a new person, able to walk in Home Depot and Wal Mart without the motorized buggy.

Bipolar Disorder,8.0,"""I started taking gabapentin experimentally to treat chronic depression and am now prescribed 1800mg a day.  At doses of 2700mg I experienced a significant improvement in impulse control and depression in general.  Went from being a shut in, to going for walks and enjoying my time in the company of others.  At the lower dose of 1800mg a day, I don't experience much improvement, save for a decrease in depressive symptoms.  I'm looking forward to a larger dose if my doctor okays it."""
Anxiety,8.0,"""I have pretty severe PTSD with some generalized free-floating anxiety.  When the Klonopin just wasn't cutting it anymore, and I'd tried so many other drugs (Atarax, Remeron, Buspar....) with no relief, I finally convinced my doctor to let me give Gabapentin a try.  I also have chronic pain symptoms, so I thought that there was a chance it would help with that (it only helped a little), but literally, with my first dose I felt like a ton of weight had been lifted from my shoulders.  I was happy and not anxious.  Unfortunately, it petered out on me over a few months.  I taper off and after a few months get back on.  Still works!"""
Anxiety,8.0,"""I personally am a heavier person, i have a lot of anxiety and depression on a daily basis and its been this way since i was 14. Im now 18 and i've been using many different prescriptions for my anxiety and depression and i've found benzos work well. But recently I was prescribed gabapentin 300mg 4 times a day and I found that it does affect your coordination taking this much of a dose but amazingly took away all my anxiety without any xanax like I usually take and it worked even better for my depression. I do feel a buzz almost as many users report when they first start, which i don't mind as i work from home and enjoy it but this could be a problem for addiction. Luckily I'm only using it temporarily and not long term."""
Neuropathic Pain,8.0,"""Started to take Gabapentin for nerve pain 3x100mg daily. Even this low dose gave me headaches and migraine. I increased my intake of water and as the days went by I was able to increase the dosage as suggested by my doctor and the headaches ceased. The pharmacist did suggest that Gabapentin can dehydrate and dehydration can lead to headaches."""
Neuropathic Pain,8.0,"""Mostly I feel confident about taking Gabapentin. I am on a small dose, 100mg 2/day.  Occasionally I get twitchy feet and/or hands plus mild shakes like tremors.  This does worry me but it doesn't happen too often.  I did put it down to when  I double my usual intake of alcohol.  It takes a couple of days to get back on track.  It is depressing that there are people out there worse off than me"""
Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,"""I am a 58 year old female. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia 14 years ago but have suffered from symptoms much longer. I have also suffered from foot clumsiness since I was 13. Many ankle sprains and one broken ankle. The last two years I have been falling about once every two weeks. My feet have both felt numb and in pain at the same time. A neurologist checked the nerve transmission speeds to and from my feet. Thankfully he very tactfully said ""Your feet don't FEEL normal but the ARE normal."" So no true neuropathy. My fibromyalgia doctor then prescribed an increased dose of Neurontin. (Tripled my previous dose). Although I am sleepy, the results have been a startling improvement in the neuropathy."""
Migraine,8.0,"""I was having migraine headaches twice per week then gradually it became every day for 3 months. Midrin was no longer working. I was incapacitated. Yesterday, I was prescribed gabapentin 300mg twice per day. First day it took 1 1/2 hours to kick in then I fell asleep. When I woke 6 hours later I felt drunk and my coordination and walking ability were impaired as if drunk. I worried about falling. Yet for the first time in 3 months, my migraine was present but at a level ""4"" verses a pain level of constant ""10"".  An unexpected additional gain was that it helped my unresolved back pain of the neuropathic (burning) variety. I highly rate it except for side effects of in-coordination, slightly blurred vision and word finding problems."""
Neuropathic Pain,8.0,"""I have a nerve in my left foot that goes crazy at night. It doesn't bother me during the day. Without Gabapentin I would get practically no sleep. But, I have had to increase the dosage over time to get relief. I started five years ago at 900 mg a day. But, now it takes 4200 to 5400 mg a day to shut it down, but I only take it at night (between 6 pm and 3:00 AM). I can't take it during the day - makes me too tired. 

The main side effect that really bothers me is poor balance - you can walk ""right."" But, the podiatrist can't find the nerve. If she could find it she could just go in and shut it down. That's where I'm at - as soon as she shuts that thing down I'll get off these pills and get back to a normal life."""
Fibromyalgia,8.0,"""Chronic finger twitching.  I use this drug for my fibromyalgia that attacks my face.  I cry out in pain when the cycle last anywhere from 2-6 weeks.  Even my hydrocodone doesn't work on my face.  Gabapentine works great on taking the edge off. The only side effect I don't like is the chronic finger twitching."""
Anxiety,8.0,"""Like many of you, I have tried several SNRI's and SSRI's..None work after a certain time period, and nearly all cause weight gain. I am thrilled that I might have actually found a solution to my chronic depression especially given this med is meant more for Bi-polar which is not my diagnosis. I have energy for the first time in years, no weight gain, no increase in appetite! Sleeping great and waking up with energy. I'm almost afraid to write this because I may jinx it but I feel great.. I am only on 200 mg. split up twice a day and I don't need to increase at this point so I'm sticking with this low dose. very happy so far. I hope this review helps other who have struggled with finding a solutions to chronic depression.."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,"""Gabapentin is the only thing I have found that reduces the chronic pain of a pinched nerve. I did gain a lot of weight since it has reduced my motivation. Also have acne which I never had before. Muscles feel tight and when working out they become sore quickly. No sense of anxiety, very calm. A lot of small side effects including almost zero sex drive, but the reduction of the BURNING, CRUSHING NEEDLE FILLED sensation in my foot it is worth it. Great medicine for severe, chronic pain."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,"""I have been having such a bad time with my left thigh & down to my left foot, the burning, shooting bolts of the worse burning pain I ever felt! On a pain level, a 12! Out of a 10! I took a 300mg GABAPENTIN & in 10-15 minutes the pain is a 6-7 outta a 10, I usually get the PN at night, it's 2:33 p.m. right now! Thank God & do for this medicine! I have controlled diabetes 2 & severe back ruptures & spinal stenosis! But, DON'T want operations as I am afraid of being paralyzed, doctors told me it was a slim possibility of that! They have to go through the front to get to my back, C-4 to L-5, otherwise, split like a trout! Thanks, but, no thanks!"""
Anxiety,8.0,"""I have severe anxiety and have been taking Gabapentin for a week, gradually building up to 3 x 300mg a day. Within an hour of taking it I notice a heady, slightly drunk sensation and feel a little 'high', but this passes and I'm finding my thoughts are more organized, I have more energy and I can get more things done. Because I'm more active during the day, I am sleeping better and longer at night. My heart is no longer continually racing, and my chest pains have diminished. Another good thing is that these tablets do not make you feel desensitized, or like a zombie. All in all I would say these are definitely working for me."""
Neuropathic Pain,8.0,"""Degenerative disc pain. Pinched nerve root L4-L5, from arthritic bone spurs. Was on oxycodone for months. Doc gave me this to get me off the oxy's. By god, it worked. I was truly skeptical, but my pain levels are assuredly reduced, and the side affects are minor. The oxys really didn't block the hardcore nerve signals that fire when the nerve is pinched by walking or movements. Lightning bolts of pain would shoot right through the meds. This at least makes the pain tolerable."""
Fibromyalgia,8.0,"""Was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia at the start of the year having suffered with severe neck and upper back pain.  The deep pain especially in the upper back right in between the shoulder blades was unbearable most of the time.  I had the symptoms for over 2 years before the diagnosis and had almost 80 sessions of treatment with 11 different therapists. 

Anyway started taking duloxetine, gabapentin and Cocodamol in January.  Started gabapentin at 300 mg a day and built up to 1800mg a day by the end of March.  Over the last few weeks I feel that I am starting to get my life back.  Not totally pain free but I now have spells where the pain is bearable.  So if you have just started on this,  be patient and fingers crossed you will get relief."""
Bipolar Disorder,8.0,"""Was quite effective in combination with Seroquel.  I felt A LOT better!  Drymouth and sleepiness were the only real side effects and they weren't that harsh.  Easy to use."""
Fibromyalgia,8.0,"""I take 4 doses of 300mg Gabapentin every day, and it completely interrupts my regular daily pain cycle.  It is also an excellent analgesic enhancer when taken with other pain meds.  No side effects that other than mild sedation, and nothing like brain-numbing Lyrica."""
Pain,8.0,"""I live with chronic back and neck pain from an accident. I have been on every narcotic available and now use fentanyl patches. The patches work for everything except the nerve pain in my neck, shoulder and left arm. I couldn't get any relief from the pain, especially at night trying to sleep. My doctor put me on Neurontin about 2 weeks ago and what a relief. Amazing that Neurontin took away that pain."""
Fibromyalgia,8.0,"""I am 49 and been suffering with fibromyalgia for years. I have been disabled because of it. Six weeks ago I had the worst flare up in years and the pain was so overwhelming I barely left the house. I got a new doctor who gave me Gabapentin and started me out on the lowest dose possible. I had never heard of it but assumed because of the low dose, 100 mg to start with it would take a while to feel any effects. I woke up the next morning almost pain free. I felt like I won the lottery. I don't understand what or why it worked so fast but I thank God for it. I do have drowsiness but it's well worth it. I have had some pain some then and am still building up my dosage but my quality of life has improved drastically in just a few days."""
Hot Flashes,8.0,"""I was prescribed gabapentin two years ago to help with night sweats, coincidentally I noticed that having always had mild to moderate anxiety I was much calmer and only became anxious as a result of a problem or crisis. recently I had an illness with nausea and loss of appetite, so stopped all my medications for 2 weeks. My anxiety went through the roof with panic attacks almost constantly, I have since found stopping Gabapentin abruptly is a no no, I took one 300mg last night and feel like my old self already, having had a nights sleep, after 2 weeks of insomnia. I think Gabapentin works extremely well, and I have no side effects. I hope my Dr doesn't ever want me to stop taking them, but if he does I now know it has to be a gradual process."""
Pain,8.0,"""I have severe sciatica in my right leg and horrible back pain due to two herniated discs, and severe spinal stenosis from an injury.

Insomnia,8.0,"""I take Phentermine 37.5 and a side effect is horrible insomnia. I went almost a solid two weeks before I called my doc to help me find something that would keep me sleeping through the night. She gave me GABA. I take it 30 minutes prior to when I want to get to sleep with my 75mg of Topirimate and my Spironolatone and within the hour, I'm out. I'm very sensitive to medication also. But I woke up feeling refreshed and not at all zombie-like. I woke up at 2am to give my son a bottle and diaper change with no problem waking up and going back to sleep. I've only taken this medicine for four nights but very happy on it so far!! As I said I am very sensitive to medication so finding one that doesn't make me have lingering side effects is great!"""
Hot Flashes,8.0,"""Have been taking Neurontin for 6 days, dramatic decrease in number and severity of hot flushes!"""
Neuropathic Pain,8.0,"""I had been having severe, migratory joint and muscle pain, along with horrific idiopathic itching. We tried everything (anti-histamines, steroids, etc) with no effect, finally trying gabapentin. It was like a miracle: the joint pain and terrible itching went away. However, I developed secondary pain--a deep, horrible ache in both thighs. It took me two months to even figure out that the pain in my legs was caused by the gabapentin (first of all, I suffer from RA, so pain is common; second, gabapentin is supposed to help with pain, not cause it, so this was confusing).  I went off the gabapentin (note: always consult a physician and taper down!), and sure enough, the debillitating thigh pain that I'd been suffering so long went away."""
Migraine,8.0,"""In August 2012 my migraines suddenly got disabling! It was constant and horrible! I saw a neurologist in early Dec. and he ordered Gabapentin, starting at 1 pill and then increasing weekly up to 4 pills. It's mid January and I am still only taking 2 pills because I am always tired and a little nauseated. I need to increase it though because, as another reviewer said, it makes everything ""muted"" but not completely. I have had some migraines but nothing horrible like before. So for that reason - this medication is wonderful! But I have one side effect that I wonder if it is from gabapentin - I feel extremely mean and annoyed. It's very noticeable to my family. Has anyone else had this side effect?"""
Pain,8.0,"""I had shingles and if anyone has ever had it knows the pain is excruciating.  Doctor prescribed me Gabapentin 300mg along with another pain med.  I started with one a day for 3 days and then 2 a day for 3 days then 3 a day for 3 days.  This drug may not help all but for  me it was a life saver.  The pain was really bad everyday and I also had to work so when I took meds I had to make sure I ate a good meal so it would not mess up my stomach or make me sleepy.  It also a good night rest medicine when you have shingles and I hate taken pain meds ."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,"""I take 900 mgs a day. It makes the burning sensation in my hands and feet go away. But the pain in my shoulders and arms is still present and the side effects are worse than the disease!!! I experience tremors, blurred vision, loss of memory, dizziness and drowsiness. I'm a mother of three and I can hardly function, but I do anyway.  I still have very little use of my left side. If my neurologist thinks it's best, then who am I to argue. It does work. But for ME, the side effects are a tad bit annoying for a full time mom."""
Pain,8.0,"""I have a bulging disc (C4) which traps a nerve leading to severe pain in my right shoulder (at worst) and a near constant tingling and semi-numbness in my left lower arm and hand (at best). I've taken Gabapentin before and had been reluctant to try them again because of the drowsiness, fatigue and general weirdness I felt the last time, but the pain got the better of me and so I capitulated. I take 1200mg 3 times a day and so far the sharp shoulder pain has gone, however the tingling has not. Apart from having great difficulty coming to full wakefulness on a morning, I feel completely hyperactive and a little manic- not a bad thing as I'm getting a lot done!"""
Alcohol Withdrawal,8.0,"""I have been taking gabapentin for years.  Started after stopped drinking. Had a recent 3 mos alcoholic relapse and continued taking gabapentin during and after. Have been surprised by how easy the alcohol withdrawal has been.  Am also taking Antabuse to avoid a slip but I don't think this is supposed to help reduce the desire to drink.  Anyway, the biggest reason I wanted to post is that I want to caution anyone who tries to get off gabapentin to do so very slowly like maybe reduce by 100 mg or 10% /week whichever is less. I have had horrible anxiety, shivers, sweats, racing thoughts, sleepnessless, pain and more trying to get off it.  """
Pain,8.0,"""I have used Gabapentin for 5 years now. It was initially prescribed to me for fibromyalgia. I now only take it so I can sleep at night. It doesn't help with my pain, but it makes me fall asleep and stay asleep all night. The only downside I have found is that my body has become very dependent on it. This is inconvenient because I can't sleep without it, so If I forget my medication it is absolutely impossible to fall asleep."""
Epilepsy,8.0,"""I am 30 years old, and I have epilepsy.  I just came off of Tegretol and only on gabepentin after asking my neurologist if I could please.  At single doses of 600mg 3 times a day, I feel like my anxiety goes away, but my head can feel groggy.  I actually have panic attacks, anxiety attacks, depression as a result of epilepsy.  I do like Gabapentin if it prevents seizures.  Last night I felt nuts, and racing thoughts.  Maybe I need to up my doses to 1200mg at night instead of 600mg.  I do sleep very well once I do crash.

My pain was gone immediately. However, within two weeks I called the doctor back complaining of increased foot pain. He increased the dose to one 300 mg capsule twice a day.

I found that if I missed a few dose's or just took it as needed to control the pain and not as the doctor ordered, that it would cause me to have severe cramps in the calf region that were extremely excruciating.
I would also like to add that I have taken this drug while ""Detoxing"" from alcohol. It did a fantastic job at controlling the ""Delirium Tremors"" or ""Shakes"" as well as controlling the ""Sweats"" and ""Insomnia"" associated with alcohol withdrawal."""

I have 400mg/3x day for typical days and she prescribed 600 mg for my bad days. However, the 600 mg makes me feel very spacey and unable to focus, slightly headachey.

I still wake up with minimal back pain but that soon goes away after I'm up and moving around.  The added benefit is I also have restless leg syndrome, so I kill two birds at once.

When the shingle scabs had fallen and my doctor said the episode was over, I had no pain.

1) I was very clumsy and disoriented.  I couldn't walk right and almost fell over several times.  
2)  I laid down to watch a movie, since I was stumbling around my house, and I ended up passing out for hours... from about 3 to almost 7 today.

Unfortunately, I have had to add other medicines to gabapentin overtime to help with the burning pain.  I added Lyrica and then Cymbalta.  I'm on 3600 mgs of gabapentin along with the other two medications.  My burning is pretty bad again.  Gabapentin worked for awhile but, now I need to switch medicines.

However, I did notice that my tolerance to its sedating effects built up rapidly, and by night 4 on 300mg my insomnia reared its stubborn head again. By night 6 I was determined to sleep well, so I upped my dose to 600mg.

Because of my family and work obligations some times I have to skip a dose so I can function properly. Also I have trouble with my memory. I am a huge trivia buff but right now it is hard for me to remember anything, I have not put on much weight but it does seem that after I take a dose and eat then I am hungry and can not get full.

Hoping I don't have to get off of the medicine because it is really helping me, but man am I tired."""

I'm only on 600 mg a day (been on it for 4 days), and I know my body is still adjusting to it, so this might be a hasty review... but it's given me a calming feel, helped a little with racing thoughts, but I feel ""high,"" at times like I'd drank a lot of codeine.

Peripheral Neuropathy,7.0,"""I take 800 mg TID, which seems to me a high dose. It's still a bit hit or miss on neuropathic pain coverage. When it works it's great! I know it works from comparison to the week- or month-long periods I've not taken it, when the pain is much worse. Still, it can't compare to other meds I've tried like Cymbalta which provide awesome pain control (downside to Cymbalta is insomnia tho). Narcotic pain meds work somewhat too, but mainly by changing my attitude towards the pain, not really lowering it, so they are a poor option for me."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,7.0,"""I use Gabapentin to treat pain and burning (feet) caused by a small fiber neuropathy (confirmed by biopsy). I take a relatively small dose (1200 mg) at night when symptoms are worst. I usually get adequate relief, enough to sleep, on most nights.

They have helped now after 2 years of taking them and I'm used to them but the beginning side effects really kicked in for me. I don't think I will be able to stop taking them either.

The numbness over my right rib cage is nearly unbearable. 12 doctors want to ease the pain, but no one wants to find out WHY! Plus, they are not very good at easing the pain. Now they want to put a neural stimulator in me and if it's anything like a TENS machine, all it will do is irritate me. I will not go off the Gabapentin until my diagnosis.

I noticed no ill effects from this combination. I was able to function, multitask, strategize and work as a purchaser without problem.

Neuropathic Pain,7.0,"""Had surgery for Morton's Neuroma in March 2013 which resulted in nerve pain on left foot. Prescribed gabapentin with various other drugs over 2 years in order to achieve the right mix. This was a disaster. Side effects were intolerable & frightening. Eliminated the other drugs and am now (after a 2nd surgery in 2015) on only gabapentin, but at a ridiculous dosage of 4800mg daily. This gives a tolerable level with the foot pain and numbness, but does nothing for any lower back or sciatic pain relief. I have the usual side effects of blurred vision, tired and drowsy, and instant memory loss which has become quite annoying. Started to reduce the dosage to a more sane level. Hoping for 1800mg per day but doubt it. We'll see how it goes."""

Transverse Myelitis,7.0,"""My max dosage was 300mg 3xdaily, it eased the worst of the neuralgia(stinging and burning) and even the numb/tingling sensation. However, it interacted poorly with all other medications I took. I could not mix it with Baclofen nor ANY OTC allergy medicines that were effective for me. Outside of medication interaction I had one side effect; not being able to orgasm, which was hard enough due the lack of normal sensation I have. I did discontinue the Gabapentin but only because I needed effective allergy control more than I wanted neuro pain management."""

Unfortunately I've also had a 16 pound weight gain. I am already obese, so this is a huge problem. It breaks my heart because for the first time in 27 years I've been excited to have a flower garden again. Before that I had no interest because even the thought of it was too overwhelming due to pain. Dizziness was a very bad problem at first but I was down in bed anyway for other problems so it didn't matter to me. That wore off (mostly) in three weeks."""
Peripheral Neuropathy,6.0,"""Gabapentin tends to dull the sharp pains of peripheral neuropathy, but it doesn't actually get rid of pain.

I started low 100mg at night which actually did help me sleep and felt calming effect but I did notice a little twitchy, but all in all it was ok the problem was the next day my anxiety seemed a lot worse I even tried couple more nights and same thing always happened.

Insomnia,5.0,"""I was put on 300 mg at bedtime for better sleep with spinal pinched nerve, along with chiropractor care. At first the sleep effect was awesome - no crazy dreams like trazadone, and no super quick tolerance built like ambien, just good and regular sleep. However, after a month and going up to 600mg for nerve pain it bizarrely started to cause insomnia! The worst part about this med is the brain-erasing characteristic. I thought ambien damaged my memory, but this far surpassed that because it lasted in the day to the point where I couldn't remember where things were or what day it was. My father takes it for spinal stenosis too and has no issues. Also, the posts about withdrawal syndrome are very real! It was hard to wean off."""

After increasing my dosage over the course of three weeks, Neurontin completely eliminated the pain.  However, I gained weight rapidly (nearly 20 pounds in 2 months), retained a tremendous amount of water, to the point where my jewelry wouldn't fit and my shoes were very tight, and the constipation was awful and even laxatives didn't help.  Also, I was fatigued all the time.  Unfortunately, the side effects were just too much for me.  I still haven't found a good replacement medicine for the pain.  All the side effects!"""

Most recently and MRI showed that I have bone spurs on my L3, L4 and L5, with the L5 pushing on the nerve.. thus Sciatic pain down my right side... extreme much of the time. My  Pharmacist said not to expect this medication to work over night.  In fact he stated I was on a low dose and it was best to increase it gradually likely 4 months!  I will keep you posted!"""
Fibromyalgia,5.0,"""Gabapentin kept twitching muscles and nerves at bay.  I found the side effects to be very annoying.  I had cognitive issues, while on Gabapentin, such as, hunting for the correct word from my varying and large vocabulary.  I also experienced memory (short term) problems. Now that I've tapered down to 300mgs 3 times daily, my memory has improved, and my vocabulary is coming back.  
I recommend this medication, yet, if you find yourself entering a room in your home and not knowing exactly why you are there, forgetting why you went there in the first place, blame it on the medication.  You are not losing your mind, nor are you suffering from early onset dementia!"""
Migraine,5.0,"""I started taking gabapentin since I had vertigo, nausea, dizziness, headaches and I collapsed twice (I am only 23 years old). The doctors said I have migraines. Gabapentin has really bad side effects. I was on 300mg per day for 9 weeks and it took me a month to get used to them. Pains in the chest, throat and back for weeks. Just horrible. It you can tolerate the side effects I would suggest taking them since they did help. Theg haven't resolved my issues but did help with the situation. Be careful when you stop them though since they got bad withdrawal symptoms."""
Fibromyalgia,5.0,"""I'm not sure.  At first I thought it was okay because I had more energy.  I only took it for 3 days.  I slept more because I still had taken trazodone.

I stopped all pain meds and started at 100 mg at night, yes I have slept, yes it has relived some of the pain, yes I am like a zombie during the day, no I will not continue it.

Thankfully, this only happened the first couple of times that I took Gabapentin. Unfortunately, it was only effective at 300 mg for about two weeks. I was supposed to move up to two capsules  (600 mg total) after the first week, but hadn't out of fear of the side effects and at first it seemed unnecessary. Once the pain came back, I added the 2nd capsule and the tired, groggy feeling lasted all day! I'm not going to keep taking it."""

Pain,3.0,"""This medication was prescribed to me by my psychiatrist for thr chronic pain I suffer from in my legs and lower back. He doesn't prescribe opiates in his scope of practice but still wanted to help me out. This drug takes awhile to kick in. It's very unfortunate especially when you have pain that needs to be relieved ASAP. Everytime I take this pill it makes me feel emotional and physically impaired as if I had a drink. It helps a bit for my restless legs but for pain it really doesn't do anything. It definitsly does not relieve anxiety or panic disorder. Keep in mind I am
still on a low dose of 200 Mg per day but my PCP wanted to increase it to 300 Mg three times a day, which I disagreed with. It's not effective for pain and anxiety for me."""

Anxiety,3.0,"""I am Rxed this 6/day for neuropathy but on the side for anxiety too. In my opinion, if you have panic attacks, just stick to a benzodiazepine as if you're not taking long term, it's not bad. If you find Gabapentin to work, then take that but usually Gabapentin is given as a regimen for generalized anxiety. I've never had luck with Gabapentin but I would prefer someone take that for chronic anxiety than a benzo. However, don't let the med fool you... It can be a nightmare to get off of this med. Sometimes just as hard as benzo's. If you take this daily to prevent panic attacks but don't have panic attacks daily, I advise against this med. It's easy to build a tolerance too and constantly have to raise the dose. Not too effective."""

Angry most of the time.  Irritable.  Unhappy.  Finally getting off gabapentin.  Didn't help mood (made it worse), didn't help anxiety (I had to take more Ativan).

This medication also helps tremendously for my restless legs. As for the nerve pain it doesn't do anything for that anymore. I'm afraid the doctor will add another dose but want to stick to the minimum amount I can get away with. I do recommend it to people though it is a very helpful drug.

Migraine,,"""I have been taking gabapentin and was initially very skeptical when my M.D. prescribed it. I had already tried so many drugs and was admittedly very pessimistic. I was incredibly surprised after taking it for two months that I had way less pain, pressure, rear eye pain and auras. I had thought it was just coincidental, but when stopping the medication - the headache with all its fury, came creeping back. I have since tried stopping the medication during the day and now just take it at night (300 mgs) and though I have auras once in awhile and stingy eyes, they are super more tolerable compared to my sad life prior.
