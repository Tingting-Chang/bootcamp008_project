Anxiety,9.0,"""I've taken klonopin off and on for many years and I have to say it is very effective and much longer lasting than xanax. I've been prescribed xanax as well and it is effective, but I truly believe it shouldn't be taken on a regular basis, especially several times a day. It's fast acting and it helps with panic attacks and similar situations. But to take it day in and day out seems ludicrous. Klonopin has a much longer half life and I don't feel withdrawal when I come off klonopin, that's not the case with Xanax. Not only that, on Xanax I was finding that I would have periods of forgetfulness, meaning periods of the day. I was at a job interview and I really couldn't tell you what was said by me or the interviewer. I did get the job however."""
Bipolar Disorder,1.0,"""When a person has mental symptoms , they're supposed to have medical workup always. The reason is many medical conditions mimic mental illness until treated. Then zero symptoms forever (mentally). If a person has Myxedema (severe hypothyroidism), gets misdiagnosed as mentally ill (schizophrenia, bipolar, delusional d/o, depression, anxiety ...all common MISDIAGNOSES in thyroid disease), Klonopin can induce coma. This happened to me and then they realized I was not mentally ill. Had no symptoms since healing from this dreadfully dangerous drug. Read ""Physical Illness presenting as Psychiatric Disease"" before taking any psych drug. Any sedative, hypnotic, even Advil can cause MyxedemaComa 40%chance death. See Iatrogenic Coma & other articles."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I started having horrible extremely bad anxiety attacks for the past 5 months. Since then I've been on so many different medications to help with anxiety. I was first put on gabapentin, which I had a bad time on, horrible reaction that put me in the ER. Got put on clonezapam which worked wonders for me. The uncontrollable crying episodes stopped until I was put on adderal & lexapro which made them come back along with my anxiety attacks. Stopped the adderal & continued the clonezapam & finally came out of that. I still take the lexapro. But now I've developed a upper respiratory infection, having flu like symptoms. I was taking 1mg once a day everyday for almost a month. My doctor told me to take half a 1mg so now that's what I take."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have been taking clonazepam .5 MG's once daily if needed for over a year now, and let's just say this medicine has done wonders for me! I suffer with horrible panic disorder as well with agoraphobia without clonazepam I probably would never be able to leave my house, I only take it when I need it which is usually three times a week depending but just knowing I have it helps calm me down, I am also on Zoloft 75mgs and the combo works great for me!"""
Panic Disorder,10,"""I've been on 2mg twice a day for over 14 years now. My dosage has never gone up and I feel it really helps keep my panic disorder in check. Sometimes I skip a dose and don't even notice it. 
I have had trouble with doctors wanting to take me off the medication and essentially play with my medications. However, my response is always ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"".  
I do recommend that anyone that is on this medication have a physician to monitor you on a regular basis. If you find yourself taking more than prescribed, please notify your doctor."""
Anxiety,5.0,"""This medication should never be taken as a long term treatment for Anxiety, Panic Attacks etc.. 
This medication also should be given at low doses to begin 0.5 once or twice a day. The reason
for these conclusions is that I first was given clonazepam over 25 years ago after extreme anxiety   
from a major surgery. My dosage was high (Started 2MGX 3 Day and Eventually 2MG X4 a day) 
I was on 2 MG X 4 a day for well over 20 years and getting off has been almost impossible, even in a detox center. Even with tapers. This last year we slowly were sort of successful by cutting it back down to 2MG X 3 a day and that took over a year of tapering. I still get the shakes once in a while, this drug is dangerous for now I crave it."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""I have been on this med for my panic/anxiety disorder for a few years now and I must say it is a saviour for me.  I had very bad depression and anxiety/panic problems for years along with a medical problem about my thyroid.  This medicine has helped me very much.  I take .5 mg at bedtime.  helps me sleep all thru the night.  I get my 7-8 hours that I need.   everyone can be affected differently with medications but I think in my opinion, if you take a benzo and/or a antidepressant and it freaks you out, then you are not taking the right medication for what ails you.  That I know from my own experiences from other meds in the past.  I take this with lexapro.  This combo  works wonders for me.  Thank you."""
Insomnia,9.0,"""I have to say I was prescribed 0.5mg of Klonopin for sleep.   I've tried other medications, Ambien, Lunesta etc.. with not too much success.   The Klonopin worked wonders but after about a month on the medication, I felt very weird  I started to have hallucinogenic dreams... with bouts of gloom and doom during my waking hours.   It got to a point that I got moderately depressed thinking such negative thoughts and decided to stop taking the medication.   Wow, I never thought withdrawal would happen to me.. but it certainly did. Sweating, nervous, agitated.....  It took about 5 weeks off of the Klonopin for the withdrawal symptoms to cease.   Please be careful folks.. it's one of most additive medications out there."""
Seizure Prevention,10,"""Would not recommend for those with only generalized anxiety. To me, this pill calms the synapses in the brain in order to control seizures...as it does for me. It will not have the same effect on people who do not have overactive, sharp brain waves which cause epilepsy, period. However, if taken to calm the synapses, I see no harm in taking this medicine. I've been taking it for over 2 years now for my seizure control, and haven't had to up my dose from 0.5 mg once daily. It makes me feel normal, calm, safe, and unparanoid. Taken in moderation, and for reason that requires care brain wave wise, this can really help you...as it has me. People with epilepsy are wired differently than those of only anxiety or insomnia. We need to remember that"""
Insomnia,1.0,"""Klonopin completely destroyed my life. I was physically dependent after just 30 days. It took me 1.5 years to taper off the drug and I was disabled by the withdrawals. At 15 months off I still have symptoms. Google benzo withdrawal before you EVER take a benzo daily. My biggest regret in life is seeing a psychiatrist and taking Klonopin."""
Anxiety,10,"""For me this worked like a miracle drug but be cautious because overuse can be hazardous if you have any fear simply take small breaks between and dont build up a tolerance if used properly I believe it can completely eradicate anxiety even if only temporarily"""
Anxiety,4.0,"""I was given clonazepam  after my husband passed away to be able to sleep. It didn't help much so my Dr added half of a tablet. I took the 1.5 tablet  which didn't help either. I am at a loss. I already take 2 types of antidepressants. I also hate these drugs that are supposed to help. I'm going to wean myself off of all of these drugs. I can't wait to be see if I feel normal, I hope."""
Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,10,"""After a car accident, I was prescribed this medication for TMJ which existed before the accident but grew significantly worse. I also experience anxiety and racing thoughts that prevent me from getting sleep. This medication has helped tremendously although I'm not able to take it every night. This can cause you to develop a tolerance."""
Anxiety,10,"""Been on Clonaz for 4 years, on and off. I take 2 mgs as needed. I've had panic/anxiety attacks since I was a child. It wasn't until I got older that I realized what they were. I worry all the time. I can't fly with out this drug. When my anxiety prevents me from sleeping and I have racing thoughts and weird feelings of dread, I take it. 1 or 2 times a week. It's a miracle drug. My anxiety goes from 10/10, the worst I can imagine anyone experiencing anxiety, complete freakout panic with no way out, too bliss, where everything feels peaceful and nothing worries me and life is great. Miracle drug. Although, its extremely scary when I feel I need to take it, and I have to pace around and keep calm until it kicks in 45 minutes later."""
Anxiety,10,"""I was involved in an accident a few months ago that claimed the life of the person I was with and tried to rescue. Both of us had to be flown out; I made it, they didn't. I had prior, minor anxiety issues; but never had the need for medication or treatment. I was one of those people who thought anxiety/panic attacks were more of a mental/attention-seeking action. I was wrong. I now know what it's like to wake up at 1 am (sometimes reliving the scenario) and be in complete chest-pounding panic. I now know what it's like to have certain words or topics of discussion trigger major anxiety issues. I take this (1mg dose) med, as needed (post event, day or night), to help calm anxiety issues; currently 0-3 times per week (more a few months ago)."""
Anxiety,10,"""Helps my anxiety just generally puts me in a better mood - I can actually deal with life happily now"""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I suffer from GAD, panic attacks and digestive issues. I am grateful for being prescribed this medication. It has saved me from dozens of visits to the emergency room. Just 0.25mg once in the morning takes off the edge so that I can get on with my day. I tapered off my daily use after 1 year with not too much difficulty except for dizziness, headaches and some anxiety (over 6-8 weeks) Now I just take it twice a week as needed. Some of the side effects that I experience while on this medication is slight forgetfulness and eyes seem sensitive to bright lights. Key is using the lowest dose possible that works for you."""
Bipolar Disorder,8.0,"""Not quite strong enough for me by itself, but it helped me sleep easier during the roughest period of my life (losing my mother) when combined with xanax, ativan, Halcion, lamictal, and risperdal (though I did have problems with the risperdal - but I put that there)."""
Anxiety,8.0,"""I had been on Zoloft for about a year or so which helped manage my anxiety, but didn't help when it came to a very stressful day or event that led to side effects like racing heart, labored breathing, sweating, stomach ulcers, etc. I needed something that I could take immediately to stave an anxiety attack off. My doctor prescribed Klonopin and I'm so grateful for it. For me, it doesn't make me tired, lethargic, or dull me down. I was afraid of a medication that would just sedate me. This drug takes the edge off and makes me feel good enough to continue with my day. I haven't had any side effects."""
Seizure Prevention,10,"""Suppresses all stress on my nerves I sleep all night without any interruptions.  If you have to wake up early in the morning, take it early night hours. I've been seizure free for 8 years since I've been taking clobazepam"""
Insomnia,10,"""Lamictal has controlled my bipolar type 2 which manifests as depression & hypomania. I never have full blown mania. My GYN Dr prescribed  hormone replacement treatment to treat my mood swings. It completely inactivated my Lamictal so it was as if I went off it cold turkey. It was the most horrible experience of my life!  My HR increased to 130, my BP to 160/98, my thoughts raced & then I couldn't focus or make sense & made serious mistakes. I didn't sleep >15 hours in 5 days and no sleep the last 48 hrs. Klonopin saved me when 4 meds failed. Just don't ever drive!! I plan on using Uber!! Hope this helps someone! As w/all meds will need to adjust & figure out how to taper off. I have an amazing Pdoc though & I have strong faith. """
Anxiety,10,"""I've been on Clonazepam for five years now. I take it for general anxiety disorder. This is a miracle drug. I don't care what the critics say about the idea that it's addictive or that you build up a tolerance or any of the other hundreds of negative things they say about this drug. All the negative effects they claim you'll experience haven't happened to me. And trust me, if anyone feels the side effects of drugs, it's me. All the cold and flu medications, antihistamine, etc. that say they are non drowsy (i.e. Clartin) knock me out completely. Sure, this drug is addictive, but so is your heart medication. If you go off it, you might get a heart attack. Listen to the doctors, not the Internet."""
Anxiety,10,"""This is the only thing that has ever worked for me and continues to work for me on a regular basis. As long as I take it according to the dose my doctor prescribed I have never had an issue with this drug not working the way it's supposed to. On that note, I wouldn't say that it's for everyone, and if you are going to use Kpins, be aware that this drug can be addicting and the withdrawals are next to unbearable. So use them with Therapy for the best results, not just a script from an M.D... best"""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I've taken so many different meds and this one is the only one that's ever worked for preventing panic attacks from anxiety. Which happen often because I have social anxiety and phobias. I never developed a dependency even after stopping it for a few years when I quit taking my mood stabilizer as well."""
Insomnia,8.0,"""I have had severe insomnia since being diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1999.  I will be awake all night without meds.  Ambien was the worst as far as side effects--should be off the market.  I now take 2 mg of Clonazepan and 10 mg of Doxepin.  Still takes me hours to fall asleep, but at least I do.  Best I've taken so far.  Only side effect for me is that I don't feel low blood sugars until the 40's (I'm diabetic).  So I check my BS often.  Have not slept through a night since 1998.  Hoping to increase dosage next doctor visit."""
Insomnia,2.0,"""I've been taking clonazepam 5 mg to 10mg tablets as needed for anxiety and nerve pain for 4 years now, and also have ADD.  As of lately I've noticed that about an hour after taking clonazepam I felt restless and tense, almost jittery and my muscles tightened up and I was wide awake so I basically got 2 hours of sleep at night.  I would say that after long term use, even if it is as needed, clonazepam definitely causes affects of insomnia and muscle stiffness."""
Insomnia,1.0,"""Hi all! Over 15 years I am on Clonazepam. CVS doesnt give Klonopin they substitute it with generic Clonazepam. Is there any difference between Klonopin and Clonazepam? 
I beg all to help me! I want to withdraw from this drug. I am unsuccessful on that. 
All doctors say that you have to find interesting hobby, be in circle of friends, around family, be more in nature. I have done this all, but it does not work. 

I have chemical addiction, drink high quality water, but it does not work too.

Again, I ask everyone for help!!!

Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I have many health issues, but the worst have been chronic migraines for the past 5 years!  They have gotten progressively worse and I feel like I am constantly fighting them off and I've tried everything.  I have Relpax as a rescue drug and it works great, but I am only supposed to use it twice a week or else face rebound headaches.  I asked my doc to prescribe Klonopin, mostly because I am under a lot of stress and I had read that it could help with TMJ disorder (I grind my teeth badly) and I have restless leg syndrome, Fibro and RA. What I didn't expect was for it to reduce my migraines considerably.  I take .5 mg 3 times daily.  I only had to take my Relpax 3 times last month!  and I'm not fighting them off all the time!  Freedom!"""
Insomnia,10,"""I have had trouble sleeping for at least 10-12 years.  My brain doesn't seem to shut down.  OTC like Benadryl has no effect on me at all.  After many trials, my doctor found than a combination of Clonazepam and Tranzadone work great for me.  They two don't make me sleepy at all but instead calm down my brain activity in order to go to sleep.  I take them about two hours before going to bed.  In addition, I found that the Brand name Qualitest for Clonazepam works better than Teva.  I've been using this combination for about three years and they work great."""
Burning Mouth Syndrome,10,"""After suffering with burning mouth syndrome for over a year, my doctor said that he had had good luck with one other patient using orally disintegrating clonazepam. I quickly got his Rx for it. It dissolves easily on my tongue (no bad taste) and I take it twice a day, 12 hours apart. After about 10 days I can say than I am ecstatic that my burning mouth syndrome seems to have disappeared. I have a little left over mouth pain but that I can attribute to my upper denture. I don't know if this will work for everyone, but I certainly think it's worth a try if you can tolerate it. My only side effects were a little dizziness for a couple of days (didn't drive), then daytime drowsiness. I don't work, so this posed no problem for me. hurray!"""
Anxiety,10,"""I was an iv meth user for 6 months and I'm really proud to say I'm clean since march 05/16. I went one month detox until I couldn't handle the racing thoughts and tense-ness through my whole body. Finally I go to a doctor and Valium fixed me up for one month then weaned of that. Still experiencing some same symptoms so he tried propranolol. Which helped take the edge off but hardly so I switched  to Zoloft which was hard! But much better thoughts. Still tense still freeze up in situations still worry about an minor inconvenience I would cry and think about death just death in general my brain would stick to one thing and float around everything else. Until I got clonazapam. I can think things through, keep calm when pressured, and live!"""
Insomnia,2.0,"""I took this medication for insomnia and towards the end of my manic episode my brain was gone when I was really logical and smart and insightful during my episode the nurses and resident thought and didn't even think I had a mental illness and thought it was only my personality (I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type) but by the end of my recovery and after the high doses of clonazepam and only being on it for 2 months I was already doing stupid stuff I wouldn't ever do and even called my cousin my other cousin's name on thanksgiving when I greeted him and I've never been this stupid in my life."""
Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,1.0,"""benzos will burn your nervous system and neural circuits, dont be stupid this drug is just a mask to the problem, once you get off it. if you have a panic disorder, your panic attacks will explode during the withdrawal, if you find hope in this drug, I seriously recommend you rethink your life decisions before taking it any further, I had bad experience, it took only 1 benzo for me to realize this isnt the cure. To those people suffering panic attacks, you have to conquer it naturally and with SSRI meds, I wouldn't take the time to come here and write this if I didnt want to help anyone, benzos are like any other illicit drug, they blind you and make you think you just took 5 steps forward, when you come off it you are 100 steps back.GL"""

Insomnia,1.0,"""I don't understand why there are so many high (8-10) ratings for this drug.
After reading so many who experienced negative effects, yet they gave a high rating.
My first night taking my 1mg. prescription, I woke up thirsty and spilled water all over myself. Not a big deal. A while later, I rolled out of bed onto a bedside table and bruised myself badly. I had never before fallen out of bed. After the first night, I slept well and continued using it with no noticeable side effects.
After using up my 3 months prescription, I was told that I needed to go to my doctor's office for paper prescription. I'm 68 years old, disabled and live 16 miles from my doctor's office.
I am now suffering with horrible withdrawal symptoms!"""
Anxiety,7.0,"""I was prescribed .5mg to be taken 2 times daily for anxiety. At first I would only take a single .5mg dose every once in a while if I had an anxiety issue, which seemed to help a bit. Well, last week I was anxious most of the week so I decided to take a single, .5mg dose once a day for 4 days straight. Boy was that a bad idea!!! 2 days after stopping, my anxiety symptoms skyrocketed multiple times worse than before I even started the medicine. I had severe withdrawal symptoms for over a week after and didn't know a dependence could be gained in such a short period of time. My psychiatrist even said it was nearly impossible for that short a period at that dose. I won't continue this medication. Beware!"""
Anxiety,3.0,"""I take .5 klonopin and i still get really bad anxiety on it. I tried telling my psych about it but she said it was okay. Personally, I dont think it works and im 122lb."""
,10,"""I have been on this med when I was diagnosed with UC in 2007. Due to the nature of my job and the stress. I only take when needed, have gone over a month when it wasn't needed. Also, anyone who has WD from this med must be on a large dose. I personally never experienced any problems when off it. It's a miracle pill for me. Every six months I see my gastroenterologist and stay on top of all info on the medication. It's a blessing."""
Insomnia,1.0,"""This medicine has destroyed my life. Yes it works well and yes I was able to sleep but tolerance build up quickly you need to keep increasing your dose. It might not increase and everyone but it did for me. It also ended up causing a major depression from use which I cannot get out of. I also went through the worst withdrawal trying to get off of this and I am still unable to sleep since using it. I think it affected my brain's chemistry. I literally only sleep 5 to 6 hours a week since quitting. I know the Temptation could be great to start it because as I said it works for insomnia and anxiety but be warned it is nearly impossible to get out of your life. I'm currently on family medical leave from work trying to get my life back together"""
Anxiety,5.0,"""Stay away from this nightmare drug it can in most likely cause depression and more it's dangerous i had withdrawals for months horrible......."""
Burning Mouth Syndrome,1.0,"""I have tried clonazepam and had no luck. I have had BMS for over 3 years now and absolutely nothing has helped agonizing pain. Have been to both Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins. Mayo recommended the dissolving clonazepam but even after telling them muiltiplte times during my interview that I could not tolerate any kind of sweetner, they gave me tablet with aspertine in it!  Have also tried just regular clonazepam left in my mouth for 3 minutes and then spit but no help either. Have tried all other remedies and meds to no avail. Take 1 mg xanax 3 x day to help manage anxiety from overwhelming pain."""
Panic Disorder,8.0,"""For generalized anxiety, this medication is probably the best or second best out there for it. It helps tremendously with general anxiety. When it comes to panic disorder, I would say it has its pros and cons but overall is good. If you only take Clonazepam for panic attacks, and that's the only time you take it, it should be great. (And was for me!) If you take it daily to prevent panic attacks, I think it also works great. But if you take it daily to prevent but end up still getting one, it doesn't help too much. But it's one of the better benzos to take as a regimen (though there is no* such thing as a good regimen) but it has its peak effect at around 2-3 hours and can last long, making it a great reliever for many! It's helped me!"""
Anxiety,8.0,"""Helps me live a normal life even tho I have Agoraphobia. This medicine kicks my panic disorder in the butt and keeps in down ALL DAY! Unlike Xanax that wears off in 4 hours and leaves you shaking. Also helps me through these uncomfortable Xanax withdrawals. I do feel like I need a stronger dose. I'm 145lbs and physically fit, I take .5mg and I don't feel high or drunk, just normally calm. I haven't tried doing anything outstanding on this drug yet. Maybe with more CBT I'll make more strides on this drug."""

Panic Disorder,9.0,"""About 3 months ago my anxiety got out of hand. I'm constantly obsessing something is wrong with my health. Brain tumors because I'm dizzy and lightheaded a lot, cancer because family members& a high school friend just got diagnosed, to heart problems. I'm 22 and know it's not healthy to obsess over this crap.. but I can't stop it. Tried new SSRIs. Haven't found one that's side effects are livable. I take klonopin as needed when I'm feeling bad and it instantly helps. Still have some anxiety but it chills me out to where I feel I don't need to go to the hospital. Very helpful. I was directed to take .25 MG twice a day but figured I'd only take it as needed so I don't get dependant to it. Hoping to find a new SSRI to nip this in the bud."""
Anxiety,10,"""Have been prescribed a plethora of anti-depressants and non-benzodiazepine anti-anxiety meds; all accompanied by horrendous, long lasting side effects. Had a bad experience with a psychiatrist & also held a negative attitude toward being dependent on medication, therefore decided to be anti-medicated for several (miserable) years.
Eventually came to terms with the fact that I can not properly function in society without medication. It took awhile, but I have finally found a great combination of meds, including .5 mg of Clonazepam. Anxiety is better managed. Happy to no longer be missing out because of anxiety. Would recommend a low dose (prescribed by a doctor, of course) to someone that has tried multiple anxiety medications with no avail."""
Anxiety,,"""My best friend was taking this medication for many years.  He committed suicide in September.  A few months before he told me that the the drug wasn't working and that it was a different manufacturer.  He said he had been trying to get off it but was unable to.  He was under a psychiatrist's care.  I'm not sure of the entire story, only what he told me.  However, he started to withdraw from all his friends and let his work slide.  The last time I saw him he looked terrible, shakes, sweaty, awful.  That was months before he died.  He was 57 and had been taking the drug for decades.  All I can say is it sounds like a dangerous drug for some people.  I am saddened by his passing and wish there was something we could have done to help him."""
Panic Disorder,9.0,"""I don't give this medicine a 10 because it's too good and you really forget that you can do things on your own. What I'm trying to say, it's a lifesaver when you're having a crisis, but the thing is so good you want to take it to deal with normal levels of anxiety. Anyway, impulses aside, I experienced no significant side effects. You do get a little drowsy but you won't just fall asleep if you don't want to either. I have always been anxious, had a panic attack that had me hospitalized as early as 12 years old and from then on it was on-and-off, being told not to think about it and enjoy things, it's all in my head and it made me awkward, shy and think I was a nervous wreck.

Insomnia,10,"""I have had insomnia for several years, sleeping only 2-3 hours per night. I tried Clonazepam last year for a few months and didn't have much success with it, so I went back to Lunesta, which worked fairly well but left me with a dull headache every day. 
I decided to try 1mg Clonazepam again after reading that Doxepin helps it to work better - this time I take it along with 3mg of Doxepin Elixir liquid, (which is an antihistamine at low doses of 3-6mg). Now, I fall asleep within 30 minutes and sleep all night! Between 7 and 8 hours. I feel energetic and not groggy at all! I have my life back!!"""

Seizure Prevention,10,"""As soon as I feel any sort of seizure coming on, I need only take a half to a full 0.5 mg dosage. Within 20 minutes, I feel a sense of calmness overcome me...and all of the strange sensations disappearing. For me, I'll get an intense tingling all over my body, my thoughts become rapid, my hands jittery, and heart pounding (as my warning signs.) Clonazepam has the ability to literally take that away..at least for me. It does make you a bit tired, and at times forgetful. But is it not more worth it to be seizure free, and have some sense of security that you will be alright? I've been taking it for two years now, and although I am not a fan of taking medication, period...this is my one exception. I feel much safer knowing I have it on me."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,6.0,"""My RLS is inherited and turned predictably vicious by the time I reached my early 40s. It was destroying my life. 

I was put first on Clonazepam (1 mg) in 2003 and 13 years later I am now at 2 mg taken several hours before bedtime.

Some health experts describe Clonazepam as ""the most dangerous pill in America"" because once on it and once dependent you risk two things...the first is severe withdrawal symptoms beginning within three to four days of stopping. The second is even after being weaned from the drug you will likely experience the sudden onset of withdrawal symptoms weeks or even months after stopping. 

I am also on pramipexole and  Gabapentin."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""I started having panic attacks at age 26, I'm now 56. Those were the worst things a person could go thru. My first shrink in 86 put me on Haldol. Oh my God, that was horrible. I was on different medications until 1994 when I got on klonopin. That pill is a miracle drug. I don't have to take it everyday anymore but I always carry it with me in my purse just in case. I do take other meds for depression and they also help but nothing like klonopin. Because I hear it can contribute to Alzheimer's I try not to take it daily. That's all I need ontop of my other mental problems. I would advise anyone to take klonopin for major panic attacks but try not to take a lot of it for long periods. Maybe in conjunction with something else u can take less."""

I've always went the natural route - yoga, cbt, exercise, and although some of those things are helpful to others, I felt I needed something more to help me along in the process. Let me tell you that Klonopin has been an absolute savior in my life. Just after one day of taking it, my panic completely subsided within 20-30 min. I take one .5 in the am/pm along with lexapro. so far so good. As long as you are taking it as prescribed in small doses,the risk of addiction is low"""

I still feel anxiety, but I am able to shut it down very quickly before it has the chance the turn into a full blown panic attack.

However, it has been my observation over the last 10 or so years, that the different colors, sources, and whatever ""fillers"" that are in some of these clonazepam, alter the effects too randomly. As sufferers of the horribly misunderstood disorder, we should have more resources to find out what is in these and  more insight into which ones favor our individual bipolar characteristics."""

But when my doctor retired and a new doctor took over his practice I was abruptly discontinued the xanax. This was a dangerous thing to do. I began to go into withdrawals within one day without the xanax. The withdrawals were excruciating and lasted for weeks. I was in constant extreme anxiety. Sleep was nearly totally absent for more than two weeks. My thoughts started to become almost to the point of psychosis which also lasted for weeks. So never abruptly stop benzos unless medically supervi"""
Anxiety,2.0,"""Yes, this medication works. It works very well for chronic anxiety disorder and  sudden onsets of severe panic attacks. Knowing what I know now, I wish with all my being it had never ever been prescribed to me, and without the absurd nonchalance dozens of practitioners have portrayed. 
I'm 32 and have been prescribed clonazopam for 14 years. Ive been in situations where my health insurance is in transition and I must go off the medication abruptly-- this is when I realized how deep I was. Weeks upon weeks of non stop physical, emotional, and psychological withdrawal effects that are like hell. Words cannot accurately describe just how awful it is. This, again, has been my experience during withdrawal as a long term clonazopam patient. 
All skin, especially the face, becomes numb. Vision gets fuzzy and difficult to see clearly. Panic attacks become extremely exasperated, frequent and debilitating. Severe irritability. Worst of all: a terrifying disconnection between your mind and body; as if you're an onlooker watching and feeling this horrible thing happen to you, but not actually feeling connected to any of it-- that one is tough to explain. All of this... It can lasts months, maybe more. That's right. Not just some one week hump to overcome. 
After finding how awful the withdrawal is I've been attempting to ween very very slowly down from 3 2mg doses per day to eventually zero, hopefully. After six months of gradually decreases in dose I'm now at 2- 1mg doses per day and I'm not sure how or if I can go much less than that. No doctors I've had have been of any help. The ween down was my idea and the rate of it was also my idea based on experience. It sure would be nice to meet a doctor that truly had knowledge of this withdrawal syndrome and took it a bit more seriously. I am confident that the medication is no longer treating my anxiety disorder, but simply preventing withdrawal from the meds themselves. And there don't seem to be any good alternatives. It's a long road ahead, please think it over and over with someone knowledgeable before being so quick to embrace this miracle drug. The truth is that most of us actually need very real psychotherapy, not chemicals that run our lives.

Panic Disorder,10,"""Was prescribed Clonazepam for short term use while adjusting to Lexapro. It worked quite well to keep panic at bay with it's long half life. Prescribed .5 mg 3X daily, but I only took as needed as I was wary of dependence. Lexapro is now working great for me and my extra Clonazepams are fun for weekend relaxation. I can feel their additives  quality just with occasional use. I would never recommend for long term daily use. That's a dead end road to hell."""
Anxiety,10,"""At the age of 58 I was revictimized (psychologically) by a male RN co-worker. I had had absolutely no idea that I could have been severely sexually abused as a child and that the perpetrator had to have been my own father. The revictimization caused me great PTSD so I sought a therapist for help with that, and it was she who told me that I absolutely must have been abused by him because it could not have been anyone else. Clonazepam works great for me and I have no side effects. I've been on 2 mg. 3X/day for many years due to the horrible therapy I must endure.  Often I feel that I'm not getting enough but my psychiatrist said that I am at the absolute maximum and that it would be dangerous to take more. I follow his advice."""
Insomnia,6.0,"""I was hopeful this medication would help me with insomnia, but have had a mixed experience. At 0.5, I get very sleepy but don't necessarily fall asleep. It does last long which helps with morning anxiety if you take it at night.

Restless Legs Syndrome,5.0,"""Been taking 0.5-1mg clonazepam for 20  years for PTSD flashbacks. Diagnosed with Parkinson's 3 years ago. Because of scoliosis and spinal stenosis the only exercise I can do comfortably is stationary bike. Usually do this 5 out of 7 days a week. The past week or so I did none for various reasons. The past several nights the RLS has been so bad I've awakened 3-4 times and tried the clonazepam. Helped at first, but for no more than 1 hour. From reading articles I think I must get myself back to the bike. Then I'll know for sure. The clonazepam still works very well for panic/anxiety/flash backs. Thankful for that."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""Have had anxiety all my life!-40 years.

ONE pill before bed one evening did the trick for me. It was like hitting the reset button, and I woke up rested, calm, and totally fine again. Haven't needed another pill yet."""

After that I had extreme anxiety and agitation. I couldn't sit still for months, I had to take a non addictive medication to be able to sleep at all. I was unable to eat well for months.

That's it. Even with it being addictive & being known to cause dementia, I still give it a 7 out of 10 stars because it was very effective for me. It would have gotten 10 stars if it was safer to take & if it had ridded me of my anxiety completely."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""This drug works well ""short term"". As all of the literature you have read about it says. However, ""Short Term"" is ambiguous.

1. Tolerance withdrawal - Doctors will never tell you about this, some don't even acknowledge that it exists. This means that when your body has developed tolerance to this medicine, even though you keep taking your steady dose, you will start to experience god awful withdrawal symptoms. Believe it.

It has helped my anxiety greatly.  It takes the edge off and brings my level of anxiety down to a manageable level.  In addition, it helps me get to sleep quicker and helps me stay asleep.

Anxiety,2.0,"""Increased depression at higher doses, which are needed as your system becomes tolerant and you always will need to increase the dosage to get relief of the anxiety, negative thoughts in general, fear of withdrawal, agoraphobia if you do run out before refill, severe memory problems the longer you are on it, tolerance develops quickly and what started out as 0.5 twice a day is now 3mg a day which leads to almost constant fatigue and a general feeling of hopelessness that doesn't go away."""

I can go several days without needing it, then when I do it's very helpful to bring calm and relaxation and significantly reduce depression. I think some people on here are confusing the side effects of Lexapro and other SSRIs commonly prescribed along with Klonopin. More than likely it's the SSRIs that are causing the nasty side effects and withdrawal symptoms, as I went through that myself when I stopped taking the anti-depressants. I find Klonopin by itself to be high effective without any negative effects, and I have stopped all other SSRIs because of their sexual side effects and worsening of depression."""

Once I'm back to feeling normal, I stop taking (sometimes I wean off, sometimes I don't, just depends).

 I have a huge tolerance and I am worried the clonazepam may stop wporking.
Someone mentioned hydroxyzine. I found that it is only good for helping with mild allergies and contact dermititis. I am amazed dr. Prescribe this for anxiety

I am 5 months and so far, the baby is healthy and developing normally. I'll continue to wean and pray for my baby."""

Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I was diagnosed at the age of 15 with Bipolar. I really never understood why that was my disgnosis.. maybe cause of my horrible depressions at a very young age and well having to go thru alot very early in life might have been the cause of that. I suffered alot from Anxiety or panic attacks and i must say that Klonopin has been the best drug i have ever had, even better than Xanax. It relaxes me instead of that sedation feeling Xanax used to give me and also last longer. I can now sleep better as well. So in conclusion Klopin is amazing and way better than Xanax and ofcourse this is to my opinión"""

Anxiety,8.0,"""I was prescribed clonazepam 0.5mg twice a day for my anxiety and for restless leg syndrome. It works nice for anxiety and I feel it coming again and I don't wanna overdose on it. It doesn't help much with the RLS. I just went a week without it. Waiting for my refill to come in and then I take it for the first time in a week and I feel great. But once I start taking it every day, it won't work to it's full effect. Idk if I need a higher dose or a new brand but something has to change. Overall, it works. It really brings my heart rate down and calms me. It's just on some days I'll feel anxiety maybe twice a day and I don't wanna take double than I was prescribed. And for my RLS, I think I might need a whole new med for just that."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I'm 22/F have GAD & anxiety for a long time. Just in the last year I've developed panic attacks. I quit my job, never left the house. It caused me to basically fear life itself. Doctor recommended klonopin .05mg at night. Benzos make me very drowsy starting out. So I was told to take 1/4 of the pill (.25) & slowly increase every few days! I'm at a little over 1/2 & I'm seeing a major difference. I still have some anxiety but I'm also still on a low dose. But this medicine allows me to think more clearly. I developed nausea &  excessive belching after eating everything, when I started getting panic attacks &I've seem to notice a difference in that as well. Considered about addiction though"""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I was prescribed this in 2013. I took as needed for my terrible anxiety attacks and was able to completely stop after I got pregnant in 2014. I had my baby & got another script because I am experimenting some post partum depression. I also take celexa 20 mg. the klonapin is .5 twice a day. I usually only take one and break it in half (.25) and use it for my situational anxiety. These pills are very easy to get addicted to and you can build a tolerance so please take with precaution. That being said, I would recommend for anyone with bad anxiety disorders. They kick in after about 15 minutes. I refer to them as my little miracle pills. God bless."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I can take 0.5 mg twice a day as needed. Some days I don't take it. It helps so much even with my depression.

Anxiety,10,"""I switched to Klonopin from Xanax and Doxepin because Klonopin is not addictive and had no side effect.  Could not drive for months my new car, but when Klonopin was added to Zoloft I was able to drive and deal with every day routine as a normal person."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,10,"""I've experienced RLS for over 20 years. After trying various techniques I finally resorted to medication. I started with 2.5 mg diazepam before bed time with good success. After some major back surgery, I could no longer use diazepam and was prescribed all Clonazepam 1mg before bed. After a few months due to excessive drowsiness I lowered to 0.5mg and was able to reduce the overall drowsiness factor and still able to control the RLS. If I have a bad night I will take another 0.5mg if needed. I've tried Lyricia and Oxycodone with poor results. I have not had any addictive issues with any of my meds. As a side note, I've also tried 420 with poor results."""

Anxiety,10,"""Upping my 10mg Paxil dose to 20mg sparked quite a few anxiety episodes for me. My doctor said the Paxil would take 2.5 weeks for the new increased dosage to kick in, so in the meantime he prescribed me 0.5mg of klonopin to take twice a day (morning and night). A year ago, when I initially started Paxil (after a terrible 6 weeks of trying Zoloft), I took a Xanax because the anxiety was so bad. For some reason, the Xanax made me so depressed. Anyway, my first dose of klonopin was awesome and has been sense then, (about a week ago). It took an hour for me to start to realize that I wasn't anxious anymore, and I seemed to be really productive and felt normal, which is a great feeling! Klonopin is awesome for us who have generalized anxiety."""
Bipolar Disorder,3.0,"""Don't take it for longer than 1 month. I'm addicted to 4 mg daily and I can't get off.
Side effects - Short-term memory and long term memory are gone (REALLY GONE), I'm so so tried (I sleep all day) and I have 0 motivation. It's amazing for short term anxiety of all kinds. Just do not get addicted. IMO max 1-2 mg for max 1 mth. 2 year user. 27 yo male. Kills anxiety in it's tracks but not to be used long term. Look into Nardil/Parnate if SSRIs fail. Asenapine is great if you need your racing thoughts controlled. DO NOT LET ANY PSYC GIVE THIS TO YOU LONG TERM"""

I  have started and stopped with this medication prior to recently starting it up again. I used to use 1mg 3x a day, so, I am low dosing for now, 0.5mg. But it is a wonder drug.  One thing people did not write about this drugs is that it keeps you from over thinking which helps for anxiety a great deal.Love this medicine - just do NOT abuse it . I have safely used it for over 10 years."""
Anxiety,,"""I was prescribed Klonopin / Clonazepam after experiencing debilitating anxiety attacks after a close family member was diagnosed with cancer.   At first, doctors put be on Zoloft, which made me feel like a complete zombie and didn't relieve my anxiety at all.  I quit Zoloft after 3 weeks and switched to therapy and Clonazepam as needed.

The first time I took Clonazepam was like being instantly transported from anxiety attack hell to a soothing vacation.   It was the first real relief I had had in 2 months.   

3 years later and I still have a prescription for .5 mg as needed for anxiety attacks.    I get a bottle of 30 about twice a year.  The drug just really works well for anxiety.  Makes you feel totally calm and normal."""
Anxiety,10,"""I am going through a very difficult time in my life with my fiance being diagnosed with stage 4 renal failure. I am the sole provider of our family and was waking up to what felt like someone scared me or a heart attack. It was so scary and when I addressed this to my Dr. He informed me that it was stress waking me up out of a dead sleep. I have had stress and anxiety before but this was entirely different from what I've been through before. I started taking this and ever since then I've been so grateful. I still have stress  but I can manage it now and don't feel like I'm going to die in the middle of the night."""
Anxiety,8.0,"""Definitely helps me. I deal with a lot of social anxiety. So anytime me and my wife plan on going out or doing a lot of shopping etc., I'll take 0.5 mg and take an extra one with me just in case. I just take it as needed, and I usually feel the effects within half an hour. I don't experience the sleepy side effects. But it definitely calms me down. So if I'm feeling anxious before bed, I'll take one and it helps me sleep, because it calms me. I don't take it often, 90 pills lasted me a whole year. I would recommend this drug if you need some help from time to time with anxiety. I don't have experience with taking it on a daily basis."""

Anxiety,1.0,"""Initial relief. Grew tolerant of the drug within 2 weeks. Went from 1 mg as needed and was legitimately prescribed 5 mg as needed. Would end up taking 5-6 mg. The inner dose withdrawal was horrible and led to suicidal thoughts because the pain was so bad. The inner dose withdrawal could have been 2 hours after taking a pill. Was feeling my mental capacity fizzle away after a year of use and decided to get off it. Which led to 5 monhts of weening and 16 more months (and counting) of severe horrific withdrawal state. Every symptom imaginable. You feel like you're a dead zombie. Still struggling to finish sentences and talk 16 months out. Do not recommend to anyone. Find other solutions, please. Most doctors are clueless of the hell."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I do like this medicine because it helps me to control my nervousness and instant reactions to stimuli much better than without it. I almost can pretend I'm normal.  And because of its long shelf-life, if I want to reduce my dose because it can make me feel moody and lethargic after continuously taking it for a while...there's no side effects other than feeling better. Its easy to manage my own mood by upping or lowering my intake on the same prescription. I may go a week without it and feel fine, but when I start to get heart palpitations and my mind blanks out when I'm confronted, I begin to take it again. That way it helps me to stabilize but I'm not relying on it ALL the time."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I've battled with anxiety most of my life. In the last six months I've suffered greatly from severe anxiety due to changes at work. The nurse practitioner I was seeing put me on Lexapro, Risperidone, and Remeron for sleep. Nothing was working, and I was not sleeping at all, I mean literally not sleeping more than one hour night, I was not eating barely anything. It got so bad but I put my notice in at work. The nurse practitioner would not prescribe any benzodiazepine because she was worried about my history of substances abuse with alcohol. I ended up trying to kill myself by stabbing myself seven times and overdosing on my prescription medication. After that I went back to my previous psychiatrist and she prescribed me on Clonazapam. I'm now back to work and I'm feeling much better. I wish this was prescribed to me sooner."""
Insomnia,8.0,"""Yes indeed, Clonazepam is a ""wonder drug"" for sleep (and anxiety); BUT, beware...if I can just save one person from this drug...YES!!! I ended up on this drug for 18 years and it took me four months of a slow taper to wean myself. During and after withdrawal, I had horrible side effects: nausea, insomnia, panic, loss of memory, etc. I have been totally off the drug for 8 weeks and my side effects are slowly going away but I still have a horrible metallic taste and smell. I'd try anything OTHER than a benzo. It is not worth the side effects. Look at the drug warnings; they state the drug is meant for SHORT TERM USE. Good luck."""
Panic Disorder,1.0,"""I have a frontal Lobe injury along with PTSD and Panic Disorders. I took 1 mg of Xanax QID (4) per day as directed for 16 years. I asked to be removed while in the Hospital.

He won't listen to concerns and has never given me a physical."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""I would not be alive now if not for Klonopin, nor would I have been able to complete Graduate school. Anyone who has had panic disorder that literally freezes your mind and body into a state of never ending terror know. You are sure you will die. Mine started at age 28. I have been taking a low dose; 1 mg per day - 0.5 morning and before bed. If I feel one coming on I take 1 mg of Ativan - happens a few x a month. Those who say it's as horrible and addictive as Heroin? Likely using it for generalized anxiety and increase irresponsibly .Those of us who suffer from the physical and mental terror of panic disorder and take the medication carefully - it's hard to hear others saying how dangerous it is. Anything misused is dangerous."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""This medication is magic. The first few times you take it (if you take it before bed, I usually do because that's when a majority of my panic attacks occur), then you might wake up feeling zombie-ish for a few times in the beginning. For me, that side effect passed. Now, it's amazing for me. My best friend was on Xanax and she said it would just knock her out and by the time she woke up, it would be worn off and she would then panic all over again. Klonopin has not been like that for me because it has a longer half life, which means it stays in your system in effect for a longer period of time. I will say this - be careful. Honestly, I took 1/2 of a .5mg pill for a while and it did me well. Be safe with your usage and you'll love it."""
Insomnia,10,"""I have been using Clonazepam for insomnia and mild anxiety for the last 4 months and I can say that it is working miracles for me. I have been using a very very small dose - 0.25 mg in the evening for the first 3 months, now I am taking even less - 0.15 mg in the evening. I have 0.5 mg pills that I use to break into small pieces. The dosage is so small that I have no fear of becoming an addict. Even so, if my sleep and peace of mind mean being an addict, then I 'm more than happy to be one."""
Anxiety,7.0,"""I was diagnosed with PTSD and GAD after 2 tours in combat. I began to suffer from anxiety in 2009, I was prescribed Zoloft and Klonopin .25mg (as needed). Klonopin was an immediate relief for unexpected anxiety attacks. 15 minutes later I was functional again. After 2 years, Zoloft destroyed my libido. So I took myself off and relied only on Klonopin. It began as needed, then 2 a week, once everyday, and finally twice a day. The anxieties were reoccurring quite often, I quickly built a dependence to get me through the day. It turns out that I was getting anxiety due to my addiction to klonopin. I decided to get off cold turkey (not recommended) and I went through 2 weeks of withdrawals. its a quick relief but addictive. be careful!"""
Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,,"""Was taking very small doses (0.1 mg)  for 3 years - and one night after taking it on the previous night for sleep, I drank a few beers and had some type of dizzy spell - which resulted in becoming ""sensitized"" to Clonazepam.  From that point on, I suffered side effects from either taking the drug or from trying to withdraw.  I only gained relief after quitting Clonazepam with the aide of substitute medications (Olanzepine & Fluexatine (3-25mg)."""
Bipolar Disorder,8.0,"""I had been taking clonazepam for two years, then slowly stopped taking it. A couple weeks after not taking it, I had a grand mal seizure. Then a few more smaller petite seizures after that. I started up clonopin again and bam.  No more seizures. It is a great drug for my BPD but I will caution you to talk to the doc before stopping it."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I had migraines for 20 years and just dealt with it the best I could.  Doctors put me on all types of pain and triptan class drugs and while they numbed it they didn't do much.  I would always awake with a migraine and it would last 3-4 days.  10 years ago a Dr gave me 0.5mg clonazpam at bedtime and BOOM headaches almost go away.  I have forgot the bottle on weekly trips and do find my quality of sleep is reduced but overall no other side effects.  Do plan to drop to .25 and .10 nightly if I can't cut them that small...but if the migraines return...they will bury me (of old age) with .5 in my bloodstream."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have suffered from panic attacks for 25 years, I was almost 6 years free of them in celexa after years of Ativan   So I went on klonipin and I think it works very good , slow at first but 1-1.5 mg a day and I feel like I have my life back.  Very good."""

Panic Disorder,9.0,"""I am fairly certain that Clonazepam saved my life.  I suffer from a phobia of vomiting, with frequent panic attacks (which of course make me nauseous, leading to even more panic).  I was put on Clonazepam when I was sixteen, and I'm still on it at twenty eight.  I've had to increase the dosage only once, very recently.  Side effects are mild and usually limited to a slight feeling of sedation.  Clonazepam utterly annihilates anxiety.  The only reason I don't rate it as a ten is because of its addictive nature.  Clonazepam should never be suddenly stopped, as the withdrawal is highly unpleasant.  That being said, I'll take a functional physical addiction over a life lived in panic any day of the week."""

Anxiety,3.0,"""I was prescribed Clonazepam on a situational basis, to help manage infrequent but severe anxiety attacks. Although I do find this drug does help to take the edge off in stressful situations like an interview or a crowded concert, the side effects and withdrawal symptoms are far too negative. While on it I feel drowsy and forgetful, and the next day and even up to two or three days later, I get depressed (more than I normally am) and cry A LOT. The last time I took it I had severe depression and even suicidal thoughts (which I never have really had before) for two full days after. That scared me enough to not want to ever take it again.. I highly recommend being careful and doing your research when it comes to Clonazepam."""

I was disoriented, rooms looked like they were sideways, objects that were not moving looked like they were, I couldn't get enough air in, I needed to close my eyes, driving was out of the question and I was nauseated and terrified. After two weeks of being out of work I was put on Klonopin along with antidepressants. It is the only thing that has allowed me to function like I could before the panic/anxiety attacks started. The only drawback is that I have to take it at the same time each day and cannot miss a doseage or the dizziness, panic and feeling like I am going to pass out comes back. It has been a life saver."""

Panic Disorder,10,"""I was given clonazepam 0.5mg as needed for panic attacks but have since been taking that dosage 2x a day for about 5 years.  I don't want to go up on the dosage because I don't want to be one of those people taking 9mg a day.  (but not I am 
saying,  who cares if it gives your life back do it ) so at this point I am sure it's just the placebo effect,  or not.  But it saved my life so I am on this medication for life.  When it gets really stressful or panicky,  I take 1mg, like tonight.  Panic attacks have all gone with this drug,  and Prozac

The Clonazepam has been a wonderful drug which has allowed me time free from the agony of anxiety.  It has also caused me problems with drowsiness and memory.  Withdrawal has been manageable on a couple of occasions.  I am currently on .25mg/day/prn and am trying to get off of it completely per my MD.

My psychiatrist, and 2 other consulted doctors,  don't express the least amount of concern about using 1 mg of Klonopin daily perhaps indefinitely.  However, I went 42 years without taking a prescription drug and it really is my hope to not need Klonopin for much longer.

I have had insomnia for 8 mths off of it. I think it's best to manage sleep or anxiety issues on your own because being on this stuff is not worth it.

Clonazopam on a regular dose has helped me in so many ways. I'm prescribes 4 1 mg tabs a day, even though I don't usually take that much, along with wellbutrin.  I'm no longer experiencing anxiety or panic attacks and best of all don't feel the need to get high in order to get rid of it. clonazepam has saved my life along with suboxone.

Anxiety,2.0,"""I was on this medication for approximately 5 years.  The last couple of years, I had increasing anxiety and depression.  I never increased my initial dose of 2 mg. at night to help with sleep.  My PDoc continued to insist that it was not the Klonopin that was causing my anxiety and depression.  Who knows?  I weaned myself off of the medication SLOWWLY over 4 months.  It really took me that amount of time, even that may have been too fast for me.  When it works, it's a helpful me.  Problem is that many people tend to build a tolerance to the med and will likely need to increase the dose to get the same effect, hence feelings of withdrawal that can come on automatically.  I know everyone has his/her own opinion about this drug."""

A month ago I had a few drinks and decided to do a little cocaine. Bad move. My anxiety exploded. Started taking 30mg of citalopram daily since then. It still doesnt work after a month so my doctor prescribed me .5 Clonazepam when needed. When I feel really anxious, I take .25 and it wards off any anxiety. I feel back to normal.

It took me a spur of the moment gather of courage to take Klonopin..and now I can say that *when needed*, I love Klonopin.

That said, when taking it, it works.  It, like most, if not all benzos, actually start messing up the natural sleep architecture.  The longer one takes this, and the higher the dosage, makes for a very difficult withdrawal, physical and psychological.  Never, after having taken this medication regularly, suddenly stop.

I went on a 2 day trip 3 years ago and forgot my medication. I was up all night and realized that I was dependent on Klonopin. In the past 3 years I have slowly decreased my dosage to 1mg at night and 1mg in the morning. I have been at this dosage for 1 year. If I forget to take this Klonopin dosage, I get very anxious.

My doctor finally sent me to a Psychologist and he diagnosed me with panic attacks. There was a name for this!!  I was prescribed something similar to Klonopin and when Klonopin came on the market, he prescribed 0.5mg twice a day.  I have had no adverse side effects, only positive.

I take an extremely extremely low dose (0.125 mg - 1/4 of an orange tablet) as needed. I cannot explain how amazing this drug has been for me. I get silent anxiety - not necessarily panic although I did recall getting 1x or 2x.

One caveat to this is that the feeling it does give is beautiful but it has a strong appeal to stay at that level. Probably be on this drug for life."""

I will say that it was the best medication for anxiety, but its side effects and addictive traits made it a horrible experience for me. I strongly recommend that people do not use this medication or any form anxiety medication. I also suggest people keep way from anti-depressants.

I finally went back to Pristiq which had worked several years prior for me and after a few months was back to myself and with my Dr's OK I weaned off of the Klonopin and have been of it completely for almost two months now. I was terrified to stop it since I heard so many horror stories of benzo withdraw but I had no withdraw just as my Dr. had thought. Good luck!"""
Anxiety,8.0,"""Was warned about benzo's by my first psychiatrist but in all fairness I haven't seen a (major) dosage increase. I first started with .25mg when I needed it. Mostly at night to .5mg again mostly at night. To then routinely taking .5mg in the morning and at night. Never straying to take it any more doses per day because of said addiction warnings. I have had some lapses in taking the prescribed amount for a couple days of which I paid for with loss of sleep but with any negatives I've found for this drug the positives have outweighed the negatives significantly. The biggest negative for me is the controlled substance and the hoops one must go through in order to maintain a routine for the medication."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""A life saver to say nonetheless. I am currently on two 1mg tablets of Clonazepam a day. I must say I haven't felt better and since my doctor prescribed it I haven't had any anxiety attacks or random out of the blue panic attacks. I was doing the lab rat routine for years. All the basic SSRI""s and trilicylic anti-depressants just weren't doing it. Now I take my two tablets (1mg) a day and I couldn't be better. Combined with my 50mg trazadone -for my insomnia disorder- one a night before bed I couldn't be better. My quality of life has undeniably, drastically, and fortunately improved."""
Anxiety,7.0,"""Okay, here is the thing with Klonopin. It's a drug that works perfectly. There is literally no way to be anxious on a high enough dose, and benzos will be your saving grace if you are suffering from several panic attacks a day or even if you're catatonic. It's also got a pretty good record for being safe, far as I know.

Here's the bad part. Any drug that works too well, that allows you to feel too good on it, runs a high risk of dependency. Not only that, withdrawal from this drug is miserable and painful if not done currently and under supervision. You'll be told this is ""not abusable as Xanax"" because Xanax is common among recreational drug users. That's a fallacy. Klonopin is very easy to double up on and abuse. Do not mix with alcohol."""

I seen a Dr at the age of 16 and started on Xanax 0.5mg and Xanax worked till I was 19. My friend gave me a klonopin 1mg tablet during a panic attack while I was with him and had no Xanax with me. I like how klonopin worked compared to Xanax, seen my Dr a week later and at the time was on Xanax XR 2mg 2 tablets twice daily. I asked to switch Klonopin and he put me on Klonopin 2mg 1 tablet taken 5 times daily and it's what I take currently now and keeps the anxiety away."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I was prescribed 0.5 mgs twice a day as needed. Usually take it in the morning around 8 or 9 am and take the other around 7 or 8 pm. Klonopin is a life saver!! I was on Xanax before, but found that it made me zombie like and no matter how little or how much I would take, it didn't help my social anxiety like I needed, which is what I needed help for the most. I've been on klonopin for a few months and have never felt better since my anxiety started to emerge (about 3 1/2 years ago, I'm 21 now) it's definitely boosted my confidence especially in social situations. I'm also been prescribed 60mg of adderall a day, have been for over 10 years. Both combined definitely help when working."""
Anxiety,10,"""Before this pill I had taken a many different anti-depressant as my family doctor stated that this would with my anxiety as well. This is BS!

So much starts to happen to my body during an atfack. My heart feels like it is going to literally explode. My breathing becomes hyperventalating. So finally I was prescribed 1mg of klonapin 2 x a day and it has worked wonders in helping stop attacks"""
Panic Disorder,10,"""It works. I have panic attacks and then I have severe full blown three days without sleeping panic attacks. I only take 1mg when I am having the severe attacks and I make sure I only take that much. I would say I take maybe 2 mg a month. The reason why is because this really should be used for worst case scenarios and not for moderate anxiety and panic. The withdraws are unbelievably monstrous,  worse than anything else. Taking it everyday is a horrible idea because you will never get off unless you go to rehab. Klonopin needs to be used with extreme caution. Get cognitive behavioral therapy for you everyday moderate panic attacks and use klonopin for this emergency ""can't get out if this"" episodes. It is a tool, not a crutch"""

Anxiety,7.0,"""Hi,
Almost two years ago, I started on a dose of 0.5mg of Klonopin twice a day (or as needed) along with 20 mg of Celexa (citalopram).  I would say Klonopin is an effective drug and useful for treating anxiety and panic attacks.   However, my advice would be to make sure that you are working with your doctor if deciding to cut down on/taper off of Klonopin.  I weaned my dose off without talking to my doc a few times.  Mostly OK (days of some side effects notwithstanding), however, once it was pretty bad.  I recall feeling -- edgy -- all day at work, and then later that night feeling horrible.  I didn't want to eat, I cried, and I kept having anxious thoughts.  I would not recommend leaving Klonopin cold turkey unless you really feel ready."""

Then about 4 years ago my husband was in a near fatal car accident and a year after that we had to put our daughter into a psych ward for about 3 weeks. Long story there, but my anxiety was out of control. Pounding heart as soon as I woke up and all day long. The thought of taking a shower was almost overwhelming. A shower!  So my Dr put me on Klonopin. Amazing. Helped me so much. Then his clinic couldn't prescribe it for a few months due to laws that were passed and then amended. So I was off of it for about a year. So very horrible. But back on and grateful!!"""
Panic Disorder,10,"""I have suffered from anxiety since I was 17. I had a very traumatic experience and I believe that is what triggered my GAD. It got horribly bad while going through a custody battle and dealing with my ex. I was taken to the hospital during a severe attack and formally diagnosed for the second time with GAD. I was presecribed Clonazepam and it has worked wonders for me. I have been on it for a little over a year. Granted my doses do go up occasionally. I started at .25 and slowly moved to 1mg. I refuse to take Xanax because of an addiction I had when I was a teenager. I take my meds as prescribed. 1mg 2x daily. There are days I try to control my anxiety and do pretty well and won't need my meds and then other days where I definitely need it."""

It helps my pins and needles issues too and my blood pressure is normal too. The only problem is it makes my depression sometimes worse. I also get little bit over sleepy like in daytime I feel a hangover of sleepiness and sometimes I feel bit dopey so I take two 5mg of it at night time but If I feel it too much I sometimes take 1 in a half to limit too much sleepiness.

I took 3 mg a day . 1 mg in the morning and 2 mg at night. I became a Christian and I tapered of the meds, I believe meds should be taken short term less than 6 months .

I have not only anxiety, but chronic depression, bi-polar disorder,  limb jerking, panic attacks to the extreme. I am so sensitive to meds, it's scary. So when I find something that works I stick with it. I usually only take ""Brand Name"", good insurance, or I couldn't.  I'll tell you from experience, if you stick with an exact time line on taking it, rather than as needed, you will do a lot better. I have never had any side effects from it, a blessing. It helps with all of the above. I took myself off of about 17 medications a doc, had me on. I call them stackers. For a while I did not even know who I was. Now, I am stable, doing the best I ever have."""

Right now I am on 40 mg of Celexa once a day and 2mg of clonazepam 4x a day. I have been on Lorazepam and Ativan but they only work a few days. I was on Xanax for many years and it worked great, my dosage kept going up, I was taking 2 mg 4x a day and still had anxiety attack.

I was always afraid to get up in class to speak class and found myself avoiding it all together if possible. My voice would shake, I'd trip over my own words, I'd start sweating and my heart would race so fast that you could practically hear it. Having social anxiety has been a nightmare. It stemmed from years of bullying and abuse growing up and never had any hope until my Dr prescribed 0.5mg of clonazepam twice a day. I take one in the morning and one at night.

I took Xanax just to go to sleep for an hour.  A counselor tried to get me to do breathing and muscle relaxation exercises but I was too anxious to concentrate.  I had to take off work because I ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT FUNCTION! My Psychiatrist just put me on Klonopin 1mg 3x a day.  That's a lot but hopefully I can taper off soon & the Zoloft can do it's job.

I try not to take them if I don't need it,  but you never know when it may manifest.  So I try to take half doses to make my script stretch and to also not be as dependent.

Anxiety,10,"""I have anxiety and am agoraphobic. I have constant anxiety, which I can usually deal with without medicines. But when my anxiety becomes extreme, clonazepam calms me quickly. It also works when I take one before I am going to be in a situation that I know will cause my anxiety to be intolerable (like a crowded grocery store). I take them only as needed, not necessarily every day, so I don't worry about addiction or withdrawals. However, I did go through withdrawal once. I found that cutting back on my dosage over a couple of days alleviated my withdrawal symptoms. This medicine has helped me face my fears and I fully expect to one day either use it rarely or completely stop needing it."""
Night Terrors,5.0,"""I was prescribed for night terrors. I tried it for about 4 weeks. I had a significant improvement but the side effects included feeling drugged all day and twitching muscles in my ears. I stopped taking It because of the side effects."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have been taken Klonopin for 20 years, it all started because I lost function of both my inner ears and had no balance. The ear specialist concluded that there was no treatment available for this condition so my stress and anxiety level landed me in a pain clinic where medicine, exercise, counseling and diet did the trick. In three days I was back to normal. What I later found out is that Clonazepam was not only very effective for my balance disorder but it took the anxiety away. Today I  take 2mg a day in two or three dosages and feel completely normal. When stress increases I slightly increase the dosage. I take it with Lexapro so as not to end in depression.

Under recommendation from my therapist my GP reluctantly prescribed clonazepan (Klonopin). 1 mg 2 x day. The full 1 mg made me a bit glassy eyed and dull.

I dreaded going to bed for years.  My twin sister also has rest leg syndrome and her doctor put her on Klonopin, it worked for her. So I went to my doctor and he gave me a prescription of Requip.

If I feel anxiety and can not stop the feeling, I will take 1mg. I plan to cut my dose to 1mg nightly.

Panic Disorder,7.0,"""I first started out on Lamictal and unfortunately got a rash from it. I then was moved onto Ativans and those worked but only for a short period of time.

That's why I gave it an 8."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""I've struggled with panic attacks, anxiety, and other symptoms stemming from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. First my Dr gave me Ativan which made me tired, and helped with my symptoms slightly. After a couple of days though, it just stopped working. I was then bumped up to low dose Xanax which worked slightly better but my dose kept needing to be increased because of the loss of effectiveness. The other problem I had with Xanax was that 15 minutes after I took it I felt like I had a piano dropped on my head, and then 2 hours later all effects were gone. Clonazepam, however, has been far more effective. It does not hit you all at once. It is steady, and long lasting. 1 MG 4x daily, and no need for a raise since I switched 6 months ago."""
Anxiety,3.0,"""I took them for 3 months before I told my doctor to either change me or take me off them.

It's never given me any side effects ever, has worked some with other meds, but found a good combination where it is really working so much better: 1mg 4x daily (one of those at bed time), Wellbutrin, Topomax (""mood stabilizer), Prozac. I am still trying to get over the semi-agoraphobia (can't get out alone, only with another person) that an antipsychotic caused with daily anxiety/panic attacks. But the clonazepam is working now."""
Insomnia,10,"""I was talked into Klonopin by my doctor.  I was quite resistant to benzodiazepe medications. I take 2 mg at night before bed.  This medication has been a life-saver for me.  My doctor asked that on some nights that I go down to 1.5mg in order to keep the medication working well.  Have been taking it for three years this way, and it works. Sleep is so important, and I have tried everything.  Good medication for insomnia."""
Anxiety,8.0,"""I was prescribed Klonopin to get me through anxiety exarcebated by starting on Lexapro. It is a benzo and therefore highly addictive so I was very careful about taking it as little as possible. I found it to be very effective and one tablet would actually keep me calm for around 36 hours ( it has a very long half life ). I did not feel side effects and didn't feel drunk or disoriented. Was effective for me but needs to be used with care. """
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I have anxiety attacks, restlessness, post traumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder. My Dr put me on 1 mg Klonopin about a year ago and now I can handle life again.

It also controls my bipolar disorder I no longer (flip out) as my daughter calls it. So yes I agree that it is a miracle."""
Anxiety,10,"""This medication is really great for anxiety. I use it for severe anxiety related to interviews and relationships.

I am more social again, working on my novel, doing well at work, handling stress well, having a lot more fun and joy. I've been on it for 3.5 weeks and hopefully can stay on it permanently. I know one needs to be cautious with it."""
Anxiety,10,"""Best medication personally for anxiety and panic attacks. I have been taking 3-6mgs a day since I was 16 and compared to all the other benzodiazepines it has been the safest for long term use. I have tried Ativan, Xanax, and Valium also and did not have good experiences due to many side effects and they only worked for a couple weeks for me. Personally all medications have withdrawal so why not choose the best medication for yourself. SSRI's are just as hard to come off of as Benzos because of withdrawals, but most doctors don't tell you that."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I have been on Klonopin for about 6 months now. I am on a pretty low dosage. I am prescribed one 0.5 mg in the morning and one in the evening before bed. I feel this pill has been a life saver. I take it and it kicks in my system in about 20 minutes or so and I start to feel my panic and anxiety melt away. I feel like I can breathe easier and my heart isn't beating out of my chest. I am more efficient at work and that's very important because my job entails direct patient care/interaction...so I have to be ""happy"" and on top of things.

My dr put me on Prozac and that's helping a little bit to control crying. But the Klonopin is giving my heart and mind a chance to breathe again when I take it as needed.

Anxiety,9.0,"""Really good for as-needed, I take it less than once a week because my antidepressant works well. For me, 0.5mg in the early afternoon really takes the edge off, doesn't knock me out or leave me stoned, and lets me sleep that night. Rated a 9/10 because I have sexual side-effects for a few days afterwards, really not a big deal because the benefits outweigh. Only take this medicine as-needed, tolerance builds fast so a script of 30 should theoretically last 6 months. Be safe, and above all, communicate with your doctor. Benzos can be very useful if used properly."""
Insomnia,10,"""Just went back on this because of anxiety and insomnia. All my llfe I haven't slept well and have woken up anywhere from tired to absolutely exhausted. This will sound extreme but it has saved my life. I now feel 'normal' as I can cope with my anxiety, have less muscle tension and much, much better sleep so I can function during the day. It's too bad it's so look down on as a medication. It's cheap and very effective but doctors, my experience in Canada, seem to only see it as something to be abused."""

I can sleep again 8 hrs straight! I don't feel groggy, drowsy or sleepy AT ALL, actually quite the opposite! I have so much energy in the morning, I feel like a superman!

Hyperekplexia,9.0,"""Clonazepam helped me live a ""normal"" life. After several months of trial and error on the dosing, I was able to walk, hear a loud noise, be touched, etc. AND REMAIN UPRIGHT! The downside is that I now sleep approximately 4 hours more per day than before, which took much adjustment. Overall I'd say the benefits outweigh the problems exponentially.  During and since my second pregnancy while on the medicine, something has changed and I no longer live a ""normal"" life, but I still live a much higher quality of life.  Despite many adjustments to the dosing and scheduling in the last 5 years, I have never regained the freedoms of the first 15 years on the medicine.

I have been seizure free for 22 years except for some myoclonus activity during sleep.  I have not had to increase my dosage and the only time I had a seizure was the two times my doctors tried to decrease my dose to see if I could come off.  Apparently, that is not in the cards. I have no side effects at this point in time, do not find it sedating.  I have always taken as prescribed and also maintain a healthy lifestyle."""

I personally think it's a good idea to follow your doctors instructions and start with the more mild medicine. 

But to those who warn of the withdrawal symptoms of Klonopin. I have to say that opinion does not apply to all. Not wanting to die in the middle of the night every night for 2 years is such a benefit to me that I will risk the withdrawal symptoms that may come with stopping later down the road."""

And some days I take the another 0.125 mg. totaling 0.25mg  per day. I'll admit it helps a lot. It makes me feel like myself again. It doesn't stop the scary thoughts and stupid fears that I have, but I don't react as poorly to them. I'm hoping I don't have to increase my dosage, but figure I have a lot of room to go up if I do. Still wish I didn't have to take them but this winter was rough and I needed some help until the sun shines again."""
Night Terrors,5.0,"""I had been taking anti-anxiety medication for a very long time due to my severe anxiety and panic attack disorder I have and the last resort after trying a few others was to take klonopin 1 mg 4 times a day.. After starting taking the medication, I didn't notice any bad side effects, but then I slowly started to have nightmares and night terrors, even when I just took small cat naps! It was absolutely horrible, I couldn't stand it but I didn't think about Klonopin being the cause until after a while it stopped working for my anxiety and I went back to Xanax which started to work better for me again and all of a sudden, my night terrors have disappeared and no longer afraid to fall asleep! They've gone away ever since I stopped Klonopin."""
Anxiety,10,"""Klonopin definitely has a smoother onset and longer duration than Xanax. Some tolerance can develop on long term usage so try to keep the dose as low as possible. Great benzodiazepine, wipes out anxiety once you figure out the right dosage for you."""

I do keep mednotes on all medications I take for interactions just because I've had some scares with some medications that have interacted with each other but the pharmacist or doctors have not caught onto."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have been taking Klonopin for generalized anxiety disorder for 18 years now.  I am 52 years old and this medicine saved my quality of life. I have ranged between 2.5 and 3.5 mg for 18 years now.  No side effects at all.  Psychiatrist told me I could use it the rest of my life.  Felt it was an older but best proven remedy for dealing with GAD on the market.  No pharmaceutical kickbacks involved so not as popular as other medicines being prescribed.  No pharmaceutical incentives to sell.  Not addictive but could be dependency forming.  Lesser of evils versus anxiety.  I highly recommend it in proper circumstances."""

Insomnia,9.0,"""I'm 25, female, full-time student and full-time worker, living in NYC. I've been fighting insomnia triggered by anxiety my entire life, but it was never an issue until I reached my mid-twenties. When I lay down, I get a series of panic attacks that can keep me awake the entire night. Lately, I've been going three days on ~5 hours of total sleep. I quit my job and my focus for school was diminished. I became scared and a total mess. I need proper sleep to be able to function the next day. I was recently prescribed Clonazepam through my psychiatrist and it is, seriously, a blessing from the universe. I take .5 mg when I start feeling sleepy and, within an hour, I'm in dreamland. I don't have to fight for sleep or get anxious about sleeping."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,10,"""I have both restless legs syndrome and insomnia. I have taken Clonazepam for 10 years. Started at 0.5mg, 1mg then 2mg. Decided to stop all medication a year ago and I have not slept worth a darn as well, as my restless legs syndrome has been horrible. Finally broke down last night and took a Clonazepam. Had no RLS and I did sleep, waking up only a few times. I was a little groggy this morning but certainly can deal with that. In past years I have tried many other medications with horrible results. Clonazepam has been a very positive experience for me."""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I have taken clonazepam for years to sleep and to control anxiety/panic over my child's chronic illness.  When my son had a medical crisis and was hospitalized recently, I had my first 2 migraines within 12 hrs of each other.  I became so anxious of having another it was non-stop anxiety. My psych said to use the clonazepam for the anxiety and another 0.5mg tablet if I felt the eyestrain/nausea of another migraine coming on.  Two times I have taken 2 Advil (200mg) and 0.5mg tablet of Clonazepam when I felt eyestrain/nausea/light headedness - but I have not had another migraine.  Whether the increased dose is helping abort the migraine or just calm my anxiety over having one, the relief is good in either case."""

My dr. put me on Klonopin 2mg 1 tab 5 times daily when I was 19 and its a wonder drug. I'm 23 now and I'm not panic free completely but when I feel it coming I take a tablet and the fear is all gone in 20 minutes. I'm 23 now and if you take it properly it will help you greatly.

Bipolar Disorder,8.0,"""Since I was 13 years old. Anxiety has been a severely debilitating issue in my life. It's destroyed most of the relationships in my life and stopped me from maturing as a person in terms of moving up in the job field. A lot of people would consider me weird, because of becoming Very reclusive due to my anxiety disorder. When I am on Klonopin... IT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT! I have a lot of energy, motivation and I'm anxiety free. The most I've taken consecutively was 2mg  for about 2 weeks and after stopping for about 2-3 days after that I'd never feel any withdrawal effects. This is usually the cycle I use. The quality of my life is drastically better on Benzodiazapine medication."""

I am having a hard time finding a new neuro in my area that does not have a several mo. waiting list (north Louisiana & Arkansas border).I ran out of this medication a month ago; obvious with-drawl symptoms have not been 'enjoyable': severe insomnia, nausea, extreme weakness; to me it felt like it was causing my M.S. to get worse.

One symptom is not reaching a deep sleep past REM, and having nightmares through-out the night, continually waking, panicked. I was prescribed a sleep med that made me some what relaxed, or I maybe only slept for four hours, and still having nightmares. This went on for months. I was prescribed Clonazepam and it has been a God-send. Not being able to sleep normally had a terrible affect on my daily life. I take it a few hours before bedtime, and when ready I lay down and sleep soundly, waking the next morning feeling relaxed, rejuvenated. I am able to return to a normal activities without the fatigue."""

Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,9.0,"""Works great for Periodic Limb Movement Disorder for me. Can intensify if I stop talking it though.....which is a slight worry, as I would prefer not to take it for the rest of my life if I can help it.

At my worst I was hitting myself and my partner in my sleep without any control at all and would waken me 9 times out of 10. So I was having very poor sleep, so was my wife. So I can live with a bit of tiredness over feeling like a zombie."""
Panic Disorder,8.0,"""One thing I learned while taking 0.5mg of clonazepam as a sleep aid, it did help my panic attacks that I had for about 7 years. Side effects weren't bad at all. But one thing you might want to try if you take this medicine for panic attacks. I was told during this time that I was now a diabetic. For six months I did away with 98% of my normal sugar intake, and along with the clonazepam, it did wonders for my panic attacks. Sugar acts as brain fuel and to much of it puts the brain in overdrive (it doesn't take much) which puts you on edge for panic attacks. I recommend cutting out at least 50% of your sugar intake. Your notice a big difference. I also lost a huge amount of weight. Cost nothing to try. It worked for me. P.S., no sodas or Juices."""

I've been taking these for over 1 year now, so I don't know why he went to 90 instead of 120. I have VERY high anxiety, and it was not cutting it for me not being on it for a week. When I went back on it, I was just fine. I would for sure give this a 9.9 rating. Best medicine for anxiety I have ever taken!"""
Insomnia,9.0,"""After four spinal fusions, I have chronic pain and chronic spasms. I've tried almost everything out there My doctor suggested 0.5mg of Clonazepam twice a day for spasm and sleep. It's worked wonders. Being able to get rest, makes everything else tolerable."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have been on Clonezepam for 2 different reasons. 1 for Anxiety 1mg pill 3xs a day, and then 1mg at bedtime to help Insomnia. It REALLY helps with the anxiety part with me losing both parents & dealing with my own rheumatoid arthritis at age 26. To those worried about becoming addicted or physically dependent on this medicine, I wouldn't worry about it too much as I been on it for 3  yrs now and I haven't had to had to up my dose at all and have been on steady 4mg daily. There were a few times where my doctor went on vacation & it was my fault for not getting my script early.

Anxiety,9.0,"""A very effective medicine, that needs to be used with care and caution. I wouldn't take more than 1mg per day, and my doctor will not prescribe any higher dose.

Panic Disorder,10,"""Having lived with my Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and panic disorder. Klonopin seemed to be what I needed. It eliminated my issues by 95%. And it has a longer half life so it can be taken daily.  It's given me my life back."""

Anxiety,9.0,"""I was placed on 150mg x2 a day Wellbutrin & 0.5mg Klonopin X 2 a day. Wellbutrin gave me the initial energy I needed to stay awake. At one point I didn't have enough Klonopin to get me through so I cut my dosage in 1/2 for the Klonopin to 0.5mg. Wellbutrin was overpowering it made me too hyperactive and made my anxiety rage so I stopped taking it and it helped calm me down. My depression disappeared and my anxiety leveled out. Since, I%u2019ve been back on 0.5mg x 2 a day, extra as needed and stayed off the Wellbutrin. The depression hasn't come back yet. If I forget to take Klonopin for more than a day I start losing my thoughts mid-sentence and I forget everything that I%u2019m trying to say.

I was scared to take any medicines after having a bad experience with another anxiety medication, but I took it finally and day three of my panic attack/no sleep was over! I could eat again and finally crack a smile. It did make me sleepy, and it felt a tad funny to walk. I only took them before bed to sleep unless I really needed it. It restored my confidence that I could be happy again and made me feel comfy just knowing I had them on me. I am off of them for now and on a different anxiety pill, because my doc didn't want me to become dependent on them. I do keep one or two in my purse for emergencies."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""Klonopin works pretty well at low doses (2-4 mg). I'm 46 6'4' 260 lbs. Higher doses just make me drool and shuffle, and cause horribly painful foot cramps if I miss a dose or two. Low dose, no problems. One wicked side effect is memory loss and speed of comprehension. Sleep is better. Withdrawal is pretty easy at low doses. Taper from high doses. It also was a major asset discontinuing opiates, and their various temporary-but-forever withdrawal effects."""
Anxiety,10,"""I take 2mg Klonopin 4-5 times daily along with Adderall XR 20mg 2 each morning. The combination of the two works great. I suffer from BiPolar disorder, Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and ADHD. I would get so bad I would lock myself in my room at home and cry my eyeballs out, afraid to speak to people, just full blown terrible anxiety. Klonopin is very effective if taken properly. Its a miracle medicine. I used to just be on Xanax 1mg 5 times daily and it started making me angry and aggressive. Some people react different to medications. Klonopin controls my mood, stops the worst anxiety you ever experienced in its tracks. Wonderful medication with just drowsiness as a side effect."""
Insomnia,10,"""I have struggled with moderate insomnia for years (can't fall asleep, wake up 3 hours later unable to go back to sleep, etc).  Although some nights are better than others, it has always been a major influence in my life.  Lunesta worked well, allowing me to get about 6.5 to 7 hours, but it costs a FORTUNE.  Just started clonazepam about a month ago and WOW!  I only take it 3-4 nights a week to avoid dependency and my life is a lot better.  As a side note, I do not suffer from anxiety or depression, I just can't turn off my brain EVER."""

Insomnia,10,"""I've had insomnia for 10 years; couldn't shut my brain off! My uncle is a doctor & flipped when I told him I hadn't slept in 16 days. He immediately prescribed tricyclic antidepressants & sent me for a sleep study; in only 4 hours of sleep, I woke up 69 times. The antidepressants made me suicidal. Everything else worked for just a few weeks. I started getting depressed, panic attacks, anxiety, quit working, having seizures, became a shut in, cried every single day, then became suicidal. The only thing that stopped me was the thought of my family finding me. I was then prescribed Ambien & it worked well but made me hungover. Amitriptyline worked but gave me bad muscle spasms. Finally, I was put on 2mg Klonopin. I can sleep now!"""
Anxiety,10,"""For the severe level of anxiety that I had developed Xanax would help. It would calm my body within a few minutes. However, after about 3-4 hours, my body would be back feeling nervous and tense again. It works very good, except its effects don't last long. I was also prescribed Klonopin to try after I told my doctor that I was having problems sleeping and that the effects from Xanax were not long lasting enough. I am prescribed to take 1 mg twice a day. With Klonopin, I am able to feel relaxed for longer periods of time than with Xanax. It has helped to keep my body more tranquil. It has helped with my sleeping better than Ambien ever did. And, I haven't experienced any bad side effects from it either."""
Anxiety,1.0,"""Please, please, please do your research before ever taking Klonopin or any drug in the benzodiazepine family.  Klonopin has caused me great hardship and nearly cost me my life.  And I am not alone - thousands of people have had horrific experiences with this drug.  Please search ""benzo withdrawal"" or similar to educate yourself.  Looking back, my original anxiety was nothing compared to the torture I went through once I was addicted to klonopin.  And I am not through it yet.  Words  can not explain the horror I went through.  That is why I beg you to do your own research.  Most doctors don't know or are in denial about the withdrawal effects of benzodiazepines.  The stories you will find are not lies or exaggerations.

When I take it, I feel normal again.  SSRI's have given my side effects; I have none with clonazepam. Some docs don't like to prescribe it long-term, although we are talking about quality of life.  It ought to be the *patient's decision* if they want to remain on it.  If being dependent on something greatly improves quality of life, then it's worth it IMHO.  Some people are born with more anxiety than others.  This medication seems to correct that imbalance in brain chemistry."""
Anxiety,10,"""Anxiety disorder runs in my family, and Klonopin has done us wonders. I suffered a severe car accident 10/2012. Quit my job, quit fall-term, and became paralyzed from Anxiety. Initial dose was 0.5mg 2X a day. I discovered, LESS IS MORE. Now I only take 0.5 mg 2X a day, and it helps me be Andy. Klonopin is addictive. 20mg is max dose for epilepsy. 4mg/ day max for anxiety. 1mg/day in studies is shown to be most effective for anxiety. Take it as prescribed. DON'T, TAKE MORE. If you don't have epilepsy. BELIEVE ME! Benzodiazepines should be used with caution."""
Anxiety,2.0,"""I think Klonopin is the bottom-of-the-barrel of benzodiazepine anti-anxiety/anti-panic medicines. This is from personal experience with it & other benzodiazepines. Klonopin, for one thing, lacks the muscle-relaxant effect that's an additonal benefit of other benzodizepines such as Valium (diazepam). But what's worse is that Klonopin caused me to lose 2 jobs. It has this strange effect of prompting me to 'speak my mind' -- a little too much! Not the case with Valium, which has a much more pleasant effect. With further research I found out that Klonopin was intially marketed for seizure disorders *only*. But, because it didn't sell well for that, the company basically pushed into the anti-anxiety market. There's much better out there."""

Finally my doctor offered me 0.5 mg Klonopin prescription and it has been life changing.  I have been taking it for about 8 months.  My only issue is that he is still suggesting another SSRI which I'm tired of trying.  Now he's suggesting Paxil which I don't want.

Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I started taking Klonopin recently, and I'm mixing it with Vybriid and Lamictal. It helps so much. At night it takes the edge off.

The after effects is a little bit of groggyness but it's worth it. The only thing that bothers me is that I feel like smoking cigarettes after I take it.

Panic Disorder,10,"""Excellent medication. It saved my life. I am a normal person again. The key to panic disorder is to find the adequate treatment for the severity of your condition.

I vary in my doses from 1 mg a day to 3 mg at times due to needing a little more or less. Since I have been on it for so long I am able to do this. I take it at nighttime because I cannot function during the day if I take it in the morning.  I think I have been on every seizure medicine there is and have had nightmare stories concerning them but Klonopin works the best for me. I believe every person is different and what works for one may not work for another. I do have to put up with occasional side effects like bouts of insomnia and breakthrough optical migraines."""

I vary now between 0.5mg and 0.75mg depending on my anxiety level going to bed. I cannot say what a difference it has made. My sleep terrors are all but gone (I still have them on occasion, but not every night), and I wake up feeling more alert than on the other medicines. It has been the most helpful for me."""

There has only been one short period in my life during those 20 years, when my circumstances were so overwhelming that the panic attacks re-occurred, and I would sometimes take an extra dose.

The life saving plus no side effect profile of this medicine is amazing. I just hope I can continue to take it long term because without it I would be in far worse shape.  Thank you for all the rave reviews nice to know I am not alone in my love for this medicine. And this is from a medication averse, workout everyday, eat right person."""
Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,9.0,"""I have been taking this for several years for a tremor and anxiety. I take it 3 times a day, it works so well, but lately Doctors are giving me hard time filling it because it's considered a controlled substance.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10,"""I have suffered from terrible bouts of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder my whole life. I have tried SSRI's such as Prozac and Luvox and at other times the supplement 5-HTP with good success. I wish a doctor had given me Klonopin earlier in life, however, because when I take 1 mg it is as though I have no OCD at all. I do not take it everyday because of its tendency to cause dependency, but I take it as needed. Roche has done a study showing Klonopin's success in helping patients with OCD while they wait for the SSRI to gain full-effect."""
Anxiety,10,"""Awesome medicine. I have a good deal of anxiety I've been dealing with for years.  Recently, I started experiencing involuntary muscle jerks (Myoclonus) that kept getting worse and worse.  About 100 times per day.  After seeing my doctor he prescribed me Klonopin 2mg once daily.  It has been a life saver to say the least.  My anxiety is all but moot.  No real side effects to speak of. I'm relaxed, able to think more clearly, and overall, feeling great!"""
Anxiety,10,"""This is a miracle medicine for me. I've been plagued by anxiety all my life. My Dr recently added 0.5mg clonazepam twice a day to the 115mg Effexor I am taking.
I am happy, relaxed and finally able to enjoy life and work."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I've suffered with depression, anxiety and panic along with various health problems. I have tried just about most medicines that claim to help with these problems. Nothing, until I tried Klonopin and it just changed so much about me. Although I will say in the beginning I felt very cheery and super friendly. Though that particular feeling has decreased it still controls my anxiety. And no side effects, only thing is that it doesn't help with sleep so I take a Seroquel instead at night.It also helps keep me calm when worrying over my bad health conditions. Found deep belly breathing can help while in the midst of a panic. I plan on staying on it. Take care."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""Best medication I've tried to combat panic/anxiety attacks.  Prescribed 1mg twice daily as needed and it's been a God send.  I'm a relatively ""big"" guy, not overweight but tall and broad.  It's been wonderful so far and have a very compassionate physician who listens and has me in his best interest.  Yes, during the down times, it can make you a bit sleepy/drowsy but haven't had a single panic/anxiety attack since beginning the medicine.  It's given my life back and that's priceless.  I can now function at my optimal capacity.  I hate to rely on pharmaceutical solutions but this one has changed my life for the ultimate best."""
Panic Disorder,9.0,"""I have post traumatic stress disorder and PCs.  My psychiatrist switched me from Ativan to clonazepam a few weeks ago. It is powerful and effective. I am prescribed 0.5mg 3X daily (and 200mg of sertraline). It lasts a LONG time and can take up to 4 hours to peak, so if you take 0.5mg, wait a half hour, (decide its not working) and take another half.  I now take a quarter of a pill (0.25mg) at a time and give it at LEAST 2 hours to kick in (because I like being able to leave the house once in a while)."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""Klonopin has been instrumental in getting my anxiety disorder under control.  I take 0.25 milligrams three times a day...taking 0.5mg at once is too much and causes me to be a space cadet.  It doesn't work as well on my rare panic attacks, but I have found other ways to cope with breathing exercises and such. Without it I was nearly non-functioning and about to slip into a deep depression.  It has leveled my mood swings and just made life much more bearable (even joyful!). I would much rather have dependency on this medicine and be happy than feel that I am constantly in crisis (and occasionally suicidal)."""
Panic Disorder,9.0,"""I take 0.5 mg twice daily - actually Xanax worked slightly better, but my doctor believes Klonopon has less risk of addiction, so he prescribed it for long term use, which I need to treat panic disorder.  My panic disorder emerged as a young child and then went into remission from my twenties through my early forties, only to crop up again a few months ago.  I take 100 mg of Zoloft for depression and the Klonopin for the panic and I have my life back.  I do get a little tired each day, but my range of emotions are normal, not desperate, hopeless and fraught with terror of panic.  These medicines area a God send and I thank God daily for them."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,10,"""Have had increasingly severe restless legs syndrome for 45 years.  Finally started using Requip about 12 years ago, and got relief from RLS at night, but had to be doing something physical or at least on my feet all day to keep it under control.  Got up to 3mg at bedtime, but that was causing horrible nasal decongestion every morning.  
My doc suggested clonazepam, and the effect was absolutely amazing!  Wonderful, solid sleep every night.  But, even better, the RLS disappeared during the day, as well.  Daytime movies, meetings, and travel all now possible for the first time in decades!  Need only 0.2 mg each evening, and no adverse side effects or tolerance increase after more than a year.  This truly changed my life."""

,10,"""This med is usually prescribed for anxiety but I'm taking it for post-surgical nerve pain. It is truly a miracle. I take a tiny dose of 0.25mg and it lasts for 14-18 hours! The only downside to it is that it can cause dependency & you eventually get used to it and have to increase the dosage. For that reason alone I don't take it every day although I'd love to."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have no anxiety on this medication. It last longer therefore I don't get panic attacks anymore."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""Completely changed my life for the better. I've had panic attacks for as long as I can remember, literally. I should have been diagnosed at a young age and who knows how things would have turned out, BUT it does help tremendously. I get that doctors are hesitant to prescribe it because it is scheduled and realistically you will be on benzocdiazepines forever if you have serious panic problems like I do, and I know many of you know how debilitating this disease is.  But what is better; intractable panic all day with your teeth being ground down and your BP 200/120, or being on a relatively harmless controlled substance that can give you a life? Not a hard choice to me!"""
Anxiety,9.0,"""Not sure if this qualifies as an anxiety attack, but not sure what else to call it.  I'm 60 years old and have never suffered from anxiety or depression in the past.  I'm active, lift weights, and train (a lot) to race competitively on bicycles. Almost every morning, driving to work (I'm a CFO), when I get about 20 to 15 minutes away, I break out in an uncontrollable sweat.  I'll turn the AC on to 60 degrees turn all the vents on me.  Still, by the time I get to work, my clothes are soaked!  Doc said it seems reasonable to consider this an anxiety attack, regarding my work situation (it can be stressful).  The sweating happens with incredible regularity.  Klonopin made this go away. """
Anxiety,10,"""I have very high anxiety which makes my blood pressure go sky high and my pulse rate stay in the 120's. My Dr prescribed Klonopin and Valium at the same time to try to bring down my blood pressure and pulse rate. My breathing was bad and I hated being in the small waiting room. My biggest fear is driving but since she has put me on 1mg 4 times a day I feel amazing. I sometimes still don't want to leave the house though."""
Anxiety,10,"""This is the only medication that has ever taken away my anxiety completely. I was on it for 5 months and decided to try and quit the medication and it was the worst experience of my life. I now feel like I can't function anymore. My performance at work is slipping and I feel like I am losing my grip with my general anxiety disorder. I have tried Celexa, Zoloft, Lexapro and Remeron with no luck. This medication was a Godsend and when I was taking it I was only taking 0.5mg 1x a day. I did not feel like increasing the dose nor did I feel like I was addicted to it. I did not have a bad withdrawal coming off of it either, other than my anxiety has returned to the same levels it was prior to the medication. This medicine was a miracle for me."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have generalized anxiety disorder. Before I was prescribed Klonopin I was at the verge of losing my job, house, even my family. I couldn't stop worrying, stressing and overwhelming myself. I had no energy to even play with my kids. Once I started taking this medicine it brought me back to living and enjoying life, family, even performing better at work. I really recommend this medicine if you have generalized anxiety disorder, it works like a miracle."""

Panic Disorder,10,"""46 years old and suffered from untreated anxiety since I was 12. Last December had my first panic attack and everything went to hell after that. Doc put me on 0.05 mg Klonopin 1 x a day which I split up and take one half in the morning and half before bed. Also take 10 mg Celexa as well, which seems to work well together with the Klonopin. Needless to say the last week since I've started these I've been better, more motivated and not so anxious, not to mention sleeping all the way through the night. People say don't take Klonopin daily or watch out for withdrawal from long term use? Why stop using it if it has been working for years? Think about what your life was like before using it..cannot have been pleasant. It helps some people live better."""
Anxiety,8.0,"""I was switched from Xanax to Klonopin for anxiety by my doc because the Xanax was just making me feel ill and nauseated.  The Klonopin is doing the same thing.  I feel even more lethargic, weak, nauseated and tired during the day.  The initial prescription is .25 per nite before bed.  Since I wake up with the anxiety each morning, my doc agreed I could take it in the morning.  On Mother's Day I had to take 2 pills and still didn't calm me down...for no reason!  I had a great day planned and still had anxiety.  I think after all these rave reviews I'll try it before bed again and see what happens in the morning.  I just want to feel GOOD again!"""
Anxiety,10,"""After decades of debilitating anxiety, a psychiatrist put me on Klonopin. I have now been on this medication for about 15 years, and my anxiety rarely affects me anymore.

Insomnia,10,"""I have suffered from insomnia most of my adult life. Like many here, I was prescribed clonazepam 1-2 mg. at night.  I have never increased the dose after years of use.  In fact, my doctor recommended that I go down by .5 m.g. as often I felt comfortable to do so in order to reduce the chances of becoming tolerant to the medicine.

Restless Legs Syndrome,10,"""I have had restless legs syndrome for years. In the beginning it was a problem at bedtime. Over time it started everytime I was sitting for more than a few minutes. I couldn't do anything comfortably. Driving, reading the paper, going to a movie, flying, church, watching TV. Clonazepam has worked well!  At first it was perfect and then I started experiencing restless legs right after I took it at night. I still do usually, but it is not very intense and doesn't last long. The medication holds it off the rest of the time. Occasionally I'll have a mild attack while driving or something. It's not very often and not nearly the intensity it was before clonazepam."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""I've been on Clonazepam for anxiety and panic disorder for about 5-6 years. I am prescribed 1 mg 2 x a day. I don't take it that often, I take it as needed and usually only need 1/2 of one to get stop the panic attack, on rare occasion I take 1 whole if it's a really bad one but that isn't very often at all seems though I can stop them before they get extreme. It works GREAT for me, with no side effects at all. And even after being on them for such a long period of time, I've not had to up my dose ever. I still take the same amount I started with (as needed). This was a lifesaver for me, as I was too anxious to even take meds before them. I feel safe now and know that this will work. Recommend!"""

The Dr took me off them & said it wasn't the right medicine.  I tried 2 medicines by his suggestions and changed Dr's after bad reactions.

Bipolar Disorder,8.0,"""I've been on this medicine for about a month.  I am currently on 1 mg 3x daily.   There is no kick to it, in that it's so smooth I'm not sure it's working.  I have less outbursts so I think it helps with that."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""I hadn't had a panic attack in years, but I got sick with the stomach flu about 3 weeks ago which was a trigger for it to return. The past three weeks have been living hell.

I'm new to this medication but so excited to finally just be able to breathe again."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder about 6 years ago and had my share of trying different medications to get it under control. After multiple trials with medicines my doctor finally found the right combination for me (Lexapro, lithium, (Depakote had sexual side effects), Synthroid, trazodone at night, multivitamins and B-1 vitamin). This combination worked great to get my mood swings under control. Once my mood swings were under control, I started having extreme anxiety attacks. I was then diagnosed with anxiety disorder as well. My doctor prescribed 0.75 mg Klonopin 3 times a day, as needed and it is a lifesaver. Klonopin knocks my anxiety down within 15 min. I have been taking it for 3 yrs with great results."""
Anxiety,10,"""Used to take 2 mgs three times per day with my old doctor, stopped for a year,  and now I'm on 0.5mg three times a day.

Insomnia,9.0,"""I've been using Klonopin for about 4 years. I take it when I awake in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep.  0.5 mg gives me about 3 hours sleep and much more if I've not been taking it for a few days. Recently, I've been weaning myself by reducing the dosage to 0.25 mg.  This weaning would be more difficult if I weren't retired so that I can get more sleep just by staying in bed longer.  Not sleeping is much more adverse to my health than taking a moderate dose of Klonopin."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I am bipolar on 500mg Lamictal, 1200mg gabapentin and prescribed Klonopin. I am prescribed to take it 1.0 two times a day but don't need to often. When I am hysterical or very angry in which I want to hit someone or tell them off which happens sometimes you take half usually and it works. I take a whole one if its too much to handle. I don't use it all the time sometimes not even for a week. It's wonderful for those out if control moments! Klonopin is much better for bipolar, to use than Xanax. Xanax had no effect in me at all!"""
Anxiety,10,"""I'm 22 and allergic to peanuts so I would worry all the time about it and would just have panic attacks like at least 3-4 times a week then starting taking this and it just went away. Works great, I feel like a normal person again, no worries."""
Anxiety,10,"""This medication opened up a whole new world for me.  I developed a very bad anxiety & panic disorder and lived with it for years. Therapy and many other medications did not help! Didn't notice much of a difference initially but by the time I was up to 1mg 3 times a day my life so greatly improved.  I currently take another medication (Xanax).  I was taken off the medication because I became an alcoholic. When I detoxed from alcohol I was immediately taken of Klonopin. My only concern for people that are taking it is that if they decide to stop, please withdraw from it properly by a gradual reduction over a period of time.  The hospital took me off of it without gradually reducing it.  The withdrawal was horrible!"""
Panic Disorder,10,"""In my opinion this medicine is great. It feels good to be able to go outdoors with confidence. No more anxiety dizziness, I can say hello to a nice girl at a coffee shop  or even read a book without thinking everyone is looking and laughing at me. This medicine worked for me.

Anxiety,7.0,"""Okay so I have been on Klonopin for about 3 months and might I say it's AWESOME. I have severe anxiety and get panic attacks quite often which are bad and it finally got to point where I couldn't eat or sleep I basically couldn't function. When I first started taking it I was zonked out. They made me so tired but my tolerance has gone up so much and 3 doesn't even do anything to me now so that's the downside. On the up side when the dosage does work your anxiety is completely gone and you just feel so chill yet able to function (at least for me). Hopefully my dosage will be upped and I'll be happy again.

I believe Klonopin is unique among benzodiazepines - because it takes a while to ""kick in"" there is no calming rush after taking it.  The effects come on gradually, which in my opinion lessens the potential for abuse.  I have little to no sedation from taking Klonopin."""
Panic Disorder,7.0,"""Clonazepam 0.5 mg. worked for me better than diazepam or Librium in relieving panic/anxiety and helping me to dose into a mild sleep. I am satisfied with this treatment, works well along with Effexer XR for me."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""This has been a lifesaver for me. Due to a genetic problem that doesn't allow me to metabolize almost all SSRIs, I'm really limited in terms of what I can take to help with my panic disorder. I was on clonazepam about 13 years ago for 6 months. I went to therapy, got better, and weaned off without issue. I just started back on this medicine because of health issues, I've had a relapse of panic disorder. I take 0.25mg once per day, and I am no longer panicking and agitated all day long."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""After trying gobs of anti-depressants, Xanax and the like, Klonopin along with both Effexor and Inderal has obliterated ANY and ALL anxiety and disabling symptoms plaguing my life for YEARS. I am so happy to have found a sympathetic physician who listens to my strife and actually cares about my welfare as a patient.  This combination has made me a NEW person with SO MANY opportunities in life.  This medicine has been a lifesaver and so very happy I'm finally squared with my emotional and anxiety-ridden baggage.  Not a SINGLE panic attack or anxiety attack since starting Klonopin. It's really a God send after so many years of struggling and would recommend to anyone a frank discussion with his/her physician for at least a trial."""
Anxiety,10,"""I am so grateful to find other's who actually are thankful to this medicine. I have been beating myself up over taking it for the past two years, due to this new medication free obsession (which is good advice for some), but this is the ONLY medication that has made me feel better. Instead of going up in dosage, after being diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder two years ago, I have gone down (without even trying). This is an amazing and life saving medication to those who actually need it. I have suffered all my life and nothing else ever worked. Just a tip: if people tell you that you don't need this medication, think back to before you ever took it. 100 % satisfaction with this medicine!"""
Panic Disorder,9.0,"""Klonopin was great for helping me manage anxiety and panic attacks. Almost all medicines carry warnings about alcohol consumption, so many people like me and assume that moderate alcohol consumption is okay, and that warnings are just to limit liabilities of the manufacturers if someone drinks and has an incident. WARNING: DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL IF YOU ARE TAKING THIS MEDICATION.  I did, and had what I now consider to be a near-death experience!""  I found myself in a public restroom stall, and literally UNABLE TO MOVE for what seemed like hours.

I have been prescribed many different medications to no avail and have only been prescribed clonazepam this week.

I had loss of appetite, uncontrollable weight loss, stomach pain, memory loss, headaches, dizziness, urinary pain, thinning hair, bad acne, depression, and constipation. It was so difficult to taper without severe withdrawals that I needed a 6 month tapering schedule. My dose was 1mg twice daily. I find that Valium or Xanax have less side effects."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have had a great experience with Klonopin. It has really saved my life. I tried Buspar and other SSRIs to help with my Anxiety but they never really took care of it. I was in a really bad funk about 6 months ago and the anxiety just kept building up. I went to my psych doc and she prescribed me Klonopin as needed at about 0.5mg a day. It makes me feel good through most days but with increased stress at work I feel I have to take a little more. I say, if it works take it. 10 out of 10 for me. It has given me back my life."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""Very effective at treating social anxiety (while also receiving therapy), keeps you in a more balanced state than with other benzo's, minimal side effects. I was started on 0.5mg 3 times a day but after 3 years I'm down to 0.25mg once a day. I have seen many patients started on too high a dose, I think 0.25mg twice a day is sufficient for most cases and be aware that once you start taking them you will find it hard to stop and will have to wean yourself off them gradually as is the case with most medicines."""

I DIDN'T understand why anxiety would make me feel this way. When the Anxiety would kick in, I literally thought I was dying. My heart would race, my body would get tingles and I would feel chokingness. It was scary and still is. I have tried many, many anxiety medicines, Paxil, Effexor, Xanax, Lamictal, Geodon, and many more. NONE have worked the way Klonopin works. With Klonopin I feel safe and I do not get the jittery feelings. I am so grateful to have a medication that actually works for me. If I miss a dose I will get severe anxiety and a panic attack."""

Anxiety,9.0,"""I had been prescribed Klonopin in the past to treat severe anxiety until my appointment with a psychiatrist who deemed that such an approach to my anxiety issues was heavy handed. He took me off of them and since then I've been on Lexapro, Buspar, Seroquel, Zoloft, Pristiq, Paxil, Atarax all to little or no avail. I moved to a different area and got a new Psychiatrist who diagnosed me with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The original course of treatment for that was Ativan 0.5mg three times daily. I was switched to Xanax 1mg twice a day as needed. A couple of months passed by without substantial improvement and I was bumped to Xanax 1mg 3x day Doctor decided Klonopin would be a better approach earlier today. So far so good."""
Anxiety,10,"""Initially I started on citalopram 20 mg once a day. It was great for anxiety and my depression but I had no sex drive at all. My doctor changed me to Effexor 75 mg once a day for long term and was taking lorazepam 1mg as needed. My anxiety was not controlled. I had to take my lorazepam up to 3 times a day. Spoke to my doctor and I stayed on the Effexor but he switched me over to clonazepam 1 mg twice daily as needed. Lorazepam has a short life but clonazepam stays in your system way longer. Ever since I started on the clonazepam I feel so much better. There are days I only take 1mg at night and that's all I need."""
Anxiety,10,"""Great and effective medication while taking .25 to .50 mg once per day. I'm in Law Enforcement and have a tough time shutting off my mind now and then. Klonopin works very well at taking away the negative thinking and unrealistic worries. Cops tend to role play alot in their minds, with everything. What if this, what if that?? Sometimes it gets out of hand and the horrible feelings that come from that sort of continuous thinking can really take its toll. Klonopin takes that away for a much longer time than Xanax. I also take 20mg of Lexapro a day, been taking for about three months. It has helped to some degree as well and keeps me from having to take a higher dose of the Klonopin. But overall, I give Klonopin a 10."""
Anxiety,10,"""Klonopin has absolutely saved my life in more than one way, with it treating my anxiety and panic attacks. Before I was prescribed Klonopin I had severely withdrawn from almost every aspect of every day life. I was always a very outgoing positive and happy woman before my anxiety and isolation took over every aspect of my life. I just could not face the ""real world"" before Klonopin and now I have been completely able to live a normal, happy and productive life. It has helped with social anxiety which was what caused me to withdraw from every day life. I cannot praise enough the benefits to me personally. I can again live a happy existence and will never have a bad thing to say about it from own my personal experience."""

Insomnia,10,"""I have severe and chronic insomnia that has caused me little (if any) sleep per night, leading to confusion and irritability in the morning, leading to delirium, if prolonged exposure to sleep deprivation was to happen to me. My doctor first prescribed me Seroquel (quetiapine) for my insomnia, which worked a little bit TOO well, as it was too heavily sedating, and left me with too many ""morning-after"" effects. At my doctor's reluctance (due to substance abuse history in not me, but my family) I was given a prescription to a starting dose of 1 mg a night of Klonopin. This was amazing. As opposed to being forced to sleep by Seroquel, Klonopin lulled me to sleep. It's a wonderful medicine."""
Anxiety,10,"""I'm a 48 year-old male, 6-2, 230lbs. I've been taking Klonopin off and on now for the last year. It works pretty well for anxiety and takes about 40 minutes to kick in. I take 0.25mg twice daily. I just started taking Lexapro 20mg and have been on it for about four weeks. Not sure if it's doing much. We'll see in about another 4 weeks if I can stop the Klonopin. I have to agree with others, Xanax works well and quickly, but leaves your system quicker and leaves you more anxious. Klonopin seems to be a little bit smoother and longer lasting about 3-4 hours at 0.25mg. This medicine gets a bad rap due to the people who abuse it. I'm in Law Enforcement and I see it every day who abuse these."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""My doctor does not like this medicine, although she had no problem until she had a patient with a bad experience, etc.  I know that Klonopin has done many things for me, including helping the anxiety and panic attacks.  It also soothes a lot of the side effects of my other seizure and neuropathy medications, while it does not mask the effects totally.  This is good because you always want to be aware of side effects other medications have on you.  I had the perfect balance of medications and was doing very good.  I have read some of the ratings and I agree.  It helped when nothing else could.  The withdrawal symptoms are not good, but, they go away.

Being in crowds doesn't bother me as much. It sort of slows things down and doesn't make things so hectic and crazy. Although things may be going on around you, you seem to not notice it as much. It's unbelievable how different I feel. My dosage is 1mg total a day (super low). I found 0.5mg to be too much so I take 0.25 mg four times a day. I feel like myself again.

In fact - though I wasn't depressed per se - I subjectively experienced the lessening of my anxiety as positive and consequently my mood improved.

It's a great medication."""
Anxiety,1.0,"""My mom was put on o.25 mg nightly Klonopin after having likely withdrawal and memory issues from Ambien.  She experienced anxiety, panic attacks and random episodes of fright/panic and memory loss.  The doctors of course raised the dose to 0.5mg given the anxiety and the symptoms got worse - more anxiety, random attacks and withdrawal symptoms in the morning.  So they raised it to 0.75mg and she got even worse. I had to take control of the situation and spread the medicine out to 3x 0.25.  This helped significantly but nervousness continued. The doctor not understanding her sensitivity decided to reduce the frequency, not the dose and this resulted in terrible withdrawal symptoms.

If work gets too nuts, I may take another 0.25mg during the day -- it ""takes the edge off"" and makes sleeping even better.  When things are calmer at work, I can generally go down to .125mg at night and still get decent sleep.

I am worried about having to come off of it, but my psychiatrist says with weaning it is not too difficult. I think there is too much stigma with this medicine. It works and if you need it, you deal with the physical withdrawal when you have too. It can't be worse than the Zoloft withdrawal I had- with weaning- that doctors told me I wouldn't have. I am not tempted to take more than prescribed, and I don't feel ""high"" on it. Has helped me immensely."""

Withdrawal from clonazepam is not as hard as some people say, it must be gradual. If that doesn't work, ask your physician to switch clonazepam to its equivalent in diazepam.

Klonopin made me cough and increased the thickness of the mucus in my lungs until it was almost impossible to cough it up.

Anxiety,8.0,"""I was just prescribed clonazepam for moderate anxiety, and it's working well for me compared to other anti-anxiety medications I've tried. Lorazepam was great for sudden panic attacks but it made me sleepy and clumsy, and didn't last long enough and had too many side effects for general day-to-day nervousness. Same with Xanax, and even Xanax XR. Clonazepam is great because I can take it in the morning, and have a very steady, reliable feeling of calmness for hours.

That being said, it is a benzodiazepine, so taking it every day isn't a good idea, and the potential for addiction and tolerance is there. In combination with talk therapy, this medication can help you live a life free of fear and worry."""

I was okay for a good couple of months then my anxiety came back stronger than ever. I am now back on the medicine and have no doubt that I will be well in no time."""
Anxiety,10,"""This medicine works the best of all the benzodiazepines for me. It has completely wiped out my anxiety and has zero side effects at my prescribed dose (2.5mgs a day total). The only problem with it and all benzos is that it is very hard to come off of once you have been on it for awhile. I don't think enough doctors stress the dependence factor of this medicine (it is very difficult to withdraw from, you need to decrease your dose very slowly over a long period of time), so educate yourself if it is prescribed to you and use the lowest effective dose.

Even with a 0.5 dose I do get a brilliant nights sleep and feel so relaxed the next day but groggy and slightly confused so if I know it is going to be one of those nights where my legs are moving and jerking all night long I take one. Try not to take regularly and definitely do not drink. Just knowing they are there for me helps me relax."""

Migraine Prevention,6.0,"""I was prescribed Klonopin two weeks ago by my neurologist to help with migraines. My best friend was murdered a month ago and dealing with that stress has caused me to not be able to let my mind slow down enough to sleep which triggers migraine attacks. I find the Klonopin does help me sleep at night but I feel my mind racing with the stress of my friends death while I'm awake so I'm dealing with headaches still while I'm awake."""
Anxiety,10,"""Ever since I was taken ill with mono and strep which occurred at the same time, I have suffered terrible anxiety, OCD with my throat, and some other strange changes.  I had been through Zoloft, Prozac, and Paxil until I was given chlorazepate.  Chlorazepate was the only one that even worked in the slightest.  I told my doctor I could tell it was working but felt that there might be something better,  That's where Klonopin comes in.  It helps control my anxiety and OCD to a manageable level.  Sometimes I'll just break them in half and take 0.5mg in a day, other days sometimes ill need to take 2-3. Basically it has changed my life for the better and I'm glad to have finally found a medicine that works."""
Bipolar Disorder,7.0,"""I could stop using it without withdrawals and it didn't have the extreme highs and lows of most benzodiazepines."""
Seizure Prevention,10,"""Excellent. Haven't had one seizure since I was switched to Klonopin(Clonazepam). It helps with my car accident injuries which I did not expect and not only with the broken bones but almost as an antidepressant, better than Paxil, that I was given and didn't make me fell more relaxed. I sleep well again because I don't take pain medicines even though the doctors prescribe it. Highly worked for me. Start out at a low and comfortable dose if you can't afford to be drowsy at work, etc. Tell your doctor and slowly he will bump your dosage up until you are comfortable."""
Anxiety,10,"""I take Wellbutrin XL in the day for depression, anxiety and bipolar and clonazepam at night and it has done wonders for me.

Panic Disorder,9.0,"""Been using in alternating with Xanax for 15 years, and there are times I would (and sometimes did) end up in the hospital without it."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I agree, Xanax works well but in limited duration - Klonopin is better because it relaxes you for longer. Just mellows you out so you don't freak out- has changed my life and made it better. My doctor told me to let it dissolve on my tongue, since I have issues with burning tongue from a nerve injury. This has added benefits of helping me not panic about the pain, and other things I feel out of control of in my life. I take a small dose and feel that I can continue taking for awhile without negative side effects, though it can make you a little drowsy during the work day."""
Panic Disorder,8.0,"""I take 0.125 twice a day (yes, 0.125mg). I know that sounds like a low dose, but it works wonders for me.  I still have some days where I feel a bit anxious and panicky, but all in all those days are getting less and less.  I think if I went up a little on my dose it would probably cure it 100%, but I am currently also trying to learn some cognitive behavior methods, and with that you need to feel some of the anxiety to overcome it.  I really think it has given me my life back.  It does make me a little tired, but that side effect is even going away with continued use.  I am out driving, and doing things I never thought I could ever do again, and I am doing them all by myself.  Life saver!"""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I'm a chronic pain patient who has had three lumbar spinal fusions plus eight pedicle screws and plates. The anxiety started after almost 16 years of daily pain.

Before this my bedroom was causing anxiety attacks I was only sleeping on the couch.  I have been only sleeping in my room since the klonopin.  Klonopin has given me my life back because I am sleeping. The one night I tried to stop taking it was a rough night so I have not tried again.  I hope all of you out there find your. relief"""
Anxiety,10,"""I have a severe panic disorder as well as OCD and I have to say since being on Klonopin (for about 2 years now) I take it 2/2 x a day) it has helped me SO MUCH. I haven't tried the other ones that are listed on here so I'm not sure how good those are."""
Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,8.0,"""It works really well however you have to know that you are substituing one benzodiazepine for another. Please take your time with this medication.

Anxiety,10,"""Klonopin is the only anti anxiety medicine that works for me. I have tried Ativan and Xanax- they both do not take away the effects anxiety has on my body (tense muscles) and when they wear off, I feel way more anxious then when I take them.

Anxiety,8.0,"""I've suffered from  mild anxiety for about 15 years now, to the point that my self esteem was VERY low and getting depressed because of it. I was having social phobia as well. I'm 40 yrs old and I think my hormones was making my anxiety worse during my period. I finally got the nerve of going to a doctor for medicines. I thought I could beat this on my own but at this point I just couldn't. The Doctor prescribed Paxil and Clonazepam. I decided to try Clonazepam at 0.025 and I already feel like myself again. I'm going to wait now and not use Paxil. Will also try Yoga and exercise and vitamins and see if it helps as well. """
Anxiety,10,"""It works great, especially for sleep."""
Panic Disorder,9.0,"""I had used Xanax early on after my diagnosis of panic disorder.  It definitely worked, but was a rollercoaster ride.  Klonopin lasts much longer, and I need less of it to work.  I'm not worried about dependence since I use it as needed (PRN) and only 0.125 mg.  It definitely works great for me.  It is a bit constipating at times."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""I started Klonopin 1mg 4x a day for social anxiety. I used to find it hard and was nerve-wrecking to talk to people I didn't know personally. I went through a long depression period for a few years and stayed to myself and sometimes didn't leave the house for weeks at a time. Then two years ago I got these Klonopin and it's made me more relaxed to start conversations with people I don't even know. Started being more outgoing, so I would say it definitely works wonders.

Anxiety,10,"""I think that this medication is a life saver. It relieves anxiety and stops my panic attacks."""
Seizure Prevention,10,"""I was prescribed 2 mg Klonopin 4 x daily since October 09. It has worked wonders for controlling my anxiety and as a bonus I've had no seizures since being on the medication. I take Tegretol for seizures which helped cut down the frequency but not stopped. Since I combined taking the Klonopin with Tegretol I've been seizure free for 8 months. The longest period since 2002 and also am completely anxiety free. Thanks."""
Insomnia,10,"""My psychiatrist prescribed this for me less than a week ago because for way too long I was sleeping approximately 4 to 5 hours and was up obsessing for the rest of it, making me sad and tense and fretful and hopeless feeling -- not to mention tired -- each day. WHAT A DIFFERENCE ON THE FIRST TRY! Taking 1 mg at bedtime not only relaxes me enough to fall asleep, when I do wake up during the night I'm calm, smiling even, and can't wait to go back to sleep -- which I do easily.  Then the whole next day is just generally better.  I feel like I used to when I was younger and less ""hyped out"" in general.  And no kidding, this has only been 6 days.  Lucky me.  Klonopin where have you been all my life?"""
Anxiety,10,"""This drug worked miracles for me.  I'm in my mid-30s and never had anxiety problems until about a year ago. I finally went to a doctor about it.  He prescribed me Klonopin and Lexapro.  I was skeptical about what a drug would do since my anxiety was so extreme, but, after a couple days on Klonopin it wiped all of the anxiety away and I was back to normal.  I definitely recommend it."""
Panic Disorder,8.0,"""I was prescribed Klonopin for Post-Traumatic Stress due to being in Manhattan on 9/11.  I suffered in silence for years before finally going to a Doctor last year.  At first, I felt, ""Relaxed,"" using the drug, but after about six months, that feeling of relaxation began to disappear and my fear of a Terrorist attack worsened by the day.  So my Doctor increased the dosage to 1 MG, three times a day and my anxiety has disappeared again.  My only complaint about this medicine are the SEVERE sleeping side effects.  I generally don't feel fatigued until after taking the second dose for the day.  I tried spacing the second dose longer, but anxiety returned almost immediately.  Overall, a good drug though, with the exception of the excessive sleep."""
Insomnia,,"""I am taking it for two months and it helps me sleep. My dosage is 0.5. So far this is the best medication I took for insomnia."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have been taking Klonopin for 5-6 years now. I think it is a wonder drug and I couldn't function without it. I have (social) anxiety disorder with a history of panic attacks many years ago. I generally take 0.25mg one to four times a day (as needed) and 0.5mg before bed as it helps me sleep. I cut my scored 0.5mg pills in half. My doctor has prescribed 2mg/day but I rarely exceed 1.5mg total and probably only average 1-1.25mg. In all the time I've taken it, I've never had a desire to increase it because it simply ""works"" and makes me feel 100% normal with no side effects. I took Valium (diazepam) for many years but I always felt anxious as it was wearing off and before taking more. Klonopin doesn't have that effect on me probably because of the long half-life and the way I space it out. I fully expect to take it for the rest of my life."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""It helps me a lot."""
,10,"""Saved my life."""
Anxiety,10,"""Works really well for panic disorder for at night. I don't normally tolerate a lot of medicines!"""
Anxiety,10,"""I've taken Klonopin as needed for several years now.  It is the only thing that works when I feel a major anxiety issue coming on from progressing into a full blown debilitating attack.  However, it always helps with that, too.  

Like someone else said, it has a longer half life and you don't experience the drop off anxiety spike like some people do with Xanax.  Xanax actually made me feel more anxious when it wore off between doses.

I haven't had a problem with dependency as I only take it for a few weeks at a time every other year or so.  I'm careful to taper off over a couple weeks so I don't get rebound anxiety.

Night Terrors,9.0,"""I've been taking clonazepam for 18 months and it has changed my life around. I suffer from R.E.M behaviour disorder, night terrors, sleep paralysis and the ability to act on my dreams which has caused harm to partners. I take 7mg at night and so far I've had no problems.
 The only side effects so far have been dry mouth and slight unbalance occasionally, I'm a bit groggy in the morning for a little bit but that soon wears off."""
Anxiety,10,"""Klonopin is a wonderful drug for anxiety and panic attacks.  However, once you start it is very hard to come off of.  I stopped for 2 yrs and it took me 8 months to feel normal again.  But if you really need it, this in my opinion works wonderful for anxiety and panic attacks."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""This medicine really helped me! If you take them how it is prescribed then you'll be fine!  You don't crave them.  Once you start Clonazepam treatment you will begin to feel much better, obviously you will want to continue your treatment  with it until you can at least get your disorder under control!"""
Anxiety,10,"""Before I started taking clonazepam, my therapist and I worked for 2 years on CBT. It wasn%u2019t working. I was hesitant to take medication for fear that I would be dependent and eventually addicted to medication. After assurance from both my therapist and PCP that Klonopin was not as addictive as other anti anxiety medication. Clonazepam has allowed me to effectively used CBT and other coping mechanisms more effectively, so much so that I am able to use these methods and calm myself down without taking them. If I take one close to my bedtime it helps me fall asleep, however, I take one during the day. I do feel sleepy, but am able to function. I also do not find myself addicted to them. There are times when a 30 day prescription will last for more that 3 months."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I think this drug works.  Took the wafers after my boyfriend died and they helped me get through the day really well.  I don't feel like this is nearly as strong as Xanax or Ativan and I function perfectly normally when taking it.  I was prescribed 1 mg 3x/day and it was good, then was put on 0.5mg 3x and I don't notice it at all.  I take Effexor also which helps with anxiety.  Also, recovering heroin addict so this plus Suboxone helps a lot although doctor doesn't like to prescribe it because I have a history of serious addiction.  Be wary, this is one of those drugs like Xanax where you can take a lot and think you are okay but everyone else can see that you are ""off"". Don't mix with narcotics."""
Panic Disorder,,"""I've been on 2.5 mgs of Clonazepam for 13 years now and it still keeps my horrific non-stop panic attacks at bay without reaching a tolerance (as some SSRI pusher doctors like to scare you with).

I will be on this for the rest of my life."""
Night Terrors,9.0,"""I had a horrible time with night terrors.  I'm 30 years old, and it was embarrassing to say the least.  I get the odd night-mare, but NO night terrors! It also helps me to fall asleep faster.  I'm on 2 mg a day."""
Restless Legs Syndrome,3.0,"""I use klonopin for panic disorder and RLS.  It works amazingly for my panic, but it has actually worsened my RLS!  It does make me sleepy, but every time I'm about to doze off, the kicking and terrible feelings come back in my legs.  I can't stop moving them for at least an hour.  I'm glad it works for some people, but it doesn't work for me. I'm on 2 mg a day."""
Anxiety,10,"""I have been on Klonopin for years now to treat my severe anxiety.  Initially I tried other things like Xanax, Ativan, and Valium.  None of those compared to the relief I felt taking this.  The only downside is having to take more due to tolerance increasing, but it seems a very small price to pay to be able to function in the ""real world"". I recommend this to anyone who needs help managing their anxiety, well in conjunction with therapy."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""13 years ago I had my first panic attack and it lasted for almost 18 hours.  I thought I was losing my mind and literally was on the verge of taking a bottle full of Trazadone. I was referred to a psychiatrist after my PCP diagnosed me with anxiety disorder and prescribed Valium, which did nothing to alleviate the anxiety I was feeling. My psychiatrist first started me on Ativan (the generic form, Lorazapam) and I would fall asleep almost instantly.  I was sleeping most of the day with a 4 year old son and a new born daughter!  After I complained enough, I was switched to Klonopin (the generic form, Clonazepam) and it was a God send!  I let it dissolve under my tongue and in less than 15 minutes I'm free from anxiety and have a life!"""
Insomnia,10,"""I have been prescribed all types of sleeping aides and have found this to work the best.  I seem to have ""hangovers"" from most of the other meds, or they stop working.  I can take this at any time of the night and wake up feeling refreshed."""

I have tried other medications (Xanax, Ambien), and they work very well,
but the side effects are much more pronounced than Klonopin.
It has become my preferred sleep aid, largely due to its long half life and lack of extreme side effects.  It helps with daytime anxiety, which I am also prone to,
and that's a very big help.  
Oddly enough, unlike most any drug available, Klonopin is chewable because it has a very mild, almost sweet taste- so you can chew it up and absorb it under your tongue for faster relief.
As a prescription drug, I give Klonopin an A+,
because it does exactly what it's supposed to do, and it does nothing else."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""For me it has worked great. At first when I felt a panic attack coming on I took .5mg as soon as I felt it coming on and within 5-10 min I felt incredibly better. After about 3-4 months I was up to 1mg daily at most. It seemed to lose effectiveness after about 5 months so my Dr has tried other medications and weened me off the klonopin. After several months of trial and error (Guinea-pigging) I asked the Dr to put me back on the klonopin and it has since worked great again. Ive been back on it for about a month now. Hope it continues to work. I rated a 9/10 only because it lost effectiveness for awhile."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""Only drugs I find to be helpful from years of panic attacks were adivan and klonopin. I have been on many medications.

My doctor prescribed 1mg 3 X a day. I'm taking as directed and with prayer and faith, I'll not only get through this but the more important issue is going to Duke University Medical Center because my husband is at risk for a massive stroke unless they perform a surgical procedure that only a few doctors in the world can perform..two are at Duke.

Anxiety,10,"""Klonopin has made me the woman I was prior to menopause. I am so very grateful. I could no longer stand the sleepless nights, horrific night and day sweats, constipation, anger attacks, anxiety attacks and bouts of depression. A friend told me about Klonopin.

I am once again functioning daily, interacting with family and feeling normal/rested/happy each day."""
Panic Disorder,10,"""I suffered from panic attacks, anxiety and depression for years.  Since I started taking clonazepam, I haven't had a single attack! This drug has changed my life for the better.  I still have some anxiety and depression, but I'm taking something else for those.  My only wish is that I didn't wait so long to try the medication!"""
Anxiety,,"""This drug worked well for me, more so initially.  I usually get by with taking 1/2 mg per day at the most, often nothing.  I need to say that this medicine (or any others like it) only treats the symptoms of anxiety, not the problem itself.  If you want to get over anxiety, learn about it, and how to get over it (I admit that is easier with the help of medicines).  The best thing I have found to educate myself was to read, and re-read the book ""Hope and Help for Your Nerves"" by Claire Weeks.  If you can really understand and apply this advise, the enemy will disappear.  It follows closely with most of what any good therapist or Doctor will teach."""
Anxiety,8.0,"""This drug is pretty good. I like how 1 dose can last most of the day, but I was on 1mg klonopin after being on 2x2mg lorazepam a day and the klonopin doesn't seem as effective. I like it because it does not cause as much drowsiness as Xanax, but it does make me a lot more drowsy than lorazepam. You can take it once a day for simplicity, but like all benzodiazapines are addictive.

That is all I did was sleep on this drug for 2years until I had enough and told him no way. I want Xanax back. I have been back on Xanax for 12 years now with no problems.

Prior to taking this drug, I would get terrible anxiety for no apparent reason.  I was at the point where I was avoiding people and when I did get the courage to go out in a social setting, it was a constant fight to just feel comfortable.

The Clonazepam takes away the rough edges.  I'm now able to drive on the freeway and am even-keeled even in the most stressful situations.

I am prescribed 2mgs three times daily but only take 500mcgs as needed, unless I'm having a rush of panic attacks and need to take it preemptively for a few days, because I don't want to develop a low level tolerance.

Panic Disorder,10,"""When I was 15 I started getting anxious all the time it got to the point where I was getting 2-3 panic attacks a day. So I went to the doctor he tried everything with no success. Finally we decided to try Klonopin (Clonazepam). I started on 0.5mg three times a day for a week then he increased to 3mg/day.
It completely took away my anxiety and panic attacks with no side effects and if I take 2mg at night it helps me sleep. I've been on it for 2 years with no increase in dose and no loss in efficacy. I highly recommend it when everything else fails to work."""

Anxiety,8.0,"""Good medication when used at the right dosage. Stronger than Xanax dose for dose, but has to be discussed with the doctor."""
Night Terrors,10,"""I have found this to be the only drug that helps me sleep through the night without an episode.  It's been a year since my last doctors visit and I can count on one hand the number of night terrors I have had.  Only thing is that it doesn't make me as sleepy as it did but I've been on it for about 2 years so it's probably time to increase my dose.  Night Terrors are fairly uncommon and hard to treat, but I highly recommend Klonopin."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I have bipolar disorder and OCD.  I have been taking this drug for about 20 years.  It changed my life.  My anxiety level was so high I was not able to go anywhere.  For me, it is a miracle drug."""

Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,,"""I started on this medication for PLMD about 1 month ago.  I am now able to sleep almost through the night, which for me is highly unusual.  In that respect it is great.  I am, however, having some trouble feeling groggy during the day, with unclear thinking and some unsteady gait.  I typically wear heels daily with my work, but have had to go to flats.  The adjustment to the medication has been difficult; I feel sort of ""hung over"" during the day, even though I take only the one dose in the early evening to calm my legs to allow me to progress into a deep, restorative sleep.  I am going to continue because even though it isn't perfect, I could not go on without being able to have any Stage 3 or Stage 4 sleep due to PLMD."""
Panic Disorder,9.0,"""I've been suffering from depression for years. The last part of the 90's was okay, but starting in 2000 things went downhill fast. Two close friends moved overseas, the company I worked for layed off after 19 years. In January my father passed away, another friend was murdered by a stalker and to top it all off I had to my cat of 21 years down. I found myself not wanting to go outside, getting panicky, etc. My doctor tried a host of medicines but the only thing that worked was klonopin and Adderall. Thank God for these medicines."""
Anxiety,9.0,"""I have had moderate anxiety with agoraphobia for about 5 years. The peak of it came about just before my first day at work, My doctor placed me on 0.5mg/day when required.

Sometimes when I anticipate a major issue I take one to prepare myself and I'm fit to go nice and smooth. No anxiety, no anger, just calm, cool and collected. It's an excellent anxiety medication."""
Panic Disorder,8.0,"""I use clonezapam 0.5mg 3 to 4 times daily. It helps with both panic and anxiety. I can still feel the panic coming on but it helps combat it with deep breathing techniques.

Panic Disorder,10,"""Klonopin (Clonazepam) is incredible! It saved my life after I took Xanax (Alprazolam)! It was too short-acting. I take 4 - 1mg tablets a day for my Chronic MAJOR Panic Disorder. I also take 1 30mg Restoril (Temazepam) Capsule at bedtime. All of the benzodiazepines work well, but Clonazepam is the safest, most effective, and a real lifesaver! Antidepressants and Herbals did nothing. Clonazepam is ""Oldschool"", so it's tried and true! IT WORKS! Better than any other anti-anxiety drug! AMAZING!"""

I would recommend using this pill only when in panic or anxiety and also learning other coping strategies, such as regular exercise, meditation, self-talk, yoga, crafts & artwork or something fun & productive, or a relaxing bubble bath!!!"""
