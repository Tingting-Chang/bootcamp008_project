Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""I've only taken this for three days and already I feel so much calmer.  I have struggled with anxiety for a long time and am on many antidepressants.  What a relief!  I would recommend this to anyone with anxiety."""
Neuralgia,10,"""This is the best help I have had.  Before I started using Lyrica I had to go to the doctor for injections often. One day he asked whether anyone ever gave me anything for nerve pain.  He gave me Lyrica and I take 75mg twice a day and I have not been this pain free in years."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I have suffered from Fibromyalgia for years and have regular flare ups. The nerve pain in my jaw and neck was horrific. I found even oxynorm and Tramil was not able to control the pain. This drug has changed my life dramatically.... I feel almost normal again and able to cope with my symptoms. I am on the lowest dose of 25mg. 2 times per day and combined with 10mg. of Endep I can now get a good nights sleep and no nerve pain. I have been advised to stay on this dosage for at least 3 months and then cut down to one per day and eventually cease taking it. As I am very sensitive to drugs I was surprised that I have had no side effects. Thanks for giving my life back..... I don't know how I would have survived without it?"""
Neuralgia,10,"""I take 300mg Lyrica once per day b4 bedtime..along with 1000 mg aceteminophen (Panadol/Tylenol) 3 times daily for trigeminal neuralgia..it is a godsend..i love this regimen..works wonders for my severe facial pain..the side effects i will take gladly for my pain relief..side effects include unsteady gait which subsides once my body gets accustomed to the dosage n lowered libido which returns within a day or two of not taking this regimen..otherwise i love Lyrica."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I started using Lyrica six months after it was put on the market and I think it is a miracle drug for those of us who could not sleep or relax in any way due to severe neuropathy.  The only side effect I experienced was sleepiness which disappeared after about a week.  This is a wonderful, wonderful thing for diabetics with nerve pain.  Thank you to the makers!"""
Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,10,"""I have Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome and to those who actually have to feel the constant pain that we do, knows just how hard it makes our daily life. I have been on neurontin and amytriptiline and have had nerve blocks. I cry after I have a nerve block because I for a short time feel normal. These blocks are dangerous and I have had some complications.  My family physician prescribed Lyrica and I see a huge difference in my pain. I now have hope to live a normal life!"""
Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I used this for my last herniated disk issue.  I had a sequestered herniated L5 L4 issue and suffered from nerve pain down my left leg and drop foot.  Pain Medications (e.g. 10mg Percocet 3-4 times daily) did nothing for my leg pain though helped my back.
Lyrica at 150mg twice daily did the trick for my leg nerve pain. The sciatica makes your leg kill while you know nothings wrong with it, so with Lyrica I was amazed to have the leg pain just disappear. No side effects. Sciatica went away by itself after 3 months so no need for Lyrica anymore."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""All I can say is I love it. I am scared to take meds doctors give me but my anxiety is that bad I thought I can not go on like this I have to do something about it. I started of on 50 at night just to see how I would cope it chilled me out and when I woke I didn't feel heavy so that was good. Because when I take a pill on the night and next day get up heavy makes my anxiety mad.  But started on 50. Now am on 100s 3 times a day. Can talk to people can go for hair cut can sit in the same room as people look at there face when talking to me. With out almost passing out. If I was to say if you wanted to get anxiety under control these are well worth ago. Plus I also recommend propranolol beta blockers 40mg 4 times a day  They are great as well"""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""Suffering from complex pain syndrome and resultant fibromyalgia, and to find something that reduces the burning pain of my skin and along with other drugs to help with sleep has made me feel like ""myself"" for the first time in over 7 years.  I have shed many tears in pain and dejection, but not so many lately.  Thanks Lyrica."""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""I posted below. Been taking since Sept, I take 50ml x3 at night although presp says 3 a day. Sleep like a baby, no pain still, and wake refreshed. At first it might make u feel little drunk in am, just silly, nothing bad. Still working and a lifesaver! I needed to update on the free prescription, it's Pfizer website and goto patient presp program. Fill out info along w required things, mail it, in 2 weeks u get letter if accepted, then prsp comes by FedEx! U have to call close to running out each month so that Pfizer can fedex u your refill! Got mine paid for a year! Otherwise it's $400 for 90 pills. I get 50ml free from Pfizer a 90 day supply! Thank you Pfizer!"""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""This is my first ever review on this site, but felt it was necessary. I have Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis, and I am only 21 years old. I have been on Lyrica for about 2 months, best 2 months of my life. I have tried every medicine you could think of, minus pain killers. I am no longer constantly fatigued, anxiety, paranoia, pain levels drastically dropped, for the first time in my life I actually have thoughts racing through my brain, not one single panic attack, list goes on. I know a lot of people want to hear this, I have LOST weight like crazy, and have same sex drive. Try this before ANY antidepressant. Talking is sometimes harder for me, small price to pay though. I couldn't be happier with my life."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""Several years ago I was thrown from a car and hit by a car and have had problems ever since and had xrays and ""Congrates your back isn't broken"" but I don't know what it is. For 6 years, everyday I would have to lay in the tub and the shower hit my back or lay on a heating pad and even at night just to fall asleep I use sleep aids and constant showers or heating pads to get the muscles to stop hurting and spasms and then I couldn't take it anymore. The muscle relaxers wouldn't work and my back and neck were burning and stiff and spasms all day and night and I couldn't sleep and went desperately to a my new doctor that I was seeing and got his associate. He saw me and recognized the fibromyalgia and placed me on Lyrica. I'm a true 26 year old again."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I couldn't remember the last time I had a ""good"" day since diagnosed having Fibromyalgia until 2010, when I was first told about Lyrica by an emergency doctor. The symptoms & pain had got so bad that I drove myself to a Baylor emergency room. Physically and mentally I just felt defeated. I was so stressed out that I developed an ulcer and my potassium/magnesium levels were so low they admitted me several times for as long as a week on time. Bags of blood had to be given and IV fluids. Ugh..I was a hot mess. I don't recall the doctor that introduced me to Lyrica, cause I was in and out a few times, but all I can say is a BIG thank-you. I've been on Lyrica 300mg a day since 2010. I can get what I need done and function like a normal woman."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I was have burning pain to my feet, with sharp shooting pains from my toes.  Lyrica has completly stopped both kinds of pain.  It has also helped with the shart shooting pains in my fingers - arthritis related."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I have tried everything to help with my fibromyalgia pain.  I have tried Cymbalta and other anti-depressants as well as opiates like Tylenol with codeine and Vicodin. I have also tried muscle relaxants like Soma. All of these helped but I still had painful days. Lyrica gets rid of the pain. I have been on it for 2 months and it is a miracle drug. I have my life back and can be productive. Also controls painful flares. Haven't had a flare yet. Lyrica is great."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""This medicine works miracles when I need it."""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""10 out of 10 ,Lyrics """
Fibromyalgia,10,"""Lyrica really helps but the cost is almost getting to be too much. """
Neuralgia,10,"""Besides reducing the nerve pain from bulging discs, it also noticeably reduced the constant, annoying ringing in my ears."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""I have taken tranquilizers for years to help with the anxiety I get from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. They have only helped moderately and made me drowsy (not good for driving). My doctor suggested that I try Lyrica. It helped me in ways that I couldn't even hope for. It let me be able to say that I don't have ANY anxiety. That is HUGE!"""
Neuralgia,10,"""I have suffered extreme damage to my trigeminal nerve on the left side of my face due to dental implants. I since had three teeth pulled and one implant taken out. My life was full of unbearable pain and suffering. After 17 doctors/dentists, I finally went to an neurologist who put me on Lyrica. After fighting with my insurance company for two weeks I  was approved.  Within one week I have minimal pain! It is a miracle for me. I take 25mg three times a day. Love it! Thank you!"""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""Lyrica Pregabalin has changed my life, not a cure, I still have bad days but most of the time I am back to my old self again!"""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""I've been on this medication for 6 months! After spending years with chronic anxiety and severe depression leading to several hospital admissions and long periods of time of not wanting to go out or do anything. Over my near on 20 years of suffering and it really has impacted on my life and those I love. After years of being a long term sufferer I know there are triggers but I've never been able to control the symptoms that over took me even though I've tried to fight it and fight hard. I'm pleased to say that pregablin has really helped me, not with depression but definitely with anxiety! I had a bad experience which left me unable to breathe stand for 3 days until I went to hospital I was prescribed these meds and I was functioning again!"""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""Lyrica is my miracle drug!!! I'm suffering from clinical depression with GAD since 8 years. I tried dozens of drugs (SSRIs, SNRIs, Trizyclides, Agomelatonin, Stablon, moclobemid, methylphenidat, Ketamine infusions, every aminoacid, every vitamin, daily sport, had more than 20 ECT treatments...).
My doc gave me Lyrica. I took 50mg in the evening and the next morning I was a new human. Felt like myself again, was able to participate in life. Thank you God! Thank you science!"""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""I have suffered from panic disorder and GAD for well over 10 years, starting in my early 20s. I finally sought treatment 3 years ago, but nothing helped. CBT, 40mg Citalopram, nothing.

I then discovered pregabalin on this website. It was a struggle to get it prescribed on the NHS in the UK, but I'm so glad I persevered. This medicine is nothing short of a miracle. Within 24 hours I was a new person. I've only been taking it a week, but now I feel light and happy, and the anxiety has just faded away. I don't need alcohol any more. In fact, the thought of drinking now makes me feel ill. 

If you have GAD - please try this. I'm only on 75mg twice a day as well."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia about 18 years ago. I stopped working a few years after due to the pain. I tried many medications so I could have some quality of life with my husband and 2 children. I spent most of my time in bed or on the couch because the pain was so debilitating. I was taking Ultram and Zanex but these just didn't take away the pain and then my doctor started me on Lyrica. I started feeling like a new person because slowly the pain started to decrease. The only side effect which could also be part of Fibromyalgia is with speech. I have trouble sometimes finding the words I want to say. I now take 75 mg 3 times per day and have been taking it for over 10 years. I'm so grateful to have my life back."""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""Hello! I have severe Neuropathic pain from spinal injuries. I had a spinal block that worked for a while, but it didn't take care of all the pain. My life was pretty limited as to what I could do, which was pretty much sitting in a chair at the computer or watching tv. My love for the outdoors was pretty much squashed since it requires bending over, which I can't do, due to the rods and screws in my back. I have only taken this medicine for two days, and I have already have noticed a huge difference. I am actually able to move around more. I also have osteoarthritis, and my joints were hurting. Not anymore. This stuff is amazing. The only drawback is the cost. I have to take it three times a day, and it's really expensive."""
Pain,10,"""For the past 3 years I have been dealing with nerve pain left from shingles in my neck. I have tried EVERYTHING for this pain including injections and narcotics. Nothing really helped unless I was a zombie. I am allergic to a lot of medications including Tegretol and Neurontin. So when my neurologist suggested I try this medication I was VERY skeptical. I have been on this medicaton for a week now. I started on 25mg twice a day and felt some relief. I thought it was in my head. Now I am on 50mg twice a day and I can't believe the difference. I am relieved I can finally get my life back. I am a mother of 2. I did not realize how much the pain had taken over my life until now."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""Day 2 and feeling really calm... feel quite dizzy but can cope with that also take 10mg escitalopram which I felt increased my anxiety but these tabs I think even it out... may not even need esc anymore with these tabs can't believe I've never been given before after years of suffering"""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""This works within 30 mins. After the first pill my legs stopped burning and tingling one of the only medicines I ever found that worked so fast."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""I'm 20 year's old & was addicted to cannabis (2-3g daily) for roughly 5 years unknowingly medicating GAD.. which eventually resulted in More anxiety leading to cross addiction into alcohol, (lot's of) mephedrone, cocaine and more.. yet again this resulted in even more anxiety & treatment centres.. after countless lapses I sought help from my local GP, they prescribed me 600mg of Pregabalin daily & I can honestly say this drug is better than any illegal or legal drug available in treating anxiety in any form. This drug is not side-effect free - but compared to the others out there (Including anti-depressants) it's Definitely the best option. After the initial euphoria wains it stabilizes however, so don't give up after the first effects go."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I found this to be very effective in treating the after effects of double fusion of cervical vertebrae.  Then I found I was having less difficulty with fibromyalgia.  I was on 3 a day and only side effect was weight gain."""
Pain,10,"""I have a pinched sciatic nerve in my lower back due to a compression fracture, and also severe nerve damage in my left arm. After being on different narcotics that didn't work, I gave up and just lived with the aching in my arm that never stopped. My Doctor put me on Lyrica, and I swear, I started crying because I had NO pain in my arm for the first time since my accident: 5 years. Lyrica has been a God send for me. It helps both my back and my arm. When my Doctor increases the dose, the side effects go away after 2 weeks. I recommend this medicine to anybody with nerve damage."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""Have been rock bottom down by the river, then re-started Pregabalin. IT IS AMAZING. It only took about 24 hours to notice the difference, and wow. A week later and I am nearly 100%. I knew I was anxious not depressed! It should be prescribed as a first-line choice. Previously on it for 3 yrs. I am a 59yr old housewife."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I call it a miracle drug like most others who have shared their comments. I have been taking it now for 7 months, currently 450mg a day (for treatment of fibromyalgia). I gained about 20 pounds within 2 months which I desperately needed to do. Overall, I have a better life now thanks to Lyrica. Nothing that I have been prescribed in the last 14 years has even came close to treating my condition."""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""I've read many opinions on this site most being negative towards this amazing medication. I have suffered from a trapped nerve near my waistband ( hip) and nothing I took or did could stop the pain / burning / tingling numbness from my hip to my knee cap. I declined surgery to remove the nerve and was placed finally on lyrica. I hesitated for 2 months before finally giving in to the medication because of all the negative reviews you read online.First two days i was on lyrica I had a small headache and dry mouth that is about it. after a week the dry mouth went away and I was left virtually pain free within 2 weeks. DON'T read into everything and hesitate to take thismedication.I have not gained a single pound and im pain free. im on 3 x 50mg"""
Pain,10,"""Ii have no more pain. It helps so much. I would tell everyone to use it."""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""I was having terrible pain with sciatica.  At times I was in so much pain just walking in a shopping centre I just had to stop.   Also driving the car my leg was in so much pain I had to lift it up with my hand to ease the pain.  No medication I had taken stopped the pain which was unbearable and I couldn't sleep at night, My Doctor prescribed Lyrica and at first I did not like it because it made my feet puffy however I went back on it with the prescribed dose of 150mg twice a day.  Now I have to try to recall the pain because I have no sciatic pain at all with this drug.   It also had the side effect of making me a bit ""dreamy"" which I rather like but I do forget names and things I am saying which I do not like.  Can't have it all though!"""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""I was experiencing nerve pain from hernia and knee operations, being a single parent and running a business a while back had me run off my feet and feeling nerve pain running up the bottom of my feet and through my knee joints into the groin, Lyrica has so far taken most of that pain away.
What I didn't realise was it also helps with anxiety and depression, after 3 weeks I noticed a calmness I thought I could never achieve, did some googling on the benefits of Lyrica last night and was amazed at everyone's experience on Lyrica.
This is great stuff, would recommend it highly, thank you Lyrica, back to fun time with the kids again."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I love this medication!!! With out lyrica i would not be able to walk.Nerve damage from diabetes has taken its toll on my nerves in my feet and legs.
My new insurance company is denying my coverage for lyrica.But my drs are trying to keep   me on lyrica because i have been i it for so long.Shame on insurance companies who r just trying to save a buck!!! Not fair"""
Pain,10,"""I have a bad lumbar disc L5-S1 in my low back which needs to be removed. I'm taking Lycria because it helps keep the pain from going down my leg. Lyrica works great. If it wasn't for Lyrica I wouldn't be walking."""
,10,"""I am a 39 year old male and sustained a fall back in October shattering both heels and ankles and have been diagnosed with RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy)and my pain management doctor prescribed Lyrica 300mg twice a day for the burning and pain. I have had 4 epidurals and 1 nerve block and have found that the lyrica works best for me and it works well with the other medicines I take on a daily basis. I have been taking for almost a year now and I have not had any side effects!"""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""Amazing. Stable on 450mg for a few months. Brought back colour into my life."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""This medicine works fast and hard for anxiety. It will stop anxiety dead in it's tracks. I highly recommend Lyrica for anxiety. The only side effect has been some sleepiness, but I'll take it considering the anxiety relief being provided by Lyrica."""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""This medicine does seem to help quite a bit with nerve pain. I do tend to have a easily over sensitive nervous system.  Lyrica makes me feel a lot better at night time so I can sleep. I take MS-Contin in the day and Lyrica at night.  My life would be a lot less stable without Lyrica. I believe the best way I can describe what it does is slow down the pain signals so they are not as noticeable. """
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""Man, 47 years old. Been struggling with depression my whole life. Tried all the antidepressants in the market. The one that seems to relieve my black cloud to a certain point was Lexapro. Started taking Lyrica 150 once a day, a couple of years ago, because some research I did on my own. Even though it's side effects (weight gain) it is fair to say that this is my godsend drug. In the mean time I am having a reversal of fortune (so to speak) and taking Pregabalin is really helping me to cope with life. Side note: All SSRI antidepressants made more harm than good, cause I felt like I do not care for anything and just want to lie I'm the couch and watch TV or see the clouds just passing by. Hope this drug helps you."""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""I have had neuropathic spine pain  since 1984. I have triple S curve; had 6 spine surgeries, and have implanted pain relief system for low back pain. Nothing worked, opioids almost led to death.  2 months ago begam Lyrica (100mg, 3x/day). At beginning: brain felt ""foggy""; walking unstable; total urinary incontinence (some bowel incontinence). To say I was shocked at how the Lyrica relieved my spine pain is an undersatement! I read all the horror stories, but decided to give it time. This is the first time since the early eighties I have had NO pain! The side effects are gone."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""I have suffered with severe anxiety and depression for years. I tried 6 different antidepressants as well as benzodiazepines and all did nothing for me of any help. Eventually I was put on Pregabalin by a Psychiatrist and it was very helpful almost from day one. We increased my dose until I take the maximum of 300mg twice a day. At this dose my anxiety has been pretty much eliminated, I am happy and now an active person. However a word of warning to anybody taking this medicine for a long time: DO NOT allow yourself to suddenly withdraw from it. I recently had to go a week without it and it was a living hell for me. Withdrawal symptoms for me were as follows: severe anxiety and depression, suicidal ideation, inability to sleep, nausea and vomiting"""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""It helps with my seizures as well as my fibromyalgia so I've always been really happy with my Lyrica. I've been on it for years now."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I started with the trial way back in 05/06 and what a difference it made in my life. I lived with that muscle pain for 45 years and tried numerous medications with no lasting relief. When I seen the ad for the trial with  a Dr  I had nothing to lose but 9 different kinds of drugs and their side affects. Although I was at the top of the dosage after 18 months I was pain free for the first time in over ten years with no side affects. Even though we have added low dosage pain medications back in over the years, mainly during the winter, I'm still at a tolerable level with Lyrica. I have recommended this medication to people with explainable nerve pain many times."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""My Anxiety had crippled me to a state which my life could no longer function. The first few days on Lyrica I noted a sense of euphoria and confusion but by the 4th day I found myself able to think about  trigger points for my anxiety and was almost in awe of how it didn't raise its head. It seemed like anxiety had left my body, to the point where I had to look in a mirror and say ""why did you care about all that so much?"" Almost in disbelief of my previous behaviour, not being able to connect with those feelings or attitudes became freeing. lyrica gave me my life back it seems. Importantly, I'm still me. Friends and family all commented how much better I am without losing personality which i believe is one of the best qualities of the drug."""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""If you are debating on whether to take this, please don't hesitate. I was in car accident Dec 2012 and have whiplash/cervical strain. Injured my neck and shoulder. I was in pain for the past 9 months and no doctor would prescribe me narcotics due to Ohio law. I was miserable, crying, irritable and nothing I took (IB, Tylenol) wouldn't touch the pain. I got a prescription for Gabapentin, which I am allergic to BAD side effects. Finally the doc gave me Lyrica, within 15 min of taking pain GONE. I feel like I'm back to normal again (like the day before accident). Lyrica is a miracle although pricey. There is a program you can get through Lyrica website to qualify for free prescription. Try it."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""Pregabalin is great. Got it for damaged nerve pain but was blown away by its other effects. Suffered from depression and anxiety for all my life. I am 41 within 3 days of taking this medicine it lifted all those years of misery away. It was like it melted away layers and layers of dark misery. Honestly pregabalin at a dose of 200mg 3 times a day is great."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""I was given Lyrica for Anxiety due to Alcohol Withdrals, not only did it work great on the anxiety but it ceased my cravings, now I am living the sober life."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""My psychiatrist put me on 200 mg capsules 3 x a day (600 mg daily) and it's effective for treating anxiety. I've been on lorazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam and all 3 became ineffective after 6 months to 1 year and were extremely difficult to get off of. I don't notice any tolerance issues with pregabalin either. I've been on the same dose for about 2 years. Better than any of the benzodiazepines and other medications I've tried for anxiety. Only side effects I've noticed are calmness, sedation, and increased appetite but exercise and healthy eating take care of any weight gain."""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""I suffered severe sciatica for two years before my doctor prescribed Lyrica. After a few days of building up in my system, the medication completely killed all of the pain, numbness, and tingling in my right leg. It was so effective, I thought I was suddenly cured! I stopped taking the Lyrica and the symptoms returned after a couple of days. I have now been taking Lyrica for two years and swear it is the best solution available for my bulging disk problem."""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""I am 36 years old and had a lot of chemotherapy.  Now I have extremely bad electrical pain in my feet mostly at night but during the day too. Was taking gabapentin but I got really sick not sure if it was because of that but my doctor took me off it and put me on Lyrica 50 mg 2xday but I only take one at night because it makes me dizzy. The one at night works great. The pain before was so bad that I was starting to not be able to drive but now I am fine."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""Great medicine that gives a benzodiazepine effect for anxiety, but without the bad side effects such as memory loss or addiction. You cam't stop taking pregabalin cold turkey however because there are some withdrawal effects such as increased anxiety, insomnia, and depression in my experience."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I was on Lyrica 50- 75 mg 2- 3x/ day for fibromyalgia for over a year. Incidentally I didn't have any migraines while on it. I stopped Lyrica 7 months ago and have had migraines monthly since!"""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""I have a lot of nerve damage, pinched nerves, sciatic nerve damage, restless leg syndrome from head to toe, and nothing worked for these. The nerve damage got so bad, I spoke to my doctor about it and he prescribed Lyrica which took care of all the nerve damage. At first probably the first 2 months only side effect I had was a little swelling of my hands. Lyrica was a wonder miracle for me.  The doctor had me on it for over 3 years with no problems, then my insurance refuses to pay for it now, because a 30 day supply is $900.00. They wanted to give me Neurontin, which I am allergic too. Now all the nerve pain is back and worse. I want the Lyrica back and would recommend it to any one."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""An amazing experience, I feel I came out of prison. I am a new man. """
Pain,10,"""I have suffered severe pain for 20 years following a  motorcycle accident. During this time I have tried every sort of pain relief available to me, mainly narcotic drugs which I found as bad as the pain itself. Earlier this year I was prescribed Lyrica as far as pain relief goes...fantastic. After a few months (1x 75mg cap per day) I experienced total confusion and was unable to perform my daily tasks at work or at home. I was becoming agitated and experienced suicidal thoughts. Things returned to normal after a week or so of not taking Lyrica. Because it worked so well I am tempted to give it another go. It was just so good to not feel the pain anymore."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I have been taking Lyrica for the last three years and I don't know how I would live without it. In 2012, I was involved in a serious accident, sustaining an incomplete spinal cord injury, as well as severe injuries to my lower limbs. The pain is not as bad as it was in the beginning, but I am in constant pain and, according to my pain management and spinal and lower limb reconstruction consultants, this will probably always be the case. Initially I thought if I found the right combination of medications I could stop it and so I tried all of the other drugs prescribed for neuropathy, as well as some more experimental ones. Without Lyric I spent a lot of time crying and ended up in hospital a few times because the pain was so bad."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""I take another medication for my anxiety but after consultation with my psychiatrist I use Pregbalin for panic attacks. When I feel an attack coming I  take  75mg  then and again at bedtime. I don't, of course have panic attacks all the time so I'm not using them regularly.I took it a few years ago for anxiety for about 3 months and can't speak highly enough of its properties. It got me out of a hole and I'd sooner be fat than depressed. There are ways of losing weight!"""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""Hi,

I was prescribed Pregabalin about 8 years ago and have been taking it ever since. I suffer quite badly from anxiety and agitation and I can't tell you just how much this medication has helped. Even if I could just about get through the daytime without it, when I am asleep and my mind can follow any path it wishes to, it chooses to go down really bad avenues and I wake up feeling absolutely dreadful and this reached a terrible climax 8 years ago and resulted in me not eating at all and therefore losing a frightening amount of weight. However on my last pharmacy visit, I was a generic version of the drug which has not worked at all and so I am hoping my GP will put me back on Lyrica. If not, I am very fearful for the future."""
Neuropathic Pain,10,"""I've tried other things for pain. Already take a strong pain medicine, which is getting harder and harder to get, because in my State, one must go to a pain clinic to get it. Pain clinics are horrors. Lyrica seems to work with the amount of pain medicine that I take and seems to have even reduced the ""break through"" pain. No unpleasant symptoms yet."""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I was diagnosed with fobromyalgia in 1997, but wasn't prescribed lyrica until 2007. What a difference. Until lyrica I was in bed and couldn't do anything!!I was vomiting every day and had to be hospitalized several times and had lost several pounds. Now I'm back to work full time which i'd never thought i'd be able to do again. Doing more than simple tasks is a joy, and being able to play with my grand kids is more enjoyable than I can say. I do have to say I have to take pain medicines and muscle relaxers and had a pain pump placed inside my stomach, but with everything I'm almost back to normal. The only negative is the weight gain, but i'll take that. My husband said I needed it anyway. But I can't tell you how happy I am with the lyrica."""

Lyrica won't work the thing this doctors doesn't understand is that the Lyrica is treating only the peripheral neuropathy the diabetic part mean nothing except that the peripheral neuropathy is being cause by the diabetes.

(It really helps me to take 20mg of Flexeril at bedtime too but build a tolerance first). The combination sets me up for a pain-free day. When starting Lyrica, it does cause a feeling of imbalance, weight gain, and water retention but after about a week or two the side effects go away. I am so grateful for Lyrica. It has improved my quality of life exponentially and I don't feel all doped up as the narcotics make me feel. THANK GOD FOR LYRICA!"""

 and many illegal substances with zero help. I'm on 150mg twice a day and it has literally made me a new human, I feel like when I was teenager, before the depression and anxiety started to ruin my life.

Side effects ? a little sleepy, but nothing too severe.

I was nervous because I had used Neurontin in the past with bad side effects and thought Lyrica would be the same. I was wrong. Lyrica does make me sleepy but I take 75 mg at night about 2 hours before bed. My Doctor started me out on the lowest dosage and it has worked miracles for me. I have less pain and my muscles don't seem to spasm or twitch as much, I am able to increase my activity levels which helps with the stiff muscles. It also has helped to calm the nerves in my foot that were irritated in an unrelated injury. This medicine has been a miracle for me."""

My narcotic usage is lowered along with lower muscle relaxants.  At this point, I wouldn't do without my Lyrica."""

I got my very first dose of Lyrica (just a tiny 25mg) and after it kicked in (4 hours) I've been feeling myself, like I didn't since I was a boy! Layers of heavy bricks lifted away from my chest, and I finally feel like any human is supposed to feel. Today is undoubtedly the happiest day of my last 5 years.

Within just a couple days I was running errands without needing to have someone with me due to anxiety, I was doing chores which I without a second thought often delayed and I was enjoying my life and time with my children. I was prescribed pregablin for Fibromyalgia pain and I can't say I've noticed a difference with pain but its done EVERYTHING for my anxiety! I am way less irritable and moody and feel like I can actually enjoy living a happy and complete life for once without worry, fear or nervousness. I went from being a procrastinating home body to a normal feeling, confident person! My side effects have been blurred vision, sometimes a little sleepy and dizziness. Its 100% worth trying!!"""

So the next time I was at the doctors I asked him about taking Lyrica and he thought that it was a good idea.  It took awhile but each day that went by more of my pain left me, and now I am pain free from Fibromyalgia.  My side effects was gaining weight and that was about it.  Any day I would gain 20-30 lbs. to get rid of that terrible pain.  Thank you Lyrica."""

Fully expecting surgery I returned to Thailand and doctor suggested Neurontin.  Although I got some relief, the side effects were intolerable.  He then put me on Lyrica.  It stopped the pain within 24 hours.  He said it would take a few days.  I was on it about 45 days and then weaned myself off.  I think anyone with spinal stenosis should ask your doctor about this.

I started taking Lyrica when diagnosed, and within just a day or two I felt incredible! I didn't hurt when I woke up in the morning.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""Hello all 
A short story,I had chemical poisoning while working 25 years ago, which caused multiple health conditions causing  Brian Damage and Central and Peripheral nervous system disorders,
The main Problem is debilitating anxiety not caused by the thought process but by Physical damage as the above.
Ultimately after being on most horrific psychotic drugs i found Valium and mirtazapine ( currently on Valium 35mg and mirtazipine 45mg) which calm me down. 
Anyway i was recently prescribed Pregabalin at 150mg per day running along with the above drugs,
I cannot stress how much this has changed my life for the better although still in the early days for the first time in 25 years I am a different person,calmer kinder and finally in control."""

I stopped taking the Lyrica and asked my GP for 50mg.  I have been taking 50 mg morning an evening for about three weeks and I have never felt better.  Took about a week to really feel a difference.   I cannot remember a time when I felt so good.  Well I can but I had to give up sugar, carbs,  alchohol, practice meditation and exercise....

Fibromyalgia,10,"""I have been on Lyrica for 5 years and it has changed my life so much. I had pain all over and could not figure out why. I went through so many test and procedures to help and nothing did. I found a Dr. who put me on Lyrica 50mg three times a day and after a couple of days being dizzy I realized that my pain was almost gone. I am now taking 150mg three times a day and I have my life back. I have gained weight because food taste great now. Make sure you never run out though. It happened to me on vacation and I was so sick from withdrawal. It is the worst feeling in the world, all the pain was back and I felt like I had the worst flu ever. As soon as I got home and got my refill I was fine. Great medicine, but they do need to tell you more about withdrawal. I love Lyrica."""

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10,"""Pregabalin for me was miraculous. On the first dose (75mg three times a day) my anxiety was reversed. I really thought this was too good to be true. I have tried Prozac and lorazepam at different times of my life. But as is commonly known, after the fourth or fifth trial of SSRIs, they ""peter out"" and actually become counter productive, even in some cases causing serotonin syndrome. But about two years ago, I was in a very stressful marriage break-up and was taking benzodiazepines to keep the lid on the anxiety, with little effect. The GP respected my wish to try Lyrica. I was and still am, after two years, astounded by this transformation. I feel like I always felt I should feel. A cessation of anxiety and a sense of well being pervades. """

It worked wonders and first few weeks I felt great - for the first time I could speak in front of a group, I had strength to do daily chores and my anxiety pains disappeared. However, after some time I grew tolerant to it and my pains and anxiety started coming back slowly, so my dose got upped to 150mg twice a day.

Saw Orthopedist, Pain Specialist, and received the impression, that they thought I was a nut, or trying to get pain meds.
Finally went to a neurologist, who diagnosed TPS and Shingles nerve pain interacting. Within 24 hours of starting Lyrica the pain lessened, upping the dose a few weeks later and the pain was zilch.

Pain,9.0,"""I am 36, have a bad case of herniated disc that hits me in the back. Lyrica has helped a lot with pain and overcoming my hernia's crisis twice, at 150-300 mg daily. This is not an example of chronic use, although I might be such one case in the future if the problem persists. 

In lower doses it seems to take more time (days) to take effect, in higher doses the side-effects are more pronounced. 

My side-effects were: slight sedation, euphoria, strange body coordination, all in all: the psychoactivity. One can have an accident on these, so caution should be exercised and doctors instructions followed strictly. Using cars or other potential dangerous machines should probably be avoided too.

I also managed to severely rupture a few discs in my neck while stretching of all things. Was misdiagnosed by the surgeon who only fixed one of the ruptures with a fusion of C7. Off course this still left me with pain and numbness from my neck down both arms. About a month or so ago I switched to a spine and pain management doctor and he put me on the Lyrica (75mg 3x daily) and a Duragesic patch. These two drugs have worked wonders for my pain and Quality of life.

Fibromyalgia,9.0,"""I will start off by saying it did cause weight gain. My clothes fit the same but the number on the scale went up about 7-10 pounds depending on the day. I cannot say this is solely because the drug- I think I can safely say that this is because my pain has improved so drastically that I have appetite again. I can keep the weight off if I really want to, but I am not overweight and I am content with my appetite finally being back after years of struggles that I don't think it's a problem. Regardless, I have been on lyrica for almost a year now. It has drastically improved my nerve pain, joint stiffness and swelling (along with a gallon of water a day), appetite, energy, and sleep. I am not pain free but no fibromyalgia patient truly ever is pain free but my pain has gone from an average of 8-9 down to a 4-5 on my good days. My flare ups are far less frequent and I only experience them once every two or so months which is a huge improvement over every other week. The length of the flare ups is also shortened from 3-5 days down to 2 days maximum. At the beginning of taking the medicine I was slightly drowsy but nothing dangerous. I only take it once a day and I am trying to keep it that way to avoid moving up to 2 doses a day. Lyrica is my miracle drug and has definitely given me my life back. My biggest complaint is the cost and insurance but it could be worse. It costs me $2 a day to feel normal again."""

When I spoke to my GP about this, he made the connection between Lyrica and my general malaise, noting that it is also used for anxiety, which I did not have. After that, we worked to wean the dosage down and I stopped taking it after a few weeks.

I got my Rx for Lyrica renewed and when it came I first took 2 caps in order to see if it would get started again.  It did!  I'm going to be doing a bit of research on the internet for a lower cost alternative.  Gabapentin looks good at the moment, maybe on my next doc appt. I'll try it.

Pros-My pain is almost all gone, happy mood, and can move free with barely any pain. And I feel like I'm on cloud nine and can't wait to go to sleep. Overall, the Lyrica has really helped me a lot. I have tried the generic gabapentin and Savella. They do not work!  I'm so happy that I found this website, for all the people whom have aches and pains as well as I. Thank you."""

Coupled with some CBT therapy I find this medication highly effective. The only thing to be wary of is on higher doses (I'm on 75mg) they can have a drunk feeling effect and so I asked my Dr to prescribe me with a lower dosage for daytime (incase of driving or working etc) so I take 25mg in the day and the 75mg at night and find this works for me."""

Pain,9.0,"""The first time I used Lyrica I experienced an amazingly profound reaction; layers of depression and anxiety that had built up over several years melted away within minutes.  That was years ago and I have since both weaned myself off the drug and restarted taking it again.  One thing I rarely see mentioned is the terrifyingly bad withdrawal effect- missing more than one dose for me throws me into the absolute darkest pits of despair.  Has anyone else experienced this?  When I went off the drug the first time I felt like I had performed a miracle; so strong was the feeling that it took a long time for me to convince myself that things were bad enough to warrant going back on.  It still helps, but nothing as miraculous as the first time."""

After 11 operations I was depressed and very very sore. both in the abdomen and of course the spine .
I drank and drank . It seemed like the only thing that would ameliorate the pain.

I am very active in trying to keep the fibromyalgia pain as controlled as possible and just not been able to get to a plateau of any type. After a rough adjustment period of about 5 wks I noticed a drastic change in fibro pain. I have gained a significant amount of weight but over the last three months have been able to maintain. Now I am able to start losing the weight but have to be very careful to not take in complex carbohydrates or sugars in afternoon or evening. I have gone to an almost vegetarian style diet and have noticed that the weight just starts to come off with ease but slowly.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,"""i suffered from severe panic disorder which resulted in me being hospitalised multiple times from chest pain. I went on to have s complete mental breakdown, suffered crippling anxiety and had to give up my home and move back to my parents. At its peak, I couldn't leave my bed - I was shaking with fear, panic, worry. I spent hours reading reviews looking for hope. I was under the care of a psychiatrist who prescribed antidepressants (Mirtazapine - helped me sleep, Escitalopram - helped anxiety a little at 20mg) I was offered Xanax which helped enormously but I was worried about addiction. We then tried pregabalin - amazing! You will feel out of it for a few days which is uncomfortable. Stick with it and ramp up. 450mg-600mg is needed."""

The condition has caused a wasting of the muscles in my legs, which has led to problems with walking and balance. It is a progressive condition which I'm led to believe will one day cause similar symptoms in my hands and arms.

There are some side effects in the beginning such as a little bit of a wobbly/buzzed feeling bit it subsides after a few days. The only two qualms I have with the drug are the price (about 12 bucks a pill without insurance) and I build a tolerance to it very quickly."""

I experimented on-and-off to determine whether Lyrica was indeed the reason for this change in energy and mood. Indeed, nights that I took Lyrica (75mg) I was completely refreshed and motivated the next day.

Could be other drugs mingling with pregabalin aswel but I don't mind, I prefer being emotionally blunt. A good mate of mine died the other day and my emotions would'nt even trigger much, my grandad died 3 days ago I feel a bit upset but I should be is disarray because he was close to me.

I have also noticed that it helps tremendously with my anxiety. I was taking Xanax 1mg 3x a day and now I only take it once a day if that.

I started out taking Lyrica 50mg twice a day along with 20mg Busiprone twice a day.

As for my wrist pain, we've bumped up the mg to 175 per day and it's only been two days, I'm very groggy in the morning. I didn't get that on the 75mg, but I am confident it will subside.

It doesn't kill the anxiety in its tracks like benzos do, but it makes the anxiety MANAGEABLE.  I have been on pregabalin for two years now and started @ 100mg 2x a day.

I am very sensitive to medications and the side effects from anti-depressants cause more depression than relief. So, to try another drug was scary for me. I saw a Rheumatologist, and he dx my Arthritis called DISH in my spine. He recommended Lyrica. I finally saw my PCP MD and said let's try this drug.

I begged my doctor for an anti-anxiety medication as I was really desperate. I was afraid of taking a new medicine too, but took it anyway. I can honestly say it is incredible. My sometimes near constant anxiety state went down to near nothing. After about 3 months I needed to go up to 150mg twice daily. After about another 2 1/2 months some anxiety and sleep problems have crept back and I think that I may need another increase. My only problem with this frankly amazing medicine is its tendency to wear off after a few months. I experienced few side effects (dizziness, fatigue, loss of appetite).

I take 300MG of Lyrica spread over 4 doses per day and the Cymbalta, and 120MG of OxyContin and up to 40MG Oxycodone for breakthrough pain. In severe cases, a second anti-depressant may be needed in addition to The Cymbalta to help fight the depression that comes with chronic pain.
The big down side to both of these name brand medicines is the cost. A months supply of Lyrica with no insurance is over $330 and the Cymbalta will set you back just over $300 each month. Even with insurance these both will end up on the top tier (My co-pay is $50.00 each) and neither of them has a generic equivalent."""

Lyrica has been the miracle drug for me and I have been taking it for about 3 years. It takes time for any drug to work properly and I couldn't function with out it. 150mg a day is my dosage.

While an active AA member over these years I've found that I still suffered from extreme shyness and anxiety around others.  Doctor gave me some samples of Lyrica for Restless Leg Syndrome and I found that it made me quite sociable, talkative and able to let go some of my inhibitions, but without the sloppiness and horrible side effects as something like alcohol.  I've tried Benzos and found they just made me feel dulled out and depressed.  Lyrica, used periodically (a few times a month) never fails to brighten my mood and make me feel a bit closer to people.  On the downside it also makes me feel closer to food. It's very helpful for me."""

I also still feel the depression (mainly lack of motivation and concentration problems (not ADD).

I went off the Lyrica for awhile but have since gone back on it. I feel it helps me while I'm on it to stay on it as regular as possible.

No weight gain."""

I tried every sort of pain medication available with absolutely no relief. My Dr. prescribed Lyrica for me a few days ago and about 4 hours after the first dose I noticed a change in my level of pain. Had massive side effects though such as vertigo, dizziness, light headed, blurred vision, etc. I did have a fever though from an unrelated condition so I'm not sure whether it is related to the Lyrica. I have continued taking this medication with the hope that the side effects ease and the pain remains minimal. I'm worried about weight gain that others are talking about.

I sleep a lot and very heavy and usually can't remember the previous day. I definitely cannot function after I take it.

I fear that I will have to change to something else if it continues to make my feet swell, because it is extremely uncomfortable. Another side effect is the feeling of being drunk.

Pain,7.0,"""For severe chronic insomnia, Pregabalin does increase sleep for sure and I have regained many hours, even if it wasn't on the exact clock I planned. Combined with a good sleep-initiating medicine (i.e. trazodone), pregabalin is an even better lifesaver than alone. Next, pregabalin works quite well for benzodiazepine withdrawals. Lastly, it does work well for depression and anxiety. The downside is that it will dull cognition greatly and can also greatly increase depression at certain doses. For me, the best dose for sleep isn't great for those reasons however lowering the dosage (after a break) has provided better results. Takes experimenting with dosages."""

I was put on Pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder and seasonal affective disorder by my Doctor. At first I was put on a very low dose of 75mg, which did next to nothing. I immediately requested to have the dose increased until finally I reached a dose that was effective enough for me (600mg). For a while the medicine did its job and I actually felt like my anxiety had been reversed. I suffer bad social anxiety, and 300mg of this made me quite extroverted and confident. I would say it was 'pro social' for sure. Alas tolerance set in and now even 800mg doesn't do much of anything apart from prevent withdrawals."""

I woke up a few hours after taking it and I felt out of it. It's now about 9am and I still feel a little out of it. I wish I could take half but they are capsules. I work as an RN and there's no way I could take this pill and work. Maybe these side effects will go away after a few doses, but I'm not sure if I will even take it again."""
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,,"""I have just read all your reviews about Lyrica Pregabalin , I have had a life time of anxiety and pain tried everything over the years , and yesterday was prescribed pregabalin not taken one yet but after reading your reviews i am going to have one now so here goes ! will be back to let you know what i think . i hate taking pills !!!!!!!"""
Fibromyalgia,,"""This medication left me unable to think coherently and I had difficulty talking. It was like being around a drunk. I had to stop it after a month because I work in a school and was unable to converse adequately with parents/students/staff. """
Fibromyalgia,,"""My husband passed away over a year ago. Everyone told me it was depression, why I hurt all over and was tired. I knew different, I insisted on testing and finally was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Lyrica has given me new life. My children and friends are amazed at the difference it has made. I take 200mg twice daily. It has increased my appetite, but I am more active since I started the Lyrica."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,,"""I was put on 50mg of Lyrica at age 62.  Within a week there was noticeable improvement in the amount of burning and tingling in my feet and legs. Within a month the burning and tingling disappeared. At 3 months I had gained 15 pounds at a rate of 5 pounds per month. Most importantly I began to notice I did not care if I lived or died. I stopped taking the drug. I have also experience this with antidepressants. For 6 months after stopping Lyrica I remained relatively free of pain. By 8 months the burning and tingling have returned at their full intensity. I rate the drug a 5, great for pain with serious side effects."""
Fibromyalgia,,"""I was having a lot of problems on 150mg a day probably due to my age (73).  I stopped and restarted on 25mg 3 times a day and it made quite a difference. I have had fibromyalgia for over 15 years but was only diagnosed 2 years ago.  I tried neurontin and it just made me sick.  Thank God for Lyrica.  My insurance company keeps trying to get me to take Neurontin again but I won't as long as I can help it."""
Fibromyalgia,,"""Kiss your sex life goodbye."""
