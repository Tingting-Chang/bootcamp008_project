Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I was afraid to take this medication I went online and looked it up and read so many bad things about it hair loss memory loss etc ... I am so glad I went ahead and gave it a try for myself I think it's a miracle drug ! It's helped stabilize my mood, taken away my migraines and even helped me lose a few pounds !!! I haven't had any negative side effects at all from it ! I know it's effects everyone differently and for me personally it's been great I love it!"""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""After 7 years of debilitating migraines almost daily and rebound headaches from taking Excedrin and ibuprofen, I finally found a doctor that was willing to help me. She suggested Topamax and just in this short period of a couple months, there's been a significant difference. Not only am I rarely having pain, I feel less anxious and more balanced out emotionally as well. Even friends and co-workers can see the difference in my mood! As for side effects, I experienced the tingling in my hands, feet and face but my Dr. mentioned taking a Multi vitamin each day, which has seemed to help. Also been drinking LOTS of water, to counteract the major dry mouth. Overall, Topamax has been more of an effective, positive experience for me than anything."""
Trigeminal Neuralgia,10,"""I have taken it for 1 and 1/2 years for migraine. Also, after developing chronic lower back pain from degenerative discs it has really helped me cope with the pain."""
Obesity,10,"""I am 56 years old and weighed 249 pounds. Finally decided to deal with this weight issue once and for all. My knees prevented me from working out and my weight caused my knee issue. I sat down with my primary care physician and she ultimately suggested the use of topamax. In July 2015 i started with 25 milligrams and evolved to 125 miligrams. It is now December 8 and I weigh 221 pounds. Here is how I would describe the experience. It stops the need to impulse eat, so you don't feel deprived, so...your not crying when the scale isn't moving quickly. Its not quick, because I am post menopausal...but
its not painful. Appetite is down, I can now walk 45 minutes...and for the first time in my life..I know I will reach a goal weight."""
Seizure Prevention,10,"""I have had extremely positive effects from this drug, but I do have to take Prozac with it as it causes mood swings or depression with me."""
Seizures,10,"""I went to a new doctor and mentioned to her that I had a binge eating problem in addition to having PCOS(also causes weight gain) and recently being diagnosed diabetic. She put me on Trokendi XR and told me it would help with the binge eating and OMG has it! Not only has it changed the taste of foods, where before foods I would normally eat all of in one sitting, I now only eat a literal serving size of and don't physically want anymore, and most times don't even want to eat unless I'm physically hungry. I HIGHLY recommend trying this instead of surgery or letting them put you in a hospital if you an overeating problem. Surgery should be a LAST resort! Good luck to all! <3"""
Seizure Prevention,10,"""This medication has really helped my seizures plus my migraines. It is really convenient because I have both problems and I don't have to take two medications for both problems. Topamax is great."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I take this as a mood stabalizer it has really helped level out my moods"""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""have been researching and researching for so many years and I have to say that Topamax saved my life.  I am currently 23 years old,  and I started having these migraines when I was 15. I didn't know that this would be a lifelong thing that would eventually lead me to be on daily medication. The frequency that I would get them,would be more than six times a month. Anyway, I went on propannalol? (Beta blocker), NO SUCESS. & then doctors prescribed me topamax. I didn't have any side effects. At all. No tingling. Nothing. And GUESS WHAT, I didn't have a migraine for 3 years!!!! NOT ONE. but I got off of it, thinking they were ""gone"" & now I'm suffering with new hormonal migraines. Going back on topamax & hoping for same results!!!!"""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I would get headaches all the time to the point I was not a functioning human being. I'm 26 and the past few years they gotten more frequent more painful and more uncontrollable. My doctor recommended topiramate and after a few trials of different mg it's a game changer. I honestly never get headaches anymore and had not a single side effect from this medication (which I was concerned about). It really does help and gave me a feeling of normalcy back in my life."""
Obesity,10,"""I was just diagnosed with epilepsy about 2 weeks ago and I am now taking 50 mg of topamax 2 times a day and I have to say this is the best thing ever!  I don't know how much I have lost because I did not know what I was when I started and I need to get a new set of scales.  I was around 240 lbs so I needed.  I noticed right away that my diet Dr pepper tasted flat and just thought that I had a bad batch till the next case tasted worse.  I also noticed that food tasted ""off"" too,  now my appetite is down and I took a deeper look at the info on topamax and know this is the drug I have been needing the last 10 years!"""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""Love this medicine, no headaches."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""After several concussions, i was left with months of daily, debilitating headaches that were ruining my quality of life. My neurologist prescribed me this medication for post concussive syndrome- 50 mgs a day and it has been a miracle drug! This medicine has given me my life back. I am much more mobile, less irritable, and overall happier. I've been on the medicine for about a month though, and have seen a slight return of symptoms. I used to live off of over the counter pain killers, but this medicine has really helped to repair the damage to my brain after tbi. Was warned it would effect memory, but haven't noticed that as a side effect."""
Seizure Prevention,10,"""Great   and Keppra too"""
Obesity,10,"""Update I started Topamax a week ago tomorrow 50mg at night and I have lost 5 lbs I'm 5'3"" and started at 157lbs I am at the Dr.s now stepped on the scale and I'm at 152 so I couldn't be happier...I have very minimal side effects taking them at night helps with those I sleep very well and I have had some tingling fingers but nothing unbearable...all in all I am very happy with the 5 lbs  lost in 6 days looking forward to more weight loss in one more week I do increase my dosage to 100 mg so we shall see about those side effects...but if things keep going the way then I might stay on them for a while"""
Trigeminal Neuralgia,10,"""It took me a year to be diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia - and I had to go to a doctor in Vienna for this, because the doctors in Romania misdiagnosed me - but Topamax is the medicine that really saved my life. Literally! Because I was contemplating suicide, the pain was that bad and nothing else was working for me. I have lost a little weight in the first couple of months and I also have some trouble finding common words while speaking, but otherwise I did not experience any other side effects so far. My cholesterol level is now increasing - I am wondering if anyone is experiencing that as a possible side effect."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I have suffered from severe migraines since I was 15 and the older I got the more severe they got I have been on numerous medications over the years but 5 years ago I found a neurologist that gave me Topamax and my life has changed completely 50g in the morning and 50g at night and I don't get any anymore I had a few at the start but haven't had a headache now for a few years thank God for Topamax"""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I was on Corgard for 7 years and it did not control my migraines. I get complex migraines with neuro symptoms... numbness on one side of face/arm/hand... .feels like a stroke, but isn't.... have had CTs etc. Anyway, was switched to Topomax at 25 mg in March and increased to 50mg in May... no migraines except for one episode of a few days of the 'aura' but did not go into the full blown scary feeling migraine. My side effects have been significant  weight loss and some word find issues, but I would not trade them for feeling like I am having a stroke. I don't know the long term effect of taking Topamax though.... will have to ask my neurologist. I have changed to a new one recently. Am so thankful so far for Topamax."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I suffer bi-lateral migraines and have been on Topamax for several years off and on now. I have mixed reviews.  I LOVE Topamax, because nothing else works for me. In fact I was given Maxalt and Propranolol together and wound up in the hospital almost dead. You can NOT take those two together. All medicines have side effects, so does Topamax. I liked the weight loss in the beginning, but be careful with it. I lost 80 lbs and couldn't stop. I forgot to eat. Topamax makes me just not hungry. I have it fixed now and watch out for it, but it was very scary. The memory loss has been a problem at times, but has been funny too. I have not experienced the HOT they spoke of...I FREEZE ALL THE TIME!"""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""After so many years of trying I finally start to function as a ( almost) normal human being. Topamax is my lifesaver."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I've been taking Topamax for about a year now. I started at 25 mg twice a day and I currently take 100 mg twice a day.  IT IS WONDERFUL. I have had only 2-3 migraines since my Dr upped my dosage 3 months ago. I still get ""regular"" headaches 4-5 times a day but I can handle those. I was gearing 5--6 migraines a week before Topamax. The side effects are all there but I don't care as long as the migraine pain stays away."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""Topamax has significantly reduced my migraines from 1 a month to 1 every 18 months.  I have also found that it helps you - to not over eat or drink alcohol.  I am very happy being on Topamax for all these reasons.  I initially did have tingly feet, a small price to pay, but rarely get that sympton now.  I am on 50 mg a day."""
Obesity,10,"""I was prescribed Topmax for migraines but I have had weight loss being on it. I take 50mg twice a day. I had the same problem with the pop it tasted flat (Still have). I had (have) the tingling in certain body parts and the tired feeling at first. I started taking them July 2015 and by January 2016 I have lost 40lbs. I was 190 and am now 147 and going down every day! The only thing that I have changed is I drink water. I eat whatever I want some days I eat more some days less. I used to go through a 12 pack of Mt Dew a day. It was hard at first but I honestly don't mind now. Because when I look in that mirror every morning its worth drinking that bottle of water."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I have suffered with migraines from the age of 13. I used to get them as often as once a week lasting anywhere from three to five days. I have tried so many other medications to attempt to prevent my monster migraines but nothing worked. Been to chiropractors and tried massage therapy.  Countless visits to the ER and walk in clinics for injections of Demerol and Phenergan. Then I began seeing this new neurologist and he started me on Trokendi XR. I have been on it for 3 months and only experienced just one migraine which was my fault, I ate too much chocolate during the holidays, other than that Finally relief! For me Trokendi XR has been an answered prayer. Have not noticed any major side effects yet I take it at night, a little drowsiness."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""Put simply, this stuff saved my life. I've been on nine meds to treat my suicidality associated with my ultra-ultra rapid cycling bipolar ii. the AAPS gave me tremors, seroquel made me a zombie, lithium made me suicidal, lamictal and saphris aggrivated my bulimia. My doc didn't want to use antidepressants for fear of driving me into mania. We thought we were out of options. I stumbled on topamax while looking at an NIH research study. I suggested it to my doc. he said, why the hell not? In three days my suicidality was gone, and I barely cycle at all any more. THIS IS A MIRACLE DRUG."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""helps me to sleep and a lot less head akes"""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I fell four feet backwards off of a straight truck and whacked the back if my head off of a concrete parking lot and gave my self a concussion. Long story short, I have had a rough go at the post concussion symptoms and the migraine/cluster like headaches have played a MAJOR role. Theres days where I just lay around in the dark and do nothing. The pounding just takes over and that's all that matters. You are not even you anymore. I was prescribed Topamax on Nov.18th and started one week on 25mg. Nothing changed. Then two weeks on 50mg, again nothing changed. This is my third week on 100mg and I am FINALLY migraine free. The side effects do wear off after time. You just have to give this medicine time. Worth it."""
Obesity,10,"""Excellent!  My doctor has combined this with Phentermine and I average a healthy 1.75 lbs of weight loss per week without excercise (due to pulled hamstrings).  I do not take the Phentermine full dose, nor do I take it every day.  My doctor follows me closely and I pay close attention to how I feel and go by instinct.  My overall health and well being is more important than losing weight.  I am very cautious and choose the right foods e.g., protiens, green veggies, lots of water, fruits and fiber.  I am sure to get proper rest to stay mentally sound.  Losing weight is good for me, but is taxing on my body and I am going to do what I have to in order to develop healthy long term habits (which take at least 30 days to develop)."""
Trigeminal Neuralgia,10,"""Works well with combine with medical Marijuana. I take them at night 2 in the morning. It let's me be able to sleeps at night. I wasn't able to lay down after a fail MVD operations. Since I started the Brand name topomax it help me a great deal."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I am 19 year old active kid that exercises 4-6 times a week and suddenly after years of working out some migraines began in the gym that didn't go away for 3 months. All day everyday, constant migraines. I had to stop working out, got fat and lost all my gains. I started 25 mg topamax at the same time with chiropractic care  (found in neck x-ray abnormal lordotic curve) and started treatment every week. A week later of both of these combined, the migraines are finally gone! but my head still throbs except with no pain.. I am just happy I can finally exercise again, and stop hating life. (Got CT Scan and MRI of head before X-ray of neck, was clear {checked neck because it got stiffer a month into migraines} ) NO SIDE EFFECTS! :-)"""
Obesity,10,"""I was prescribed topiramate for daily post-concussive headaches, and I also needed to lose weight.  The first three weeks were really rough, and I was unsure if I could take this medicine long-term.  I started off with 25mg the first week, 50mg the second, 75mg the third, then 100mg as my permanent dose.  I took it before bedtime as instructed, but I had next day drowsiness so bad that for three weeks I felt like I was going to face plant at any moment.  Also, the nausea was so bad that I barely ate.  Thankfully, both of these side effects stopped after about 3 weeks as did most of my headaches.  I've also lost 22 lbs in 2 months.  The best part is that it has given me control back in that I eat smart and don't have unhealthy cravings."""
Obesity,10,"""Before Topamax I used to suffer from chronic migraines I mean 3-4 migraines a week. Been on Topamax for nearly 3 weeks, day one 25mg instant appetite suppressant loss 18.7lbs in 2wks! Inches everywhere, food taste good just eat very little of i.t I'm never ever hungry but I enjoy cooking! I have energy, not bogged down with lots of medicines anymore and not one full migraine! I'm excited to lose weight it's actually very easy to eat healthy. Its all you crave and I was a sweet addict. No ugly side effects as described, not on this dosage. So I hope this has helped someone."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""This pretty much saved my life. I've been on EVERYTHING (or so it seems) for major depressive disorder and when I was about 32 something wasn't adding up and I was diagnosed BP2. I tried Lamictal and I couldn't handle the headaches. The other BP medications all seem to cause weight gain so I'd stop taking them. I got a new doctor who said if I tried lithium she would give me a little Topiramate to help offset the hunger the lithium caused. Well, the topiramate seemed to help the BP2. So I've slowly worked up to 150/day topiramate along with wellbutrin and Lexapro. It's a GODSEND. 
Side effects: when titrating up at any point, tingly fingers or feet for a week but then goes away. Take at night because can make you sleepy. Hope FDA approves!"""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I've read many of the poor reviews, and wonder how many refer to the generic version of Topamax. I can't use the generic version - it simply doesn't work for me, and I do recall more side effects. However, the brand name drug has been a lifesaver for me. I suffered with chronic daily migraine for over a decade before being placed on Topamax, and NO other drug helped. I was on beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, every medication for seizure disorders, and talk about side effects! They were horrific! I could barely function at work, missed lots of time, and essentially had no life. Topamax has made a major difference. I now have many fewer migraines, rarely contend with chronic daily migraine, and I've experienced no major side effects"""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""This is a fantastic medication.  The day I was prescribed it and started taking it was nothing short of a miracle.  I had never heard of anything like it before.  I had been on and off trials of anti-depressants like Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Zypreza, etc for years and none of them did anything for me.  This was an entirely different class of medication and the new psychopharmacologist I had told me so before he gave it to me.  When it kicked in after several weeks I literally felt it one day while riding the bus.  I was trying to have one of those negative, anxiety-ridden feelings and a flush just came over me that downgraded that sensation.  The only drawback is that this medication completely stopped working for me after one and a half years."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I've suffered from chronic headaches/ migraines all my life and now being that I have finished  high school and moved to university the headaches would cause me to loose focus in university work. When my grades started to decrease I knew I had to do something about it. The doctors prescribed me Topamax (Topiramate). I've been taking this medication for about a year and I absolutely love it! Now I only get headaches once or twice a week, instead of every day. This medication helped turn dark, painful days to luminous ones!"""
Obesity,10,"""I been on this for med approximately half a month. I actually suffer from Bipolar and Depression also PTSD. Recently after I retired from fighting mixed martial arts and had knee surgery I was more depressed I gained weight. I am a big guy anyway. Normal for me is 6 ft 6 260 lbs. I got up to 340 and was like ok this is enough.

I started my vegan diet I did back when I fought mma went to the doctor I was down 10 lbs. I needed new med so she put me on the topomax. From day 1 zero appetite none whatsoever. Like I have to make an effort to eat.
When I do eat it is just cut up raw veggies in a bowl of vinegar that is it for the  day. Now I am on top of my supplements so my body has what it needs. I'm shredding lbs like mad"""
Obesity,10,"""Ok so I am going on my third week of topamax I have seizures uncontrollably migraines and obesity so let me begin with saying this I have noticed a significant change in my body as far as the weight loss goes 6pds since I have been on it and still loosing however I have lost my appetite I have no desire to eat I may eat one time a day that's the only downside I have noticed a change in carbonated drinks they don't taste the same anymore I am currently coming off tegortol which was only treating my seizures and I was gaining so much weight so I'm thankful that topamax is working for me and i only have to take one pill a day to treat all my ailments"""
Obesity,10,"""I have struggled for years with what I thought was just a problem with controlling my hunger, I would never eat around anyone and then once everyone was asleep I was starved. I finally seen a psychiatrist for my ADD symptoms and while he was modifying my medication he diagnosed me with binge eating disorder. To my surprise he was right. I had no control. I had always bounced on diets. He started me on Topamax 25mg and I knew instantly it will work. It has a calming affect. I feel so full and I am going to bed without eating for the first time in years. I am very thankful. Not every medication is for everyone.  I am pleased with this one so far."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I got migraines nearly everyday for around 6 months, I tried lots of different drugs, monitoring blood sugars and cutting out certain foods. One day I was prescribed this to take twice a day. I read lots of reviews about side effects the only ones i got were tingly hands/feet and for diarrhea. But I could cope with that and have not had a Migraine ever since best thing I was prescribed and would recommend."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I have been off and on Topamax for about 5 years now and I must say that it works better for bipolar mood stabilization than any other one out there. The one thing I love the most about this medicine is that it is helping me lose weight. They need to put in the time to verify that this drug is in fact a mood stabilizer because it certainly does help with bipolar disorder."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I did not even know how bad my headache was for years and the ringing in my ears, I've started Topomax recently and I never realized how much pain I was in until the headache and the ringing was finally totally gone, I drink lots of water and less caffeine to prevent kidney stones. I have never had one but that was the only side effect that I'm worried about. I feel like a new person."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I too had migraine headaches since a teenager. I would leave work vomiting and have to stay in bed, pillow over the head for 3 days (monthly). Back then, nurses couldn't ask for medication for headaches we would be considered 'seekers'. Phenergan was a God send then. When Imitrex came out I thought I found the Holy Grail. Topamax has beat it. NO Headaches, I have my life back. Thank You Pharmacologists, Researchers, Chemical Engineers...
BETTER LIVING THROUGH CHEMISTRY!!"""
Obesity,10,"""I am on day 4 now and I am pretty spacey.  I feel like I have smoked weed honestly. However, I started at 277 and I am at 272 this morning. I am taking 50 mg twice a day. So I think what I will do since I have to work is cut them in have and do half in the morning half at lunch half at dinner and half at bed time so its not so crazy. Lol. It does cause slight memory loss and a little tingly feeling but its not unbearable. I have noticed I do not want any sweets. I crave fruit. And veggies. Or nothing. I had 36 cookies on my desk Friday and didn't eat one of them... This is very worth it. And the side effects do wear off after a while. Thats how I know its time to take another half. I will update later. Yay I extremely happy!!"""
Obesity,10,"""Lost 50 pounds"""
Fibromyalgia,10,"""I was put on Topamax 2 months ago after a serious car accident that left me in a flare up of my fibromyalgia. I have not reacted well to medications in the past and have had serious reactions which lead to serious consequences to the other meds I was on. Topamax has been the only medication that I have been able to tolerate well. It does take a while for it to start working though and I have had a few side effects but none that I'm not willing to put up with and 2 of them have gone away since I have started the Topamax."""
Obesity,10,"""Was given this due to daily headaches. I'm not one to take pills so I started slow. One morning and one at night. Stayed like that for two weeks. I started exercising around that time also but only about 3times weekly and dieting pretty well but lost quite a bit of my appetite. I weighed myself and after two weeks I'm down 15 pounds. I ate allot of yogurt and drank allot of coffee and water. That's all. I can't believe it was from this pill. I'm More motivated then I ever was! Starting weight was 189. Now I'm down to 174"""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""Great and also losing the weight from the previous medicines I was on. Love it."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I have used Topamax off and on for the past 5 years. Off (due to pregnancies.) I am once again on and love the drug. Although the side effects are something to get used to, tingling in the hands, etc., those can be corrected with the correct dosage. The best side effect is the weight loss which certainly helps. My migraines have completely gone away. I have been a migraine sufferer since I was 5 years old (some 27 years). Topamax is a wonder drug!!"""
Obesity,10,"""I've been taking 25mg daily for the past 5 days and already lost 3.8kg or 8.3lbs. It's also been acting as a great mood stabiliser which is awesome because I have bipolar and Seroquel alone wasn't doing enough. Very happy with Topamax so far."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I was on Lithium Carbonate for 15 years and  never felt like a ""normal"" human being. I felt like a zombie. When I was told by a new psychiatrist to pick out a new medicine for my bipolar illness, I chose Topamax even though it is an off-label treatment for bipolar disorder, it seemed to have the least amount of side affects and I feel WHOLE again. I have been on Topamax for 15 years (I think) and the only adverse effect I have is decreased sweating in hot weather."""
Obesity,10,"""Day 6 14 pounds lost. !! I haven't put exercise in yet. I take 25 mg 2x a day ."""
Seizure Prevention,10,"""I found this drug to be very effective to control my seizures. Before taking Topirimate, my seizures were uncontrollable. I would get 3-5 seizures per week. Not including the amount of injuries I sustained- fortunately, nothing serious, just bumps on the head and sprained ankles from falling over. But I've been so lucky. 

I've also lost weight. Amazing. I've wanted to lose weight for a while now. I've lost about 2 stone. But unfortunately the appetite suppressant within the Topiramate has ceased. It doesn't last very long. My appetite has come back :-( 

But the seizures have been greatly reduced. Which is the main thing, which I'm very happy about."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I weighed 268 pounds when I started out on Topamax about 12 years ago. I was put on them due to Cluster Migraines A/K/A Suicide Headaches. The level of pain I suffered daily was unbearable. Topamax was fabulous. In small doses, which have been increased to 200mg, 2Xdaily, they (along with other meds) saved my life.

My weightloss?? Hold your hats, people! I've lost a person!! I weigh exactly 120lbs, am 5'8"" & very active when I can be. I've lost 148lbs total. MORE THAN ENOUGH! So, how do I stop losing? THAT is the question."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""Following on from previous comment, I forgot to mention this medication is working wonders for my alcohol dependency. I used to drink an entire bottle of wine a night, now I have one or two very small glasses! It's incredible for someone with a long documented history of alcohol abuse. Marvellous stuff!"""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I delt with migraines for so many years that I can not even remember. Due to the cost of Topamax at one point I quit taking it. I am back on it now. It is a life saver for me. I have had some of the side effects, weight loss, tingling finger, cold feet, taste change, etc. but they are all worth it not to have the life stopping migraines anymore. Once the dosage is regulated it is wonderful. I have probably had 2 migraines in the past year and neither have been untolerable."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""Began taking Topamax in 2006. Before starting on Topamax migraines were lasting 4-5 days after onset; and frequency of approximately 3 times per month. I experienced some diarrhea which subsided after breaking dosage up throughout the day (200mg daily). Additionally, I have experienced weight loss (a significant amount 50lbs) I could not afford to lose. However, the weight loss has subsided as well. Upon beginning the medication I had trouble with recalling words and memory loss. At this juncture the side effects have since passed and so have the migraines. I experience 1-2 migraines quarterly. Topamax has been a life-saver for me. I had tried many other migraine preventatives to no avail."""
Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I have been taking it for mood and it works wonders! Mood is stable with only one side affect."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,10,"""I was diagnosed with trauma induced neuropathy in my left heel following an injury that became infected, developed cellulitis and an ulcer. It took 2 months of intensive treatment for my foot to heal but about 3 weeks after I returned to work, I started experiencing sharp, electrical type pain in my heel. It was excruciating. My doctor prescribed Neurontin at first but I was not able to tolerate it. I was switched to Topamax and within a day, I had full relief and since then, I have been pain free. Yes, I am a juvenile diabetic but I had never had problems with my feet until this happened. The neuropathy is confined to my left heel only. Topamax is the best. The side effects are minimal but even if they weren't, it's worth it to be pain free."""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I've had migraines since kindergarten. They have become increasingly debilitating in adulthood and sometimes I would average 15 headaches per month! My life revolved around my migraines. I tried everything to stop them. When my doctor talked to me about Topomax, I was thrilled. It took me two years to get to a dosage that managed the headaches and auras but now the only time I get a migraine, it's weather related. I use Relpax to relieve it.  Topomax has been a God send for me!"""
Migraine Prevention,10,"""I have been migraine free for 6 months (previously I had 3-4 migraines per month).  I also lost 25lbs and look great."""

Obesity,10,"""I have taken topiramate since June 23, 2015 for weight lose and to help with my type 2 diabetes, I have now lost 25 lbs as of Oct 15 I have also joined Weight Watchers in August because I found that the pills alone were not a miracle pill they do help with not having the carb cravings but you do need to eat well to lose weight. I currently take 50mg in the morning and 50mg at dinner time and do not see any side affects.  At first I did have the tingling in the hands and feet but after a few weeks that went away. I plan on staying on it and staying with the weight watchers and hopefully making my goal weight for the first time I am 50 years old and have been overweight since age 20"""

Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I'm ultra-ultra rapid cycling bipolar II and bul. been thru 6 mood stabilizers / APs / AAPs. My experience on those was disastrous.Lithium made me more suicidal, lamictal made me binge, destroyed my memory, didn't help my mood, seroquel put 20 #s on me and made me a zombie, didn't help my mood, latuda and abilify made me shake. I was terrified of weight gain on depakote/valproate/risperdal. I was at my wit's end, suicidal, and terrified that I wasn't going to live to my 33rd birthday, then I found NIH considers Topamax to be a mood stabilizer so I asked my pdoc about it. Within a week at 50 mgs I had a full day where I didn't cycle at all. I woke up feeling okay and stayed that way all day. I didn't cycle at all. Things are looking good!"""

I have been taking Topamax for five months and love it.  The only side effects have been a change in my taste buds and the tingling sensation.  My doctor wanted to increase the dosage.  However, after reading about the drug, I think the severities of the side effects are directly related to the dosages.  My dosage is 25 mg twice daily and sometimes I only take it one a day.  For those who are still suffering, I am sorry.  Don’t give up hope.  Something has to work and until then try the pain medication."""

I was shocked I had gotten back down to numbers I haven't seen since I was a teen. 119-123. I'm 5'2"" so to me that's perfect. Food is never on my mind unless my stomach starts growling. I forget to eat. This drug is great for people who have problems with weight. I don't get any other side effects. It doesn't make me a zombie. I take 50mg near bed time.

I initially went up to the recommended 100 mg, but I hated the ""loss of words"" feeling I had, and found that I had about 1-2 migraines a month. So I decided to go back to 75 mg and see what happened. I had less loss of words and finger tingling, and yet my amount of migraines stayed at 1-2/month. This has been a lifesaver for me.

My neurologist and I discussed Topamax and figured it was worth a shot since my chronic, daily migraines were uncontrollable and I was getting Imitrex injections almost every week and could no longer take Toradol. Unlike other people, I have very few side effects. I weaned off Topamax once to try Gabapentin but it by itself wasn't enough and my migraines returned full force. Very few side effects: trouble finding words, thirst, and weight lose (not that I mind). Topamax is a wonderful drug and a LIFESAVER. It and my Gabapentin together is my divine combo!"""

I would talk funny, not be able to walk, tingly feeling in my extremities, and soda started tasting DISGUSTING! By the end of two months most of the side effects had gone. A few things to mention though; you WILL be thirsty all the time; my suggestion is to carry a bottle of water with you at ALL times. You will NOT sweat; make sure you keep cool. And I lost 76lbs in 6 mo! Looking better than ever, and kept it off for 6 years now! Good luck to you all, stick to it and it will work for you."""

Over the years I've gained and lost up to 70lbs but never held a steady weight. I saw a psychiatrist 6 years ago (for other reasons) and shared this with him.  He told me about Topamax and explained that it did not work in everyone, but had with some of his patients with true food disorders.  He started me at 5mg/day  and increased the dosage by 5mg/ week.

Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I couldn't tolerate apiprazole (Abilify) as a secondary mood stabilizer in addition to the lamotrigine, so I titrated up to 50mg. It helped. A LOT. It stopped the ultradian mood cycling that occurred when they upped my lamotrigine up to 200mg, and it stopped the self-harming urge. It did, in combination with other things, cause kidney stones, but alone did not. It helped quite a bit in stabilizing moods, and I'm just upping to 100mg/night. It did a lot for me, and I'm glad my psych put me on it. I don't want to come off. No weight gain. Even some weight loss. I wasn't expecting it, but I am certainly not sad about it.

The thing was my body was starting to get use to the medication so they did have to up the dosage to help my migraines; I'm now on 100mg a night.

Because of my insomnia, my doc switched me to Qudexy, which is topiramate in a time release capsule. When I was taking regular Topiramate I did lose weight, approx 60lbs in 2 yrs & then the weight loss stopped. I went from 200 lbs-140 lbs. & I very happy with that.

I kept remembering her words and am glad I did.  started slowly, with 25 mg in the morning, working up to 25 mg twice a day, then 50 mg at night with 25 in the morning, then up to 50 mg twice a day by the end of the month.

I was reluctant to start this medicine, as I've read about all the terrible side effects. For ME, the side effects have been minimal. The biggest side effect I have experienced is fatigue, but it is nothing I can't manage. From time to time, I feel a pins and needles sensation in my feet/toes, but it's nothing more than annoying.

Obesity,10,"""I was prescribed Topamax many years ago... before they even offered a generic version and before they could legally prescribe it for obesity!

I was over 200lbs and in a size 18 pants, within 6 months I was in a size 8 pants! By the time a year rolled around, I was 103lbs and in a 00!!! No exercise! This is a wonder drug. I felt great!

I had the typical side effects of tingling, change of taste but over the course of time all of these have pretty much gone away along with my headaches.  The drug is expensive but it is well worth it for me."""

When I started it I weighed 165 (which I gained 35 pounds from amitriptyline) and now I am down to 115. A lot of that weight was lost from healthy eating and exercising, but it curbs my appetite a lot and I don't feel the need to impulsively eat in between meals or snack.

I had some extremity tingling for about 6 weeks when I first started (I was slowly built up to 100mg daily dose).

Bipolar Disorder,10,"""I switched from generic topiramate 50mg.

My PDOC decided that a 50mg increase was fine. It sure was! I am indicated for topiramate for the following reasons:

A. Bipolar Disorder; topiramate acts as a mood stabilizer.
B. Drug Cravings; topiramate reduces my urge to use drugs, studies are directed at its propensity to reduce alcohol and stimulant cravings
C. Anxiety: topiramate is a GABA agonist and slightly anxiolytic

It should be tapered. The enormous downside to this drug--even generic--it its outrageous cost. Needless to say, I am suffering as much as I was before having taken it.

I would forget words and things like that. I work with people so I noticed it more because people would point it out. My hands/feet tingled. I noticed less side effects when I took the medicine at night. I only take 50mg at night, that's all I ever have taken and it works for me.

Seizure Prevention,9.0,"""This is for the Newbies out there. I started this medication when I was 15. Had my first seizure few days before before my 15th birthday. The first side effect you will experience is sleepiness, don't fight it. Let your body get a nap between 1-3, which I found to be the best time. I sleep for 1 hour and still can fall asleep at night. I am 21 now. Some advice to you, whenever you don't feel like eating I found that sweet tea gets me hungry, find that X factor in you. The weight loss is insane. I lost 40 pounds in 6 months just by breathing. Now, sleep patterns are important. If an average person needs 8 hours you and I need 9-10 MINIMUM also try to take the dose at the same time every day, you will fall asleep faster. Hang out to see sunrise."""

I am 24 and was so depressed I wasn't leaving my apartment but now I feel like a new person like I want to go out and do things again. I'm not held back. I like that this medicine doesn't make me gain weight too because I've had that problem in the past, I lost 10 pound since I went back on it 4 weeks ago. The only thing I will say that is not great is it slows down my thought process sometimes and it gives me tingles in my hands and face but not all the time.

Everything has started tasting weird since starting the 100mg dose.  I used to drink at least 4 cups of coffee a day and can't stand to drink it at all.  The bonus is that it has helped with the caffeine withdrawal. I am also a smoker and it has helped reduce my craving for tobacco! I have read a lot of the posts on here and am seriously concerned about many of the side effects such as hair loss.  However the weight loss aspect is really appealing. I haven't lost anything yet though."""
Bipolar Disorder,9.0,"""I started on this medicine in 2004. It has been a roller-coaster ride. The first, and most immediate thing was I stopped smoking, and discontinued drinking anything carbonated. I rapidly lost about 30lbs, my nails became so thin I could not hold paper. I started taking supplements as the weight loss, caused nutrition loss. Tingling in hands and feet still persist, especially when I am cold. Around 2007 I entered into a psychotic break, there are other contributing factors here, so my doctor took down the dose from 200mg to 75mg where I am still at today.

Bipolar Disorder,9.0,"""I took this drug for two reasons. First to stop drinking so much and secondly to iron out my highs and lows. Let me say it worked wonders on both fronts. But getting to the sweet spot on the dosage is tough. On the way to the 150 mg daily dose which seemed to even me out and make me act right, it was super tough. I was more low. Suicidal even and I could give a damn about anything. But I know once I got to 150 mg. I'd stick to my plan of not drinking and be much more motivated and optimistic. It's nothing short of miraculous. The sad state of affairs is about a year and half in I developed some liver issue. Was it this drug? Was it something else? Who knows, but I had to go off.

I came off them altogether and migraines just came back as before and I put on 16lb weight in a month!  All the other side effects disappeared.  I have stayed off them for a month and am about to reintroduce them as I cannot stand the almost daily migraines.

The headaches came back immediately just as bad as before the medicine and it took shots to get rid of them. I hopefully will not have to stop this medicine. I do get tingling every once in a while but it does not hurt or stop me from doing daily activities, it just surprises me. I do tell my doctor so he is able to keep track of them.

It was increased but only because I am overly stressed so I am having more issues with my myclonics. Also, and very important...I took this while I was pregnant. I did slack off on taking it since it was a new drug at the time.

I did loose a little weight. The tingeling went away, I adjusted to just not drinking soda. And tomatos started to taste fine. I also take Sumatriptan for when I still do get a headache.

I was close to suicide because of the amount of pain in my life when I tried topamax and it solved all of those issues. One thing I will say is that the side effect I got from it was pretty severe-I was unable to physically exert myself or else I would break out in cold sweats and feel very weak.

Side effects were so bad the first week I almost quit:  dizzy, complete ""weirdness"", inability to handle more than one task at a time, anxiety, spacing out and forgetting things, etc.  And I still got migraines.

Lately I have been very tired, I used to be able to stay up forever now I go to bed at 9:30. Lastly, I have been experiencing random pains. They seem like body aches like you would get when you are sick. Oh and I almost forgot foods tastes different and pop taste metallic."""

Of course, it took a while to figure out that these symptoms were all caused by migraines but they were and after taking Topamax for 2 weeks I stopped having silent migraines. 

I even went off of it after about 3 months of being on it, just to see if my body had possibly regulated itself, but it had not. I was sick again in no time. It was horrible. It took about 2 weeks for the Topamax to kick back in."""

I have tried phentermine with no luck and usually had good success with natural weight loss until being diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and needing a knee replacement that keeps me from working out too much. So so far, I am impressed. I'll be back in a few weeks for a weigh in review. No side effects like others have had with mental fogginess or tingling. 25mg 2x day.

I kept begging to increase the Topamax as I had stopped having any side effects.  Finally I fired my pain doctor after he told me just to go ""cold turkey"" off of morphine (I wanted to stop taking it, but not exactly that way!).  Life is so much better without daily pain medicines and I found a neurologist who took me all the way up to 400mg/day on Topamax.  I did start to have some more weight loss and taste issues and sleepiness, but my migraines became much more manageable with Imitrex and much less frequent.

Recently, my pharmacy switched me to the generic version and I hated it. Immediately that first day, I would get crazy headaches, feel dizzy, sick to my stomach and I couldn't concentrate on anything.

I solved that by cutting it short and dying it purple! Topamax is also sold as a diet pill, so I also lost about 40 pounds, which is helpful for a lot of fibromyalgia patients since we tend to gain weight from lack of activity or taking meds like Lyrica .

At the end of my treatment, my dose was 300mg daily.  I had also lost the ability to form sentences, because I couldn't find words, and was constantly in a fog. That is not good if you're a nurse. Also my short term memory was non existent, also not good for an acute care medical nurse. By the time the side effects became so debilitating, I had to take a short leave of absence to sort out my situation because it affected my job performance. In the end, the medication was discontinued by my doctor and I gained 23lbs of the weight back.

Once I had one there was no driving or I'd run off the road. Thankfully after getting no relief from several medications & including visits to the ER, ENT, and neurologist to try and figure out something... I was prescribed Topamax.

It has even taken away chronic fibromyalgia and arthritis pain, given me back my ability to sleep soundly for hours at a time, and has gotten me out of a daily triptan habit that almost caused a stroke a few weeks ago.

I'll still get an occasional headache that requires me to break out the Imitrex, but nothing serious. I haven't had too many problems with side effects other then having a little less quick recall/memory, but not enough to really matter. Potassium seems to help with the side effects.

Now on 100mg and taking it with Wellbutrin XL 150mg (I also suffer from other issues) I find myself doing ALOT better..I'm seeing a nutritionist too along with therapy but really my medication has helped. Its great."""
Migraine Prevention,9.0,"""I just started back on Topamax after being off the medication for 4 years. I suffer from cluster headaches, when a cluster starts the debilitating headaches come everyday. The last time I took Topamax it stopped the cluster within a week. I continued working up to the full dose and the side effects gradually decreased (confusion, hard to concentrate, difficulty with finding the words to express my thoughts). I found that a lower dose kept the headaches away so I dropped down for a few months then came off the drug completely. Last week a new cluster started so I am back on the Topamax and have had a couple of headache free days already. This medication works well for me at a lower dose and limits the side effects."""
Migraine Prevention,9.0,"""I was just started on this medicine on February 13th, 2009. 25mg a day then after one week to increase to 50mg. Read some of the side effects here figured they must surely be on someone who is definitely on a higher dose.  Anyway, I am a person who is highly addicted to drinking coca cola. I drink like a 2 liter bottle a day.  Well, not any more.  This medicine has cured me of that in 2 days. All carbonated beverages taste flat like Robitussin cough medicine. Good side is that'll help me lose weight and the better side is I have yet to have my headache."""
Bulimia,9.0,"""It helps. For me it wasn't so much the appetite suppression that worked, but the way it makes me more conscious of the situation before I binge. Its makes me stop in the middle of the binge or just before completely,  and ask myself whats up with the need to hit the self destruct button. 

In case that I do binge on Topamax, my binges consists of less food when. And I eat slower, defeated by the situation."""

The only side effect I've had is mild dry mouth. And no migraines. None. I went from 2 or 3 a week to ZERO migraines in over a month. I am very happy with this medication.

I have minimal to no side effects, a little drier mouth perhaps, plus my 15/20 vision reduces to 20/20. I feel less anxious and less ""pressure/need"" to tic. I can take much lower doses of the brand name to achieve the same effect with the generic; but my insurance won't cover the brand name. It's 100mg twice/day generic versus half that amount brand version. It's still worth it!! I feel so much more in control and ""almost normal""."""

I believe it is working for me.
Ok, I am now updating my review...I am now 37 years old and I still take the Topamax daily, 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night. It works for me really well. Maybe 1 migraine a month and it is very manageable with Relpax. I still get a little bit of tingling in my hands and feet, and my weight has stabilized. I love Topamax.

Migraine Prevention,9.0,"""I started with migraine aged 2 and suffered all my life. Going through the menopause it got worse and I was given Topomax. It changed my life in fact it gave me my life back. I titrated the drug super slow from 5 mg up to 50mg twice a day. The only side effect I had was pins and needles in my hands for several minutes after taking the tablets, that was bearable. Within 3 months I was migraine free. 12 years on I am still taking the tablets and still migraine free. Drugs affect individuals differently so don't be put off by the bad experiences of others even though I feel heart sorry for them. If you are suffering badly with migraine as I was then at least give them a try and I hope they work for you as they do for me."""

I'm about to make the step up to 200mg.  I went up in weekly steps of 25mg.

Migraine Prevention,9.0,"""I've found topamax to be a useful tool in migraine prevention. I've been fighting these now for over 25 years and I've gone as far as having sinus sx and dentures to replace my top teeth to reduce the triggers of these monstrous headaches. I've come to believe there's no magic pill to take it all away but topamax reduces the severity greatly. The little tingling sensation will go away and saltiness are great when you have to take meds and don't have a full stomach. It helps with the nausea.  Whether topamax is the drug for you- don't lose hope. Just keep trying to find the right combination of diet change, sleep, trigger reduction, and meds until you find what works for you."""

My wife wouldn't let me drive at 400mg, I was dangerous, parking became very difficult, once I had to get out of the car and let her park. Frustrating and humiliating. In the end, I was down to 50mg a day, Doc said that wasn't causing any side effects at that low dose. WRONG! When I finally stopped, it took a couple of weeks to become me again. I was shocked at the difference it made being off of it. Some of my hearing came back thankfully. I did lose 30 pounds that did not come back."""

I also have generalized  anxiety with panic attacks for which I take Lexapro for over 10 years.  My psychiatrist suggested that I may have something similar to ""The Kindling Effect"" rather than explosive disorder.  He asked me if I'd like to give Topamax a try. I said sure why not! He started me on 25 mg twice a day. Within five days I noticed a difference for the better.  I can handle my mood much better, I can handle situations much better, and I have not had any explosive episodes at all in five months! To me this drug is a miracle.

I occasionally get tingling on my tongue and a weird burning/taste when I drink soda. I get a slight dizziness when I first take it. I am more sensitive to cold and I get diarrhea. All of these side effects I can either live with or treat and are worth the freedom of the migraines.

I still fry veggies in olive oil. Still eat a baked potato sometimes. But cut way back on portions and added snacks between meals.  Then every 3 days I be sure to eat something a little more fattening and it makes me lose weight.  For salad dressing, oil and vinegar with seasoning packet. No sweet tea etc. Lots of water.

My migraines all but stopped after a month of being on the medication and at the lowest dose.  I had all the side effects - tingling, weight loss (very happy about it too), forgetting certain words and the nasty taste of soda.  That was okay because I only drink it very rarely anyway.

Thankfully I have wonderful insurance that I only pay $20 a month for my Topiramate. Prior to not having insurance. I was in a real pickle. I found a program through Johnson & Johnson where they paid for my Topamax for two years. Saved me about $890 a month. But honestly, great medicine if your doctor gets you on the correct dosage.

Migraine Prevention,9.0,"""I was put on Topiramate 50mg to control almost daily migraines. It didn't work at that dosage so my doc increased to 75mg after 2.5 weeks which stopped full-blown migraines but I was still getting threats (migraines started and lasted 1/2 an hour then went away on their own). No weight loss except for what I was already losing (2 Lbs/week from my normal daily exercises). When I first started on Topiramate I couldn't think straight and couldn't remember some words so I immediately started taking it at night only instead (with my dr's approval) and that got rid of all of those problems.

I carry out my job with ease as well so really can't complain there. The only issues I've had are the side effects of tingly hands and feet, sudden dizziness, becoming very, very tired all of a sudden - and more recently - losing my train of thought, getting confused easily and being unable to focus.

Carbonated drinks taste terrible. I was a Diet Pepsi ahololic , and should stop drinking it anyway. And without out any other dietary changes I went from 210 to 206 this week!

Migraine Prevention,9.0,"""I have been taking topamax for 2 months to help prevent severe daily migraines w/ Aura it has helped me tremendously. I did lose 6 lbs the 1st week. Mainly due to diarrhea & lack of appetite. I almost gave up on taking it because of the stomach cramps I was getting but they subsided after the 1st week. I have changed a lot about my lifestyle since taking topamax so I don't know how much of my weight loss can be attributed to the drug itself but I definitely have lost weight 12 lbs & don't crave sugar. I stopped drinking soda over a yr ago so I don't know if it tastes different now. I do want water more than anything, which is fine. It does make you drowsy/foggy but I take my dose at bedtime, I do get weird tingles a few times a day in hands"""
Seizures,8.0,"""Topamax is an uncertainty at this time.  I took it decades ago and because no med or mixture of meds controls seizures sufficiently for me I'm circling back.  I've noticed major neurological feelings (e.g., tingling) transmitting down my legs to the point that it keeps me awake for many hours, which results in sleep deprivation and then seizure activity.  It's not good at night.  One reason I stopped the med years ago is because it can cause kidney stones.  Not anything I want on top of seizures plus the tingling, foginess, and fatigue caused by Topamax."""

But for a long time Topamax was wonderful. The first 3 months were hell and my boyfriend almost left me but I started taking a small amount of antidepressants and that seemed to calm me down. Or maybe it was a coincidence. Anyway all of the side effects did go away except for the difficulty remembering words.

I could not do simple math problems or remember the names of streets nearby my home.  The huge relief of not having migraines made it almost worth it.  After all, I was now retired and did not have to be as sharp as I once was.  It was a tough decision .  My family was frustrated too with my huge brain fog.  I also had the tingling and taste changes but they are easy to adjust to.  I recently weaned myself down to 50mg a day and its working well."""

Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""My neurologists prescribed me Topamax to prevent migraines 4 days ago. The first night I took the the pill I had HORRIBLE side effects (tingling and numbness for hours). The following night I decided to take my vitamins (which I didn't do the night before) and I didn't experience the same side effects. Not sure if it helped, but I make sure I take them every single day!! The only side effect that I get is slight tingling in my hands occasionally."""

I've been taking 25mg per day for 2 weeks then increased to twice per day for 2 weeks and now I'm on 50mg, twice a day. I've not had a seizure in over a month which I'm very happy about! The negative side effects I get are blurred vision, clumsiness, headaches and tingling in my hands and feet. I was hoping to lose some weight as I read some reviews on the Internet on how Toprimate helps with weight loss- but I haven't experienced any Weightloss yet. Maybe it's because I'm on a very low dosage. I'll have to wait and see."""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I've been using Topamax for about 4 months after suffering for about 20 years.  The migraines had started to come every week and I couldn't function for days.

Side effects haven't been too bad, some tingling, and I can no longer drink anything carbonated, but well worth it. """

By week four the feeling went away. Took 2-3 months for the fingers and toes to stop tingling but I had that in the toes any ways from nerve damage in the back. They increased my evening dose and within two weeks again I tried to commit suicide again. This time twice in one week and within a month I stabilized again. My doctor will not raise it anymore even though I just begged her to, it's only day 7-21 that I need to be watched and the last time, I called my sister to take me to the hospital the second attempt.I didn't lose weight on it."""
Trigeminal Neuralgia,8.0,"""I suffered a stroke in '04 and my neurologist prescribed Neurontin to deal with the resulting numbness and tingling on the right side. A year later, and after emergency gall bladder surgery, he put me on a low dose of Topamax instead. It worked well, but I've had to eventually increase the dosage. The side effects were minimal; I needed to lose the 35 lbs I lost (and my wardrobe needed updating :0), and the additional tingling is nothing compared to what I feel when I don't take it. Expensive!"""
Obesity,8.0,"""I've been on Topamax since March 2009. I've lost 75 of the 110 pounds I need to lose. The side effects are annoying and, in the beginning I really wanted to quit the medication. But as I've lost the weight, I've actually been able to decrease the dosage so a lot of the side effects have decreased as well. Some of them are easier to live with than others. The paresthesia has mostly subsided, but I do still struggle with memory lapses. I quit drinking all carbonated beverages because I do not like the way they taste. That has probably helped with the weight loss anyway. Overall, I am quite pleased. I am also pleased to read that others have been able to maintain their weight on this drug."""

I had not read any of these reviews, and after my very first dose, I had a carbonated drink and it tasted flat on the front of my tongue, but burned the back! I thought it was a fluke, but, it happened today, too. This will definitely help me drink more water! I have started having tingly fingers and toes, but no other symptoms, yet. I already have brain fog due to menopause, so I'm a little worried about that! I have been having 4 or 5 migraines per week lately and I take sumitriptan for them which usually works.

The side effects kept getting worst to the point where I couldn't stand up, grasp anything, I talked funny and even messed with my throat to the point of chocking.

Bipolar Disorder,8.0,"""I was diagnosed bipolar 2 about 3 years ago.  I am a 36 yr old female.

That worked great for awhile until it didn't and I weened myself off everything. DON'T DO THAT!! 
I had a horrible hypomanic episode followed by a 4 month depressive crash.  I'm now on Latuda, Celexa, Klonopin, and my good buddy Topamax.
I have had no serious side effects from Topamax.  A little hair loss (more like extra hair in the brush) but it's only noticeable to me.  Not bad.  No word loss, no memory problems.  I'm in grad school with a near 4.0 GPA.  It helps me maintain my weight so the other meds don't affect me."""

Side effects=food tastes yucky, expecially my beloved sodas and rockstar energy drinks. Im loosing too much weight (Ive always struggled w being too skinny).

Bipolar Disorder,8.0,"""I love the weight loss attribute to this drug. When at a dosage of 50 or 75 mg per day, I have felt happier. One day, I doubled the 50 mg dosage in the late afternoon. Note: This doubled dosage was done 4 MONTHS after initially being prescribed the medicine. 
100 mg of generic Topiramate made me feel wired. An hour later, I could be found with a full cart at the grocery store.The manic in me had returned. This was not a coincidence. I took the dosage at 75 mg the following day out of curiosity.. The compulsive cleaner had returned. My b/f at the time watched me scrub away at an already squeaky clean countertop.

Im not counting calories; just not interested in junk food. I read a poster on another forum to take extra B complex and Biotin to avoid any hair loss as the drug seems to deplete that nutrient in the body.

Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I've been taking Topamax for over 3 years and the only side effect I experienced was an initial weight loss of about 15lbs. If there was any cognitive difficulty, memory loss, difficulty remembering words, etc., I didn't notice, as it was worse when I was experiencing a migraine. Before taking Topamax I would have a headache for months, with no relief. After I started taking Topamax the migraines were down to 3 month. My Dr. started me on a dose of 25mg, 2 X day and titrated me to 100mg 2 X day. Unfortunately, the Topamax no longer seems to be effective and on my next visit I will ask my Dr. to either increase the dosage or to prescribe a different medicine. Also, I have to agree with another post I saw, I am always freezing!"""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I have been taking Topamax 50 mg. 2 X daily for over a year now and found that it has helped me alot with a few exceptions.  They are weight loss, kidney stones, tingling in hands & feet & frequent urination.  I found that other medications din't help (Depakote).  I also take this with Inderal(B/P Med) and Catapres TTS Patch(B/P Med) cause I also suffer high Blood Pressure and these two medications also are good migraine fighting meds.  I do recommend the Topamx."""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""My doctor prescribed me Topamax as a preventative measure for my common migraines.  It helped with my headaches really well.  I used to get migraines at least a dozen times a month and this medicine allowed me to only have 2 headaches in the month that I took it.  
I stopped taking it, however, because I felt so out of it.  I felt like a space cadet.  It also made me very moody.  Everything irritated and bothered me.  I didn't think those feelings were worth continuing with the prescription.  
I would suggest trying it, as those effects, from what I understand, are rare.  And, I have to say that I didn't get migraines for a few months after I stopped taking it.  So that was a bonus.  
As a side note, it does make soft drinks taste 'flat'."""

The Depakote, amitriptyline and nortriptyline were too sedating.  The propranolol worked well, but I had too increase the dosage over time to the point where my blood pressure became too low.  Right now a combination of Topamax at 50 mg and propranolol extended release at 60 mg works best for me.  There are few adverse effects.

I do experience the metal taste, some tingling in my hands and feet, tiredness, blurred vision, some diarrhea but these are few and far between, my weight is stabilized and not many problems with sleep.

Also my short term memory was non existent also not good for an acute care medical nurse. By the time the side effects became debilitating, I had to take a short leave of absence to sort out my situation. In the end, the medication was discontinued and I gained 23lbs  of the weight back.

Tingling is more frequent in cold weather, but it's not bad enough to make me quit, especially not with the benefits I'm experiencing.

Last month, the headaches came back almost daily with the auras. My doctor increased dose, going to 200mg and headaches are gone already. I'm hoping this will also help with back pain from disk degeneration. Lost 33lbs"""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I started this medication at the suggestion of my neurologist in June 2016. I was overweight and having frequent migraines. I started on 25mg and increased by 25 mg every week until I was at 100 mg. I started to notice slow weight loss at first, and my migraines were instantly better. The weight loss definitely increased once I got to 100mg. After the one month mark the doctor increased me to 125mg and the wight loss slowly continued. As of now I am down 27lbs and still going! As some have said the side effects of ""word soup"" and tingling in my hands and feet have all happened, but they have all worn off once I have become used to the increased dosage (which is a good and bad thing). I'll be talking with the dr soon! Good luck everyone!"""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I have epilepsy and chronic migraines due to a head injury. I have had this condition for 3 years now. It wasn't until Topamax was added to my regimen that I was seizure free. I do still have occasional migraines but I personally feel Topamax gave me my life back. 6 months ago I got my drivers licence back after 3 years. I attribute that to Topamax."""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I was put on Topamax, but the generic version about 5 yrs ago for migraines. The weight loss was phenomenal when I took it like I was instructed. It decreased my appetite tremendously. I did have tingling in my hands & feet for a while & was a little foggy, but nothing too bad. I actually didn't attribute these effects to the Topamax until reading others account. I went from 220 to 180 lbs in under a year. I stopped taking it about 3 months ago because a friend complained that it made her hair fall out & that she was feeling mentally ill so I got scared & stopped. Now my appetite has really picked up. I'm going back to the Topamax because my hair never fell out or anything & I didn't feel mental. Everyone reacts differently to different med"""
Bipolar Disorder,8.0,"""I have taken Topamax for bipolar twice. First for three years then now for a year. Do not know why I ever went off! This has been great for me after 25 years on lithium which was like living under 4 wet wool blankets. I also tried Depakote which only increased the weight gain and depression. At first, the side effects were a bit rough even at the initial very low dose of 25 mg. Very sleepy and tingly of hands and feet. BUT they pass, they really do. It may take a week of just being exhausted even when you increase your dose. The appetite depressant is wonderful. Also cuts down on general anxiety. Takes the real edge off the hypomania. I have not had any of the problems with finding words, etc. """
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""Topamax worked pretty well for my daily headaches/migraines. I was down to using 6 of the 9 Imitrex pills that I usually suffered the rest of the month needing more of before. It also helped my cravings for alcohol (former binge drinker) and sugar, significantly. Topamax works for so many things- but there were 2 side effects that I couldn't deal with- irritability and hair loss. I recently had the same experience with Keppra- minus the benefits of Topamax. I have gone through all the seizure medicines with minimal benefit and all have caused hair loss for me except Zonegran, which didn't help my headaches at all."""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""After taking 100mg daily, it took me roughly 3 months for my migraines to dramatically stop. I went from having approximately 12 migraines monthly to having maybe two. The side effects of this medication for me: for 3 weeks I could not focus, extreme fatigue, restlessness. I cannot drink anything carbonated, as a result, I lost 20 pounds in the first month. Serious appetite loss. I've been on this medication for 9 months and lost a total of 43 pounds. I have to take in the morning otherwise I cannot sleep. It also helps with my OCD tendencies. If you can make it through 3 weeks of outter space, this medication is worth it!!"""
Obesity,8.0,"""This is my second check in. I started Topiramate on July 4th with minor success but high hopes taking 25mg 2x daily. Now I am at 100 mg, 50 a.m. & p.m. This seems to be the turning point for me. The weight is finally starting to noticeably go down. I eat a breakfast with protein, barely hungry until dinner but make wiser choices and still enjoy desserts. Very thirsty for water all night and still biking. Good luck all!"""
Seizure Prevention,8.0,"""I've been on Topamax (250 mg/day) for 8 years now. Up until last week, I was seizure free for 7 years. Everything I tried prior to Topamax resulted in breakthrough seizures every couple of weeks. Topamax enabled me to get my license, a full time job, move out of my parent's house, and eventually get my Bachelor's degree (next year!). Put simply, Topamax gave me a life!"""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I had tried everything Depakote, verapamil, Inderal, etc. and I had several migraines a week.  I have been on Topamax for 15 years and it has made a huge difference.  I still have a few migraines a month which usually respond to Imitrex.  As the years have gone by the tingling, loss of words have gotten much better.  I can't do without this medicine.  I'm a nurse and for the one or two out of control migraines per year I use injectable Toradol.  That is a miracle medicine.  No more Emergency department for me.  I can now feel free, live a normal life, not terrified of being stuck in a dark room with vomiting and wanting to die."""
Bipolar Disorder,8.0,"""I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since I was 16 and now that I'm 25. I feel good to have found a medication that helps me. The only problem I have is the fatige. I could sleep alot on this medication. I guess thats still better than being depressed and irritable."""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I've been on Topamax for probably at least 15 years, 400 mg daily. I'm get debilating migraines. After reading these reviews I guess I am one of the lucky ones as I have not received one side effect. I take it at night. If the migrane is really bad I add one pill of Relpax and that does the job."""
Tourette's Syndrome,8.0,"""I have MS and often shake. I have a full time job and often had to listen to people ask me ""had a little to much coffee?"" or ""are you cold?"". Since I started taking two doses of Topamax - one in the morning and one in the evening my shaking has greatly diminished."""
Bipolar Disorder,8.0,"""Overall, Topamax has been a very positive attribute to my daily ""cocktail"" of necessary medicines.  It has assisted in stabilizing my mood, and thus helped me to resume a semi normal routine.  As for side effects, I experience loss of memory that I am told is due to the Topamax, and is fairly common.  Although, irritating at times, it is much more tolerable than my past existence."""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""Prescribed a half 50 mg tab at bedtime for a week.  It's been two days and I have no more headaches! Finally!  I have a strange side effect of pain in my private area though.  Does anyone else have this issue?  It's just annoying.  I hope it doesn't get any worse.  I've been looking for a migraine med that actually helps without too many side effects."""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I've had daily chronic migs for over 39 years now & have tried everything under the sun. Although Topamax doesn't get rid of my migs it allows them to be manageable. When they not, Imitrex is there. I LIVE on those two. Yes, Topamax has its side effects; I esp like the one where I forget words and objects. I've been on it for about 6 years now & although it doesn't work the best, it works better than anything else i've been on. I take 400 mgs daily. Have a pos outlook on life, it helps a lot!!  :o)"""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""Didn't like initial side effects. Reduced migraines by at least 50-75%"""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""This is one of the medicines I cycle through for my migraine control.  My body gets ""used"" to them, so about every 4-6 months I have to change drugs.  Fortunately I can rotate back after about a year off.  This is one of my favorites, because the side effects don't interfere too much with my day-to-day life.  Tingling in the hands and feet, decreased appetite, and a bit of increased anxiety (but manageable).  For me, the benefits of having my migraines under control (ones that went on for days and weeks, 7-9 scale pain on a regular basis), far outweigh the cost of the side effects."""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I still get slight headaches once in a while,  and use Excedrin Migraine with the Topamax, but its nothing compared to what I had. The side effects go away and the ones that don't, you get used to. I still have memory problems, so I had to lower the dose."""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I've been taking Topamax since  1/2015 for Migraines suggested from my Doctor. She said it was a little pricey. If you don't have insurance I would recommend websites where you print out coupons and take them to the pharmacy they saved me $188.00 for Topamax ! No kidding. Anyways. Topamax works good. I did loss 7 lbs my 1st week, I ended up losing a total of 20 lbs in 3 mos. been steady since. I'm still taking Topamax 6mos later. I'm looking into other options as  I can not take the Side effects, loss of hair, tingling of my Feet, hands, legs,, face, odd places on my body, mood swings, I'm very irritable, I don't recognize myself.  I need a change."""
Obesity,8.0,"""I was taking 400mg daily for chronic migraines, depression, and weight loss. It's very important to build up slowly otherwise the side effects can be extreme. I lost around maybe 50lbs while on it. When I got up to 300 - 400mg I started to have memory problems and sleep issues. After a while I felt like it had stopped working and dropped it, but that could have been from me forgetting to take it (memory issues remember). It takes a few weeks to a few months for the side   effects to fully wear off. I started at 235 or 245, and went down to 185. I'm now back up to 200. I haven't exercised in years, and I didn't change my diet (I probably don't eat as healthy as I should)."""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I have only been on this medicine for about a month and a half. I was having about 6-8 migraines a week. I cannot tell you how much difference Topamax has made in my life. I feel like a new person. Some side effects , little tingling, my tongue feels weird, but only a few mini migraines here and there now and well manageable. Love it."""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""Just started Topiramate August 2 2013. I've had migraines for 33 years.  Imitrex works unless, like now, I'm a stress-monkey. I was having 2-3 migraines per week. Doc started me on 50 mg. Slowly working up to maximum dose over 30 days. I didn't like the 1st 3 days. Feel disoriented, dingy, irritable. I've lost 8 lbs in 3 weeks which is fine since my weight contributes to my hypertension which contributes to my migraines. My doc & I plan to take me off Topiramate as I lose weight & get healthier. Right now I can tolerate the negatives."""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I started taking 25 mg about a year and a half ago I got up 200 mg once a day I found in the beginning my hands would tingle I had bitter a taste in my mouth but overtime that went away it did help with weight loss I lost about 10 pounds. I didn't experience any hair loss in the beginning I had trouble remembering things but it eventually fades away and you're back to normal at least for me . I believe this drug does work specially if you have migraines."""
Seizure Prevention,8.0,"""Well I can say that I was taking keppra which made me psychotic. I now take topiramate x25mg twice a day and increasing until 6 weeks and I started last week Tuesday and already lost 15lbs. I have to watch this because as being in the medical field I know there are different side effects but the main two are diarrhea and anorexia. The diarrhea I maybe can deal with but I'm not made to be anorexic. I like a little meat on my bones. So just watch your weight side effects"""
Obesity,8.0,"""Hi, thank you all for your comments. Ive just started topamax (second night) 25mg and cant sleep. I now see its a side effect that some expereince and it will go away. I will persist.

Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""I used to get migraines twice a week that would last a day or two. Now they're down to  two every two weeks that could possibly last a little more than a day.Topiramate really helped. I used to be on a lot of meds. I'm 17 now. I do experience side affects as well. I can't really concentrate as well in school. I can see that in my grades. I can't sleep well at night. I've lost weight, which is probably a good thing, (30lbs in 6mos.) and the one that gets me the most is my hair has started falling out drastically. I don't brush my hair anymore. I used to have 8 migraine days a month at the least last month I was down to 3. These side affects are worth it to me. but every case is different."""
Fibromyalgia,8.0,"""I love this medicine.  My Dr originally gave it to me for weight loss but it got rid of all my joint pains.  I had it everywhere.  It was a miracle drug for me.  I am noticing some memory loss,  and difficulty concentrating but I'm 52 so it could be age.  I'm going to cut back on the dosage and see if I notice changes."""
Seizure Prevention,8.0,"""I took Topamax for approximately 5 years with little trouble. I did have the metallic taste, and could not drink carbonated beverages. In July 2009, I had to quit Topamax due to a little published side effect, kidney stones. I was on a pretty large dose (600 mg).

I had a 9mm Kidney stone and many many small stones. I take Keppra XR now. It prevents the seizures, but I have gained all the weight plus some that I had lost on Topamax, but no seizures or kidney stones."""
Migraine Prevention,8.0,"""Used to get 2-3 weekly migraines before Topamax and would run out of Fioricet and Imitrex. I tapered up to the 100 mg dose and while I do get the occasional tingling in my fingers and toes, its nothing compared to a full fledged migraine. I also dropped 8 or 9 lbs, which is a lot for me since I'm 5'2 and was 129, now I'm 121lbs. I have almost no appetite, but almost no migraines."""
Obesity,8.0,"""I started againTopomax about 1& 1/2 week ago for migraines and I am down about 8 lbs. I am overweight due to the fact that I just had my last child and I did eat what I wanted to. I did work out before, during, and now after my pregnancy. Topomax has reduced my cravings I absolutely love sweets & southern foods(I'm from the South:) I did occasionally soda but I did regularly drink Izzy a healthy carbonated drink but Topomax makes all carbonated drinks tastes horrible which is great if you have issues drinking soda all the time."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,7.0,"""I was recently prescribed topiramate 25 MG tablet for neuropathy caused by type 2 diabetes.  I can not find any other place on here where this drug was prescribed for neuropathy, but so far it appears to be helping."""
Migraine Prevention,7.0,"""By the time I started Topamax, I was getting migraines 2-4 days a week. Topamax seemed like the best fix. And for a while, it was. My migraines significantly reduced, though I did get most of the common side effects: slight tingling in my fingers, carbonated beverages tasted gross, and weight loss. 

My main warning about this medicine is weight loss. It seems to be paraded as a benefit, and to some it may be, but if you are already naturally slim, pay very close attention. I wound up dropping to an unhealthy weight despite all attempts to counter it, and it's ultimately why I had to stop Topamax. I was unwillingly wasting away. When I stopped, my migraines returned in short order, and I'm still looking for an alternative that works."""
Seizure Prevention,7.0,"""I have to take a very low dose or suffer from stomach problems and diarrhea. If I miss just one day can allow mild seizures to come through. Otherwise it works well."""
Migraine Prevention,7.0,"""This drug isn't for everyone. The side effects are completely crazy. I have been on it for almost 12 months now. It has provided relief from migraines by almost 95% of the time.  This has been a big deal for me. Side effects I've experienced: hands and feet tingle periodically (some days are worse than others), hair loss started 3 months after taking it but began to cease 6 months later, definite brain fog (some days I feel like I'm losing my mind), grogginess (I can only take my dose at night otherwise I'm a zombie during the day), changes in vision, loss of appetite, fatigue, irritability.  At first I convinced myself the side effects were worth tolerating compared to having a migraine. But as time goes on, I'm beginning to think im wrong"""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,7.0,"""I started taking Topiramate several years ago for pain/neuropathy, as I read these posts I found out it could also be helping my obesity, fibromyalgia, Crohns and my smoking. I stopped taking it about two months ago because I was having kidney stone problems and thinking this medicine could be the reason why. In the two months I have gained 25lbs, I'm in so much pain I can't wrap my head around it, and my smoking is got in out of control. I had no idea this medicine could or was helping all my other issues so I'm going back on it to see if I loose the weigh, control my pain, stop smoking, Although kidney stones can be the most excruciating pain ever! I'd rather have that pain once a year than suffer every day in my other pain."""
Migraine Prevention,7.0,"""Been on Topamax for 3 months I have recently gone up on the dose to 75 mg at bedtime. I've been all right dealing with the tingling. I have quit smoking and drinking which is great. I started working out alot since I've been so anxious. Possible side effect?  The worst for me is the sleep issues and the mood swings. Since the dose went up I am having terrible night sweats and am waking up all night long. I'm exhausted all day with little to no motivation. My mood swings quickly and dramatically from happy to annoyed. Just trying to wait it out. I'm still having headaches everyday. Just not migraines."""
Migraine Prevention,7.0,"""When I took 50mg of topamax the first time for migraine prevention it worked wonders and I lost 20lbs in a few short months! I stopped it when I got pregnant with my daughter. Once she stopped nursing I restarted it again to help with my migraines and hopefully drop the extra weight I couldn't lose from the pregnancy. It helps with my migraines the second time around but there is no decrease in appetite and no weight loss. Very disappointing."""

Tourette's Syndrome,7.0,"""I have Tourette's Syndrome and ADHD. Tried different kinds of medicines for my TS. Depending on my day, I could have some to a lot of tics. Topamax did wonders for my tics, but it can have side effects that are similar to ADHD symptoms - different remembering some words/names when asked, unable to concentrate, etc. I also experienced that my thought-pattern were kind of limited to a certain degree, as I would sometimes have difficulties thinking further ahead. This medicine however, was much better than other kinds I've tried. """

When he upped the dose apparently my body did not like that and my migraines came back, just going back down didn't do the trick. After about a year of being off of it and trying 6 other prescriptions, my new doctor said she didn't understand why they had come back when the dose was upped and maybe that it was totally out of my system we could try again. I went back on it and my migraines have decreased from one every day meaning literally 7 days a week to about 3 or 4 a week, but no soda like others stated and this time I had to quit smoking cigarettes because they tasted stale."""

Migraine Prevention,7.0,"""Side effects in first 3 months included tingling feet, loss of sensation in hands, some minor hair loss, weight loss (11kg), appetite loss, loss of words (especially nouns), inability to taste carbonated drinks. Almost all of these disappeared after 3ish months. I am left with a somewhat reduced appetite, occasional pins & needles and I can't drink fizzy drinks. Weight loss was short lived.

Effect on migraines was instant and measurable - reduced severity/frequency. Not to zero, but to a more manageable level. I am left with regular headaches, which I now think are Medication Overuse Headaches which will pass as I reduce painkiller use. I still get menstrual migraines which can be tricky to shift, but with sumatriptan I can usually cope."""
Bipolar Disorder,7.0,"""I was diagnosed with bipolar depression about a year ago. I have been on topamax for that as well as migraine headaches for 8 to 9ish months now.  The migraines went away, and I have lost about 40 pounds since taking Topamax! The only downfall is hair loss. I highly warn anybody taking this drug not to miss a dose or try weaning yourself off, because I have done both and ended up with very bad mood swings and will be crying on the floor one minute, then raging and angry, then it will be as if nothing happened."""
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,7.0,"""I've heard so much about topamax  and was given it for nerve pain I have heard that its infamous nickname is ""dope-amax"" which I find hilarious but have fortunately not experienced yet thank God! I have however, coined another nickname for it: ""skinnymax"" as I have been taking it one week and am wasting away on it! I have to make myself eat. My pain management doc put me on it because Lyrica and Depakote caused weight gain. I wasn't  fat to begin with. Just didn't want to go down that road. I'm currently on 25mgs bid. The only other side effect besides loss of appetite is mild drowsiness. I am 5'2 and last I weighed in at 115.  I haven't weighed but if I go below 105 I will have to stop. Still it is a great drug!"""
Obesity,7.0,"""I've been on topomax for 6 weeks now along with walking at least 2 to 3 miles a day sometimes skipping a day or two depending on the weather I'm 40lbs down. Appetite gone, smoothies are enough for me and no snacks. No side effects by the way. 50mg twice daily"""
Obesity,7.0,"""I have struggled with weight loss for years.  Food cravings are one of my ""symptoms.""  Topamax really did help with this, however my energy and memory are not what they use to be.  Originally I thought it was a trade off I could adjust to but the fuzzy memory for me is frustrating.  I sometimes say words that I am thinking about and don't even realize it.  Then argue that I didn't say it, only to find out I did. Silly, but worth revisitng my physician about.  I struggle with the same 10-20 lbs but won't give up. I would recommend trying it to people who are serious about weight loss.  It helps you push your plate away and not obsess about food.  That was an experience I had never had before, but I need my memory."""
Migraine Prevention,7.0,"""I had been Honorably discharged from active duty, and from the time I got out I had experienced Migraines on almost a daily basis's. I went to a neurologist after trying home remidies and using Exedrin Migraine, and he put me on Topiramate 50mg twice daily, but my body metabolized it to fast, causing my head to be very painful. Also the first day I took it, I had a pain in my head that woke me from REM sleep, my wife said I was screaming in pain while sleeping. He recommended Trokendi XR 100mg Extended Release. Since I have been on Trokendi, my head hurts daily a little with a slight tingling pain which my neurologist says is normal. I have migraines on a rare occassion."""
Seizures,7.0,"""I started taking this medication as soon as I was diagnosed with an inherited seizure disorder. Although I haven't had a seizure ever since I began to take the medication (which is good because the meds are working) the side effects were horrible. I would often feel very disoriented and saw a great amount of weight loss. This may not apply to everyone because everyone is different, but that was my experience with this medication."""
Migraine Prevention,7.0,"""I have been on generic 25mg daily dose for a week now for migraines. Positive is that I finally have a break in the migraine of 8 plus days, no tingling in extremities as others mentioned. No additional mental fog. Cola taste flat and that is a plus to me as I need to drink more water. Negative is the nausea that occurs after I take the pill and it is horrible but I counter it with a suppository of phenegrin(sp). Of course that knocks me out for hours. I was to increase dosage to 50mg but doctor gave okay to wait another week. This is a promising option for me after 16 yrs of suffering. And I have tried numerous meds over that time."""
Migraine Prevention,7.0,"""I've been on Topamax for about a week now great results. carbonated drinks taste horrible little confused in class but overall its a Lifesaver. My migraines had me suicidal."""
Migraine Prevention,7.0,"""I started out at 75mg, had to decrease at first because it made me super emotional and had really bad tingling in hands/feet, so I ended up going back down to 50mg, then I slowly increased by 25mg until I got up to 100mg and I'm doing OK now. I do feel emotionally sensitive at times and do get occasional tingling in my fingers and toes if I don't eat for awhile, which the Topamax also decreases my appetite and I have lost weight on. I still have ocular migraines if I stay up too late or don't get enough sleep. If I have even a small glass of wine the evening before I will wake up with an awful migraine the next morning, so I see why they say not to drink while on the medication. Overall it has really significantly decreased migraines."""
Obesity,6.0,"""I suffer from migraines and also am overweight. So the Dr prescribed me topamax for both. I weighed in at 209 on Feb 2 2016 and today Feb 12 2016 I am 203. So far so good with the weight loss. I'm not to pleased with the side affects however. I feel fuzzy all day. Like I'm on a cloud, Dizzy.  Tingling and nubness in my fingers and toes. Hasn't helped my migraines at all either.  It does though not make me hungry at all. I have to force myself to eat because I know I have too. I don't see myself taking this medication long term. I'd rather try and lose the weight naturally. Not worth all the side affects"""
Migraine Prevention,6.0,"""Topamax worked great to relieve my daily headaches and migraines. Taking it twice daily, it didn't take long to start enjoying life again without headaches, but as time went on, the side effects just kept getting more and more intense. I could deal with the tingling in my fingers, hands, and feet, but waking up completely disoriented, not being able to think straight or concentrate, not being able to form sentences or find the right words finally got to me after about a year/year and a half and I weened off of it. It's unfortunate because it felt amazing not to have headaches everyday. I am also small to begin with and I lost about 15 pounds on it, I usually had to force myself to eat due to having absolutely no appetite."""
Obesity,6.0,"""I was prescribed these meds to aide in my weight loss journey. I struggle with PTSD, anxiety, depression, sleep apnea, and pain.

I am really hoping these will boost my weight loss which will intern lift my mood, relieve my pain, etc.... Pray for me it works!!!"""
Migraine Prevention,6.0,"""Until three months ago I thought I had tried it all. My doctor mentioned Topamax in a follow-up and asked if I'd be willing to try one more time. (I'd about given up) I had just happened to be recovering from a horrific migraine from the night before that had me down with my ice packs and my trusty bucket for nine hours. So I said, ""Yes, gimme!"" I'm still trying to decide if it was the best decision... My goal was 100mg a day, I haven't made it beyond 50mg yet. My side effects are tingling hands/feet, brain fog, thirsty ALL THE TIME, hot flashes, and forgetfulness. I went from 2-3 migraines weekly to about that monthly. So it DOES help, but the side effects are ridiculous and they aren't going away. It's choosing the lesser of two evils."""
Migraine Prevention,6.0,"""Was rx'd for migraine control and prevention. Worked. But the painful tingling in my hands and feet was so extreme, I couldn't handle it. It also messed me up with some outrageous severe insomnia, and that's one thing that I can't have any more out of control. Even with Lunesta and other hefty sleep aids I was a mess, no sleep at all. I'm just now hearing how it helps with weight loss, which Id love to get advantages from, but the side effects weren't worth it at all."""
Migraine Prevention,6.0,"""I started Topamax two days ago. I was very scared to try this medicine because of all the side effects and put off trying it for years. So far I have had the numb/tingling extremities and what seems to be a bit of a brain fog (trouble focusing,recalling words) I also noticed that soda doesn't taste the same. I drank one today and it was HORRIBLE! I also feel really lightheaded. I am determined to ride this one out for as long as possible, though. I've tried most other medications without success so this really is my last hope."""
Bipolar Disorder,6.0,"""I've been taking Topamax for two months and the weight loss is great, but that's because everything taste's gross. I'm tired a lot and have to work hard to focus. But I can finally sleep at night and feel rested. After reading some of the other comments I now understand why my fingertips sometimes feel numb or weird. I'm still not sure if the weight loss, better sleep are worth the disgusting taste in my mouth and the feeling sometimes that I just want to burst into tears (although that could be just because I work so hard and I'm still broke)."""

Migraine Prevention,6.0,"""I have been on Topamax for about four years now. I think the drug works however, I have developed Kidney Stones. I guess I am one of the few that do but I did therefore, I am seeking other drugs. As most have stated, my taste changed and anything with carbonation was terrible for the longest time. I eventually pushed through the changes and now everything pretty much tastes the way it should be on the medicine. I have allergies so the headaches I experience are mostly caused by that (which is why I think I have been pushed up to 200mg a day). Just a forewarning to everyone... When they say drink water DRINK!"""
Migraine Prevention,6.0,"""I have been on Topiramate for just over a year. I have suffered from migraines for more than 30 years and have been on Imatrix and Relpax before. Topiramate was awesome, at first. It reduced the frequency of migraines and kept things really under control. I lost approx. 20 lbs within 4 months of being on the drug (my normal weight is approx. 140 lbs) hadn't been down to 120lbs since high school so was feeling pretty good about myself. I did have some minor side affects like blurred vision and tingling in my hands that spread to my feet but this was worth not having migraines. More serious problems arose, however, after being on the drug 10-11 months when I developed kidney problems-stones and infections in both kidneys. Warning!"""
Bulimia,6.0,"""I was on Topamax 2x 50 mg worked perfect for 31 days, then the effect wore off, now I am on day 3, Dr. Increased dosage 100mg 2x per day, works perfect.

Migraine Prevention,6.0,"""I have been taking Topimax off and on for 10 years. After having cancer and eventually neck surgery I had severe head aches. I was finally prescribed Topimax. I started at a low dose. My neurologist kept upping my amount until we found the right amount I needed to work for me. It is a miracle drug for me, I tried everything! Nothing else worked for my head aches. The weight loss is a great bonus! The side affects do go away, I say trry it, you can always stop taking it if needed.  I am currently at 300 mlg daily. I just started again wish me luck!"""

Over the years (I'm now 55) I have tried many drugs for the treatment of or prevention of migraines. I get the classic vascular migraine with an aura each time I get a migraine. I finally was prescribed Topamax as a preventative, the final dose that worked was 75mg in am and 75mg in pm.  My migraines went from daily to MAYBE once a month. I took this for 3 years at least. I was just at the point of quitting it when I lost my job so I had no choice. The reason I was quitting it was that I lost SO MUCH WEIGHT that I looked anorexic!

I discontinued Topamax because it slowly got to the point where I could not remember something for an hour. Topamax also was causing erectile dysfunction problems for the last 3 years.

The tingling in the hands and feet went away completely after a few weeks on the final dose. but the mental fog is a side effect that stayed.  I still have trouble concentrating and remembering things, especially details & sometimes have trouble finishing a sentence.

Bipolar Disorder,5.0,"""I have taken this for about a year. I have lost about 40 lbs. I am taking it to help depressed moods. I also have to take the brand and not the generic. I will have late onset asthma with the generics and other unpleasant side effects. I tried more than once to use generics but it won't work. So , give it a try if you can afford the brand name. IT makes a big difference. I also found that all my migraines disappeared while taking this. What a relief that was. """
Migraine Prevention,5.0,"""At first it seemed to make the migraines not so unbearable. The weight loss was nice too! It did make me drowsy at first.

Ultimately I didn't think the benefits were worth the side effects. Everyone is different."""
Migraine Prevention,5.0,"""It lessened the frequency of my migraines. But the side effects are not worth the relief it provided. It turned me into a zombie. I didn't care about anything. I couldn't even taste my food! And the worst part was it robbed me of my ability to be alarmed by the growing severity of my depression and other serious symptoms. After three months, I was GLAD to detox. 4 days clean and I can almost taste sugar again. Can't wait til the brain fog lifts."""

I have suffered from almost daily migraines since I was 6 years old and have always resorted to OTC medicines to ""attempt"" to ease the pain. I have taken Imitrex to combat the pain and even resorted to Valium to knock myself out and sleep through it. When I heard about Topamax I was elated and it really does work at preventing migraines. However, within a few days I developed some side effects ranging from annoying to considering whether I should go to the ER: burning/stinging sensation when drinking soda, tingling feet, nausea, weight loss, memory loss, irregular heartbeat and passing out. I can't function like that. """
Migraine Prevention,5.0,"""This medicine did reduce the frequency of my migraines. However, it caused severe memory loss, problems with concentration, and an inability to remember certain words.

I'm off the pills now and looking for a different option; there is no way I can keep my job in tech support if I start the pills again. """
Migraine Prevention,5.0,"""I used Topamax for less than a year. I loved it for the first 7 months because it got rid of my headaches and reduced my appetite.

I was taking 600 mg of Topamax which sounds like more than a lot of people but I found out online that many other people experienced the same symptoms on lower doses.

After various conversative methods which included Vitamin D 5000mg, it was suggested that I cease the Topiramate as a process of eliminating things.

Bulimia,4.0,"""As I type this it is hard to relay it understandably because of the Topamax. I researched Topamax and heard it suppressed eating and stabilized mood which I figured would helped my bulimia, which I have been getting help for and am in recovery for. The Topamax definitely suppresses the desire to eat and have cravings which is great. You do lose weight. However, it created other problems. I didn't realize it but I was increasingly having a harder time talking to people. I can't do homework, write papers, and my relationship with my boyfriend- we ended breaking up. My hair falls out. I had bad anxiety, I thought I was going insane. I then researched side effects of Topamax and now realized this is what I am experiencing. I'm getting off."""

I developed a 9mm kidney stone when I had no prior history. I developed a blood disorder (something acidosis, was told this was a rare side effect, but that was why I stopped taking it.

Normally I wouldnt complain, however it was always on my mind.I think the hardest thing about the med was the appetite suppression for me. I was down to eating one meal a day, which ultimately let to me not loosing any weight which I can say was very difficult for me. I had increased irritability, and I felt overly fatigued. I am also on Citalopram, which is a terrible combination if you're prone to fatigue."""

He is taking me off of it because it's doing nothing for the migraines. I gave it a 3 more for the lack of help for the migraines versus the side effects, since I'm not sure if it's the drugs, the Lupus, or something else.

I didn't loose any weight, but what I did loose was the ability to remember sharp details that I would have been able to before, I would loose feeling in my feet, my legs, my handson, and my arms, and in the worst of it the dizziness got so severe that my vision blacked out.

The only side effects so far were frequent urination, mild leg pain/numbness, and eye sensitivity. By the third day, my eyes were so sensitive, I was constantly squinting and felt like I needed to wear sunglasses indoors. My vision has always been great and now I was having a hard time seeing clearly. In all the reviews I had seen, I never read about anyone having vision problems after taking this.

I was extremely lethargic and had trouble climbing a flight of stairs without getting winded.  I was having sharp pains throughout my body (breasts, stomach & back).

I had also lost 20lbs in a 3 week period, but had not noticed a change in my appetite. I am very fit and eat 5-6 times a day to keep up with my metabolism and workouts, so the weight loss was extremely irritating, considering it was nothing but lean tissue.

I began taking biotin and vitamins, but hair still kept coming out and scalp was starting to show more. I stopped completely and only lasted 4 days before a migraine wanted to come on.

It did not affect my eating habits or energy levels, did not affect my weight at all. It also did nothing for my migraines. It severely impeded my ability to think and thus my ability to work in the tech field, so I stopped taking it, and my work performance improved drastically."""
Bipolar Disorder,1.0,"""I am bipolar ii with anxiety and depression but was put on topomax because I suffer from migraines. The first time was before I was diagnosed and I got severely depressed and had a suicide attempt. Within a week of getting taken off of it I was better. The second time I was put on it was after I was diagnosed and put on mood stabilizers and my doctor wanted to try it again because he thought my depression may have been from my bpd not the meds and it really did help my migraines. Same exact thing happened. Within a few weeks of being on it my mild bipolar disorder was uncontrollable. I wish I could be on it because it really helped my head and counteracted weight gain from my other meds but my body just cannot handle it."""

MY LONG BLONDE HAIR was clogging the drain every day in the shower! Long story short, what's the point in being skinny if your bald? I HAD pretty hair, now 3/4 of it's gone and still not growing back! Makes me wonder what other damage it's done.  Not worth it!!"""
Migraine Prevention,1.0,"""I felt compelled to write a review, as I was on topamax (or should I say dopamax?!) for about 2 years. I started this medication when I was 21 and was so desperate to find something that would actually help my on-going migraines. Personally, the side effect symptoms FAR outweighed the benefits. I started out on 25mg a day and gradually increased to 100mg. As soon as I got on this, the side effects came rolling in. Before I knew it my memory was completely gone. In daily conversation I couldn't think of simple words, names or phrases. I knew what I wanted to say but couldn't form the words to do so. The worst of all, it really affected my grades in college. I used to have awesome memorization skills. Unfortunately I would study for hours upon hours, and still wouldn't do well as I would have ""brain fog"" during tests, etc. Another side effect I experienced was weight loss. I lost around 25 lbs., HOWEVER I don't believe all of this was ultimately from topamax. I'd definitely say it suppressed my appetite, but I really changed my eating habits and worked out daily. It helped with my first few pounds and got me motivated to do the rest. On the plus side, I saw a significant difference in the amount of migraines I received. It was a night and day difference in that aspect. However, approaching a year and a half on this medication I couldn't take it anymore and had to get off. It wasn't worth it anymore. I don't think tapering off or stopping cold turkey on this really makes a difference. My mom stopped cold turkey and I tapered off, as my doctor instructed me. I rebounded off this HORRIBLY, as did my mom. I was STARVING constantly after no longer taking it. This didn't just go away either. My body didn't feel levelled out and ""detoxed"" of this for honestly about a year after. I not only gained back all my weight I lost, but plus some. Although everyone's body reacts differently, I highly do NOT recommend taking this. Not even for those desperate for weight loss. Losing weight from a medication like this is not sustainable long term. I'm 24 now and am still affected by my choice of taking this. Topamax has ultimately ruined my memory to this day. I still cannot remember words or things. It changed me. Do not take this! There are other answers out there."""

A week before my apt while at work I started stuttering really bad and just couldn't put my sentences together and was very out of it.

Plus it makes you forget words!  I know another girl at work who went on this and she's fine!  I guess I just couldn't tolerate it.

Prior to taking this medicine I was at the top of my game. Now I feel helpless and the doctors were no help. My vision changed after it, mind you I had lasik eye surgery and could see perfectly fine prior to this.

By afternoon of that day, I knew that it was the medication. I had pressure in my head, tachycardia, nausea. This is about the worst I have ever felt.

My anxiety was the worst it had ever been and I was slipping into a depression. I had no idea what was wrong g with me. The VA gave me (a person who suffers from anxiety) a medication that makes you stupid, and wrecked havoc on my mind without warning me about any potential side effects.

At first carbonated sodas tasted flat so I stopped drinking them, but I found the trick to overcoming that one.  If I drink them fast I get the carbonated sensation. I still do not drink very many though. Over time the tingling in my hands and face subsided. The one side effect that bothers me the most is my intolerance to heat.

It helped only during the first few months, but now I get just as many migraines as before."""
Obesity,,"""I just was prescribed topomax for migraines  today. I take 50mg at night for 2 weeks then 50mg in the morning and 50 mg at night for a total of 100 mg..I'm 5'3"" and weigh 157 lbs and have gotten really out of shape since having 6 abdominal surgeries for hernia repairs...I've read a lot of the reviews on here and I hope I have good experience with loosing weight. I am curious about the tingling fingers, toes, lips and the ""word vomit"" that is another side effect do they go away eventually or is it something that stays the whole time"""
Seizure Prevention,,"""I hate the side effects but it controls my seizures."""
Bulimia,,"""Update: this is an update to the previous review, see below. I have been on topiramate and 20 mg prozac since 3 plus years now. I have been tapering on and off all meds and have to say the combo 20 mg prozac with 100 mg topiramate twice daily  does work best. It is not perfect, but I am better. Since I am still quite symptomatic I will have an upcoming visit yet another psychiater who is screening ,me for adult add. There is a possibility that if this is the case a stimulant might actually help me out (after 35 years of treatment refractory anorexia and bulimia nervosa). I keep updated."""
Obesity,,"""I suffer from depression, bipolar, and anxiety and believe me it is a struggle. I always had a perfect 10 body weighing at 112 now 175 at 5'2 then I was put on Abilify to add to my other meds. My doctor weaned me off the abilify and put me on Topomax for mood swings and to loose weight. I am on 50mg at night. Within 2 weeks if I don't see a change she will bump my dosage up. I am praying that it works for me. The struggle is real and I feel for everybody going through this pain. I want to wish everyone good luck and a happy new year! I will keep you all posted"""
Seizure Prevention,,"""First off my dosage 200mg twice a day, 26 yo male. It's works, in fact the only anti-seizure medication that has worked for me. I have noticed weight loss of 15 to 20lbs under my natural weight (135 to 155 at 5'11"") from being on the meds to off (but that could be lack of exercise). Other than that keeps me going in my daily life. Just don't miss too many."""
Obesity,,"""I started a very low dose of Topiramate to help prevent my frequent migraines. I did notice a decrease in frequency but my weight has SKYROCKETED! I've always battled to stay at my ideal weight. I am a gym rat and an avid walker, walking everyday of the week at least for an hour. I've gained 35 lbs in six months. I've tried every diet in the book, gone to every doctor and gotten every blood test. Everything is fine except now I'm getting a fatty liver because of my weight gain! I don't drink and eat super well. I didn't wear shorts once last summer because I was so embarrassed. The only thing I can think of is this drug. To me, I'd rather have more migraines (thankfully triptans work for me) than be obese. Can't take it anymore. Going off!"""
Migraine Prevention,,"""I went to the Neurologist & she ordered an MRI & when the results came back she said I had Migraine headaches.  So she put me on Topiramate 25mg & I have been on this medicine for the past week & it's a wonder drug for my Migraines!  I have not lost weight but the pain is now gone!!"""
Obesity,,"""I am about to start taking the topiramate starting on monday september 19th along with phentermine, I will let you know how it turns out"""
Migraine Prevention,,"""The side effects outweighed the Wonderful absence of migraines.  I did not remember most things I was told.  I couldn't remember words, was in a constant fog, hardly smiled or laughed anymore. After I get over these odd ""withdrawal"" symptoms all will be back to normal. """
Obesity,,"""I have not lost any weight on this medication. It has been about six weeks. I started at 25mg and am now at 100mg. I am very discouraged. But at least I know now why my feet tingle. Does anyone else have leg pain?"""
Obesity,,"""I take topiramate and phentermine together and it works great I lost 50 pounds in 5 months taking them in the morning I have no appetite all day and night I have to force myself to eat and I eat what I want but not a lot of it. My side effect is dry mouth. I was on Qysmia which is those two drugs combined but very expensive and the insurance won't cover it."""
Migraine Prevention,,"""Your experiences helped me a lot.  This is my 3rd day on Topamax at 25mg at bedtime and the only side effect I'm experiencing is nausea. I'm also looking forward to the weight loss! Would love to lose 15 pounds."""
Seizure Prevention,,"""Have been on it for two weeks now, lost 20 lbs, had two episodes. Have short term memory loss, can't think of words, tired all the time, feel like I can't function at work. On 50 mg in the morning and at night (100 mg a day), going up to 150 a day, increasing to 100mg at night. Having problems sleeping at night. I'm getting used to the side effects though. They get better with time, I guess just hang in there. The weight loss is a big plus, I have no appetite at all, I have to make myself eat. Confusion is a big problem, I'm not driving now."""
Bipolar Disorder,,"""Good so far."""
Migraine Prevention,,"""This is my first time taking them I already feel the tingling in my face hands and feet. This is a scary feeling  and just by reading the reviews I'm already thinking of not continuing this medication, I'm all for weight loss but hair loss and memory loss OMG that's to much, I just want to feel better I've been battling migraine headaches since middle school and now I'm 33 something has to give."""
Migraine Prevention,,"""I started topamax about 4 weeks ago for consistent, daily ""addle-brained"" headaches. Before that I was taking Depakote but I had gained a lot of weight. The topamax seems to be working well but I am doing very silly things, like throwing my wash in the trash and getting very emotional over the silliest things. Also, difficulty in speaking."""
Migraine Prevention,,"""Hi I have taken topamax for almost a year, not only is it expensive, my husband wanted me to stop taking it. He said I was acting like a witch, and I did not notice any change in my migraines just weight loss. I also had difficulty speaking and could not think of what I wanted to say. I no longer take it but I am still looking for something to help with my migraines."""
Migraine Prevention,,"""My current dosage is 100mg daily. I started at 113 pounds, today I weigh 100 pounds due to Topamax. Yes, I agree with everyone in the beginning the side effects were the worst. However, my doctor warned me that I would not feel relief until I reached my full dosage and my body adjusted to it, which was about 12 weeks. And I did see a difference. Before Topamax, migraines controlled my life, I had roughly 15 a month. With the Topamax I rarely have a severe migraine at all. Typically I just get 5-7 headaches a month which is a big difference. Yes, sometimes I forget my train of thought or tingly in my feet. However, those side effects beat the alternative to 50% of my life being controlled by severe migraines."""
,,"""My neurologist started me off on 75mg a day. I started with migraines about 2 months ago. I have never suffered from migraines before. Topamax has helped me quite a bit with the pain but I'm still new to the drug so I will keep you guys updated. I hope I can lose some extra baggage I have too. I have some tingling in my hands and feet. I get tired during the day too. I forget some words and my communication has decreased somewhat. But it's okay. I am not feeling the pain I was feeling before Topamax."""
Obesity,,"""I am 36 years old woman and I am currently suffering from fibromyalgia and Moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnea. I have gain approximately 92 lbs since 2012 and I am currently 230lbs. I am so depressed over my weight and have tried diets and exercise but with my illnesses and medication I'm always at a loss. I am currently taking gabapentin for my fibromyalgia symptoms which encourages weight gain. On Friday September 4th my neurologist started me on topiramate 25mg for weight loss. I am really hoping it will work for me as I am eager to be at a healthier weight again plus look like my old self. Does anyone uses this combination of medicine if yes how has it worked for you. A medication that promotes weight gain and on that promotes weight loss"""
Bipolar Disorder,,"""Do not take with Stay Slim Appetite Suppressant or you will have diarrhea."""
