Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,10.0,"""I was diagnosed with RSD on Tuesday. The doctor prescribed me Gabapentin. I'm only taking 1 pill per day for the first week, then taking 2 a day for a week, then moving up to 3 per day. So far, after only taking this pill once a day for 4 days I have seen a huge improvement with my affected foot. My range of motion has increased (with the help of physical therapy) and the constant burning pain has gone down from a pain level of 5 to a 2! The crazy electrical ""zaps"" and ""zings"" have been happening less and are not as intense. I feel way more calm and confident mentally and emotionally. However, the tissue, muscle, and deep bone aches are still severe, but I'm hoping that will subside as I start to raise my dosage. I like these pills so far!""",0.0729938271605,Gabapentin,0

Anxiety,10.0,"""I have had periodic depression for years, and general anxiety problems as well, lately they had been getting worse.

I cannot tolerate the SSRI anti-depressants, can't even tell any effect when I take Buspar, was taking Clonazepam when things got really bad.

I went back to see a Dr. I have great respect for, had another QEEG, he said I have a ""fast brain"" (Gross CNS hyperarousal).

Started me on 300 mg Gabapentin at bedtime.  Noticed a calming, mellowing effect the first day.

Before I could not stop my mind from racing, from obsessing, and would get almost paralyzed to do anything.

I feel so much better, my mind is calm, depression is lifted, and no side effects other than a very, very slight fogginess.

So far, for me - amazing.""",0.0705555555556,Gabapentin,0

I have Lupus which has caused me to have horrible pains to where I can't sleep.
I now can sleep through the night because of this med. I was on 400 mg of methadone and I still had pain. So, the doctor added gabapentin and started to taper the methadone. I am now only on gabapentin and it is wonderful.

My dentist lets me cancel & reschedule if I'm having a flare. I even have some Emla cream to put carefully on the facial area that is most sensitive. There is also something called Warm Skin that a person can use in the winter, if you live in a cold region. That helps, too.

I did notice a few pounds packed on, and a bit of a blur in my eye with the new lens implant.  Now that I know it is the gabapentin putting the weight on, I can be more careful as I want to maintain my figure.  Lyrica made me nuts and I had terrible mood swings.

Anyway, the very first time I applied the lotion to the feet the pain, which was so severe I would cry in agony, dissipated rapidly and was gone within 15 minutes. I use

An accident last summer caused me great nerve pain and in the fall I was put on Gabapentin for this nerve pain in my arm from my elbow dislocation.

However, I too take pain medicine, which I prefer not to. Vicodin, Norco, Percocet, tramadol and now Gabapentin. Which really works! Very well. Helps the anxiety pain puts you through.

Knowing what I know now, I wish with all my being it had never ever been prescribed to me, and without the absurd nonchalance dozens of practitioners have portrayed. 
I'm 32 and have been prescribed clonazopam for 14 years. Ive been in situations where my health insurance is in transition and I must go off the medication abruptly-- this is when I realized how deep I was. Weeks upon weeks of non stop physical, emotional, and psychological withdrawal effects that are like hell. Words cannot accurately describe just how awful it is. This, again, has been my experience during withdrawal as a long term clonazopam patient. 
All skin, especially the face, becomes numb. Vision gets fuzzy and difficult to see clearly. Panic attacks become extremely exasperated, frequent and debilitating. Severe irritability. Worst of all: a terrifying disconnection between your mind and body; as if you're an onlooker watching and feeling this horrible thing happen to you, but not actually feeling connected to any of it-- that one is tough to explain. All of this... It can lasts months, maybe more. That's right. Not just some one week hump to overcome. 
After finding how awful the withdrawal is I've been attempting to ween very very slowly down from 3 2mg doses per day to eventually zero, hopefully. After six months of gradually decreases in dose I'm now at 2- 1mg doses per day and I'm not sure how or if I can go much less than that. No doctors I've had have been of any help. The ween down was my idea and the rate of it was also my idea based on experience. It sure would be nice to meet a doctor that truly had knowledge of this withdrawal syndrome and took it a bit more seriously. I am confident that the medication is no longer treating my anxiety disorder, but simply preventing withdrawal from the meds themselves. And there don't seem to be any good alternatives. It's a long road ahead, please think it over and over with someone knowledgeable before being so quick to embrace this miracle drug.

In fact - though I wasn't depressed per se - I subjectively experienced the lessening of my anxiety as positive and consequently my mood improved.

I prefer Klonopin to Xanax or Ativan because it lasts longer (up to 12 hours) and I don't feel the craving between doses. Withdrawal from clonazepam is not as hard as some people say, it must be gradual. If that doesn't work, ask your physician to switch clonazepam to its equivalent in diazepam.

It did not affect my eating habits or energy levels, did not affect my weight at all. It also did nothing for my migraines.

Migraine Prevention,1.0,"""I felt compelled to write a review, as I was on topamax (or should I say dopamax?!) for about 2 years. I started this medication when I was 21 and was so desperate to find something that would actually help my on-going migraines. Personally, the side effect symptoms FAR outweighed the benefits. I started out on 25mg a day and gradually increased to 100mg. As soon as I got on this, the side effects came rolling in. Before I knew it my memory was completely gone. In daily conversation I couldn't think of simple words, names or phrases. I knew what I wanted to say but couldn't form the words to do so. The worst of all, it really affected my grades in college. I used to have awesome memorization skills. Unfortunately I would study for hours upon hours, and still wouldn't do well as I would have ""brain fog"" during tests, etc. Another side effect I experienced was weight loss. I lost around 25 lbs., HOWEVER I don't believe all of this was ultimately from topamax. I'd definitely say it suppressed my appetite, but I really changed my eating habits and worked out daily. It helped with my first few pounds and got me motivated to do the rest. On the plus side, I saw a significant difference in the amount of migraines I received. It was a night and day difference in that aspect. However, approaching a year and a half on this medication I couldn't take it anymore and had to get off. It wasn't worth it anymore. I don't think tapering off or stopping cold turkey on this really makes a difference. My mom stopped cold turkey and I tapered off, as my doctor instructed me. I rebounded off this HORRIBLY, as did my mom. I was STARVING constantly after no longer taking it. This didn't just go away either. My body didn't feel levelled out and ""detoxed"" of this for honestly about a year after. I not only gained back all my weight I lost, but plus some. Although everyone's body reacts differently, I highly do NOT recommend taking this. Not even for those desperate for weight loss. Losing weight from a medication like this is not sustainable long term. I'm 24 now and am still affected by my choice of taking this. Topamax has ultimately ruined my memory to this day.

It does permanent brain aging  , you will be confused and have terrible memory the rest of your life and this problem becomes very clear to you when you quit.

I did for 5 years now and still can't function
 

That is when you can quit because this drug is highly addictive and the withdrawal when you decide to quit is stuff out of nightmares.

I got my Lyrica back today and waiting to see if my symptoms improve. I know now that it was working very well because I feel the difference being off of it for the last month.

Neuropathic Pain,,"""I was prescribed Lyrica for small fiber neuropathy pain. I will say it did offer relief from the pain but the side effects were just too great and at times dangerous. You should not be driving a car on this stuff. I was in an accident because I was slow to reaction in a high stress traffic situation. You will eventually begin to feel quite unlike yourself. Zombie like. You will say to yourself,  I don't feel like me anymore I feel like something is controlling me. If you're someone who can stay home all the time and has very little work demands, or family life this may be helpful to you.

Lyrica helped immediately with all of my pain; with the numbness from thoracic outlet syndrome, and it has a surprisingly positive psychological effect.  Due to other meds, or psychological issues, I have trouble focusing, making decisions, carrying on conversation, and moving forward with decisions.
