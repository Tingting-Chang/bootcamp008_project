The stock made big gains Thursday in its first day on the Mexican market, overcoming a weak peso and anti-Mexico rhetoric from President Trump. The stock was up 5% in morning trading.  The initial public offering was reportedly delayed twice last year.  Trump floated the idea of a 20% tariff on goods imported from Mexico to pay for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.
