["TamingnewsItem","Projected No. 1 overall pick Myles Garrett created quite a stir on Friday when he pleaded to Jerry Jones in a video to . The former Texas A&M Aggie asked the Cowboys owner to make the jump from 28 to 1 so that he could stay in Texas, but that trade is easier said than done.Regardless of how outlandish and unrealistic his request was, fans still took it to heart. And as a result, Garrett had to clear things up to ensure everyone he wasn't taking a shot at the Browns.Garrett said he was \"definitely\" taken back by the national attention it received, and by the way everyone took his request so seriously. He's made it clear in the past that he's a Cowboys fan, considering he grew up in Texas, so his declaration should come as no surprise.Despite wanting to stay in Texas as a pro, Garrett doesn't mind heading up north to Cleveland where it'll be significantly colder and  less successful. He cleared up his comments from the video where he said \"I'd like to not go anywhere cold.\"Garrett concluded his explanation by saying \"take a joke, people,\" ensuring everyone that he was kidding about the whole premise. Even if he wasn't, the Cowboys probably don't even have enough firepower -- Tony Romo included -- to trade up to No. 1 and keep Garrett in Texas.","Published\n\t\t            February 12, 2017","http:\/\/feeds.foxnews.com\/foxnews\/sports","http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/sports\/2017\/02\/12\/myles-garrett-downplays-video-plea-to-cowboys-jerry-jones-take-joke-people.html","job-152791-3-23",1486920229535.0,"foxbasic","Fox NewsMyles Garrett downplays video plea to Cowboys' Jerry Jones: 'Take a joke, people'",-1094476033]
