The recruits, including three sets of siblings as well as five women, were enrolled at Sudan\u2019s University of Medical Sciences and Technology in Khartoum studying to be doctors dentists and pharmacists.Most of the students were of British-Sudanese origin.Sudan is one of seven countries named under a travel ban to the U.S. by US President Donald Trump, just weeks after the outgoing Obama administration had said it would lift sanctions against the North African nation in response to the country\u2019s fight against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups.British authorities believe the recruits entered Islamic State territories in phases beginning March 2015, and most have been deployed by ISIS in medical facilities controlled by the group in Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, Syria and Mosul, Iraq.In total, 27 UMST students and graduates are believed to have joined ISIS with at least six reported dead.
