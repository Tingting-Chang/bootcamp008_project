["TamingnewsItem","Amid mounting concerns over recent terror attacks in the City of Lights, Paris has announced that it will construct a bulletproof, glass wall around the Eiffel Tower as part of multi-million dollar plan to protect the iconic monument.Upon completion of the eight-foot glass barrier, visitors will no longer be able to stroll under the tower and tourists will have to pass through security checks regardless of whether they plan to enter the monument itself, according to\u00a0.\u00a0Currently, the Eiffel Tower is surrounded by a metal fence, introduced prior to the Euro 2016 soccer tournament.The new wall will run along Quai Branly and Avenue Gustave-Eiffel, bisecting the small parks on both sides of the monument.The wall, which is expected to be complete this fall, is estimated to cost over $21 million.The new wall isn't the only upgrade coming to Paris' most iconic metal monument. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo has announced plans to invest over $300 million over the next 15 years to improve tourists\u2019 experiences at the famed monument.\u00a0The proposed upgrades aim to help reduce lengthy lines by creating new welcome areas and better systems for managing peak times. Other enhancements include new sparkly lights for the tower's nightly show, new paint and some extensive cleaning to help modernize the second level of the tower. The Eiffel Tower currently receives over seven million visitors annually.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0","Published\n\t\t            February 09, 2017","http:\/\/feeds.foxnews.com\/foxnews\/internal\/travel\/mixed","http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/travel\/2017\/02\/09\/paris-unveils-plans-to-secure-eiffel-tower-with-bulletproof-glass-wall.html","job-152791-3-21",1486861492249.0,"foxbasic","Fox NewsParis unveils plans to secure Eiffel Tower with bulletproof glass wall",-1079707056]
