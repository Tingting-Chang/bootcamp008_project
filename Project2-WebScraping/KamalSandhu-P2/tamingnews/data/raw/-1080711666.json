["TamingnewsItem","President Trump on Wednesday brought the legal dispute over his immigration executive order into the court of public opinion, using a Washington law enforcement address to mount an urgent defense of the measure and urge the federal courts to reinstate it.\u00a0At a meeting with local sheriffs and police chiefs, the president said he issued the immigration order \u201cfor the security of our nation and so that people come in who aren't going to do us harm.\u201d He added that the order was written simply and \u201cso beautifully.\u201d\u201cA bad high school student would understand this,\u201d he said.\u00a0He spoke after a hearing late Tuesday during which the Justice Department presented its arguments to the San Francisco-based 9\u00a0Circuit Court of Appeals. The DOJ is fighting to overturn a Seattle judge\u2019s decision to halt the controversial order that suspended the U.S. refugee program and immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries: Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan.\u00a0Trump said he listened to the judges Tuesday and, while vowing not to comment specifically on the hearing, added: \u201cI watched last night in amazement and I heard things I couldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\u201cIf they wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they\u2019d be doing what they should be doing.\u201d\u00a0Supporters of Trump's order say it will help keep America safe from terrorists looking to infiltrate the United States from terror hotspots that often have inadequate vetting procedures. Opponents have argued it is unconstitutional and discriminatory \u2013 claiming that it is a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201dTrump has waded into the legal battle before, largely on Twitter. He recently called the judge who halted the order, James Robart, a \u201cso-called judge\u201d and earlier Wednesday warned on Twitter that \u201cIf the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled.\u201dAt the meeting with police chiefs, he indicated he would be ready to criticize the appeals court if it ruled against his administration.\"I don't ever want to call a court biased, so I won\u2019t call it biased and we haven\u2019t had a decision yet, but courts seem to be so political,\" he said. \u201cIt would be so great for our justice system if they were able to read a statement and do what\u2019s right and that\u2019s to do with the security of our nation, which is so important.\u201d","Published\n\t\t            February 08, 2017",null,null,"job-152791-3-11",1486570386001.0,"foxbasic","Fox NewsTrump mounts public defense of immigration order, blasts \u2018political\u2019 courts",-1080711666]
