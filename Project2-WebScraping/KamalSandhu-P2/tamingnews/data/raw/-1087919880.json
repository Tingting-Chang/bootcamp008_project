["TamingnewsItem","The Kansas City Chiefs have a handful of big decisions to make this offseason with regards to their pending free agents. Eric Berry and Dontari Poe are both set to hit free agency, and it's unlikely the Chiefs will be able to keep both.In addition to deciding on those players, they'll have to figure out where Jamaal Charles fits in with their future.The reason Charles' roster spot is even in question is because of his contract, and his inability to stay on the field. He'll be owed more than $6.1 million if he's on the Chiefs' roster next season, whereas the team can save $5.9 million if they release him.It's the final year of his contract anyway, which should make the decision much easier to make.In the last two seasons, Charles has played just eight games. The Chiefs have been wildly successful without him on the field, which is also a factor. In all likelihood, the Chiefs will move on from Charles this offseason, or at least try to restructure his contract to keep him on a lesser number.On the flip side, Dorsey was very committal when talking about Alex Smith as the starter.\"We've said all along he's the starter.\" - Chiefs GM John Dorsey on Alex Smith. Cited how he's led team to playoffs 3 of past 4 years.There's not much reason to believe the Chiefs will move on from Smith this offseason, but with Tony Romo, Jay Cutler and Jimmy Garoppolo potentially becoming available, there will be options out there.","Published\n\t\t            February 09, 2017","http:\/\/feeds.foxnews.com\/foxnews\/sports","http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/sports\/2017\/02\/09\/chiefs-gm-non-committal-on-jamaal-charles-future-with-team.html","job-152791-3-15",1486687553954.0,"foxbasic","Fox NewsChiefs GM non-committal on Jamaal Charles' future with the team",-1087919880]
