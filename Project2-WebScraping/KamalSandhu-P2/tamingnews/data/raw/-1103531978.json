Today, it is more popular than it has ever been.The Real Clear Politics  on approval for the law shows opposition down 11 points in the last year and the latest Fox News  support for the law actually outpacing opposition by 4 points.What had been a thrice-successful election strategy for Republicans has turned into a policy millstone for the GOP at the very moment the party assumes total control of Washington.So what gives?It\u2019s only February and we are already hearing at least the fourth iteration of the party\u2019s strategy for when to repeal and replace the law. Not the actual contents of the replacement mind you, but just the question of to break ground on the project., who campaigned ferociously against the law, stunned casual observers when in his  after winning the White House said he wanted to maintain some key components.Then, House Speaker  unveiled a plan that essentially called for repealing the law immediately but delaying its removal for years while Republicans sorted out their specific replacement. Given Trump\u2019s  that there be no disruptions in coverage for any beneficiaries of the existing law, it seemed to many like the only reasonable means of escape.The delayed replacement plan was of particular political appeal since it would allow Republicans to keep their promise to base voters by voting to \u201crepeal\u201d the law but not open themselves up to Democratic attacks over lost coverage. It would be the reverse of what Democrats did in imposing the law: eat dessert first and wait to eat your veggies.But, just as \u201crepeal and replace\u201d seemed to have given way to \u201crepeal and eventually replace,\u201d conservatives in Congress kicked up a godawful racket about a bait-and-switch, alleging that the leadership would either never get around to replacing or wait until a time when Republicans had less political leverage and use that to cram down conservative demands.Sen. , R-Ky., led the charge on the right against symbolic repeal and eventual replacement and  Trump to the cause. And the next week, Trump  for concurrent repeal and replacement and doing so \u201cvery quickly.\u201d Or so it seemed.Ryan, accordingly, turned the ship about and days later promised that the House would meet the demands of the conservatives, now backed by Trump, and . It was a huge legislative marker and one that Ryan acknowledged would wipe out hopes for quick action on other priorities.Those priorities include two of Trump\u2019s favorites aimed at kick-starting the economy: big tax cuts and a deficit-fueled $1 trillion infrastructure package. Ryan said  that those big ticket items would have to wait until at least the spring as the House choked down the ObamaCare legislation.That all brings us to the president\u2019s interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly that aired ahead of the Super Bowl. Asked about repealing and replacing, Trump  that the replacement process will be \u201cvery complicated\u201d and may stretch into 2018.And that\u2019s the year those on the right were worried about in the first place, since election-year pressures would make passage of a more conservative replacement \u2013 if any at all \u2013 less likely.Which brings us back to square one.After eight years of relentless focus on the issue, how can it be that Republicans are in such a quandary over what to do about the law? Let\u2019s go back to the stunning turnaround in those ObamaCare polls to explain why.ObamaCare was always mostly unpopular, but for different reasons. As , who is better at reading the crosstabs than picking football games,  a consistent component of the opposition was from the left \u2013 those who thought the law did not go .Republicans mostly imagined that ObamaCare opposition was monolithically opposed to the law as an expensive intrusion of the federal government. But there were consistently between 10 and 20 percent of folks who wanted the law to be more liberal than it was.What are those people going to say when the discussion shifts from replacing or changing ObamaCare under a Democratic administration to a Republican one? Given the choice between keeping something that in their minds doesn\u2019t go far enough or replacing it with something far more conservative, of course liberals would glom on to the law.And remember, this is all before the nitty gritty policy committee gets to the work of describing what is and isn\u2019t in the replacement plan. By the time Republicans are done, they could see their plan looking far worse than ObamaCare in polls. Remember, they\u2019ll be losing support among their base voters, just as  saw  and others attack his law from the left. No wonder the GOP is all tangled up.But while Republicans are dithering over when and how to do the deed, the decision may be made for them. As Trump pointed out in the interview, the law is already coming undone. Much of it stems from existing problems with the law, but  is also blowing up the abutments that are keeping ObamaCare alive. These decisions, made at the agency level, have set a countdown clock to doomsday.While the GOP is jabbering about the most politically advantageous time to act, the decision may be made for them. And the only thing worse than being seen as confused about something so important as Americans\u2019 health care is being unprepared in the face of a crisis you helped precipitate. \u201cThe powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0: \u201cSOMERVILLE, Mass. - Fluff turns 100 this year, and the marshmallow concoction that has been smeared on a century\u2019s worth of schoolchildren\u2019s sandwiches has inspired a festival and other sticky remembrances\u2026In 1917, Montreal-born confectioner   crafted the original recipe in his Somerville home. Query is said to have whipped up the first batches in his own kitchen before selling it door to door. Following World War I there was a sugar shortage in the U.S., so Query sold the recipe for $500 to two war veterans,  and . The recipe has stayed with Durkee Mower Inc. ever since. It\u2019s the only product the family-owned company makes. In 1920, Durkee and Mower began producing and selling Fluff, which they first named Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff. The company moved to a factory in East Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1929. The original recipe hasn\u2019t changed: corn syrup, sugar syrup, dried egg whites and vanillin.\u201d\u00a0Email us at\u00a0\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions: \u201cSeveral Republican lawmakers sought Sunday to distance themselves from President Trump\u2019s comments he made about Russian President Vladimir Putin, made during an\u00a0. Trump has long expressed his desire to mend the relationship with Russia. When told by O\u2019Reilly that the Russian leader is a \u201ckiller,\u201d Trump replied that the U.S. has killers too. \u2018What do you think?

A room full of troops in fatigues from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines awaited the president, who was scheduled to join them for lunch, along with senior members of his White House staff. At MacDill, the president is to be briefed by CENTCOM and SOCOM leaders, join troops for lunch and deliver a speech. Gen.  , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and  , Trump\u2019s national security adviser, were expected to attend the meetings.\u201d : \u201cDonald Trump's unpredictable foreign policy could hamper longstanding U.S. intelligence-sharing partnerships as countries react to a president who seeks closer ties to Russia and is unafraid to offend American allies by cracking down on immigration or getting angry with friendly leaders. Veteran spies say intelligence relationships are built to weather storms between political leaders. Even in the worst of times, allies share intelligence to thwart threats. But the lack of understanding about Trump's foreign policy direction and his potential new friendship with Moscow are creating jitters across the Western world.\u201d : \u201cAs an appeals court reviews his travel ban from seven Muslim countries, President Trump claimed Monday that the public is with him. \u2018Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election,\u2019 Trump tweeted. \u2018Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.\u2019 Polls are more equivocal on the Trump order that blocked travel from seven Muslim majority countries, causing delays,\u00a0long lines, and general chaos\u00a0at airports nationwide last month. After a federal judge in Seattle struck down the order, the Trump administration has appealed to the\u00a09th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\u2026\u201d: \u201cLawyers for Minnesota and Washington state told a federal appellate court Monday that it would \u2018unleash chaos\u2019 if it lifted an order temporarily halting President Trump\u2019s ban on refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslims countries from entering the U.S. The states said in briefs filed with the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Trump\u2019s travel ban harmed residents, businesses and universities and stated that the ban was unconstitutional. The legal maneuvers by the two states were accompanied by briefs filed by the technology industry arguing that the travel ban would harm their companies by making it more difficult to recruit employees. Tech giants Apple and Google, along with Uber, filed their arguments with the court late Sunday.\u201d Former Deputy Attorney General  , a Bush political appointee, says that although he supports broad use of executive action he questions Trump\u2019s knowledge of his Constitutional limits. : \u201cFaced with President Trump\u2019s executive orders suspending immigration from several Muslim nations and ordering the building of a border wall, and his threats to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, even , our nation\u2019s most ardent proponent of executive power, would be worried by now.\u201d \u201cNeeds to slow down on the gum chewing; way too many pieces in there\u201d \u2013         \u201cGood info but must take exception on two statements.\u00a0The election was not very winnable for Democrats. The people were tired and fed up with liberal politicians and Democrats had no desirable candidates to choose from. Also the statement that Trump\u2019s temporary ban on immigrants was unpopular is inaccurate.
