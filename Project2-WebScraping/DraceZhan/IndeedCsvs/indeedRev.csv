And they keep your tips.  Again work for Uber or Lyft you make more money hands down.  If you set it up right you make enough to quit your regular job. Don't work here not worth it.  My paper count was constantly off, I did not have enough newspapers to complete my route. Which cause me burn more fuel and waste more time.  They charge you 5.00 for complaints. Which is more than you make per paper.  I'm  so sorry I every work for this company as a independent contractor.XXX,It honored to work with this company. Friendly and helpful environment.XXX,Team lead, Ba, developer and UAT team are realy helpfull and professional.XXX,I learned alot from here.XXX,A typical work day was running the press line to produce newspaper, that were delivered to the DMV areas.

Good compensation with flexible hours.XXX,I work there for 25 years always have had a fun and friendly atmosphere, people willing to help, management style was helpful in developing and educating the junior staff.XXX,On a typical day at work, I have been learning new lessons to improve my skill.

But it is up to you, you might get a boost in your career after here for a while.XXX,My job is making sure people stat their day with a smile and a paper. Some even bring me snacks,coffee, things to read and I love playing with the little ones as they are on their way to school. My co-worker and I work together on the job and get the job done from 6am-10am. By me passing the paper out a lot of people ask me about the current events, sports and sales that are going on and also where's a good place to eat or a great movie or free show's for the weekendXXX,Working for the Washington Post was a great experience. I was basically my own boss. I like the job because I had certain responsibilities and no one really over me all day. I performed my work as asked and completed what I needed to do on time. I was also a warehouse manager and I distributed bundles on the weekend to the carriers and locked up when they left. Everyone's trust in me felt good and my dedication to my job was appreciated.XXX,Very good environment to work at, the management is so amazing. All team members are friendly.Indeed, I learnt so many things!!XXX,I started at the Post having worshiped the pape for years. I was hired to work in the advocacy/political advertising department. There was nearly 0 training and on boarding, even a ""boot camp"" was scant on actual direction. The person who was supposed to train me was unable to focus and all I heard from the rest of the department was that she was a walking disaster. XXX,After being there for less than a month, both of the senior sales reps for advocacy left and no one knew what they were doing. There was contention between the sales planning team and marketing and it was a hot mess. People would email you all night and over New Years week everyone went out of town and there was no one to ask questions of as a new employee. They abuse young workers in a fashion similar to how law firms treat new hires. Other than it being the Washington Post there were no possitives about this job. It was like dating a hot guy and being abused, but being like ""well he's hot"".XXX,job was great at first but it took its toll on you working 60-80 hours a week with very little sleep. it was great being my own boss and driving to deliver the newspapers in a peaceful atmosphere. It was great meeting new people as our area tripled.XXX,Working as a journalist was thrilling, fun, and rewarding. But the business model is broken and the industry is dying.XXX,Since the mid-2000s, the newspaper has undergone a series of buyouts, in which hundreds of the Post's most experienced writers and editors left. The paper has pushed out dozens more. The advent of the internet, which undercut the Post's advertising revenue, and some short-sighted business decisions are to blame.XXX,i was young when i was working here don't remember much of it a lot of cleaning i only made 15 dollars a day but i was 16 so i thought i was rich.XXX,Working at the Washington post was interesting and a fast pace environment.  Innovative and energetic are the words that comes to mind, when I think back on this company.XXX,Respond to customer help desk inquires both in writing and over the telephone.XXX,Trouble shoots digital product issues with readers and subscribers.XXX,Escalate reader issues to internal team via Parature as necessary as well as provide reporting for customer issue resolutions.XXX,Good Digital Experience. Learned a lot about the digital landscape and got to work with a lot of top clients. Ran marketing campaigns from start to finish.XXX,Loved working there. Great managers and co-workers. I added new skills to my resume, such as pre-flighting electronic files. The hardest part of the job was having to leave it via a lay-off. I would still work there if I could.XXX,I had to get up at 2 AM go to Waldorf and pick up my newspapers. I had to go over my list of changes and get them in order to the way I deliver my papers.Then I go deliver my papers. It didn't matter how many papers you had to deliver you had to be done by 6 AM the same morning. Sunday was the hardest day of the week because you had almost twice as many papers then you had thru the week. You still needed to be done by 7 AM the same morningXXX",,,"Fun place to workXXX,Flexible workXXX,Tuition reimbursementXXX,Remote work, Work from home, flexible timings, awesome culture and environementXXX,My customers bring me snacks, fruit, or watered.XXX,noneXXX,Being your own boss; growing your own business; and providing good customer serviceXXX,Working on great storiesXXX,A fun place and fast moving place to workXXX,I felt great pride working for a company that is so highly regarded in the industry.XXX,I had my days freeXXX","Paid only .10 per newspaper had to deliver 1000 newspaper to make hundred dollars a day, which would kill you transmission.XXX,NoneXXX,Mostly night work one had to work many years in night before get a day shiftXXX,Compensation, food (nothing is free)XXX,no lunch breaks, emails all night, no training, disorganizationXXX,Too many hours with very little sleepXXX,No job securityXXX,short breaksXXX,I didn't like the commute to and from work each day.XXX,I didn't like getting up at 2 AMXXX"

Friendly people from coworkers to management.  Management was very transparent with staff. Plus - catered lunches!

Medication were added, changed or dosages adjudged by the physician and I monitored weekly for any changes in behavior or side effects as well as teaching the patient and caregiver in regards to disease process.

The environment is great. There are no closed off offices, everyone is surrounded by other people.

Excellent exposure to industry professionals.XXX,Consultant role is more of a technology position than finance. You will be working with clients to help with research/problem solving from a technology standpoint and not from a strategic finance position.XXX,I worked at FactSet for 15+ years.  Was fiercely loyal, deflected competitors overtures for years. I worked up through several positions but not management, and did fairly well. XXX,One Friday this March, I was let go. I was told it was a reevaluation of company priorities,  future investment,  etc.  Reality was it was just cost cutting. I had grown too old and expensive,  and recent process improvements I had made to my product line basically ""improved"" myself out of a job.   XXX,I could have easily moved to another position.  When I questioned the reason for termination, noting the above, the director of product development actually sat there with a cocky grin on his face and said no can do.   Squirming to keep from wetting himself,  the coward jumped up and left me with the HR rep to finish it off.  No ""I'm sorry, this is hard in me as well"" or any of that nonsense.  XXX,I blame myself for being so loyal to a company for so long and not moving on sooner.  I had been so good at my job that I allowed myself to get pigeonholed into such a narrow role that I'm finding it almost impossible to convert into a new position. XXX,So in some regards, when I lose my house and my family is evicted,  I will place the blame on FactSet.  But on the flip side,  this experience has taught me to never be that loyal to another firm again.  I will only be focused on the job at hand, and will be constantly looking for that next position.

However, management did not have much of a presence.  There was no clear direction in regards to project management, which lent itself to ambiguity and inefficiency.XXX,People is expected to work 60-70 hours a week even though the company only pays 40 hours per week. Managers utilizes a micro-managing and fault-finding approach. Oncall rotation is not a real ""On call."" This is a poor excuse to make the engineers execute changes during the weekend and after hours during the week. Your weekend work is equal to 16-20 extra hours at least. Company does not pay overtime. Employees are not recognized for their extra efforts instead, they are treated as objects that belongs to them, therefore, you have to do what I want you to do.  There are not words to express the bullying approach used by managers to their employees.XXX,Consulting for FactSet Research Systems was my first job out of college and was the perfect gateway into the working world.  The company entrusted me with responsibility from day one and taught me how to be a working professional.  They provided me with growth opportunities and a great work life balance.XXX,My true passion was to become an investment professional and the knowledge I gained from working at FactSet opened the door for me to become one.XXX,Consulting role is merely customer-service and troubleshooting, with little or no true consultative, strategic work whatsoever.  Additionally, organizational claims to be 'flat' and entrepreneurial, yet management is not clear about professional development or expectations whilst there is virtually no autonomous work that outside of what you're micromanaged on.XXX,Overall good place to work. You are given interesting and ever-changing projects.XXX,The New York City office is in a good location and benefits are comparable to the industry standard!XXX,I liked the company, but unless you were a software engineer, you did not get all the great perks FactSet has to offer.

There was room for advancement and they always tried to prepare you for corporate American being that we did things different overseas.XXX,While CGI is a great company to work for with great people and great opportunities, there is a lack of communication throughout the company. XXX,I enjoy the networking that the company has to offer, and they provide tools to help you learn more about any technological field you set your mind to. XXX,However, the opportunity for growth/advancement is a joke. XXX,Under-qualified people get promoted, so in turn they are not much of a team player being that they do not understand a lot of process and procedures that the rest of the team knows.

It was a good company to work for with good benefits.  The health insurance leaves a lot to be desired, however all the other benefits are good.XXX,The department that I worked in was a diverse group of people doing various jobs, such as print operators, insert operators, clerks and warehouse workers.XXX,One of the offerings is the employee Social Club where a member decides if they would like to participate.

They paid well at the time and I enjoyed my experience there for the most part. I worked there during the economy crisis and being so it became almost cut throat. The pressures of making sales goals became a large amount of stress in my life. They threatened to take away bonuses and even fire employees for not making sales of bank accounts.

Great company culture who believes in creating a friendly, cohesive, team-oriented environment. A lot of my closest friends are my friends from work when I worked at BofA.

This is necessary, but it can also be overwhelming for some people.XXX,They have a ""people-oriented"" corporate culture.XXX,I enjoyed my entire time there.

They have a severe disconnect for what it is like to work as a rep in Technical Operations and thus do not offer any type of support or career development to move on further with your career. The pay scale here is horrible and offers ZERO transparency on why external hire that are new to the company receive a higher salary than a individual who works in the same role and has been there for years.XXX,Very nice people here. The place was one of my favorite places to work. People there always go above and beyond to help each other and always being polite. I just wish I could of be there longer. Project over and you move on in life.XXX,Great place to get started in any position. Not for long term as stress levels will increase in time. Department managers are chosen internally and typically understand 15% of the departments functions..this forces any good long term employees to move on, thus losing a valuable resources for the company.XXX,Great first job. Learned a lot and had a great training program. Management can be secretive at times. Not much room for growth or upward mobility. Great co-workers and fun place to work.XXX,A typical day would be to monitor the queue for incoming break fix tickets. These tickets range from service impacting high severity to low priority infrastructure work and operational updates. I've learned a wide variety of skills as diagnosing hardware issues, troubleshooting connection/link down events and also uploading and analyzing core/log files. Management can come down on you for small things, but that is because of Bloomberg is a multi-billion dollar company with potentially millions of dollars at risk. The hardest part of the job is multi tasking and handling multiple issues at once.  Bloomberg has certainly helped with pressure.  The most enjoyable part of the job is learning.  You can learn a little bit of everything here.

WE worked closely with many up and coming Network giants, streaming video and audio at a time it was very new and challenging over the internet platform. Our successes were many, and the company was all over the Nasdaq, until ultimately the internet ""bubble"" burst and many tech companies went n hiatus, or closed altogether.XXX,The management in this marketing position was very unprofessional and treats their employees with little to no respect.XXX,There is no clear-cut policy for hours per week or time off, so be very careful.

You get to work with an incredibly astute set of people and have a hand in making a difference at to how the internet functions daily. Every day is an opportunity to learn and better yourself professionally.XXX,I will preface my review by saying Akamai is a global company and the culture varies greatly depending on your location and department. I firmly believe that the good far outweighs the bad. XXX,We are a driven, intellectually curious collective that is always pushing ourselves and those around us to achieve the next level, rethink what is possible, and break through plateaus. In a place where you arrive and you are already behind, finding a healthy work life balance is one of the largest and most common challenges that exist.XXX,It's a great company. People are smart. I learns something new every day.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with the politics, but I'm pretty good at ignoring them.XXX,The work culture at Akamai was amazing and I learned a lot from the time I spent there. The University Relations Program is perfect and they run many programs during the internships seasons to expose us to the business and to network with others.XXX,Akamai has a great helpful culture.  Coworkers are supportive and cooperative. Very smart people working in a fast-paced environmentXXX,The work culture at Akamai is very enriching. Everyone is helpful and encourages to enhance your skills. All the colleagues are accommodating in nature and guide you to the best of their capability.XXX,Akamai's technical assets, systems and procedures are well developed and mature; a day at Akamai is a day refining and renewing these things in small but important ways.  Engineers must understand that there is 15 years of very diligent work and careful attention to detail that proceeds them.  There are opportunities to innovate, but he pace of change is no faster than that of refinement - and for good reason.XXX,The management cares deeply about the employees, they work hard to nurture and encourage career development at all levels.  Akamai invests in the community, students and even sponsors programs to teach those who've never worked in technology the basics.  Akamai has a strong culture of diversity and a good balance across cultures and genders.XXX,Fast paced.  Not a fan of the vacation policy.  Lots of smart people.  Not super friendly.

Excellent place to learn and they are an industry leader and encourage innovation strongly.XXX,Great place to work. Very easy to get along with everyone and to get involved with the firm. Could use better communication between departments but overall a great place.XXX,They are a great company, I did a co-op there and wish they hired me full time. Great CEO and Management Team, but from what I have gathered, there isn't much room for career advancement.XXX,Akamai has very hopeful and ideal work culture. They try and try to make you feel awesome about what you do.XXX,But, ""try""ing is not enough. Started from a very small and tightly knit group of people, while the ideal is great, does not necessarily translate into  the future very well, IMHO. Very little to no talent management. Manager trainings are laughable. Stale, older culture remains within groups and very strong office politics drive the majority. Not sure about other BU's but where I'm in, there's dwindling next generation of workers, which in my humble opinion, is not a good sign, especially when you look at the market now, that there are a plenty of competitors who are trying to do the same as Akamai does.XXX,Growing pain? maybe. But you can't keep continue to have the ""pain"". You need to learn and adapt to get out of the funk. It seems that senior management is oblivious to what is actually going on below their level.XXX,Great company if you're an engineer. They are treated very well.XXX,Otherwise, there are plenty of other companies that you CAN get treated very well for your non-technical contribution.XXX,Working with cutting edge technology has allowed me to grow as a professional, teammate and increase my personal knowledge.

Member-centered environment where main goal is to provide care based on their needs.XXX,I was hired a few years ago. They are doing a mass layoff without much of an explanation and no promises that there won't be more. It's a typical insurance company. If you don't express your feelings ever, if you like being micromanaged-they literally watch your screen and record every call, if you like being numbers driven, and if you are basically a robot that never leaves their desk for 8 hours, this is the perfect company for you. They offer you ""wellness"" time 1 hour a week, but if you use it, you fall behind, then get in trouble. I'm in the worst health of my life because of this job. I stay for the benefits for my family and that's about it. Growth opportunities are few and far between and management on all levels keep employees in the dark. Job security is basically non-existent. If you express concerns about the layoffs they 1. Fire you 2. Tell you to read educational material about job stress, anxiety, work/life balance 3. Ask you if this is the right place for you to work. The clients you work with are generally nice, but the company and management is greedy and it shows. To sum it up, I don't really recommend Humana to anyone with a soul.XXX,Humana is a large company with a lot of work at home employees. I placed outbound calls to member which I enjoyed.

It was an amazing experience. Enjoy helping seniors people that need the most help with their medical benefits. Amazing years.XXX,Best ever. I really like this company. You can work from home, they support education and growth. Good benefit. They value there employees. The Associates are given opportunities for professional growth. The organization encourages honest feedback.  They provides wellness incentives. Have a great employer who actually cares about the retention of their employees. The company have the last technology.My coworkers and my leader was awesome people.XXX,Humana has great benefits and compensation.  There is also the security of working for a large corporation.  If your position is eliminated, there's a good chance you can find something somewhere else within the company if you choose.XXX,Humana is a fast-paced very high-call volume environment in the department I worked in.  As a result the management focused more on metrics than employee concerns.  At the time, they were more concerned with maintaining low call volumes and shorter hold times than making sure everyone was happy and comfortable.XXX,Very good company, always changing and evolving and improving.  Rapidly changing - employees must adapt quickly to change.  Information does not always trickle down smoothly.XXX,Most days, hold something new, so you don't face the typical redundancy of day to day work load. Sometimes, the hardest part about the job is work-life balance. The culture is good, and very health and education driven. There are ample opportunities for growth and development.XXX,Its an ok place to work, nothing too crazy but nothing to write home about. You must be a self starter who is flexible and willing to learn fast on the go.XXX,I was brought in during their open enrollment period. We did not have a frontline leader in the beginning.

I made more than enough for what I needed. I was pretty much always busy but that's because the delivery zone. It is much more conducive for this service. XXX,Then I had to move to California and I began working in Oakland. The delivery zone is super huge and spread out. People don't tip like they did in Denver. They game the system by saying they will tip in cash but they never do. They snatch their food and slam the door. With how spread out the zone is this is problematic. When its 5 out of 10 deliveries! They need to cut up the zone!! XXX,Everything takes forever to get to. Such wasted time in travel. XXX,They do need to pay milage for between times. Like from the previous location to the next restaurant too. That is all a waste of gas. When you get to an old delivery and the restaurant refuses or is closed you just wasted gas and time and no compensation when it wasn't your fault! XXX,It is NOT worth it in the Bay Area California.

Stressful job at times but compensated well in the sales department.XXX,Even though you are contracted as Indepedent Contractor (that is what they say), the communication from the payment department is terrible. They don't care and don't read your requested question. I sent a request to clear up some issue about the payment but their representatives were horrible about answering question. Then, they gave you the same answer even the answer wasn't something I asked for. In general, they didn't read your question and have some idiot replied the same thing over and over again until you were tired. At the end, they ignore you and you will never get compensated for your work.XXX,Grubhub is the worst of all the delivery platform I have used. They give you this non sense about their professionalism and how they are better than the other platforms..... Meanwhile they are crooks using people for free labor and telling them to prove they made deliveries with an app that wipes itself clean and leaves no proof of your deliveries etc. They also trash your acceptance rate on purpose in order to not pay you the minimum. A very deceptive and sneaky company with no moral compass. From what I'm seeing on their reviews it looks like they have a class action lawsuit coming in the near future.XXX,This company expects you to drive 30 miles away to pick up a order and if I reject the order because its to far it counts against my acceptance rate meaning I don't get my guaranteed minimum. Driving 30 miles each way cost more money than I make working, out of all the delivery apps I have worked for none of them ever ask you to drive this far to pick up a order they exercise this shady practice as a bait and switch scheme to get more drivers on board but they know no one in their right mind would drive 30 miles to get food because your losing money thus they don't pay your guaranteed minimum because because you didn't meat their 80% acceptance rate.XXX,I highly recommend avoiding this company at all cost because by the time you calculate the wear and tear on your car your actually paying out of pocket to do this job.XXX,Sometimes communication can be off but overall the company pays well and they are always busy here in D.C.

First, I was with the company just three days before going to, what they call, ""driver care"" for assistance. The representative on the other end of the phone was rude and malicisously didn't help me when I began questioning her reasons for being so rude. It was just a disaster of a call with no assistance for my situation.XXX,Despite that issues, I decided to give the company another chance. What a mistake! They claim to pay a minimum hourly wage if your quota is not met. But, the underlining trick to that is that your acceptance rate has to be high enough to qualify. Well, that's really not possible when you're having to reject calls that are over 30 miles away from your current position. It's a trap!

I wish this hadn't been just a seasonal job.XXX,Youtube give the best creative freedom to make original content while  helping a big community of viewers, there is a lot of new techniques that I learned from trying to be competitive to get more views.XXX,The work is extremely easy intellectually for I have learned the main primary SOP (standard operating procedures) but it is tiresome on the body after consecutively lifting bulks of items. I think the best part of this position is getting to see customers and communicating with them.XXX,A typical day at work was completing orders and shopping on the salesfloor. spent a lot of time traveling from store to store to help. hardest part of the job was trying to get time off from work and starting early.XXX,It was a great company who was the delivery service in a lot of people got what they needed without having to go to the store to buy it it was same day delivery some of the managers were a little racist but besides that it was a pretty good experienceXXX,A rewarding challenge every day.  There were many new ideas and views on how to tackle the challenges of building a fiber network.  I am glad I took on the challenge.  It helped me to grow professionally.XXX,Very fun to work here, the people are very nice and always get our work done but there was times we had fun. We were like a family and we would all eat together on our breaks. Downside is the contract that was limited to only 1 year then 6 months off then you could reapply.XXX,Watch the ticket queue and respond according to priority of the issues that were presented.XXX,management was off site and did not communicate much.XXX,Co-workers were friendly.XXX,Most enjoyable part of the job was the free foodXXX,Technology is wonderful when it works and a productivity-sucking-piece-of-junk-headache when it doesn’tXXX,Whether it’s proactive network maintenance, virus protection or firewall services, WTC has you covered.XXX,If it wasn't for the incredible opportunity to go back to school at Harvard I would not have left, but I would have looked to transfer internally to a role that I could grow more in.XXX,Not always the fun loving, awesome place you read about in media.

I learned a lot new things about different cars. I use to drove them back and forth. It was a fun loving job for me.XXX,I have been employed for quite some time. We have survived through multiple buyouts and ended up as part of Honeywell. Even now being Honeywell, a global conglomerate, the only advancement opportunities I have available require uprooting my family to another State. And even then, I would be required to get manager's approval. Which would leave them short staffed, and likely not to occur. The job is great, but the atmosphere that is fostered will force good people to become hard to work with. It is almost too competitive in nature, and everyone is pushed towards only doing their ""hired-for"" job. My manager is head of our site, but really has very little actual authority. It seems like his hands are tied at every step. Healthcare is expensive. Took a rather large pay cut when Honeywell insurance was instituted.XXX,a struggle to get things done due to culture, tools for getting job done  there was a strong focus on finance management. Very week in project management due to young or still learning work force.XXX,Engineers rule at this company causing many road blocks due to egos and power politics.XXX,My boss was very supportive and provided me a top of line laptop and desktop computer setup. Every week we had one hour tag up meetings which aloud me to keep my boss very informed regarding the challenges of my position.XXX,A great place to work if you do not mind uncertainties, Stress levels are low until management gets caught not doing their job. Poor planning and solutions are ignored unless they come from certain people. People pick and choose who they will work for and how much energy they will use to get the job done.XXX,Horrible working environment! One of the leads on my shift (3rd shift) was very rude and inappropriate! He wasn't  professional at all. He would cuss at people over everything and would say nasty things to the women there and would get you in trouble for absolutely no reason!. I told the manager about it on my shift and he did nothing at all and said he would. The work is easy but nobody can deal with some one like that everyday at work especially if it's there lead!XXX,It started out as a great job with great people. A lot of changes occur after a year I was there. Management got worst. The environment was terrible. Everyone was exhausted and always fighting. It was out of control.XXX,Honeywell is a pretty big company, and YMMV depending on the site you're at. I've worked at 3 sites. The two in Virginia were very similar. Advancement opportunities were slim, but your job will be secure. It's pretty much a stepping stone company for most young engineers (less than 5 years). You'll learn a lot of useful stuff, and colleagues are eager to help. The work life balance is great.XXX,I have fewer good things to say about their facility in southern Illinois. It was also another good stepping stone type of job, but the workplace culture would be a 1/5 stars.XXX,My Honeywell work experience was amazing!  Great managers who gave positive employee support, direction and motivation.  Collective team spirit and cooperation coupled with dynamic problem solving goals were vital to our culture. Never found my assignments hard, only challenging and exciting. My jobs focused on good planning, open Communications, developing work and team relationships plus daily meetings interfacing with managers, outside vendors, team players, production and sales.XXX,a typical day at work may have been 8 hours or 16 hours. I learned many different facets of making ammonium sulphate. management most of the time was great to work for. sometime the culture was not the best. the hardest part of the job was being drafted..The most enjoyable was the training.XXX,Good company with great potential.  However, then they got into financial difficulty they re-organized the company and outsourced employment to lower cost locations.XXX,The degree to which Honeywell is a great place to work is predicted on which organization you are working in, and that particular leadership team.  They vary from ""5 star"" to ""1 star"", and changes with time.  Company ethics are solid.  You don't hear much negative press externally nor internally.  I've been there for 6 years, and would overall describe it as just OK.  I've worked for better places, but also much worse places.  Salary is competitive.  Benefits are ever shrinking, particularly medical.  I've been furloughed for 1 week per quarter over the last few (three total) which definitely isn't appreciated.XXX,As with any big company, there are some issues with management, but the current management is steadily driving away the good employees.XXX,There have also been reductions in pay, at least 4 layoffs, as well as reduction in benefits over the last year and a half.XXX,Honeywell bought out Sperian safety and slowly moved machines over seas. They weren't the best, but they taught us Kaizen and 5S.XXX,Started off as a great place to work and throughout the years seemed to get worse and worse. Benefits are nothing to brag about anymore for sure. Insurance, Pensions, 401K's hit hard. Furloughs and layoffs many times here lately. I loved what I done as a job not so much the people I worked for at times.XXX,Great work ethics. Work life balance. Lot of flexibility. Absolute pleasure working at HON. If given a chance will join again.XXX,The work was not that  hard but you had a number to hit in that hour and if you didn't hit that number then someone in management would come down on you hard about it.XXX,Good experience, exposure, and team members. Ability to problem solve and pro-actively manage through customer issues, vendor issues and internal issues is key.XXX,Good place to work, challenging assignments.XXX,Promotions from withinXXX,Global ExposureXXX,High management turnover causes challenges in business continuityXXX,Honeywell is a very demanding environment however with that comes tremendous potential for career advancement.  There is a high level of accountability and a culture that expects commitments to be accomplished.  If you thrive in a say-do culture, there are endless opportunities for career advancement .XXX,Great place to work.  Focused on employees.  Working in energy efficiency and focusing on future needs of the planet.  Provide benefits and salary is ok.XXX,I strive to make what we are doing better.  This includes actively seeking better ways to develop, test, integrate or field our product.  I have developed products extensively in C and Java and a little in C++/C#.

Good growth and reputation.XXX,I've worked for companies large and small. MacB strikes a nice balance between the two. Large enough that they have a cohesive organizational structure (HR, BD, PM, etc), but not so big that it feels like a drunk godzilla (SAIC/Leidos, etc) crashing through a city. As a billable employee I never liked the efforts to make me feel like a part of some corporate-level team. My team is the people in my workplace, a majority of whom do not work for my company. I want support, guidance, and advocacy in those rare situations that I can't get that from my workplace. Other than that, I want to be left to do what I am being paid to do. MacAulay-Brown is a great place to work because they really strike that balance well. I feel like the compensation should have been a little higher, but I really believe that is more a function of my current contract vehicle and not the company as a whole.

It’s feast or famine. If you want to make money, then you need availability during the weekends and weekday evenings when the clients want to tour. Which is great for people that want a flexible par time schedule. The local management also hires a lot of associates so they enough people available during the week. How it works is the events are first given to the deal writing agents, and any events they can’t do will be given to us.  We mainly do tours, help out at the open houses and specialized inspections. There will not always be enough work to keep everyone busy so expect some downtime.  XXX,The associates are paid a fixed amount per event. We are independent contractors with no benefits or perks though expenses are tax deductible. Tour pay starts off well for the first home but the pay for each additional home is minimal.  The company recently cut Associates pay across the board which makes doing some events less desirable.  One cannot pick which events you want to do. This is a car dependent job, if you don’t like driving, then this job is not for you. If the driving is too much you can limit the areas that you cover but this will affect how much work you will receive. XXX,There are a lot of unpaid hours with this job. Event pay doesn’t compensate for all the time it takes to setup appointments, rescheduling events with the clients, or researching the properties on the tour. Clients will expect you to be knowledgeable about the properties and locations. If you come off as unprepared they will slam youXXX,  XXX, in a review. This makes us spend more time preparing for tours. XXX,Another dislike is the clients frequently do not show up to confirmed appointments or will cancel at that last minute which is bad if you have driven over an hour to a property. The cancellation pay is less than what the event would have paid. Clients will also make constant changes to their tours which makes it a hassle to schedule the homes with the listing agents. At least if a client does it excessively management will ban them from using Redfin's services.  XXX,Lots of independence with the position. Associates don’t interact with the full-time staff or with each other on a regular basis. We work from home which is great. There is limited training besides the first mandatory training. Associates are left to their own devices with limited oversight. Which is good and bad. After a lot of negative feedback from associates, upper management directed the local offices to have monthly meetings so we could voice questions directly to management but that never materialized. Promotions are available into full time positions though they seem to be hiring more people from outside the company.XXX,  XXX,Redfin is an awesome company. I am currently employed as a full time agent. Before coming to Redfin, I was with a traditional brokerage. Redfin is NOT traditional. Redfin is different in its core values and beliefs, always making sure their customers are first. They are open, honest, transparent, and aren't afraid to tell you if they don't know the answer. Internal HR and IT departments are always super efficient and responsive to any concerns.XXX,With all these differences, and because they put the customer first, your pay structure is going to not be what it would under a traditional brokerage. Don't let it fool you- paid mileage, bonuses, base salary, and benefits REALLY add up. XXX,The environment here is great. Good, upbeat attitudes and honest people make working for Redfin the best thing I've ever done.XXX,I have been employed with Redfin for two years now as an Associate Agent. I work on my own schedule and make a great amount of extra money. Great Team. I work for another brokerage and received little to now training and with Redfin they are there with you to make you the best. I have learned more about showing houses, open houses, inspections, etc. movement throughout the company is possible as well.XXX,A week in the life as a Redfin AA is fun and involves a lot of driving and interaction with potential buyers through home tours, inspections, and more.XXX,Redfin is a technological Company first and foremost and the only folks getting paid decent wages are the Seattle Engineers and Executives.  Agents are paid based on reviews and sometimes regardless of how hard you work, you're not compensated regardless of the hard work you did.  They claim paid benefits and dues, however your base salary is so menial along with bonus structure, you indeed are paying for all of those benefits they claim to offer.  If you are a RE Agent and want unlimited earning potential, don't work at this place.  If you're a brand new Agent with no experience, Redfin is a great place to start because they'll provide enough leads to keep you stressed out and under water.  You will be expected to close a minimum of 3 deals per month, so forget any kind of work life balance.  If you attempt to take a day off to decompress, you will be scolded and told you're not a team player.  Also, given your compensation is tied to a review by the customer, you better be prepared to miss out on quiet time, family time, or even the birth of your children, because rest assure some consumer will claim in a review that you didn't respond to them in a timely manner and your already menial bonus will be cut further.  The Average bonus after taxes is $1,000.00 and your base salary will be $10,000.00 so you do the math.  A traditional Agent will be paid thousands in commissions, paid right away, and paid regardless of what the consumer thinks.  Redfin's business model is rigged to keep you hungry enough to stay, but too poor to leave.  Redfin also promotes unqualified individualsXXX,  XXX, into leadership positions.  I would assume this is due to the revolving door.  They can't sustain quality Agents because they don't compensate them fairly.XXX,  XXX,Walking into Redfin was a dream come true! The people are experienced, helpful and friendly. The most enjoyable part of my job was the flexibility.XXX,I don't why people have posted such negative reviews. Everyone was honest with me on our  team you own your own schedule you can work as much as you want are as little as you want.XXX,This position is perfect for a new agent you will gain a lot of experience taking clients out on tours, performing open house, doing inspections, and doing closings for the deal agents when they are not avaible. Let your manager know that you want to go fulltime.  You get paid for every event and team meeting. Plus they pay for your business cards.  New Jersey South is an expansion market. The marketing manager has been honest and up front.  If your looking to make  career change to real estate and are scared of the traditional format this is the place to start with our amazing website, technology, and putting the customer first. If you have a passion for customer service you will go far.XXX,I'm not sure why these reviews are so angry! I joined Redfin as an Associate Agent this year, and couldn't be happier! An AA is an independent contractor that is paid for every single event that you perform. One of the many positives is that you make your own schedule. Do you have family obligations? Close your calendar. Want to go on vacation? Close your calendar. There is a whole team of AA's in the area available to make sure that a customer can see a house on their schedule. XXX,It's true that the income isn't entirely reliable. It's based on the waves of business. If people aren't wanting to buy or sell, there is nothing for you to do. But I worked full time without any issue over the summer. The winter is quieter, but anyone in the business (or researched real estate before getting their license) knows that it isn't as crazy in the winter months. If you didn't save any money, go out and get a part time seasonal job. You can close your calendar! XXX,The Redfin business model is customer centric. We are taking real estate to the next level by putting the needs and wants of our customers first instead of the possibly desperate traditional agent who is wondering where the next paycheck is coming from. Redfin is a business and pays its employees a salary and offers them a great satisfaction bonus in lieu of working for commission only. It allows an agent the opportunity to focus on the customer without struggling to survive.XXX,Redfin isn't for everyone. Perhaps the other reviewers weren't as successful as they could have been because they didn't have the right attitude. ItXXX,  XXX, isn't an easy way to make money in real estate. It's a choice to be an advocate for your client in the confusing process of buying or selling real estate. You still hustle and work to build and maintain client relationships while working on their deals. You just have a whole team of people working with you to achieve the same client satisfaction goal!XXX,Redfin is awesome. I feel like I have finally found a career and a place where all of my many years of customer service experience is put to good use! I ""drank the Kool-aid"" and I could not be happier!XXX,  XXX,This job is not sustainable...All Management are condescending and arrogant.  They don't know their business...if the job market wasn't so tough, they wouldn't have many employees to do this job.XXX,The surveys are ridiculous and we don't even get paid for the transaction unless we get a 9 or 10 yet Redfin still takes their commission.  The Middle Managers are promoted because they are part of the clique not because they are skilled and know what they are doing.  If your not in the drinking crowd and kiss up to the local Manager, you won't go anywhere. Everyone I talk to, doesn't  even want to stay with the company.  They are looking for other jobs.XXX,Redfin is a technology based real estate firm and I believe they are at the cutting edge of blending technology with the real estate business. For a consumer, they have some great home search apps and a creative webpage with current home listings. However, they are not a good company to work for and promote a cult-like atmosphere. Everyone who works for Redfin has “drank the Kool-Aid” and become a Redfinian and that included me. I worked for Redfin for 2 years as an Associate Agent, one of their contracted positions. I barely made enough to survive, but hung in there because I thought they would promote me to one of their full time W-2 Agent positions, which is what their ""Market Managers"" led me to believe. Regardless of what I was told about the position when I was hired, it was part time income at best. I never got promoted despite receiving consistent 10s on their Redfin customer satisfaction reviews and my tenured experienced as a successful real estate agent. Redfin is a clickish company managed by nerds with marginal people skills. They preach inclusion and transparency, but they do not practice the mantra with their own employees. The deal writing salaried agents do well income-wise and do get great benefits, but they pay dearly for them in the way of slave labor. They are required to be on-call 24/7, have a huge volume of clients to handle and might as well be working for minimum wage in comparison to the work hours logged. The consistent consumer complaint by Redfin clients is that their agents are too busy to provide adequate customer service. I met many buyers/sellersXXX,  XXX, that used Redfins technology to search for homes, but hired a non-Redfin agent to negotiate their home purchase. The Redfin business model is based on sales volume, which allows Redfin to offer benefits, but their agents are not able to keep up with the work load and get burnt out. I witnessed allot of turnover in the time I was there and typically when staff quit, it was strangely kept quiet. Don’t drink the Kool-Aid, run the other way and find another place to work for. If I sound sarcastic and angry, it’s because I am. They treated me like dirt, along with allot of others who got fed up and quit.XXX,  XXX,In general they do not understand real estate. They are an internet based company that lacks agents that know what they are doing. XXX,Bonus are confusing don't recommend any true agent transferring to Redfin.XXX,I applied to Redfin and was contacted. The description of the position states a ""salary"" NOT TRUE!XXX,You are NOT paid for selling homes! You are provided a 1099 for attending open houses, delivering signs or present for home inspections. You are paid a sum of money for the above functions.XXX,Only approved agents are paid to sell homes or show homes.XXX,Great company to work for.

Upper management treated you like you were insignificant. Benefits were great. Met some great people. Glad to be out of EZPAWN tho.XXX,I worked at two location. In the Tuscaloosa store the manager would hide in her office instead of helping with customer. Employee moral was terrible. The Bessemer location was the worst tough. Because the store was over ran with cockroaches. They were everywhere. They'd be crawling out of merchandise as you were trying to sell it. I would have to make sure I shook  my clothes out before I got in my car. I would think that would be a health hazard. And there was no real security. They didn't even have proper cash draws. I carried when I worked for them. Which is against company policies. But I would rather be fired than be dead. The company has no concern for employees safety.XXX,The best part of being the Store Manager there is being able to train your own employees especially when you come with years of experience.

I do regret not being able to help everybody who walks through those doorsXXX,Good job alots of fun very good job for first time employment. Good experience, very diverse and fast paced. A lot of room for growthXXX,The company does not care about employees are customers safety. It was a grueling and stressful environment. It requires much detail.XXX,This company thrives off overworking their employees with part time employees being scheduled for 12 hours without complying with Labor laws including lunch breaks. They are deceptive and unconcerned with the safety of their employees. Several employees who have experienced on the job accidents were given false information to contact workers compensation as well as not properly treated with medical care immediately. Store managers have been known to sell items that customers have pawned before the 60 day window expires. Items have been lost, broken, or stolen with little regard to the customer and without compensation. Store has been repeatedly robbed or burglarized and management has showed little concern for fixing inoperable security cameras. Store management has proven to be sexist while leaving two women to close a store alone on a busy road and allowing all males the opportunity to leave their shifts early. Employee appreciation would only include male employees while females were left to tend to the store for hours. District managers micro manage store activity only to damage employee moral and diminish the little capacity one has left to effectively complete his or her job after being bullied and threatened on a constant basis. The only time the store functions properly is when corporate comes in town and they monitor your interaction with the big bosses and threatened anyone who would attempt to carry on a conversation with them.. Anyone have anything to hide maybe?! Vague promises are given during hiring such as management positions, competitive pay and adequate hours.XXX,  XXX, Managers have been caught fraudulently taking employee hours before payroll submission to avoid overtime pay. When the store is too short staff, employees may not be given a proper lunch break but Management will secretly deduct the worked lunch hour without the employees knowledge when payroll is submitted. Fraudulent loans are written to boost loans per day and they will loan money on bad items to boost their numbers as well and punish the pawnbroker for following manager direction when the item does not sell after the loan period is up. XXX,If you decide to work here, stand your ground and watch your pay check. Make sure you track your hours separately than the system because you may get shorted. Bonus checks are barely delivered on time or at all and payroll takes their precious time correcting the error if at all. Also be mindful that they will automatically take money out of your check for a sorry 401k without your consent and it takes forever and a day to get that money back without penalty. As publicly traded company they are supposed to make you aware of whistleblower laws but they carefully keep that info away from their employees because the stores are not run properly and as long as the bottom line says $$ they do not investigate impropriety. Also in the event manage changes during your tenure here be careful because if that manager didnt hire you, your the first to go. Also they do not encourage or value higher education as they do not acknowledge college degrees and they have stopped tuition assistance for their employees.XXX,  XXX,Significant change in leadership over past 18 months, and major restructuring.

Great environment and team effort all day. i learned a lot on how to style every women for their body type.XXX,the work environment is great for a person who is active and love multitask.

Different mixtures of cultures and management is very understanding and flexible with employees that are going to school or have another job.XXX,My first day at stitch fix suck.the management is in their own world.Manager and trainer was playing and cussing the other employees.once they show you what to do .the trainer did not come back to check to see if I am doing the job right.at the end of the day manager and trainer had clock out before me.the new employee. they are very hood in the warehouse.don't like getting paid only twice a month.XXX,I have grown a lot as a person and learned a lot of great things!

There is a community of Stylists who work together fabulously. If you have a passion for fashion, you will thoroughly enjoy styling clients from across the United States!XXX,Management is really poor. They never communicate with one another, so the employee's are always finding things out at the last minute. You can see favoritism all over the place. I have been working there for almost a year now and I have never been given the opportunity to move up. I see new people with less than six months at the warehouse get promoted left and right. Managers run their department however they feel like it and they also make you come in early, but they won't show up until regular showtime or even later.XXX,Loser trash job stay away. Pure slavery in all forms like working in jail the worst job ever the people there are low class and management is pure garbage. Its like a chinese sweat shop if you are not a favorite then you will get treated like dirt!!XXX,This was my first time working at a warehouse.  I was a temp. The atmosphere can be very negative. Alot of the employees have attitudes and are hard to get to know. It seems like management changes policies and rules very often. I did see favoritism, which is not fair to the employess that work hard. Lots of Drama. Adults should act like adults, not childish brats. The amount of insubordination I saw was amazing. These people would have been fired somewhere else.  Not very flexible when it comes to family situations and your schedule. You'll get nowhere there if they don't like you. Free snacks  are great, but not worth working there.XXX,The job is easy, but I feel like the company is trying to make slaves out of theses workers. They say it's climate controlled, but the temperature is above 80, they have you stand in one place expecting you to pack clothes at a fast pace while trying not to collapse frm the pain frm your feet. They should provide you a chair if all you are doing is standing there. I realize that most workers breaking a sweat getting all the work done are black and hispanics and mainly the managers and the stylists who sits on their butts and doesn't do much yet get paid more are white. Its a major race issue within this company in my opinion, I feel like I'm a slave and us as workers that receive the clothes frm the trucks, put the clothes on the racks, pick the clothes frm the racks, pack the clothes and ship them should be treated with as much respect as the white people who sit down all day. Stop treating the ones that do all the work like slaves, I mean it's already hard for blacks and hispanics to find jobs so the only job we can probably get we get treated like slaves. I would enjoy it more if I didn't feel like a modern slave. I applied to be a stylist for this company and was denied for no apparent reason yet hired for a warehouse worker. Oh I forgot I'm not white nor have blonde hair to work in the cool part of the building. More people need to stand up for what's right and never let people treat you as if you are beneath them. Money is not everything REMEMBER THAT!!XXX,I took a job as a stylist part time to ease the transition into full time after having a baby. I was really excited about the opportunities that I thought the company might present down the road but I realized very soon that, even with a degree in fashion and 10 years of experience, I'd never be promoted even though I had very high statistics (they measure these very closely). As mentioned in many other comments, the management team is like a small group of sorority girls that choose favorites. I lost respect for the brand and the culture very quickly. That's what happens when you don't see and tap into your own employees potential and allow negative people to get settled into positions of power. Good luck fellow fashion majors- I feel your pain!XXX,This warehouse is very unprofessional. They play loud music with extreme content and profanity, like five different radios at once. The supervisors never speak to you or introduce themselves. All the supervisors do is stand there and talk all day. There is no air in the warehouse but in the offices they're nice and cool. Iv seen females pass out from the heat. Leads/trainers come to work with hang overs. We are always short on Saturdays because people call in. It's extremely ghetto so if that's not the atmosphere you like then I'm telling you right now this isn't the place for you.  If you have an idea they will steal it and take credit for it. All we do for 10 hours is fold clothing, wrap it and put it in a box. If it isn't to their liking then they send it back to you. Sometimes they sabotage your work on purpose so you have to do it over. The breaks are very very short. People have their cliques so it's hard to get to know do workers. Pay is alright and they have stocked drinks of every kind and different snacks. Over all I wouldn't recommend this company or at least the warehouse.XXX,Managementment team could be a lot more organized. They are very big on favorites. The don't accept doctors excuses or anything.XXX,I used to enjoy come to work everyday, but first they changed the schedule, second It's hard to get a promotion unless you are friends with the management, even if you are going above and beyond your required job duties your not getting full rise or even worse you get nothing, then you have to wait another year to get cents, the management is really poor, a lot of supervisor for just one department and they never dont know anything, they never can answer a question and will send you with other supervisor. I think every state its different so i guess they have to adjust to Arizona's not benefitsXXX,As a stylist I helped women discover fashion through an online medium to deliver great customer satisfaction.XXX,-Remotely review client profiles to select garments for them based on their preferencesXXX,-Write stylist tips on who to wear and accessorize current items as well as previous items delivered to them.XXX,-Communicate with team lead to stay up to date on current company news, changes or interactionsXXX",,,"snacksXXX,free snacksXXX,Free lunchXXX,CateringXXX,lots of perksXXX,Free snacks and beverage.XXX,Free foodXXX,free food, and can listen to musicXXX,Free snacks, payXXX,SnacksXXX,Free snacks even tho its very unhealthyXXX,Work from homeXXX,SnacksXXX,Free snacksXXX,Not As Much Flexibility as DesiredXXX","repetitiveXXX,standing all dayXXX,Short break, ghetto, and unorganizedXXX,ManagementXXX,some managementXXX,not a place to make a career.XXX,Management no good.good luck with the trainerXXX,climate control, can get very hotXXX,Managers, co-workers, enviornment, long hoursXXX,Short break, hot climate, favoritismXXX,Treated like modern slavesXXX,Favoritism, unlikely to be promoted- if you are, it isn't generally based on performance.XXX,Short breaks, loud horrible music, favoritism, managementXXX,Poor benefitsXXX,Great ExperienceXXX"

I learned a lot about corporate politics and that management often has a double sided tongue.  The people are the most enjoyable part of the job but oftentimes they are also the hardest part of the job.XXX,I did not enjoy working at this company. Lack of opportunities for advancement and uninteresting work were a major problem for me.XXX,The work environment was at best tolerable and at the worst, toxic. Management is terrible and it must trickle down from the top.  Mircomanagement of every decision, even of highly paid and trained professionals.  Management looks for mistakes, even creates mistakes, in order to justify their positions with the company.

The pay and benefits are amazing, couldn't wish for more.XXX,Outgoing CEO had a dynamic personality and really drove people.  Compensation based on results but little life balance.XXX,The local management was horrible and very two faced. Every one in the auto claims office hated their job but were scared to leave. They expect 12 hour work days for little pay. Do not work for this company in Richmond unless you want to be around depressed people all day. It could likely be very different in the other offices. Training is also beyond sub-par and management does not take feedback well. The local office also denies to many claims so you will get stuck with old rental bills for claimants when the subrogation dept overturns local liability decisions as they do not handle rental for claimants if they paid out of pocket.

Deloitte has more politics than many of their government clients. Cut throat culture with poor work life balance. ""We hire young people that need experience, work them to death, and then once they realize how terrible we are, they leave."" I'll leave this review on a positive note - the lunches and happy hours were nice!XXX,Very fast paced results driven environment. Working cross industries on various projects aids in building knowledge and skills required to be a successful ConsultantXXX,Deloitte is great company to start your career. Ability to work on challenging projects with some of the smartest people in the industry.

CVS was a great place for growth as a pharmacist and for the other employees as well. I do not remember a day of work that was not a learning experience.XXX,Loved working at CVS for the customers. I also loved my job and what, my job title included but I was very under paid. I also didnt like the drama and how we couldnt work as a team,XXX,This is the same company under a different name.  I am getting really annoyed by this process, It makes no sense to make me review a company multiple times.XXX,I learned how to work as a team. My managers were supportive, the encourage me to be a better me. I learned how to manage  my time, especially when it came to helping out customers.XXX,A typical day at work is multitasking under pressure. I learned my native language which is spanish while engaging with customers everyday. I learned a lot about inventory, filling prescriptions, and alleviating health insurance company discrepancies. Immediate management in my home store are very caring and thoughtful, but also abide by the rules. District management are very strict to meet their standards and goals that is expected from the front end of the store, as well as pharmacy. The hardest part of the job is knowing that pharmacies sometimes will have to go by a budget, which requires hours to get cut. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting through the day being a problem solver and customers who have been helped go home happy and on a path to a better health when they get their medication.XXX,Likely would never work there again, work conditions are sub par to say the least and you are compensated poorly for the amount of trouble you have to deal with on a consistent basis.XXX,Cvs was a bad experience for me. It was all about drama instead of work. They had me do everything there is it just wasnt fair. it wasnt a good place to work at and I would never work there again.XXX,A typical day at work is ringing and greeting customers. I also did truck on wed and rang up customers. I did photo lab and took passport pictures. i did reshop at the end of the day when the store closed.XXX,There are a lot of things to learn working in the pharmacy. If you are willing to put in the work and take the state certification exam it will definitely be worth it. As you can demand more pay or seek employment else where for more pay.XXX,great company to work for. hardworking management and staff, great products made affordably. Pharmacy is on the ball and always helps out customers when they need it.XXX,Great company to work for, gives you chances to grow and learn. New metrics to improve  customer service  develop all the time and they  help you  meet those metrics.XXX,A typical day at work is full of tiny chores to take care of, mostly busy work. Greeting the customers is a big deal here. The customers are more likely to remember the members who smile and are friendly to them throughout the exchange at the register. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customers recognize you and have a genuine interest in your well-being.XXX,My responsibilities included, running points of sale, managing cashiers, counting imprest, closing out front store and pharmacy drawers at the end of the day, preforming daily cycle counts, correcting inventory, cleaning, and facing the store. Also, I ran the photo lab and was responsible for all computers and printers; performing diagnostic checks and system cleans periodically.XXX,Minimum quality of life while working for this company.  Excessive hours required by their managers.  Low motivation through out the company to assist in a quality of life for their employees.XXX,Working with patients that have rare and terminal diseases is a rewarding job.   It is a large company with room for growth.XXX,I enjoyed the work and people there is just lack of hours provided to work . If they offer more over time it would be the perfect job. It makes you smile seeing that you are developing many relationship with customers.XXX,very typical pharmacy technician job where you fill and decipher, deal with customers, multi-task, handle multipule cases for prior authorizations. I was a floating technician so i different work experiences everyday with different people.XXX,As a CVS cashier for 3 years I had the pleasure of interacting with customers on a daily basis. Whether it was to help them find a product in the store, check them out, or just to help answer a simple questions I was always eager to help. I also was there to help customers at the photo kiosk and printing station.XXX,A typical day at work involves being able to multi-task quickly yet efficiently while providing excellent customer service. Very many patients come in upset over unresolved prior authorizations or insurance discrepancies, so be prepared to handle these patients with the best set of customer service skills regardless of any negative demeanor they may possess towards you. You will be very busy and slammed while trying to do multiple things accurately at once, so be prepared to handle all of the stress and pressure.XXX,when i got hired they told me anywhere from 25 to 30 hours didnt even get that in 2 weeks lack of communication and the pay isnt all that great eitherXXX",,,"initially was close byXXX,Friendly CustomersXXX,schedule, teamwork, programsXXX,moneyXXX,Meet peopleXXX,managementXXX,great co workesXXX,Good benefitsXXX,Working with othersXXX,Meeting new people everydayXXX","constant moving around from store to storeXXX,Lay OffsXXX,healthcare, raises, opportunity for advancementXXX,everything else.XXX,no beneifitsXXX,compensationXXX,weekends and hoildaysXXX,Stressful work enviromentXXX,No hoursXXX,Pay was difficult to make ends meetXXX,Breaks feel too short often times in comparison to the busy workflow, Raises are far and few between.XXX"

I loved the work because each day was different. My co-workers were very talented and hard working. The bad part is there is no room for advancement at all, no matter how good you are at what you do. The best part of the job is working with clients to make them happy and using my previous experience to excel in the job. There is overtime for those who care enough but there were some hard workers and some that did not put in the same effort and dedication. Reviews also do not reflect extra effort, which is not good.XXX,I filled a contract position with the company for one year. Workplace culture is typical of most Corporate America workplaces. Most employees are in their mid 30s to 50s.XXX,Company focus is centered about new generation of workers with no regards to the dedicated employees that have been with the company for decades. All incentives to stay with the company have been removed as new employees have the same benefits as those with 20 years experience. Most new positions of responsibility go to the young and inexperienced which is counter productive to this business which demands knowledge and experience. The few remaining old timers are either bullies or are hanging on for retirement.XXX,Excellent place for new grads if you like being told how it is going to be with no input to the solution.XXX,It's an ok place to work.  I do not care to share more than that.  Some employees enjoy it and it is certainly better than working in a coal mine.  I assume.  Having neer worked in a coal mine myself.XXX,Currently, there is more emphasis placed on youth than experience. There is a lack of understanding of quality. There is a lack of communication between programs which causes redundancy.XXX,Right now I am working as a sub-contractor and and I am gaining a wealth of knowledge in the position that I currently hold and have no doubts that this information will come into play as my career progresses. The culture is very professional with a work hard play hard mentality.XXX,This is one of the most well know companies in Rochester and looks great to have on your resume if you live in the Western New York area.XXX,Harris has not given a 1% raise to any of its employees in the San Diego division of Information Technology. People working with the UUV and USV program at Harris Corporation have to spend 6 months or more in Bahrain. Hours are adjust, but the promised hours are never reached. Per Diem is slowly diminishing and there is no vacation when deployed. Management is terrible at communication and don't expect planning in advance, Management will ask you to leave for 6 months with a few weeks notice at best.XXX,Good place to work. Great people, fast paced, never boring!XXX,Good pay. Clean and safe place to work. Sometimes the schedules were tough to meet, but we always got the job done!XXX,This summary will not include overseas assignments.XXX,- A typical day at work was doing my assigned tasks according to work orders. I had moved around the company learning new skills by doing different things, such as making fiberglass products, making transformers of all different sizes making cables of all configurations, making and testing electronic fixtures under government specs, and many others things.XXX,- I had some of the best co-workers anywhere. They helped me become better at seeing the big picture and I helped them wherever I could.XXX,- management at Harris were great at listening to me and others and had the knack to give instruction where needed.XXX,I loved working with Harris Corporation - unfortunately the division I worked for was sold to a private equity firm eliminating my position,XXX,My supervisor was outstanding. Very knowledge able and down to earth. She understood that I didn't know everything. Great first experience!XXX,Deadlines and ever-changing requirements from customers keep me on my toes. Great environment with plenty of opportunities to network, learn, and even a little upward mobility. Management respects employees and employees return that respect.XXX,With a great work/life balance, Harris also provides a dynamic learning experience in the work place. Management is quick to acknowledge performance and promote form within.XXX,If you are looking for experience to work with Government Projects that offer security clearance. Harris is a great place to be. I loved my experience thereXXX,The only reason I left was due to a layoff. I liked Harris and would go back happily. I liked my manager, and her manager and her manager's manager.XXX,I enjoyed my coworkers and we worked well as a team.  This may or may not be the culture of the company...it is a very large company, but my division worked well together.XXX,This place has the angriest, most bitter employees I have ever witnessed in my thirty year career. Everyone is perpetually nasty and complaining about their jobs. It translates blatantly into the quality of their work and customers notice entirely. We are rapidly losing contracts to competitors and widespread layoffs are inevitable. I cannot stand another day here and advise everyone reading this to stay as far away as possible to save your sanity and careers.XXX,Programs are always delayed, underfunded and fraught with errors. There are zero continuing education or process improvement initiatives, and employees are perpetually unmotivated. People here are enamored with status quo; they love to float by and will viciously destroy the career of anyone with drive and work ethic. Save yourself the headache of a lifetime and stay as far away from this woeful ""company"" as possible.XXX,The first year was fine. After that, it had been cut after cut to benefits.XXX,Co-workers work well together.XXX,Management uneven in how the treat each employee, and with how much they demand from each employee.XXX,Government Support, supporting the Program Office with required regulatory and statutory documentation during the acquisition process material in support of the warfighter.XXX,Great work life balance and vacation and 401k, but a very low pay and bad middle and upper management cancel that out.

Cox Media Group is one of them. Refusing to face realities and develop creative, productive ways to adapt are causing a severe problems for this company. For all the money spent by Cox on research and understanding audiences/consumers (which is a huge amount), the conclusions and direction taken are poor.XXX,While there are still very good employees within this company, their numbers are in decline and the culture is suffering. A short-sighted view of how to adapt, and refusal to put emphasis on smart change is causing ill-informed, panicked management to push people ever harder to chase unproductive, disappearing ends in old-school ways. The result is a feeling of desperation, not unlike a drowning person struggling harder and harder in the same way, ultimately to their detriment. There are a great many other companies with far better culture and prospects to choose from.

If your a flexible person this job can be a good stepping stoneXXX,A typical day was to count product as it came off the truck and make sure that all product was received in a timely manner. I got to work alone at a newspaper branch for Dayton Daily News. The hardest part of my job was around Thanksgiving when all of the inserts on the skids had to be verified and moved. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to converse with the management in the branch and troubleshoot when there was an issue with their product.XXX,Management has no clue and there is favoritism.XXX, Wisconsin trends in shifts in advertising, there's always a panic that seem to trickle down from upper management. XXX, There is favoritism, and a high demand to perform as ratings and technology changes.  Scandal with senior manager from Atlanta .XXX,still an old boys network… Too badXXX,If you are a highly motivated outgoing person, then this job is for you. You must driven, self motivated, be able to handle rejection with a smile, and be willing to turn that around to a sale,  Its a more challenging job than one thinks. If you don;t have these qualities, than this is not the job for you.XXX,Agile process was introduced in the company BuyBook Technologies which was acquired by COX in 2014 and they trained everyone with better understanding of Agile methodologyXXX,The pay at cox is pretty good for the Atlanta, GA metropolitan area. The workload can be stressful at times, but they worked to alleviate that stress which made a positive work environment.XXX,The culture is recovering from a very toxic era. Turnover is rather high, making it difficult to form a cohesive team. It's not the worst place I've worked, for sure, but things could be better.XXX,I worked for Cox Media Group for five years. At first, it was great! We had a tight group on the desk and it was a positive team environment focused on putting out a quality product. It is amazing to me that in just that five years time, so many changes happened. They minimized staff and made all of the desk merge into a ""universal desk"" located in Dayton. By the time I left, literally 50 percent of the copy desk had quit due to the horrible work conditions and not one of them was replaced. I went from designing and editing a good 20 pages a day to doing well over 80 to 90 a day. Quality went down and management didn't care as long as the paper was being printed. The stressful work environment was constant and you barely had time to take a break. It caused me to have several severe health issues and for a year and a half of my life I suffered from constant panic attacks due to the stress of that job. Never would I ever recommend working in such a toxic environment. The management was horrible and treated employees as disposable. Please for your own well being...look somewhere else!XXX,Promotion within this company is very hard you have to be with the IN-Crowd or have a Big Brother mindset. Merit increases are not guaranteed nor based on performance reviews.XXX,Company is for sale. Management is horrible with no room for advancement. Watched people with twenty years lose their job without any reason. Stay away......XXX,I worked in a department that had massive layoffs. That's part of the business. The bad part is how the company handled it. Very unprofessional and callous. It's reflective of the overall corporate culture. The business is tanking and they have no answers.XXX,Great money, it was a blast dealing with customers management varied from franchise some of it was amazing and others lacked the skills to lead.XXX,When I first started, it was a blast working there. Employees were respected and looked after and allowed a lot of autonomy in how to conduct their work.XXX,But things changed and in the end I could not wait to leave. Respect for the individual skills in IT disappeared and enlightened management was replaced with petty micro-managers who had no respect for the skills and experiences of people doing the actual work.XXX,I made two great decisions in my life - First joining Valpak, and second leaving it.XXX,I never looked back.XXX,Only if you have been working for this company for an extended period of time are you allowed any flexibility.

I would recommend this job opportunity if you were offered one.XXX,Overall, The Weather Channel was a great place to work. Management tried to adopt a Google-style workplace where everyone was out in the open. Unfortunately, they've invested too much into their morning show AMHQ and lost too much money because of poor ratings, which have also affected other live programming.XXX,Because of that, restructuring was necessary and, unfortunately, I was one of the casualties.XXX,However, had there not been layoffs, It was a great place to go to work every day.XXX,I was sold the dog & pony show..they made everything look great from the outside.

If you get on managements bad side your chances of advancement are pretty much done. There is a tendency to use workers for multiple jobs to push cost savings regardless of safety. Expect people to cover multiple areas as in supervisors overseeing multiple areas, which then causes leads to have to cover part of the supervisors job if they cannot keep up with all issues occurring. There is no real equal opportunity towards moving up they already know who they want long before they post the position.XXX,could not ask for more, its the best place i have ever worked at and I am so thankful for all that I learned while with them. it is a awesome place and you can really grow with the companyXXX,I enjoyed my time at Tesla it was always consistent with many more activities to do around the shop.

Its what I will miss mostly about my current position.XXX,My job is to assist customers when they need assistance, if they need a a new phone I will get them a phone that best fits their needs or if they are having phone issues we would try to resolve that for the cusomer.XXX,We were always able to have fun although the pressure and demand for taking care of the customer was definitely an issue due to lack of consistency between managements. The hardest part of the job was the level of stress and the lack of support from peers, especially after we worked so hard on someone's account and they gave us a bad review but the learning about new resources and being able to have someone leave the call satisfied was very nice.XXX,Sprint is an amazing work place with growing opportunities.

Overall, I love driving and that keeps my passion alive.XXX,The best part about this company is that you work when you want and can. It has its flaws since it is a newish idea. But overall its a good part time side job.XXX,I have met many different people.  I drive people to their designated locations. I really enjoy working for them it gives me the opportunity to meet new faces.XXX,I am writing this review because I was forced to do so what I didn't like about Uber is being self-employed. Other than that is a great place to work while finding another job.XXX,i drive all types of people and give excellent service you are your own boss uber lets you work on your time and you are allowed to deny any one great companyXXX,The marketing and promotions team for UBER is amazing. You get to choose where and when you work and got to attend amazing events to promote UBER.XXX,Great flexibility in ability to set your own hours and earn as much as you would like. Good way to improve your scheduling and resourcefulness skills.XXX,A typical day starts with making sure your vehicle is running and looking one hundred percent, that you're prepared for any minor emergencies (flashlight, roadside assistance, emergency phone numbers, insurance information, etc.) and that you have your decals and permits. Once you are ready, your day consists of picking up and delivering your passengers as efficiently, comfortably and safely as possible. I end my day by tracking my expenses, deductions, and inspecting my vehicle for anything that needs to be addressed.XXX,I get to meet many different types of people. I love driving around getting to know the city in so many ways. This job gives me so much flexibility to spend time with my family.

Many benefits and support to run your own business.XXX,Uber is a good part time job to earn extra money.  I enjoy driving with Uber.  You can work when you want and however long you want to as well. The hardest part of the job is when someone has canceled a ride at the last minute when you have already arrived at their destination.XXX,great job for making extra cash don't try to make living off of this because the wear and tear are not worth the headache. also you never know who is going to give you a horrible rating.XXX,Always on the job love everything I do and also love helping others.also I learned to be patient and humbled on the job hardest part of the job was dealing with toxicated people but I'm used to it,so it really didn't get to me like that but I loved every job I had which was an amazing experience for me.XXX,Uber and other TNC options are great for a ""side hustle."" Lots of flexibility and the most popular times for rides are on the fringe of normal work hours (commutes, nights, weekends). However, the wages are not sustainable as a full time career.XXX,They do not car at all about the drivers that drive for them. taking into to account all expense and withholding your own taxes you only earn an average of 20 cents a mile.XXX,Enjoyable work, meeting a lot of new people and seeing new parts of the city. Flexible schedule and decent pay. Did not interact much with Uber employees, but were friendly and helpful. Typically would drive for 8 hours a day and meet new people as well as have some down time when waiting for a ride to perform other tasks. The hardest part of the job was convincing myself to go to work, since there was no schedule or expectation that I would work any particular day. Having to pay for my own gas and car maintenance became a drag after a while, and I put about 30,000 miles on my personal car in a year just driving for Uber.XXX,The normal day working for UBER would be spent outside walking up to livery Cabs, green cabs, and anyone with a TLC license and suggesting they join UBER.XXX,This is a convenient way to make a small amount of money if you have a car. Very low pay after uber's percentage, fuel, vehicle maintenance, and taxes. I wouldn't recommend driving for uber.XXX,love driving around picking up people. but it puts a lot of miles on your car and you pay your own gas which sucks. i love the freedom that these companies offer. plenty of driving make good many but they work 50-70 hours a week. thats not healthy or good for a normal life style. i recommend people get a full time job, 30-40 hours a week then drive part time or week ends. uber offers two bonus every week, one bonus is M-Thursday for 30-80 bucks if you meet a # of ride requirement. then theirs a weekend requirement for about the same. both are reachable mostly. but harder to meet when working full time.XXX",,,"Flexible Schedule, Instant PayXXX,Tax deductions, flexibilityXXX,work whenever I wantXXX,hours no man telling you what to do flexibilityXXX,bonusesXXX,flexibleXXX,flexible scheduling, good side job.XXX,flexible scheduleXXX,Flexible schedule, enjoyable clientele, decent pay, easy goingXXX,commission off any person you get to switch to UberXXX,Drive when you wantXXX,super flexable and easyXXX","noneXXX,healthcareXXX,Too many ptople doing it so its harder to make that extra cash.XXX,no healthcare pay isn't worth it no tips pay includes gas and car maintenanceXXX,long breaksXXX,unpredictableXXX,the amount of money that the company per trip and riders cannot tips driver through the app.XXX,they keep cutting the drivers pay.XXX,Puts miles on personal car, have to pay for own maintenance, no real benefitsXXX,Low pay, rude passengers, accruing mileage, stress, trafficXXX,very low pay mostly, unless you drive in SF.XXX"

Between hard deadlines for trades and frustrated investors this will take a heavy toll on you if you are not a very strong willed person. Entry level is almost exclusively customer service phone positions and they can be very challenging. Luckily I worked through the tough times and transitioned to several other departments that all offer great skills and opportunities.XXX,In short, T.

Development is arrogant and consistently ignore internal subject matter experts when designing the system. Senior leadership tells the CEO what he wants to hear and if he really knew or cared what was going on the many hospital clients they signed would be touting their go lives which you see nothing in the media about. The company story and hospital product show well so long as its someone who has worked in a hospital before and can avoid the landmines that come up during evaluation.

Junior developers are both gifted and cursed in that regard: they do what they're assigned.XXX,athenahealth is a middle of the road kind of company - there are much better and far worse places to work. During NHO they really overhype the advancement opportunities that will be available to you. I mean, you can ""advance"", but they are almost always lateral moves...no ladder climbing here. Also, their pay is a slap in the face for what you're expected to do. I'm simply putting in my time for the experience, but have been seeking employment elsewhere since I started. For the most part, the employees are pretty cool and the atmosphere is very laid back, tech startup-y. We have monthly Happy Hours where beer is served and sometimes the beer cart will come around just because. Lots of free lunches because we're always in the weeds and they try to show appreciation. Management is a joke. They're really just a middle man between you and the higher ups. They'll hear your grievances and that's about it. Also, be prepared to shuck and jive and kiss a lot of a s s if you want to advance at all - laterally or upward.

But in many parts of the lab, funding is very tough. And a long-term career path (at least in the sections with which I am familiar) is extremely hard - I know many senior staff who have left.XXX,Management wants to have its cake and eat it, too.  They treat scientists/engineers like hourly employees, enforcing charging policies not sustainable for any reasonable work/life balance while expecting salaried work.  Definitely a political minefield, as well.  Look at the wrong person with a perceived wrong look, and good luck finding work in that group again.XXX,On the other hand, if you know the right people, you can make moves around the lab to do virtually anything you would want, given someone is paying for it.XXX,Another problem is that they expect post-graduates to be short term help, not really expecting them to stay on as permanent staff.  This is in direct conflict with promises made at job interview.XXX,Perhaps I had a bad experience, but other people have said similar things.XXX,The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is very good at producing results, but not very good an retaining researchers. There is a significant turn around because people are hired without a plan to pay them. This would not be a problem if there was a way for those with funding to find employees that fit their needs, but there are not so people with funding will hire new people.XXX,The facilities are excellent and there is plenty of opportunity to do some real science.

This particular laboratory located in Richland, Washington is one of the largest in the United States employing over 4000 staff.XXX,It is not a bad place to work especially if you are passionate about the job.  I was in operations and it is really just about maintaining the status quo.  Typically all you need to do is log in and make sure all the lights are still on and then monitor your inbox for the rest of the day.  Occasionally there are some administrative tasks or projects to work on.  I learned a lot about operations while I was here and the people do try hard and are probably some of the smartest people on the planet.  There are some strong personalities but for the most part people are pleasant.XXX,I have worked in worse places but man am I bored.XXX,Designed projects from inception to final product and novel circuit designs. Worked with nuclear physicists on unique, cutting edge nuclear detection circuitry.XXX,PNNL is a great place whch balances research and industrial development works and provides a lot of flexibility and career potential.XXX,My days are spent typically designing PC boards and helping design novel circuitry for radiation detection. I also help scientists with documentation for proposals and papers.XXX,I have leaned a LOT about radiation, and how it is detected, from large amounts to very tiny amounts. I also learned how to design circuitry to detect this radiation.XXX,Our management tends to be rather ""hands off"" which I consider a good thing.XXX,The people I work with have got to be the best part of my job - I only have a BSEET in electronics, and I work with PhD level folks who treat me like an equal - they are some of the nicest people I have EVER worked with or for!XXX,Hardest part of my job is everything is charged to a project, and if you don't have a project to charge to, you don't get paid!XXX,Best part: Again, the people I work with,XXX,If not for management that was ""good old boys"", this would have been an ideal job. It is intellectually alive, fun people, well run, but very old fashioned in its values.XXX,I was an independent Contractor for PNNL providing maintenance of US SLD Megaport Initiative in the port of Cortes. I was enjoyable and challenge experience.XXX,The SULI internships are great! They allow for students to become familiar with particular technology subjects, meet a variety of experts, network with peers, and learn how to perform experiments.XXX,PNNL is a great place for an internship as a student. Getting to work closely with scientists at the national laboratory provides a great opportunity to learn about a variety of technical fields. The quality of staff is great, although projects tend to move slowly.XXX,This is undoubtedly the best place I have ever worked! They ""get it"" when it comes to taking care of their employees.

I think you they should give more training on the sales floor.XXX,This was a good launching off job into the corporate sales environment. It very much had a ""start up"" environment with all the bells and whistles in tow. They expected you to make 150 calls a day which was more quantity versus quality.XXX,Yodle is a pretty fun place to work if cold calling and a constant daily challenge. Although if you like to work at your own pace it may not be ideal as you are required 160 dials per day as an average with 160 being the daily goal. Amazing culture and all off the people get along great!XXX,This is an excellent place to get your feet wet and learn about the ins and outs of digital marketing B2B. I was here for 3 years and 9 months, had the opportunity to work hard and get the most out of my sales. The management gave employees the opportunity to work overtime and a lot of employers don't allow that, so to me, that was an advantage, when I had the opportunity to do so. XXX,The benefits are average, they offer a 401K plan, but when I was there they didn't match it.XXX,The hardest part of the job is getting into the mental mind set of cold calling every day for 8 hours, when you are mentally there everything else is easy and setting meetings is very smooth.XXX,The culture at Yodle is and always has been very casual, since it is over the phone calling.  I always feel my best when I dress professionally, but you make it what it is and many people find that they have an input on what types of events and games happen. XXX,I learned that you make it what it is, the more open minded you are with sales, the more you get out of the position and the more you learn and grow. The sky is the limit here, but don't burn yourself out, it's important to go slow and come to work mentally refreshed.XXX,You will be measured on phone calls, demo opportunities created, and your close rate.  If you succeed in one vertical - you will stay with it.  Call, call, call!!XXX,- A typical work day will consisted of engaging with a team and feeding off of others self motivation to achieve a collective goal.XXX,- I learned the art of over the phone sales and how to manage a team that hit sales goals while training them new material.XXX,-As a manager I learned numerous techniques for enhancing individuals performance and creating an positive environment.XXX,- My fellow trainers and sales mangers created a team which was bonded together by shared experience of  cold callingXXX,- The hardest part of any over the phone sales job is hearing the no's its how you deal with adversity which makes you a strong salesperson.XXX,-Inspiring others brought me the most joy in this position, teaching someone with no sales experience how to close a deal is life changing.XXX,I want to make it very clear, THIS IS A CALL CENTER JOB. 150ish calls a day is normal. However, outside of the call center aspect, Yodle's entire culture is to make sure the employees are happy and energized. Several times a week the managers just stop everyone in whatever they are doing if energy is low to play a game or something to get everyone laughing and moving again. And the training is far and away the best youll get in a call center. Yodle is DESPERATE for you to succeed, all you have to do is listen and have thick enough skin to do the calls.XXX,Great environment for day to day work and interactions with coworkers.  Not much room for advancement however.  Teams are well run and organized and compensation is more than fair.  Office is big and well lit with natural light.XXX,Seems like a cool work environment on the outside and on paper, but it is not enough to hide the fact that the days are long, and unsatisfying.  Hard to get behind the product that you are selling.XXX,Working at Yodle Inc., has been one to the greatest work experiences I've had. It has allowed me the opportunity to develope and grow in a demanding workplace.XXX,Took really good care of their employees however work/life balance was difficult. Although the job was strenuous it has prepared me to function in high pressure sales.XXX,great work environment. There are always new things going on to keep the employees engaged and happy. It makes the day go by and also keeps the morale high. In retention client can be very difficult but you have to know how to separate that from your personal life and it all works out.XXX,The hardest part about the job was the roller coaster sales experience. Bouncing back from rejections but my co-workers and management were all so full of positivity and never ending support. I actually learned a lot about myself at Yodle. It was a very competitive environment which challenged me to be better and achieve my goals.XXX,The Culture at Yodle is amazing. Our goal each day is to provide the best client experience that we can offer. I teach clients' how to use our program that will help them market their business online.XXX,My favorite part of my job is that the customers I assist have recently wanted to cancel the program but after I help them establish a marketing strategy they give us another chance.XXX,There are many online survey from my clients that rave about their experience with me.XXX,Its a starter sales job. It has a very low retention rate of employees of longer then  months, in sales. But its a good job to cut your teeth on. XXX,Unfortunately past experience isn't really helpful.XXX,Yodle provides decent entry level positions for those seeking sales or customer service careers. A few free perks are also provided, such as daily free lunch.XXX,Yodle took one of the most difficult and frustrating types of career, telemarketing, and surrounded it with a culture that promotes positivity and happiness. The commission is the best i've ever seen in relation to revenue, the training is literally 2-3 months, and any time you need help, you can get a one on one with a manager with about 30 minutes notice that same day. You have to be willing to put in the hours of perfecting the art of the deal, getting down to the details like your inflection, pauses, breaths and interruptions on the phone. If you don't commit yourself to be great, you WILL WASH OUT.XXX,The company was purchased by Web.com in February so the culture changed dramatically and the promise of my promotion became non-existent.  If the company had not been purchased I would still work for Yodle.XXX,The turnover is very high. You're roped in with empty promises and a fun atmosphere only to be blindsided by realization that making a decent living is a stretch. Management spends the majority of their time selling you on the opportunity that you have. In reality only a couple of individuals even come close to the monetary expectations set during your interview.XXX,A typical day includes sitting in a grey cubicle making as many cold calls as possible to prospects that have been contacted every two months for the last 4 years. The toughest part of the job (besides being able to pay your bills) is keeping positive day after day.XXX,Most don't make it 3 months.XXX,amazing company to work for. great work and life balance. great managers and helpful.

There are opportunities to be heard and create change within the organization. The organization is growing quickly and, while there are some growing pains, they are starting to figure it out. XXX,CapTech is a full time consultancy and not a staffing or contracting firm. I think a lot of people overlook them because they are not as well known outside of the Richmond, VA area.

I've learned more about myself and grown in a way professionally that I never thought possible. The culture is phenomenal and the opportunity for growth is continuous if you are willing to work hard. The company is extremely fast-paced and constantly growing and changing. It takes a special personality to fit well however if you are able to adapt, you won't be sorry for the benefits the company and it's people are able to provide.XXX,This company pretends to be a progressive company but they are not. They have extremely old third party software they use that does not ever work correctly. You get written up for everything; if you stand up for yourself, suggest new processes or if you're literally one minute late, one time. Opinions are not valued and the management does not listen to people in the department doing the day to day work they do what works for them which is put more work on the people who are already overworked and underpaid. Very negative environment that will follow you home.XXX,I am very grateful full to have found Paycom. It is a great place to start a career. I look forward to growing with the company.XXX,They grind you to the bone. New hire training doesn't prepare you at all for the position. Co-workers were great, and did help answer questions. When they were busy, I would ask my team leader, and their response would be ""Who else have you asked?"" Starting pay is lousy.XXX,The company does some nice things for the employees, but only because they know how much they over-work their employees.XXX,Good corporate culture, however they burn you out quickly.  Extremely high turnover due to cycling through recent graduates.  This is a good place to work as a young individual, but it can be hard to find a good work life balance.XXX,I worked at Paycom for a while as a Paycom Specialist, and the job was different than what I expected. I was told that I would build relationships with clients, and that is what attracted me to the job.XXX,However, there is a ton of technology to learn and it is rather frustrating at times. These clients that you are supposed to be building relationships with will be very frustrated when they call you 75% of the time, at least in my personal experience. XXX,To be fair, they warned me it would be hard, but I was under the impression intellectually difficult, instead of emotionally draining. XXX,The company is a good company and they do offer good benefits. I could have explored potentially transferring into another job or department, and I think I would have been happy. XXX,So, just be aware of what you are getting yourself into. XXX,Also, since I've left, I've had guys from there message me on Facebook...... It's a very ""young"" culture. Be ready for a lot of people to try to ask you out ¯\_(ツ)_/¯XXX,I mean, no judgment, take what you can get.XXX,The day starts with checking emails and reviewing tickets submitted by PAYCOM Specialists. I have learned a lot about the software development life cycle and the results of a effective collaborative team working together to provide software solutions to customers. The most challenging part of the job is priority management of projects as it can change frequently throughout the development life cycle. The most enjoyable is the people of PAYCOM and their positive supportive attitude towards assisting each other to obtain the main objective.XXX,The best culture in any place I've worked. I enjoyed learning more about the financial industry, including payroll and taxes. XXX,There are several departments within the giant buildings of Paycom. Each department is divided into teams of about 10 specialists supervised by a team lead. It was nice to have the support of a team, especially in such a large company. XXX,Also, the year end party is totally worth the hard work you do during year end.XXX,It was a great company to work for. I did not work there long so I don't have much else to say about it. I obtained good skills and learned how to use Access.XXX,Productive and fun work place. There is opportunity to advance at Paycom but you will have to work hard to get there. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that you get to work with, they become more like family over time than coworkers. You will have a chance to be creative and innovative here and will learn that the sky is the limit.XXX,Paycom is somewhere that you can join and build an amazing career.  I have been here for almost five years and watched us build out our campus, enhance our growth paths, start new teams and all in all become the best place in Oklahoma to work!! As a hiring manager I am very proud of the standards of excellence we have.  It can be very frustrating to the people who don't make the cut and probably more so for those that make the cut but quickly realize that they just can't keep the pace of Paycom. However our standards allow us to hire and retain great people. XXX,We are growing like crazy and with growth comes many opportunities to shine.  Some people fall behind or just fall out but the best of the best have opportunities like they never thought possible!  So many of my friends have been promoted and we are all making more money. Now that being said, not everyone makes it.  We are doing amazing things at light speed so occasionally people realize that Paycom is not for them.XXX,Here is what I love the most about Paycom.  Our leaders are truly committed to their people.  We have lots of training programs that help us be better.  We have annual reviews where we use our own system and get feedback and vision for the future.  I have worked many places before that you had no idea what you needed to do to get promoted.  Our founder and CEO cares about everyone. He will eat lunch in the cafeteria with a group of people, he plays basketball with everyone in the league.  I know he has high expectations but that is one of the key reasons Paycom is where we are today!!XXX,I enjoy the gym.XXX,  XXX, It has helped me and many others lose weight and get in shape but not take away from family time!  We requested healthy lunch options in our survey and we now have a healthy option every day!  I made a goal to be in shape before the next Year End Party!  YEP is another awesome perk where we are all taken to Dallas for an awesome event at the Omni and Paycom pays for our dinner and hotel!!XXX,IF you can earn a spot on the Paycom team then you should jump on board and make the most of it.  We are definitely going places and I know I am personally very excited to be along for the ride!XXX,  XXX,Paycom has a boatload of challenges to deal with as it tries to grow into a respectable corporation.  At a high level, the corporate culture is nothing short of toxic and like many other reviewers have called out, you are absolutely expected to ""drink the koolaid.""  A perfect example of this is that I was actually told by a business leader not to discuss market challenges with other managers because they ""don't sanction excuses"" and ""my team can't handle the truth.""  Rather than leadership being confident enough to talk about issues honestly and transparently and actually deal with them head on, they prefer to sweep things under the rug.  If you are lucky, you might get told ""this is a safe environment where you can be honest"" then get blasted when you do tell the truth.  They are not open to other's ideas or new ways of doing things and typically demand people accomplish work via the ""professional insanity"" method (you know...keep doing things the same way and expect different results).  One of many examples I could provide is that I had a strategy meeting scheduled with executive leadership to try to fix an entirely broken compensation system for a certain employee population that was cancelled and rescheduled 12 times.  I eventually had to give up and acknowledge they had no intention of fixing internal problems even though that was the spiel I was given.  This tells you how much they care about their employees.  There is a sickening, fear-based leadership style that pervades all levels and is spear-headed by ownership and most team members at the C-level.  Throughout allXXX,  XXX, internal business units there are a handful of people that can make life miserable for everyone else but apparently this is perfectly acceptable and in some cases encouraged if one is fortunate enough to make ""teacher's pet"" status.  Additionally, backstabbing and tattle-telling is another perfectly acceptable means of jockeying for position in leadership ranks as well.  Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of bright, hard-working, and honest people that work there, but unfortunately this is ruined by a handful that are allowed to act incredibly unprofessionally.  Another challenge has to do with pay practices.  Although they will pay leaders quite well, they simply do not pay competitively for many entry and mid-level roles.  They are rigid around this policy and are just now waking up to the reality they may need to pay something semi-competitive for certain roles that they struggle to fill due to a high volume of rejected offers.  Additionally, they truly believe paying someone in NYC or Silicon Valley the exact same for a role as what they pay in Oklahoma is a winning compensation strategy.  Anyone with national hiring experience knows that is ignorant.  Another callout by several reviewers is that they force employees to post positive company reviews to compensate for negative reviews they receive on multiple sites.  This is 100% true and accurate, particularly in sales and recruiting.  Leadership would argue that they don't hold a gun to anyone's head and force them to do this, but I don't know what else to call it when you are repeatedly pressured to leave a positive review until you get it done.  Paycom has been very fortunate to have a boatload of financial success which they continue to count on moving forward, but when this starts to plateau, they will be faced with a sad reality.  Although C-levels would do their best to convince you they are a ""fully established"" and ""mature"" organization this is far from the truth and they have a lot of growing to do.  Overall, they suffer from a bad case of corporate ""little-man"" syndrome and don't appear to care enough to want to change things.  Many people will read this review and immediately chalk it up to ""sour grapes,"" but every thing stated is factual and could be verified by a slew of other employees if they didn't fear losing their job (the brave ones would validate it anyways).  If given the opportunity to work for them, do yourself a favor and pass.  Perhaps 10-15 years from now (if they are still around and have cleaned house in the leadership ranks), it could be worth a shot.  Paycom:  ""They may have dollars, but they just don't have any sense.""XXX,  XXX,Working at Paycom has not been what I expected. I LOVE working here. The culture here is amazing. The company goes out of its way to make sure everyone is comfortable here. When I first started, I was welcomed with open arms by everyone on my team, now I feel like I have another family. It is a work hard, play hard kind of company. The benefits are amazing as well. Paycom knows how to treat their employees. I would 100% recommend the company to everyone and anyone.XXX,I haven't been at Paycom very long, but in my short time so far, I have discovered how much of an impact I'm able to make on our customers. Our business model really allows us to identify ways to grow and continue to challenge ourselves. While the work may never stop, and the days may be long sometimes, it's a sign of a growing company and eventually that gets better - just stick with it. If you're looking for cushy, chill, and laid-back, you aren't going to thrive. So many opportunities for growth and managers are available and accessible.XXX,If you are looking for a long term fit, then Paycom is the right place for you. Working here has given me a new confidence to know I can accomplish great things! I love the atmosphere, culture and how appreciated you feel being part of this team! This is definitely a family atmosphere and one where the employee comes first!XXX,I absolutely love working at Paycom HQ. We are constantly being celebrated and rewarded for our successes. My favorite thing about work is that my coworkers are also my friends and they all want me to be the absolutely best that I can be! My manager cares about my personal achievements and continually seeks out ways to mentor me and development into a successful professional.XXX,I would recommend Paycom to anyone who wishes to find success!XXX,Paycom has been the best job I've had since graduating college 5 years ago. There is incredible opportunity for advancement to be had if you work hard. With an on-site gym and catered lunches, Paycom really caters to their employees and wants them to be happy.XXX,The culture is what drew me to Paycom and the reason I still love working here. Everyone at Paycom has an attitude of servitude, not only with customers but among co-workers as well and that is rare to find I think. At Paycom, you jump right in. A lot is thrown your way the first year, but it's only because this is a fast-paced, constantly growing environment. I want to tell people about Paycom and how we can help their business. Using Paycom myself I know how great it is, so sharing that with others is fun. I would definitely recommend Paycom to my friends or anyone looking for a career you can be proud of!XXX,I love working at Paycom because every day is different, and the culture is amazing. My team is like family, and that makes even a bad day worthwhile.XXX,During my tenure at Paycom, I have witnessed and experienced tremendous growth. The company has a leveling system in most every department, so it is obvious what needs to be accomplished in order to get a raise and move up.XXX,The leadership team is amazing and is always looking for ways to do more and better the organization as a whole. There are training courses for everyone within the organization. XXX,If you are looking for a career where you have limitless opportunities with a high-growth company, I would highly recommend this organization.XXX,I'm a very hard worker and put my all into my work but Paycom doesn't care and your just a number. They talk all the time on how amazing they are but I disagree. I'm never one to complain but this was the worst job experience I've ever had, they made me doubt myself and all my colleagues feel the same way. If you take the job, you'll be super excited and pumped at first because they feed you this dream but two months in and you'll be living on pins and needles.

Over the years, I have learned the best routine for myself to be able to complete my daily tasks, and it is all about proper time-management.  I often find my co-workers look to me for advice when they have a process-related question rather than approaching management.  XXX,Definitely a good place to start off, they pay very well and most of the supervisors care genuinely about their associates and want the to do well. They go out of their way to make sure you meet your goals to get promoted or get to the department you want to be.XXX,Geico has great benefits and great management, easy job, to do, my downfall was becoming ill before my one year mark unfortunately they couldn't hold my job.XXX,A typical day included rushing to try and get all the work done with a ton of caseload and unrealistic expectations. Lots of stress and low morale. Management feels pressure from above and sends that pressure downward to the lower employees. Horrible culture of trying to rise to the top by selling your soul to the employer. The hardest part is trying to keep up without breaking down. The most enjoyable part was going home.XXX,Geico tends to squeeze as much out of you at possible. The work/life balance is poor, in my opinion. You will really need to be devoted to your job if you plan to travel up the ladder. The entry level positions are much easier, but who wants to stay at the bottom. The job security is great. Unless you do some unethical things, it is hard to get fired. Come in and do your best and you will have a job, although if you arent good at your current position, you may get moved departments. I feel the upper level positions do not pay nearly enough for what is required of the employee. No matter how good you do, the mentality is always ""what have you done for me today""XXX,Geico does pay well and has amazing perks, but it is not what you think. Geico looks out for who looks out for them. If it doesn""t benefit upper management they don't bother themselves with it. They do pay well and have amazing perks and career growth but for you to see the growth and perks it has to make sense to upper mangement and benefit them in some sortXXX,Worst places to work.   They try to make it as fun as possible.  XXX,Chances to move up but raises are small.XXX,Work load can be overwhelming, time  management is crucialXXX,I have been an auto damage adjuster for over a decade with geico and have worked in every capacity offered to the claims adjuster.  Much has changed in this job over the last few years making it, in my opinion, not worth the high stress and anxiety that are now a daily struggle for most, if not all, adjusters I've worked with.  The freedom and empowerment that used to define this position are sadly gone for the most part.  In times past one had the freedom to choose Parts and extend rentals if truly necessary.  This has now been replaced with a more demanding robotic approach to estimating and managing of rental that makes the average adjuster extremely frustrated most of the time and feeling that they really cannot meet the needs of the customer.  The administrative red tape and documentation, along with recorded phone conversation (to supposedly grade quality of work) have made the job undoable and unbearable for most.  In the last 4 years much of our local work force has moved on or left (about 25% turnover annually) leaving a workload that is unbearable for the remaining adjusters.  With the exit of veteran adjusters, new inexperienced adjusters fill the vacancies left and they have little or no experience leading to its own problems.  Newer adjusters often feel like failures due to the impossible grading scale and rigidly high expectations leading to continued high turnover that seems unending.  Geico continues to sell claims in a massive way leading to overwork and very poor ""work life balance"".  Many, if not all adjusters will admit to working thru all lunches and breaksXXX,  XXX, are unknown due to the pressures to ""succeed"" which means just surviving the onslaught of work and claims that NEVER stop.  Broken promises of proper staffing and a future lightening of work are empty and unfulfilled at all times.  This leads to an emptiness and overwhelming feeling of failure that lead to leaving geico for those who don't want to be unhappy every working day.  Upper management seems to be unplugged and disinterested in the plights and struggles of the average adjuster.  Our claims director has an open door policy but has never visited the branches to check on anyone in a real way to get a feel or put a finger on the pulse or work environment of the average adjuster.  Most adjusters would be scared to say anything anyway so the problems continue.  As long as local management is not graded on turnover the problem and unhealthy work environment will continue.  If geico could appreciate truly how much money they could save by simply retaining good people it might be a different story.  It appears there is no change coming anytime soon.XXX,  XXX,A typical day at work at GEICO can be a roller coaster. The job is not too difficult however it can be mentally draining at times. I learned a multitude of things during my tenure at GEICO, the main thing I focused on, however, was understanding. Becoming an understanding person can dissolve most any elevated situation. The management had its ups and downs, for the most part, everyone wanted you to succeed though. The culture of my job was really family oriented but just like with all situations like this, occasionally you had those who isolated but overall pretty tight knit teams. XXX,The hardest part of the job just so happens to be the most enjoyable part of the job, working with irate people can be mentally draining and it can and is the hardest part of the job however its that same irate customer that makes the job enjoyable. Being able to calm someones fears is something that helps groom you into a better person as a whole and that by far was the most enjoyable part.XXX,I joined GEICO unsure exactly what would become of my time there. The first few years were amazing, they pay well, they have a great bonus structure, profit sharing, and benefits are all amazing, they have a great staff to help you and everyone is very approachable. There is plenty of room to advance. XXX,I left because after four years of being in a call center it can be mentally exhausting. They are constantly making changes to goals and sales techniques. Just when you get comfortable with what you are doing they want to come in and change everything. If you can handle working in a call center then this is the best place in the area. It just wasn't for me.XXX,Great place to work XXX,Management knew what it was doingXXX,most supervisors were easy to approachXXX,quality control was a moving targetXXX,only complaint was not understanding when needing to take time off for kids/medical issues. XXX,enjoyed my coworkers and supervisor. Great benefits but the stress level was unbearable esp if you havent had previous medical issues before. I started getting migraines and was diagnosed with high blood pressureXXX,I lobed the pay and benefits at GEICO however I did not like how you cannot ever miss any days even if you have to take your children to the hospital they have no leway and no exceptions which makes it hard for people who have children to work there.XXX,Geico really believe in a safe encouraging wok place for employees to thrive in. This is shown through their attention to detail in employee benefits to the time and patience that management puts into developing each individual.XXX,Extremely stressful job! One of closest renditions to modern day slavery that I can think of. Before I quit GEICO in June 2016 I began having panic attacks due to the high stress environment. I knew many collegues that suffered from anxiety, high blood pressure, and migraine headaches after being exposed to the GEICO culture.XXX,Very fun, fast paced environment.  Challenging, but rewarding.  Can be stressful at times, but they definitely pay well which makes up for the stress.XXX,Very fast-paced, positive work environment. Co workers are very supportive. Paid training and lots of work schedules available to fit anyone's need. After 6 months, eligibility of education reimbursement is availableXXX,Standard position where you have no input or voice on anything that happens. Expected to just do what you're told. Office politics takes place as usualXXX,Great Company, good benefits. would recommended to anyone looking for a career with a lot of room for growth. not for everybody though.XXX,A good place to work if you love the insurance business. You will receive a quality education to obtain your insurance license and eventually you could branch off and start your own business with your license.XXX,I spend a little over 2 years at Geico and they were a great two years.  The management is very supportive and encourage professional and personal development.  Geico has a very strong promote-from-within community.XXX",,,"Job Stability, BenefitsXXX,Great payXXX,great benefits for industryXXX,job securityXXX,Pay and benefitsXXX,Benefits, PTO (Paid Time Off).XXX,great place to work loved the atmosphereXXX,PayXXX,Compensation / growthXXX","High stress environment, Training issues.XXX,Very strictXXX,awful work-life balance, horrible pressure from management, high stress, call-center environmentXXX,no free time, constant stress, never good enoughXXX,Poor work, life balance with never ending stress and anxietyXXX,Short Breaks and lunch, poor communication, lack of responsibility.XXX,Quality control was very subjectiveXXX,ManagersXXX"

Unfortunately, most of the management that made Blizzard great have either moved on or been pushed out.  Culture shift that is occurring right now cannot be quantified in a few lines.  Decide if you like your boss before you say yes.XXX,There are some great people at Blizzard, but it's just not the same anymore.  Additionally, the pay is not great.  They like Blizzard fans who are willing to take less pay than they are worth.XXX,Blizzard was a typical video game industry job. Many of the employees are fans first and not very career focused. While this did create an exciting culture to be a part of the room for advancement was an issue for me.XXX,While Blizzard Entertainment provides an enjoyable day to day worklife, and a stellar team of coworkers, opportunities for advancement are extremely limited, as is the pay ceiling. However, that said, the job itself is fun and engaging.XXX,One of the greatest perks of being a Game Mater at Blizzard Entertainment was getting first hand knowledge on how several systems within the games worked.  This was only made better by the core value of teaching our customers why something worked the way it did.  When a customer would petition in with an issue, we had the amazing opportunity to not only explain why the game acted this way but also give great information into the thought process and idea behind the why.XXX,Thought customer support for such a massive gaming company can be hectic at times, Blizzard always made their employees feel at home and offered all the needed tools and information to continue to adjust and perform well.XXX,My department was restructured about 3 times in 9 months.XXX,Management was constantly being rotated in and out, promises for job advancement were made and then never provided.XXX,Working for Blizzard is not as all you would think it would be. Proclaimed to have amazing culture and to be a great place to work, it only applies to those who are at the main campus in Irvine. The last straw was being put into a room and experiencing a training where we were told that Blizzard was such an amazing place to work. The trainers ignored our concerns and just reiterated that we worked for Blizzard for the pleasure of working for Blizzard.XXX,Everyone is really friendly and the company is family oriented. It is a very nice place to work and it's a wise company.XXX,The company Blizzard entertainment is a pointless company. They don't show / tell the public that they have other game developing company's, develop most of the game and Blizzard market the game as there own creation.XXX,Every position I held within this company was highly dynamic, and required a large amount of agility to meet the demands of the job.

Ticketing/e-commerce is now commoditized SAAS and the company's ""strategic"" projects has failed to deliver any differentiation. Both Product and Strategy teams have abandoned the marketplace mission as they struggle to make Eventbrite a destination page for event discovery. Instead the team executes multi-year efforts on refreshing the look and feel of the website to occupy time and without substantial metrics impact. The Engineering team moves at glacial speeds and mostly comes from other events-oriented SAAS companies (read: never worked at pedigree like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc). This breads an engineering culture that lacks real processes or documentation. The ""bench strength"" has never worked on large-scale services at aforementioned firms and thus many of its services/experiences have broken under larger loads. This lack of know-how also creates a fear of touching legacy code, building hack upon hack. Recent acquisitions have built off-shore engineering centers making it even harder to develop.

I learned how organize and maintain project records and document procedures. My co-workers were great and easy to work with.XXX,My ten years at Washington State University, combined with other experience, has provided me with proficiency in a variety of administrative skills which include: accounts payable, bookkeeping, cash handling, customer service, data entry, database development and management, event planning, filing, inventory control, marketing, billing, purchasing, payroll, scheduling, travel planning, word processing, and more.  XXX,I managed my supervisors calendar and also managed all work-study who assisted me throughout the year. XXX,I am a well-rounded, and highly motivated employee who enjoys working worth co-workers. I believe in the importance of having a ""team player"" attitude. XXX,Hardest part of my job would be a certain portion of the year when putting on the biggest event (Symposium)  at Washington State University. XXX,The most enjoyable part of my job was learning and advancing in the College of Communication 3 times. I was a valued employee.XXX,Undergraduate researchers conduct extensive data collection and research various topics for their professors. Students also have the opportunity to participate in WSUV's annual research showcase and have their work published.XXX,Loved every second of working for the students as an event coordinator. It's amazing to be able to give back and sharing a 6-desk office with 12 people really makes you bond as a team!XXX,Washington State University is an amazing place to learn and work in a very supportive environment. As a graduate assistant I was supported to progress through my degree as well as gain relevant work experience. They treat graduate assistants truly as staff and not any lesser any time.XXX,I helped students in the dorm with their first year of school, guiding and advising. I learned a lot about how to be a leader and work with others cooperatively. The managing staff was excellent, as were coworkers.XXX,Hardest part of the job was balancing schoolwork with a 40 hr a week job.XXX,The most enjoyable part was seeing the positive impact I made in the lives of these students, and the bonds I made with an entire new group of people.XXX,A place where you can earn some money. Expected to work and stand all the time of your 3-4 hours shift. Permission to leave for illnesses  are really considered and you are expected to do more than what is required. Your outstanding work won't be prized sometimes even with the simple phrase "" Thank you!""XXX,I learned a lot about teaching and interacting with students while working there. It would have been good to have  opportunities to get more training. My co-workers were very nice and  a lot of fun. The hardest part of the job was the grading.XXX,Education is full of bureaucracy, and WSU is no different. There are good and bad parts to that. I was surrounded by both great and terrible co-workers. The good ones are helpful, knowledgable, and pleasant to work with. The difficult ones are condescending and wiling to stab you in the back. Education is a brutal place. The best parts were the students and the ability to help people. The worst part of the job was the way some of the faculty treated both office staff and students.XXX,Great faculty, plenty of graduate student resources, inexpensive place to live, not much to do as far as social activitiesXXX,WSU is a world class university, friendly environment, a lot of nice labs and equipments that open to everyone to use (charge of course). Overaal a good place for study and workXXX,Worked for a good supervisor and had a pleasant experience.  I had a job setting up demonstrations for some undergraduate courses and the job allowed me time to also work on homework during the hours I worked.XXX,The time I when to WSU was great learning experience. Also, the Mechanical Engineering department is great and supportive. I have enjoyed living in Pullman, WA.XXX,I was a graduate student which is basically cheap labor for professors, hopefully you can work with a good professor otherwise it can be terrible.XXX,Was excited about all of the interesting things that we were doing.XXX,Shift in management changed that. I still enjoy the drafting, and working with the project managers.XXX,Went home to home interviewing immigrants on how day to day living in the lower valley limited with income unable to prove in the winter electricity bills, food, rent.XXX,WSU was one of the best places I have worked and enjoyed life. Quality of life was excellent. The university takes care of its employees very well in terms of visa sponsorship and support for international research faculty.XXX,I loved working at Washington State University.

I love being a conduit for their success and helping them move forward and get better opportunities.XXX,The office and the help available, however, has shrunk since I began working there. XXX,Rather than fill positions of need to alleviate stress on the news and ad departments GateHouse's modus operandi has been to fill the position with someone in the office and have them do double-duty. XXX,You often work more hours than you get paid for — like working 80 hours but getting paid for 40 — which doesn't leave much for a personal life or compensate you for the time lost. XXX,There also isn't much progression and you have to be proactive about your own career there. There are no evaluations or learning sessions or opportunities to attend growth symposiums. You will have to make that effort for yourself. XXX,The previous management was great and I grew monumentally as a journalist, but the current regime is far more focused on ""clicks"" than community news and telling the rich and compelling stories found within.XXX,Gatehouse is cool if you are into practices and policy. I personally was not impressed by the hierarchy here.They have a traditionally corporate mindset hard set on robotic practices.XXX,Cohesive unit for building and developing talent to build sustainable relationships with advertisers as well as personal and professional growth of the individual.  XXX,A great company that invests in their talent with on going training of techniques and product knowledge.XXX,The company is recently out of bankruptcy and in a failing industry which limits their ability to give raises. The co-workers and the company are enjoyable just ready to move on.XXX,Middle management seems more concerned about upper management than the people on the ground and it shows. Communication is the pits here. LOW pay.  Mixed messages and lots of back patting for acquiring new titles, while reporters flail with outdated, broken equipment. No pay raises given for the past 7 years. The one benefit is that even while they expect a lot of ""content"" (not necessarily ""journalism"") out of you, they also are serious about employees only working 40 hour work weeks. It's easy to get sucked into discontent surrounding the work politics, but if you are able to stay out of that and put in your best work it's a great ground floor. That's the silver lining.XXX,I enjoyed it there it was fun while it lasted.   Nothing else I can really tell you. I do not know really why i have to fill this out seems kind of silly.XXX,The only positive about the paper I worked at for 8 years with 3 different owner ships, were my coworkers.  We did an excellent job of meeting deadlines to assure our advertisers ads would be in the paper as promised. Most customers were great to work for with.  The biggest problem was management and the leadership at the paper! They were very poor leaders who needed training and did not care who they walked over.  Favoritism and uncaring was rampant!  Our local HR was very unhelpful and did not seem to know what her position was and seemed to take managements side without a discussion. Would not recommend this company unless interning only.XXX,Not a good company. The best part was the people that I worked with. No job security. We (co-workers), felt that we had job security since it were were the only daily newspaper in the area. We felt comfortable with the previous owners, but had high hopes that this company would be better since they owned a lot of newspapers in different states.XXX,Which team you're placed as a designer seems very random. Of course, while your work ethic and skills play a big role in determining your future here, whether you'll grow professionally or adopt more responsibilities will depend on where you're placed...which is probably out of your control. Favoritism is blatant. Most complain about the salary...GateHouse is a very typical corporation in that it would rather see its good, long-time employees leave and have to put in the time and resources to hire and train new people than bring wages up to speed. Just because this isn't Los Angeles or Chicago doesn't mean the employees can afford to live in Austin on the change they're doling out. Coworkers were chill, though. It's a kind of relaxed place.XXX,First, this was not a FAIR company to work for. You would have to work 3 months with no day off while everyone else in the office got their time off. If you have a complaint about business or something going on in the office that is unethical, better keep your mouth shut..... no one cares.. no one will do anything.... it literally will be a waist of your time..XXX,I enjoyed my time working at gate house media. Management and culture is all good. I would definitely recommend to a friend.XXX,Not a place you would want to work. Employer released me with no given reason. Unemployment was approved, but it left me in a bad situation after just moving to the area where there is not much work. The publisher was very unprofessional!!XXX,The Gatehouse Center for News and Design is a modern-day sweatshop, and the company is unashamed of this fact.XXX,Turnover is outrageous. They hire in bulk because fed-up employees often walk out in frustration. Others leave as soon as they can.XXX,Managers promote among themselves and sycophants. Pay is abysmal. Promotion is nil unless you're a champion butt-kisser. XXX,In six months' time, five top-lever managers have bailed to take better jobs, including the chief development officer, the HR lady, the operations director and now the center's chief director.XXX,Daily newspaper teams are chronically understaffed and overworked, many taking on 8-10 day stretches with no breaks. XXX,Floor plan is spare, designed to emit an air of temporary work, letting employees know not to get too comfortable in their position.XXX,the job was difficult due to the limited number of businesses in the area and my limited knowledge and training in the industry.XXX,This review is for the Center for News and Design in Austin. I can't speak for the rest of the company in other locations, especially pre-2014.XXX,Job Work/Live Balance: If you're young, single and don't mind working second shift, it's probably a good way to gain valuable experience. If you have a spouse and friends with day jobs, expect a great deal of sacrifice.XXX,Compensation/Benefits: Pay is low--even for journalism. Especially given the amount of responsibility you'll have right off the bat. Plus, you'll be living in a city with an increasingly high cost of living. Healthcare benefits are relatively good, but you'll pay toward $200 out of pocket per month for them. Scheduling time off is akin to redeeming frequent flier miles: The only periods you can get time off is when nobody else wants it; and vice versa. And forget about spending the holidays with family. If stressing out on deadline at 11:30 PM on Christmas night is your cup of tea, then this is the place for you!XXX,Job Security: There's a very high rate of turnover, so if you're competent, you won't have to worry about job security. But that being said, there's a reason this place earned the nickname ""Gaslight Media."" Your head will be messed with. Team assignments and supervisors change regularly, too.XXX,Management: Some supervisors are great and really care; others, not so much. Bear in mind, this is the brave new world of corporate-owned media. Once upon a time, journalism was a field that attracted folks who valued integrity at the end of the day. Now it's all about ""what's in the best interest of the shareholders.""XXX,  XXX,Job Culture: The median/average age of your fellow employees will be fairly young. If your idea of a great work environment is a high school cafeteria or the college dorm--with all the requisite gossip and juvenile drama--then you'll love working there.XXX,  XXX,Next to no resources  devoted to local properties. Every employee in every department doing the work of multiple people, partnerships with outside marketing companies led to poor customer service. Constant confusion and no direction from corporate. The only place money was devoted to was buying new properties.XXX,I worked there for years and still to this day have a professional relationship with the owner.  Great starter job for college students and looks great on resumeXXX,I enjoyed going to work everyday. The people I worked with quickly became my friends.

The IT staff are very helpful and welcoming. They have a good balance of teaching you things you need to know but while at the same time allowing you to learn on your own. Co-workers in the IT department are unique, funny, and sociable. Hardest part of the job is addressing everyones concerns in one day. IT department is understaffed. Most enjoyable aspect of the job is learning more and being able to address issues on your own and seeing the increase in your knowledge and ability to handle particular issues.XXX,Its a simple relatively stable and pleasant company. The Location is not exactly the most fun though. If you don't mind the burbs it's great.XXX,I worked at Crestron for 9 years, co- workers were good to work with. In my first years it was great to work at Crestron. As the years went by there were so many rules and regulations it was crazy.In my 9th year I got hurt on the job and I had to get a operation,it took more than 90 days and they terminated me. Imagine after 9 years!!!XXX,A typical day at work in Crestron updating Test plans, Test scripts, attending meetings for new requirements.

Little room for advancement unless you are an engineer or tech support.XXX,Fast paced work environment.  Constantly changing duties and responsibilities,  Crestron Electronics creates hundreds of new products each year.  Employees need to be excellent at multi-tasking, and able to prioritize several objectives continuously.  You need to demonstrate working individually and working with others to accomplish your goals.XXX,As mentioned elsewhere, the pay is insulting. The company was recommended to me, but I would not recommend it to anyone else. Culture is non-existent, and there's segregation between buildings, departments, hourly vs. salary employees. The safety rules and policies are over-kill. The head of safety compliance is an abusive person, well protected by senior management. There's not much room for advancement at all. You can only hope to transfer positions after a 6 month period. Training was pitiful. I was essentially just thrown to my desk with expectations....  I enjoyed my co-workers. Lots of decent folks there you work along side with,XXX,Very stingy with its employees in terms of time off and pay. Raises are sad.XXX,Work culture changes based on each individual department's management.XXX,I've worked for almost 3 years in the shipping department at the Orangburg facility. During my run there I've worked with great people within my department , however management is a joke. With all the the hard work and overtime you put it, it gets un noticed. Very little pay for hardwork, standing on your feet for 8-10 hours. Department change or shift change? Good luck. Despite of my 2 year run, I've asked for a shift change so that i can schedule myself to go back to school. In one ear and out the other. Everything goes by favoritism . In order to be liked by the shipping supervisors , mainly the daytime ones, you have to either play video games they like, watch the same sports as them or simply have the same interests. Very unproffessional. New rules are applied everyday. Also there are different rules for different people , and special privileges for some employees. Im glad i got out of that place. The shipping department should only be a pit stop in your life , unless you really like the workload it comes with. I absolutely do not recommend this place unless you really need a job and are willing to settle for slave work. Only good thing is that if you need overtime and the extra money , its always available .XXX,A good group of people to work with.

Everybody is eager to share knowledge and supportive of branching out of the department to explore other avenues.XXX,Worked 3 1/2 years as an Extraction Operator and loved it. The huge downside for me was the 2 week swing shift. 2 weeks on 5am-5pm then 2 weeks on 5pm-5am. Good hours if you're single. You end up working 2 days on and then 2 off. Every other weekend you work Saturday, Sunday, Monday.XXX,Transferred to a straight dayshift cleanup position after 3 1/2 years of being zombified by the swing shift. I liked the work the position offered: loading shipping containers with meal, helping move rail, cleaning up, etc. After awhile the dept. superintendent put my name in some safety committee and was forced to go to mandatory meetings all the time. That wasn't my cup of tee.XXX,I was very young when I was at DuPont and really enjoyed working in a large place.  I was a creel operator and I also drove the fork lift on this job.  I worked the last 4 years in the lab,  I performed series of test on the product.  I resigned to raise my children as a stay at home wife and mother.XXX,Working with my co-worker was my highlight for the day.  Great people.  Being a team player.   There was nothing hard in my job.

DuPont was my training ground as a young engineer.  Their field engineering program gave me exposure to many different product technologies, and their Safety culture was unparalleled.  Management strongly enforced and supported a safe working environment.  I felt safe and learned so much...and this led to my contributing significant business value.  When I had to leave the company for family reasons, I was very sad to leave.XXX,DuPont in New Century KS is professional, yet they are very VERY smart and very willing to share their time and knowledge with you about a vast variety of things.

Change is good but it doesn't make everyone happy while others have benefited in their careers due to the change.XXX,Was publicly announce to the office and myself that I would be promoted to team lead; within two days the proposal was denied due to age and lack of experience by the contracting office (after being approved internally).

XXX,Great group of coworkers are always joining one's team.  Backfilling and being able to communicate with coworkers are a welcomed for a working environment.XXX,I have mixed feelings. The job was good, but they were always trying to call me in on my off time. The pay was good, but that was negated by the seemingly yearly reduction in benefits. Management turned over in one form or another once every few months in the office I worked in. There wasn't much of a pay increase over time and fewer opportunities for advancement in the company. People seemed to muddle through the day with discontent in the office. It seemed to suck the joy out of some of our coworkers just to be in the office.XXX,Leidos is a great place to work. Management is engaged and fellow workers are eager to assist each other. Salary was highly satisfactory. The fact that it was a contract job has inherent risks.XXX,Hired and then let go 6 weeks later because of funding.

Leidos also offers annual performance reviews ensuring that you have a way to move up the ladder.XXX,Excellent position to help train first responders and help protect the nation from disaster. This is a rewarding position and excellent working conditions.XXX,I was my own boss and made my own schedule to the needs of the mission. I learned a great deal about turning in old and no longer useful equioment. Management always ensured you had the proper training to complete your mission. Co-Workers were always there to help with moving any equipment that needed to be loaded into a truck or van. The hardest part of the job was not having enough time to get everything completed. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I had complete control over everything I did.XXX,Leidos is not a bad company to work for, they just aren't great either.

People are generally very supportive there.XXX,Employment their usually starts off well and lasts more years than at most places. However, it can be tricky despite your best efforts to remain employed there. The place frequently reorganizes and the people that support you the most may disappear. Their objectives can change leaving you high and dry for work. Then they give you a choice between a probation assignment (which usually leads to termination) or help in placement outside the lab. Some people leave and come back with great success. Nice campus, offices, activities and efforts to keep employees happy.XXX,Overall JHUAPL is a decent place to work; however, look elsewhere if you want to work on cutting-edge research.  There is much more of an emphasis on the worth of management over technical staff, which  makes career advancement for engineers and scientist who prefer to stay out of line management very difficult.XXX,Design a GUI for the ARGO project. Main tasks were the parser and small front end design. This was my first internship and I learn a lot about the computer science field from working here.XXX,For scientist, engineers, and management JHU/APL truly is a “Best Place to Work.”  However, support staff and other non-professional positions should be leery when considering any offers of employment.XXX,With twenty and even thirty year careers for professional staff commonplace at JHU/APL one question I recommend every job candidate ask during the interview process: “What is the median number of years my peers have worked at JHU/APL?”  If the answer is not ten years or more, it is a warning indicator of excessively high employee turnover.  The likely culprit is management that characterizes support staff as commodities.  Long-term retention is not a goal and therefore providing opportunity for advancement (promotion, recognition, salary, and training) or work life balance is extraneous.XXX,My days varied depending on which test stall I was assigned to.

We all stay very well informed of what is coming down the pipeline.XXX,Very numbers driven to exceed sales goals. Never enough head count in marketing (everyone doing the work of 2 people) with small marketing budgets. Difficult for work/life balance (many people do not have families). Growth difficult. Supposedly a team environment but seems many people want the ""one-up"".  Some cliques.  Marketing management has very high level of standard and excellence with scrutiny. Handful of people in certain verticals are a pleasure to work with. Traveling is exhausting but can be fun. Alpharetta office is stressful (with management overlooking) but has diverse internal events. Range of benefits good but amount to pay for such a large organization not accurate.XXX,This used to be a great company to work for – I loved it for the first 12 years - but things  have changed! There have been a lot of senior management changes that brought about restructuring and layoffs. And most importantly/sadly, remaining employees are no longer valued. The company is trying to push them out and is lowering salaries  and benefits ...  and doing away with flexible schedules and telework.  Needless to say, moral is low  and attrition high. Think twice before accepting  a job - particularly if based on old reviews and past reputation.XXX,This was a great place to work. I was given a queue of projects to manage daily and great care was taken for the most part to ensure that I was never overwhelmed. My co-workers were almost always very nice and always willing to help. The only real problem is that every six months or so the company had massive lay-offs.

Very engaging! The hardest part of the job was learning the software however; training is provided. Best work atmosphere I ever encountered!XXX,Associates are great. Upper management needs work. Prime example of a startup company that lost sight of the core values that made them.XXX,Every one was friendly and very helpful with helping new employees.I learned how to do things such as drycleaning, machine operating, and spotting. Co workers are always efficient and on top of work. Hardest part is working a high amount of hours completing a high number of garment , almost 10,000 a day. but it's also fun and challenging. Most enjoyable part was the environment and people that I worked with.XXX,Awesome Culture.Very young company. Very calm environment. Can drink in the office.No dress code. Very free spirited. End of the month is always a headache but not a big deal.XXX,Coming into the position, you are trained on all aspects of the rules and guidelines of the company. This is strictly a customer service role. Unfortunately, the only growth within is to become a Senior customer communications associate (with a $1 raise). The pay is not enough for the 9 hour days and weekend shifts.XXX,The most enjoyable part of the job is the random perks and fun coworkers.XXX,working at rent the runway was an great opportunity for me. it was fast pace and i like that. they provided me with great hours and worked around my school schedule.XXX,I enjoyed working here unfortunately there wasn't any open permanent positions at the time my contract expired. The staff was very open and kind. They're an awesome team to work with!XXX,A typical day at work includes documentation of all new merchandise, quality assurance, and last but not least, input of all new inventory into our warehouse management system.XXX,Lots of lifting, poor management, lots of employee turnover.  Overtime most days due to poor decision makingXXX,Very hard workXXX,I was able to learn how to dry clean garments. I had learned more information on how to wash clothing. So many things I experimented and experienced working are skills I still use today.XXX,One must have an extremely tough skin working in the corporate office at Rent The Runway.

As it is still a relatively new company, management is sometimes confusing, but seems to be developing successfully.XXX,One must have an extremely tough skin working at any of the Rent The Runway stores.  Thank goodness for wonderful co-workers who became friends and confidantes.  Many times seeing their faces and getting to talk to them during lunch was the only thing to keep me going.  The combination of low inventory, extremely long wait times for dressing rooms and irate customers, it definitely took the toll on everyone.  XXX,Few things that need to change that would dramatically improve morale:XXX,- Please thoroughly TRAIN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM!! It is unacceptable and hurts us when CI tells customers over the phone the wrong things to get them off the phone (ie: telling customers wrong store hours, incorrect information about when their dress will arrive knowing that we cannot guarantee what van a dress will be on, saying that we carry all 65,000 dress in store when we only carry 1,000, etc.)XXX,- Please be more clear on the website explaining the ""walk in"" procedure, if you walk in without an appointment you will have to wait for a dressing room to open up you can't just pop in and immediately try on, dressing rooms are reserved for the clients who have paid for an appointment, too much confusion from walk ins who take their anger out on the employeesXXX,- Management: Please have monthly events for the team to boost morale.  Dealing with a high stress job is emotionally taxing.  Please keep your promises when saying that we will have team outings (bowling, dinner boat cruises, karaoke, team dinners, etc.) and please be open to feedback from employees and do not bring outside drama/personalXXX,  XXX, matters into the job - we should not be subject to your anger over what happened with your boyfriend, friends, etc.XXX,The most enjoyable part was seeing my co-workers and learning a lot about myself and drawing out strength I didn't know I had.XXX,  XXX,I like the people I work with. We all work hard but the job is a little underpaid when it comes to how much work and energy we put it in.XXX,A good company to work for. The work environment is fast pace but an enjoyable work to go to. Enjoyable and fun co-workers, very friendly environment too.XXX,I worked as a store stylist for Rent the Runway. At first I was excited and thought I would really enjoy the work and in some ways that was right, however things took a bad turn. There is good and bad, the people I worked with are great, but the compensation is a joke. When they tell you you will make $40,000 a year or $20 an hour, run away because that's a lie. Trust me I'm saying this and my sales were some of the best in the country. You really cant move up in the company from retail to corporate, they don't hire from within and they don't promote. Rather than advancing stylist to senior stylists who had been at the retail location they hired outside stylists. What does that tell you? XXX,The business also needs SERIOUS work. There are a lot of issues with there never being enough merchandise to sell, dresses never arriving to customers and dresses arriving but being dirty or ripped. Which of course customers will yell at you for that, and when you complain about business practice nothing happens. XXX,If it's your first job its a good stepping stone, but if you are experienced and want a career go elsewhere. One of the worst markers of this company is that you could walk into their retail location right how and ask all the associates if they would quit on the spot given any other job offer and they would all say yes. Trust me I have asked.XXX,Amazing company with some of the best, most methodical people that I have ever worked with! Definitely a fun work environment to be a part of!XXX,Fun, cool place to work.

Hardest part of job was dealing with highly technical collateral written by developers. But I managed!XXX,Great team atmosphere, office space and plenty of opportunities to make connections. As a sales office, it is relatively busy but fun. Great place workXXX,SAP is fast-paced and detail driven. You must be willing to work independently because it is a virtual working culture. Depending on your location and what team you work for, there may not be much face-time with management and team members. Because of that, feedback might be delayed on completed work. However, management does a great job in constantly communicating the goals and objectives of projects in developmentXXX,A typical day at work: Calls and virtual meetings with team members around the country and globe. Setting project plans and completing tasks, reports and content outlined by management.XXX,SAP provided me with 19 years of learning, working with terrific people in a friendly and professional environment in 4 different countries and many different locations.XXX,Coordinate trade shows, contacted and maintained SAP's editorial calendar.

It's hard not to notice that they put most of their primary investments behind Sales and to a lesser extent Marketing.  Software Developers and Engineers typically take a back seat. While they may pay more across the board, they overwork the development staff.  Understaff software, overstaff sales.XXX,The movement in this job is great. Never the same position more than twice, always something new going on, the excitement at a San Jose Sharks game is fantastic.

I traveled by air, more that 100,000 air miles each year and it became awful after 911. I learned a lot from this company regarding adult education, in which we taught classes to 26+ adults each week, both at the home office and customer locations. We were required to teach more classes than the job requirements called for and that was unfortunate. The company also had a preference of hiring German instructors.XXX,You have all of the knowledge that there is right at your fingertips.XXX,Management will always support you on achieving your goals and for you to become a better resource each and everyday.XXX,Working at SAP is like flying in your dream.XXX,There is always work, but not always good support to get all work done and done well.

The work is very demanding at all levels and the environment can be overwhelming and very stressful. This job will definitely not provide for all your needs unless you are working in corporate management or have more than one income coming in for your household. The benefits are decent and the job culture can be very welcoming at certain locations.XXX,Pilot was a fun, upbeat work environment. Unfortunately the opportunity for advancement was not very attainable.

Management treated employees fairly. The workplace culture was hardworking but fun. The hardest part of the job was unstable weather conditions.XXX,Very unorganized and not too safe of a work environment. The work is very intense compared to the pay received. I can say it is a great job for those who love chatting, knowing regulars and meeting new people.XXX,If you want to work at a place where mediocrity is promoted than you have found your ideal job. Management is flat out rude to employees and customers. Try to change the public perception by being respectful and helpful... you get removed. It is a job where the truck drivers matter but get trashed talked as soon as they are out of sight. Do you have a degree in Management? Have fun using that at Pilot they target those that do not fit the low intellectual mold they promote into middle management. The grievance reporting line states there should be no retaliation. I know of three people who have ever used it and they where all terminated within three months of placing the call. Run... Stay Away... Horrible Employer!XXX,The schedules were different every week. It probably would have been a lot smoother working there but quite a bit and quite often the employees called in sick.XXX,The job is not too hard or physically demanding, but the work is boring and repetitive. Like any customer service job it has its pros and cons. Lunch is fairly short as well.XXX,Working for flying j has really changed my life in a matter of a year! I opened up with the company and because of my great attitude and ability to work well with people and manage time efficiently, i was moved up with the company as a manger.

I have learned so much throughout the year that i have been here and am excited to acquire more life skills from this job.XXX,Pilot Flying J has a standard reputation among the locals and passing truck drivers. They always had fresh coffee, great food, and amazing customer service towards guests. However upper management heavily lack communications and always played favorites with certain staff members. Employees were always treated as second rate. Corporate is always trying to find ways to keep money in their own pockets by denying certain essentials to their store locations. Couldn't even use employee discount during off hours like some other companies offer.XXX,The store as a whole is #1 in the company.  There are many good employees who make that happen.  If we were happy employees we could surpass anyone's expectations. The attitudes of certain managers is appalling.  They are incredibly rude to customers and employees. Downright hateful most of the time.  Their negativity makes me dread going to work.  The schedule changes frequently so you have to take the time to look at it daily, even on your days off because they won't tell you. You have plans? too bad. The female management and shift leads, with the exception of Dawn G, are some of the worst managers I have ever worked for. XXX,Don't make any mistakes because the smallest mistake is a major problem.

I don't have enough words on how to describe this great company. They care about the employees and all stakeholders.XXX,My time with Intuit was great. The only reason I am leaving is because our jobs were fazed out to a 3rd party vendor. A typical day at work consisted of reviewing account where funds are held by our team for review. The customer feedback we received either by phone or electronically regarding our processes took a special psychology to digest.XXX,I loved working there. The first tax season I worked there it was great the manger was great. She was nice treated you with respect. The second tax season the new mangers were terrible. They treated everyone like they were stupid and if you weren't one of their favorites well it sucked for you. They had all these rules that intuit themselves don't have and it made the work environment horrible. The leads that the mangers hired had either no experience with TurboTax or no experience being supervisors. I love the program but if intuit keeps it ran by those two it's going to fail.XXX,Being in CA, Intuit decided it would be more cost effective to move the Support section to a more financially viable location. Being born and raised in California I wasn't willing to relocate to Colorado or Virginia where I would be given a lateral move (i.e no increase in pay raise).XXX,It's a great place to work, however the call center environment at Intuit is very busy, very fast-paced, very detailed and very demanding. From the moment you log on, you will be answering calls until the end of your shift or beyond depending on the call. The opportunity to advance is hard to come by because many people don't leave once they are in a position that they like.XXX,I loved working at Intuit.  The training was very interactive and very informative.  Everyone that I worked with and even those that I came across in passing were very friendly.XXX,This is a perfect remote job.

The pay is adequate for working remotely.XXX,Was very fortunate to work for Intuit for many years.  Employees are treated with respect and are allowed flexible work hours and can often work from home. I was lucky to work with smart, talented and fun people.  The work was hard and demanding but worth it because we had a great team and leadership.XXX,Worked there for eight years.  Absolutely great place to work.  Great work-life balance.  Wonderfully managed for such a huge worldwide organization.  Loved it there.  They use a lot of contracted employees.XXX,I loved the intuit company i just did not like the vendor that i went through i felt as if the company did not have internal communication. therefore things could not get done properly.XXX,This company makes you work long hours required to work and 2 Saturdays a month leaving no time for your family.

A variety of customers, team mates, work, and opportunities. It was hard to slow the work flow down to live the rest of my life.XXX,With working for such a large organization it can sometimes feel as though you are working for a company inside a company. Epsilon does invest a lot in it's employees with training courses to ensure they are equipped and prepared to do a job well. Most coworkers are friendly and are eager to assist with answering questions and problem solving. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the ever changing rate of technology. With any job, you get out what you put in. It's not always easy to reach the next level but if you have good work ethic and are supported by management you can excel.XXX,Not a bad place to work.  A lot of restructuring over the last 18 months will a lot of confusion.  The leadership has had the most turnover especially in the Agency Creative side of the business.XXX,10 hour days are typical at Epsilon, skeleton crew,not easy to find a good work/life balance. Compensation is good - good profit sharingXXX,Director/VP level management is immature and lack strategic planning and employee development skills.  Jobs are not secure and  the focus is to reduce Irving employees and replace with associates in Epsilon's offshore office.XXX,Epsilon is a decent company to work for with decent managers at the ""ground level"".  The technology is behind the times and for an IT professional, there is massive resistance to change.XXX,Typical day starts at 330 pm until midnight unless we are on a 10 or 12 hour shift. weekends are always 10 hours overtime unless its a holiday weekend. Only problems are not enough paid holidays and should be paid more than we do.XXX,Great place to work and gain experience. Fast paced, great clients and the opportunity to deliver measurable outcomes to major brands.XXX,Epsilon has a great team of people. With the exception of senior management, everyone comes to work with a positive attitude, collaborative spirit and passion for their customers. I learned a lot about digital marketing and loyalty programs at the company. I had a great team of people that delivered top-notch results and received accolades not just from our customers but our customers' vendors as well.XXX,While there were many things about the company I liked such as the people, the benefits and company events, the company had a lot of issues. Senior management failed to recognize high performers and high performing teams; instead, awards went to those ""best liked"" or in the political click of senior management. Titles were inflated. Compensation was low. The company lacked a cohesive strategy for long-term growth. Operational and development costs were high because they refused to adapt to new technologies and methodologies. Anti-LGBT sentiment was high. Also, the company was in the midst of shipping jobs overseas.

Can't do much about that. Company has left the United States.XXX,The appearance of this company looks great from the outside, but internally is terrible.

XXX,I was a contractor with CDI, and I sure felt like a scab walking on egg shells.  So I am sort of confused.  Some contractors were gone after putting in four years of work. Some less.  With me, I got the boot after 6 months.  XXX,There is a huge communication problem in the  department I was working in.  I pursued my daily duties and did what was told.  After working there for a month, I no longer expected any transparency from my co workers or manager.  They just fail to recognize my dedication, and I'm sure their stockholders and senior employees are happier that way.XXX,Contractors have no voice or opinionated American rights.

At Parker it matters more about who you know than what you know, or how exceptional your work is. Great place to retire if you just want to put in a few years without working or accomplishing anything, but if you want a career or have any ambition, look elsewhere.XXX,The management structure changed and they pushed out a lot of talent and forced a lot of people into early retirement. With several rounds of layoffs, they found creative ways to get rid of and/or marginalize the good people that remained.

This company is still trying to find itself during the throes of today's public education debates, and is experiencing forced adaptation (reacting to, rather than leading) and semi-annual staff reductions. XXX,Since 2010, MP (and the educational testing industry as a whole) has been experiencing a thinning client base due to educational consortia (states teaming up, rather than running their own educational testing programs). Some MP clients remain loyal however because of the Client Service division's ""we'll eventually get it right"" ethos. Internally however, this bending over backwards continually bleeds this company's bottom line due to the lack of better controls over contract agreements and poor risk mgt during work proposal negotiations. Change orders are also almost never enforced, to get back monies spent mopping up client mishaps. XXX,The staff is oddly management top-heavy (what's an 'Assistant Director' anyway?), shepherding a grating mix of yokels and overbearing ""professionals"". The average joe working here has some educational content background (math, science, ELA, social studies), and the company still employs a strange tradition of promoting these people into management roles, where they're usually unsuccessful from inexperience. Most coworkers however aren't too backstabby, but cling to each other in fear of the misdirected managers I just described. MP consistently and deliberately under staffs programs/projects (""building the plane while flying it"" was coinedXXX,  XXX, here) which has resulted in some embarrassing client surprises and liquidated damages (see MP vs. State of Nebraska); strangely, this results in fewer staff than before.XXX,The culture is strained, with the employee cafeteria consistently empty (everybody working while eating) except during the attendance-mandatory State of the Company addresses. People below the executive levels are consistently underpaid, seduced by the company's ""not-for-profit"" byline, and despite enduring the constant rumors about overpaid execs and board members. The result is a continuing brain drain of top people going to competitors who (shock and surprise), because of their move beyond ""Planet MP"", statistically end up receiving commensurate pay and improved titles elsewhere. Go figure. XXX,Best part of the job is the oddly cushy benefits package, with some admittedly decent perks (vision & medical reimbursements?!), but this has been slimming down steadily over the years to something more equivalent to the national norm. I guess this is the trade off for the other negatives described herein. XXX,Hardest part of the job is enduring the continuing loss of regular business to more adept competitors. This company's contract work is driven by public funding of state education but this is not a good dependency due to today's political climate. XXX,Spiraling downfall of a once-local gem.XXX,  XXX,This was a great place to work with flexible schedules, generous paid time off, and great benefits.

The different group work in concert to acheive all final data that is required for each sample that is process.The actual protocols we follow are fairly basic, but the volume of samples prove to be a challenge. This challenge is compounded by lack of communication from management when there has been a change to  daily priorities. The workload changes seasonally and we have a high turn over of employees. Training new employees to meet the demand of the season is also challenging due to all the ISO protocols and USDA regulations that need to be followed along with all of the proper lab protocols to obtain quality results.XXX,Up early in the morning for work and you could be done by noon and have the rest of the day off.

The opportunities, and clients provide for fascinating and interesting experiences.XXX,Booz Allen is a very professional environment that encourages its workers to learn and grow. The company offers many training to help young employees sharpen their skill sets.XXX,Good work life balance and company is very supportive on letting employees grow into other opportunities. Benefits are good and pay is very competitive.XXX,Good company to work for. Pay isn't that great unless you can haggle when you get hired. If you don't work at a Booz office, then is the same as any other job. However, there is an unwritten expectation for you to attend after-work functions, and volunteer training. Of course you have to make up that time, so work-life balance becomes ""not so well"" in that perspective. Remote work is very, very seldom and hard to find. That carrot, however, is dangled in front of you. XXX,Management is excellent, but varies person-to-person. They do want to keep people, will provide you will the tools you need to further your career.XXX,Overall, Booz is an excellent company, but you really need to be proactive.XXX,The company is big and the levels of leadership can  be a little daunting. I came to the company to be able to stay with my wife as she PCS'd to her new assignment (they did not have the capability to support this option).  Benefits and culture have changed a lot when they went public and some of the features that endeared me to Booz Allen have slowly dropped off year by year.  It is still easier to leave and comeback at a higher level if you are an associate and above.XXX,There are a lot of important projects that one encounters as  a BAH employee and you meet amazing people. However, the work/life balance is not there.XXX,To provide excellent customer service through phone, email, etc. in timely and accurate manner.  Serve as a liaison between management and customer to improve the customer experience and business productivity.  XXX,Monthly reconciling of pcard and contract to date requests are tedious, because both are due simultaneously as well as maintaining your order productions.

An idea consulting firm to work at  and learn the consulting business.XXX,Good workplace environment. Diversity great in some ways, can improve. Development for entry level employees can vary greatly. Good work-life balance for consulting firms.XXX,I am with baH for almost 12 years and one thing I have learnt is to not run after  promotion until U are working on a project with your direct manager. Your manager has no clue what u do on your day to day job and thus miss/ignore promoting some good deserving employees and eventually losing them to other companies. Just do your bare min and keep getting your yearly raises as the flwxibity with work life balance is great here.XXX,The existing employees were used to writing about other companies strengths and weaknesses. XXX,When they inherited a development project from a reviewed company, they had to hire developer and verification engineers quickly. XXX,The management and employees had to determine the standards and protocols associated with software development. Hard lessons were learned well.XXX,Provides employees with training and opportunity to succeed in the government consulting field. Competitive and diverse workplace.XXX,Flexible schedule, great benefits, variety of work assignments and ability to travel and transfer across the organization.XXX,If you want to understand Booz Allen, read the firm's posted core values.  While at some places the core values are platitudes, at Booz Allen, the core values are real and vibrant.  They guide what we do within the firm, within our teams, and within our client engagements.  XXX,Though government consulting is a highly-regulated business, with the pratfalls associated with working with government clients, the caliber of the people at Booz Allen is simply wonderful.XXX,Participated in a volunteer position for InfraGard. Provided leadership to large community of network security professionals and the FBI. Volunteered for three years in the position.XXX,I loved working for BAH from 2000-2013. The company was awesome until they went Public. After that everything changed and a high percentage of upper management were let go. It became volatile in the government environment and had to start cutting corners.XXX,Booz is a great company especially if you are a self-starter and can get things done.XXX,I worked with some exceptional people at Booz.XXX,Booz is an excellent company.  There are some excellent people that work there, and I made some good friends while I was there.  Unfortunately, I was there during a particularly turbulent time.  In the roughly 3.5 years that I was there, 4 of my career managers left.  That isn't normal at all....come to think of it, maybe I drove them away?XXX,People in the consulting industry often love talking about the consulting industry.  It's politics. I'm the type of person that works to live....most people at booz aren't.XXX,Don't bother killing yourself for that raise - you will get the same 2-4% raise as the person that did the bare minimum. There is a HUGE disconnect between leadership and staff. They have no idea what their employees are doing on a day to day basis, as they are too busy trying to secure their next proposal.  The ""check-ins"" are half hearted at best and usually leadership is just going through the motions. It is a check on the box. BAH employees are constantly brought onto teams that don't really need them - and then need to try and make themselves relevant in some way. XXX,It's a great place to work if you want to show up, do as much as required so you don't get yelled at, and go home to your family. DON'T work here if you want to innovate, be rewarded based on performance (versus how long you can wait it out until the next allotted raise period), and feel like more than another number.XXX,This is my first job out of college and it was a fantastic experience.

Everyone in that sense of the work environment are very nice and wonderful to speak with and learn from. XXX,However, the management style of some is down right unbelievable and unprofessional.  You are not able to think on your own and are expected to be a robot.  If you have ideas outside of the labs you are not allowed to do anything.  You are micromanaged to the point where it borders on plain insulting.  Also, if you ask for more work it is seen as a weakness due to trying to be better then other people.  XXX,It is overall a very unhealthy work enviornment for those who have higher aspirations. XXX,It is a way they control their employees (who are fewer and fewer because they only believe in contractors).  Perm positions are said to be very likely until you start and you realize you would never want to work as a perm employee.

I learned the process of retrieiving business user requirements and transforming them into functional and technical specification documents which included technical and use-case diagrams. Also, creating test cases at the conclusion of each project so that the development team and the end user can test each scenario for errors and bugs helped me understand how the team can interpret requirements from the user-customer and produce a finish product that is rolled out to the business and sales teams.

The work was hard to get done because the systems did not always work the way they should.  Since we where on a dead line this made it difficult to get the job done in a timely manner.  Very stressful jobXXX,There is little to no training at BNY and most of what you learn is how to navigate their ancient systems.  Lower level managers are mostly cool people but there's no oversight on the supervisors beneath them.  Upper management tend to be creeps that won't look at you or say hello when you pass them in the hall.  Your co-workers are usually nice people and everyone is desperately looking for a new job.  The salary is bottom of the barrel and there is likely no end to that in sight.  It's a company that values maximum profit at the lowest cost and shows no concern for the worker bees that help achieve it.  If you need to get your foot in the door it's good for that, otherwise I don't recommend coming to BNY.XXX,My first job out of college was at BNY Mellon.

They have extended me twice and will do a third time but I really would like to get out of being a contractor. XXX,I enjoy going to work, there is always something new to learn and a new Vendor to deal with.XXX,BNY is a very bland company from my experience. Though the people are all very nice and helpful, this place should really only be used as a stepping stone or somewhere to end your career. Benefits are decent, pay is very low, and there is essentially no recognition for employees doing a good job. They need more incentives to get people to look forward to coming to work everyday, otherwise it'll stay the way it is with the entire staff complaining day in and day out.XXX,Loved to work with people. Had a great team. My manager was very good. Overall environment not so great. A lot of politicsXXX,As a Project Manager, your days vary. One day you maybe  working on an ongoing assignment, then next day you are asked to handle a different assignment. You do have deadlines for specific assignments, others may just pop up and need to be handled immediately. Sometimes there are issues where there is no one available to escalate and you have to make the call.

Just google it for yourself.XXX,Lyft is a great company to work for, very flexible schedule and you're able to meet all different types of people while driving all around town. GreatXXX,I love it i make as little or as much as I want when I need, payments are on time. Great cars and fun people to meet, also when you get to certain points you get bonuses and other discount prices.XXX,i learned more about different cultures and mostly the tourists that come to visit from close by in the states to people out of the country. i would recommend this job to anyone who would love to spend time with their families and work on their own time. also if anyone would just want to make some extra money.XXX,the management is poor. Communicating with them is hard.But i learned many routes in orange county and also LA. However, working for this corporate is not beneficial. no benefit included.XXX,most of the days or nights i work are extremely wonderful. you get to meet multiple people with lots of differences between them. you get to talk and socialize with a range of people. and people love what we do.XXX,I love the freedom of working for lyft. Very flexible & the customers are all very polite. The lyft app is very helpful and syncs with your cell phones navigation making the pairing process a piece of cake.XXX,Provide driver service to various customers from different backgrounds, color, and race. All while having conversion pertain to sports, politic, religion, and even their personal affairs. I also offer advice and counsel if they so desires.XXX,I can say that this company tries to do things with drivers interact with other drivers and try to do a little fun events to boost morale. They do little incentives to help with pay . XXX,The downside is based on your city there are not enough Riders requesting the service to really make a consistent income off of just driving aloneXXX,Recently moved to California from Honolulu and I decided to join Lyft Corporate because what's better to get familiarize with the city than driving and get compensation at the same time. It is not my desire to be full time active and make it as a career because I have other interest in what suits me best. But I find myself doing great with the customer service because I am a peoples people who loves to interact with others which makes it a lot faster for me to adapt into a city that brings diversity comes to culture.XXX,The main reason Lyft was a great job opportunity was you really are your own boss in the sense that you could work at any given time to your desire. It's uplifting many times because you're given the experience in interacting with many people around the Chicago land area.XXX,I will clarify what the reviewer from Texas said in his review in plain English:XXX,If there is negative feedback from passengers, Lyft will deactivate your driver account with no warning or explanation, EVEN IF YOU HAVE A HIGH RATING. The first reviewer saying ""the rider is 1005% right"" means that the company does not provide any opportunity to defend yourself, by countering any claims. Passengers are at many times drunk and can be belligerent, or perceive situations incorrectly because of their inebriation.XXX,Since you are not an employee of the company, they do not care if they are treating you in a fair and balanced process - they simply throw you away and activate the next guy to drive these drunk people.XXX,You got no voice at all and anybody can bust you up. Drunks in the morning are hard to go with. Anybody can busted you up. Drunks passenger are 1005 right.XXX,Great way to meet different people and to develop social skills. Great way drive around Arizona. Passengers are always great to drive with.XXX,Pay can be very good on days with active night life and big events. Able to create your own schedule, but you must possess good interpersonal skills in order to receive tips.XXX,Buen trabajo pero las carreras deberían pagarlas con una tarifa más acordeXXX",,,"PeopleXXX,Fast cashXXX,Work when you want, pick up who you want any time you want and tipsXXX,flexible scheduling, comfort in your on vehical & timeXXX,flexiblityXXX,Flexible hours, meet some cool riders, get to see different parts of the city.

I was well respected because i went into work to do a job and finish it and when my day was up i would go home .XXX,* After finding my cubicle (our seats would change regularly), I'd clock in on my computer, bring up all my systems, and answer all calls routed to my line. XXX,* It was the first large company I've worked with (AT&T and DTV). It trained me in XXX,       -Professional customer service (we had scripts to memorize)XXX,       -Using 3-4 programs at once while actively listening to customers (multitasking) XXX,       -How to promote products professionally (commission driven) and successfully. XXX,*Management did have favoritism, however I was never wronged. The environment was extremely fun. There were raffles, games, prizes, and cheers all day, every day. XXX,*The hardest part of the job was timing. Our breaks and lunches were in a tight time frame. At times, a customer would keep us over our lunch, because once a customer is on the line, we must finish assisting, and leave the customer satisfied. Also Management would not give time off for holidays, or approve any of my vacation time, or sick days. I suspected it was due to slight favoritism. XXX,*The most fun part of the job was the friendly games and community... also the great commission. I made over 100,000 for myself in commission alone there. It was great.XXX,Excellent place to work. very supportive people and very good management group.employee benefits also very good. career growth also very good as always more opportunities to explore on different tasks.XXX,It wasn't the most stressful job, but it wasn't very laid back either. A good experience overall, and would recommend to others.XXX,A typical day of work would include being yelled at by customers because we can't give them what they want. We have to schedule installs over a week out, the installs are only in the morning since they last for 6+ hours, and the customers can't place the order over the phone, they have to process it online. All of which causes the customer to be less than reasonable a good portion of the time, and the management doesn't really listen to anything we say when we try to give ideas on how to improve, giving me a less than satisfactory feelings about how the company is run. I have learned how to talk to people the right way to avoid misunderstandings and frustration from either side, and I've learned a lot of how companies work internally. The hardest part of my job would have to be when I can't give a customer what they want, which usually ends up in them asking for my supervisor. In that case I have to carefully de-escalate and explain the entire situation to him/her, and if they still want my supervisor I have to flag one down to have him/her talk to the customer personally and explain everything that I just told them. The best part of the job, I'd say, would be when I finally make a sale. In my department that isn't very often, so when it does happen, its a big deal to the dept. My coworkers are a blessing, they help me get through the day sometimes and are some of my very, very good friends. We work together on repeat calls that come in, giving information and advice on the customer to eachother when needed.XXX,Amazing company who cares for their employees and customers. They value great and hard work and reward accordingly. There really is nothing bad that I can say about them.XXX,Fun atmosphere and great people. Doesn't have the desired growth opportunities I expected and was promised existed. Management and senior staff tend to withhold and guard needed information to perform most duties.XXX,Great place to work, there are many departments allowing multiple opportunists for learning and growth.

XXX,Management can improve more due to many opportunities. The advancement is backwards. It shows to be more about who you know versus what you know. XXX,This is ran by a temp agency and due to high call volume in the call center itself the hiring process is weak. A lot of relatives work together and it can be very dramatic. XXX,The money itself which is the reason everyone comes to work is quick and easy. You are on the phones as agents and customers are calling in to order AT&T service. The sales just pour in versus seeking and working hard for it. XXX,There is commission monthly and agents are making more money then the individuals who manage them. XXX,The perception isn't correct and no one is on the same page. This is a communication/technology company and miscommunication happens too frequently. The technology itself should be top of the line but is complete opposite.

Then I was moved to trainer for new programs. Then I was floor manger helping my co-workers and jumping the que to answer phones, email, and chats. I learned to have a group of my peers under me and run a smooth operation. When I first started management was not so great but once I was moved up to be in management I jumped through hoops to have my team happy and working well with each other. I was for sure by the book but I did make things work smoothly. The hardest part was when I was moving up the chain I had a few issues with a few peers. They were upset I was moved up and they were not. The most enjoyable part was when I become the team leader and I was able to have the over head company come from California and congratulate me on my work and that they have had their eye one me since I started. They knew I had big plans for myself.XXX,Some management members are not always as professional as they should be, which then allows some of the agents to step out of line as well.XXX,I enjoyed that I was kept busy and provided responsibilities.XXX,work long hours and get passed on for promotion by outsiders.XXX",,,"Managers would help if it was needed to be more successful in the workplaceXXX,Commission, good comunity, great break roomXXX,Comfortable Environment, Good People and Good PayXXX,quick money, job security, experienceXXX,Workers, lunchroom, and workstationXXX,Moving up in a companyXXX","Short Breaks, Not much support from floor supportXXX,no vacations or hollidays or benifitsXXX,Less than satisfactory management, Job process has a few hiccupsXXX,management, unequal advancement processXXX,ManagementXXX,No consXXX,If you did not stay when management wanted you to then it was put against you., Management could have been much better, The gossip and childish behavior felt like high school (mainly from management).XXX"

Most of managers didn't have any experience on the phones so they would never know what you were going through but were quick to tell you what to do and when they were placed on the phones for a short time they would freeze up, ask you what to do, or even dodge taking calls. The culture is great. The hardest part of the job is not being able to fix a customers issue even though you know you can since it is out of your power. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with and some of the customer or knowing you have scheduled time in your bucket but you can't use it for months because all the time is blocked off and you have an emergency and your job is on the line.XXX,Great company great vaules.

The customers were alright to say the least, we had our bad eggs but it comes with the territory. Management there often turned the other when it came to favoring customers into doing things that were bank policy but at the end of the day, they were the higher voice and we did whatever I was told to do. A day here very similar, especially because the same faces came in all the time, we would offer financial products to new and current customers that best suited them and some of them took our advice and some did not. I learned how to manage money here, I also learned that a bank is like every other retail store out there.XXX,working hard for low pay, wouldn't go back, management sucks, not worth spending the summer working there, stay away $800 for 2 monthsXXX,Provides excellent customer service by maintaining a current HR and retail leadership education; responsible for store operational standards and provide leadership. Resolve conflict, practice improvement and communication to the teller line.  Educate your team members on identifying sales opportunities and referring customers to appropriate store employees or internal business partners to achieve both store and individual sales revenue goals. Support, mentor and educate team members in their professional growth. Develop and manage team members by recruiting, training and recognizing them, establish and support a cohesive team and advocate a positive work environment.XXX,I worked here from April 2016 - January 2017. I would honestly have to say that this job was not all what they made it out to be in the beginning. Very trashy working place covered by false class.

XXX,Constant threats to be put on probation/ being fired for not selling enoughXXX,Oh and forget that huge bonus that they tell you about you wont get much XXX,Poor management (anyone can get promoted at a place like this) XXX,.............. it just to many consXXX,This is a great work environment. Love the culture and the people around. You will not only learn the work place, but you will also learn about the customer and self. Once you get those completed you will not go back to the way you were. Also need to be mentally prepared for any challenge because it is a bank and it comes with come challenged. Good Luck!XXX,Overall this is a great company to work for with helpful team oriented co workers and a conservative banking approach. Benefits are good but average for the banking industry.  If you're happy in retail banking and want to be behind the scenes rather than store front I doubt you'll find much better. If you're interested in securities and wealth or looking for something with high income this is not the place for you.  XXX,Biggest issues come down to the following. lagging technology compared to other institutions which really hampers operations when volume is up as well as employee ability to provide best service. Micro management strategies from certain levels of management in certain departments. Inconsistency in management style , approach and policy interpretations(especially around flexibility and PTO). detachment of certain operations that need to be better integrated and transparent.XXX,Had great benefits, made some great friends, and learned a lot about banking here. Overall this is great company to work for even though i worked here when it was called commerce bank but i don't doubt they don't have the same culture as thenXXX,It is an ok place to work as long as you are in a good location. Some stores have really good managers that wont you to go and the store shows it. others not so muchXXX,Great pay, great environment to be in. The management is awesome and care about the employees as much as the customers.Customers are very generous. The people you work with are more like family than any other job that I have experienced.XXX,Banks are no longer banks, they are stores.  TD is a retail banker.  They say they are focused on customer satisfaction but they are not.  All they want is sales.  They are nice to their employees when they are hitting their sales goals.  Benefits are expensive, college reimbursement is cheap and they make you jump through hoops to get it, and the hours are terrible.  Customers are rude and so is upper management.  The only way to advance is to keep kissing butts all the way up the ladder.  Knowing how to do your job and giving good customer service is not rewarded.  They only care about SALES.XXX,Great place to work.XXX,Loved my boss, she truly cared about her team.XXX,Hours are not the best, they have changed though.XXX,Laid back environment.XXX,Management truly cares about employees.XXX,TD Bank is a great place to work. They allow and encourage their employees to take ownership of their work. They also challenge their employees to be the best they can be. I have grown a lot in my career with TD Bank.XXX,I currently work for TD and absolutely love it. Benefits are great, staff is wonderful, overall is a fantastic place to work. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good career startery or PT job to make some extra cash.XXX,-Typical day at work has its ups and downsXXX,-Learning new things everyday to keep yourself up to date with anything new that TD may offer to customers.XXX,I worked with TD Bank and it was a great company to work for. The only thing that was a problem to me was the management. I think TD Bank hires anyone to be in management, even if they don't meet the qualifications. I had to deal with horrible managers in my TD career. When you use the ""change of command""  to report them (the regional managers) nothing is done.XXX,Typical call center- clean. Worked there for 1 yrXXX,Management act likely care but they're just covering for themselves. XXX,Too many ""cliques"", if you're not very talkative or don't care to make small talk you won't stand out. You have to kiss up to not only your team manager but any other manager in any other department to get recognized. They say they want you to move up...But there's never any room to move up, it's competitive. Also, there are way too many metrics and goals you have to make, unrealistic ones. They want you to 1.

There is plenty of opportunity for advancement. The atmosphere is very relaxed. The teams I have worked on have always been flexible with family situations and very understanding.XXX,Work is busy as soon as you log in, and stays busy till you log off.

Doing this without making you feel belittled.

Great for young adults fresh out of college that need direction. Feels like a frat house at times. Work life balance great.

Really good people to work with an dependXXX,on, had things there to help with.XXX,Groupon is a fun place to work. It is easy to get to, and an easy place to make friends. People who work in Image Design are typical tech/startup personalities, with active lifestyles, hobbies, and high levels of competence. Image designers have relatively flexible schedules, but are required to meet a certain average productivity level, which is measured on a digital meter, so work sometimes feels like a game to get enough points in. At first, it is hard to get in all the points, but you soon learn how to work quickly and effectively. Groupon has many social groups you can join, as well as athletic activities. There is free coffee, free vitamin water, and sometimes free snacks.There is a game room, a swingset, a crying area, a DJ in the elevator, and a giant cat in a spaceship. Compensation was terrible ($13 hourly) but morale was great. Its a really great gig for recent graduates or people just moving to the city.XXX,Working at Groupon is by no means terrible. You will have a comfortable job, but most likely few challenges that utilize your education or skills. Most days I did the exact same thing, over and over again, down to the button click. This is why I eventually became bored and had to leave. There is room for advancement, but you have to be able to get through the monotonous entry level jobs before pursuing that, which proved difficult. Management leaves a little to be desired, but it was a very young company when I worked there. Chances are they've improved since then.

Too many contractors.XXX,This company is a wonderful company to work for. I started in the residential call center and quickly worked my way up. Great benifits, and decent pay. However a word of caution, I would not advise taking a job with them just at this time. I'm honestly confused why they are hiring more people, while they are in the middle of massive layoffs of well over 2,000-2,500 employees...which is no secret. A simple google search will find multiple reports of their layoffs.XXX,As a former employee I wouldn't tell you to get this job. The job wasn't good at all. You don't get to really choose your schedule. You get a seniority date so when they do shift swaps you get what you get. Preferences don't really give you what you want. The money is good but you will be stressed out. You move around everything 3 months to be on a different team. Management is not the best either.  Don't work here get your education and go else where. This job is not for everyone. Angry customers are not fun but you have to do what you can for them. Don't get sick you will get a write up. Points system sucks. Frontier is disorganized in some ways. Hopefully they change it.  I would say try it out first if you don't like it leave. Every experience is different. Good luck!XXX,I had fun working at Frontier the people are talented working with FIOS and VOIP. Unfortunately the company was falling on difficult times and I was caught in a reduction of force.XXX,They do what they can to create a positive work environment but the majority of incoming calls are from angry hostile customers with network service issues. XXX,The broad spectrum of customer complaints can make for an interesting work day but I found the level of abuse I was expected to tolerate was unacceptable for me.XXX,Had a great experience working for Frontier Communications.   Frontier offered me job promotions, new experiences, and room for professional growth.  I have nothing but positive to say about Frontier.XXX,AS frontier was taking over territories from verizon customers prices went up without being told. Also they couldn't get there on demand channels working.XXX,Frontier was a good company to work for where you had the autonomy to be creative in meeting production goals. As an internet service provider you are constantly having to adapt to a forever changing market along with stiff competition.XXX,A typical day at work in the Assignment department will always include dealing with a crisis or outage, and reacting to those things that are out of our control.

The reason for this is actually bad longterm.  A new account executive, which is a B2B sales position has the opportunity to sell many different types of solutions to a customer. Therefore, an active AE can get significant exposure in mane areas.  However, this is also indicative that Frontier lacks a strategic direction.  Management is strong in some areas and weak in others.

Everyday was something new, the job was a joy of it's own.XXX,It's a cool place for getting some experience but not somewhere I would start a career. They will hire anyone to fill a spot.  No professionalism at all. From managers to customer service reps. Reasons why customers disliked the service. I wouldn't recommend working here overall.XXX,Great company with amazing benefits. Perfect for someone fresh out of college. I would for sure recommend this position to a friend or family member.XXX,Great company culture. Diverse organization striving to promote local business and people. The company has awesome events as well.XXX,great workplace and great people. however there is not that much room to grow. a lot of the roles offered are just sales and growth within sales. however, the fully stocked kitchen was amazing!XXX,Great and fun place to work but the opportunities for advancement are poor at the Chicago location.XXX,Co-Workers are great and the management team is very fun.XXX,This is definitely a work hard play hard position so if you don't have that kind of work ethic, this isn't for you. But with the extensive training, fun atmosphere and supportive work environment, it's hard to now work hard.XXX,Too much time is spent attending to incidents or working around incidents from other teams. Many managers are new/first-time managers and lack the necessary skills to be effective at their jobs while others are handi-capped by the company's culture of super hands off management. Morale is generally poor-whatevs.XXX,Great company that sells a great product, but there's not many interesting positions to move up from entry-level.  Extensive sales training, and excellent benefits.XXX,Each day consists of a high volume of cold calls and emails sent out to SMB owners. Management varied, with some managers just one year out of the account executive role. Issues with that were panic when things weren't going well.XXX,Yelp is a great company. Employees are treated well with a fully stocked kitchen for breakfast and lunch, great health benefits, and great people. The pay is definitely on the lower side. The most negative aspect was the job itself. The day to day is strictly cold calling businesses to sell the advertising program. It can be very monotonous. Also many of the business owners are busy and do not want to speak to you. It's a hard job to find enjoyment in.XXX,I spent almost 2 years at Yelp. It's a rollercoaster. Full of great colleagues, awesome mentors, and a challenging job (but once you get the hang of it you'll pitch-on-the-fly and feel like a boss).XXX,You are responsible for the full sales cycle. From introduction to close. You will have difficult conversations about selling them Yelp ads with SMB prospects. It's challenging, but what you will also have a team, an organization, readily available for you to learn and execute with.XXX,I owe everything I know about my profession to this opportunity I got here.XXX,Thanks Yelp! :)XXX,Yelp is pretty cool.I would recommend it to someone if there was a job opening they were into.XXX,Great free snacks. Not so great compared to other companies in the area, but definitely above average. XXX,Beer! I've never liked hanging out at an office after hours before. I do that somewhat regularly here.XXX,Flexible Hours with the option to work from home when necessary.XXX,Sweet health benefits and they're pretty generous with stock even for us lowly user ops workers.XXX,Average good-ish time off/sick timeXXX,Overall company good about providing important updatesXXX,Unfortunately none of this is enough to make up for the crushing boredom that eventually sets in with moderating content. They tell you straight up when you start not to really expect this to go anywhere. It's kinda sad since we have a lot of talented, intelligent people on the team wasting their smarts. I can feel myself getting dumber from all the terrible punctuation and block paragraphs that I have to read all day long. Go on though, do it a year or two and then move along. It's a great job as one of your first out of college. You don't have to wear real clothes or show up at a specific time and that's all real real nice.XXX,""Fun"" environment for the most part. Though in our particular department there is a lot of forced fun that really gets irritating for a cynic like me. It's kinda silly since they actually advertise the position as being for introverts. It's a little tone deaf. Like the time they had us spin some Harry Potter sorting hat for assigned seats at lunch. Yep... actual adults arranged that forcedXXX,  XXX, mingling situation with a group full of introverts. They also recently instituted music on Friday afternoons and it is the worst. XXX,There are a lot of management things that make the job really stressful. But I think I mostly just get petty and mad because I am so so bored. XXX,You'll have fun for a while doing this job probably. But it really does show you a bad side of humanity. There are some awful opinions that I was not used to coming across. That can be tough. But it's nothing awful like if you were moderating beheadings content for that popular video upload website.XXX,  XXX,70+ outbound cold calls daily to SMB's in a assigned territory. Setting 15-20 minute appointments with clients to discuss and pitch the Yelp platform. These BO's already have Yelp pages that most likely have traffic to that listing. Pitch and close the prospects. Get to quota, make some decent cash. XXX,However, you must follow the process and be a quick learner. It's easy to fall into habits and not grind it out. Stand up. Take each call with a clean slate, but don't be afraid to mess up and quickly try out a new method again.  XXX,Yelp can be a great place for a couple years, but it's a daily grind and not for the weak minded.XXX,Great company to work for with a startup culture. Interacted with my peer on a daily basis to create a strategy to bring in sales for the online food ordering application.XXX,Similar to plenty of other reviews I have read, tons of kids fresh out of college who have no idea that there ARE better options out there. They lure you in with all the free food and music and games and stuff but dont tell you about the cold calling and if you dont hit these metrics on the head then you will be shown the door. Managers may ""act"" like they care about you or your home life but at the end of the day you are just a number. training structure is way out of order. They throw you to the wolves the second week on the job and then give you information in a training 2-3 weeks later that would have increased your odds of getting a appointment/sale. Lots of tasks to accomplish on a daily basis but not enough time to complete them all and then you are hit with the no excuses card when you are not pulling your weight. XXX,On the flip side, fantastic place to work, free food all day, game rooms and music, lots of stuff nearby.XXX,Great for younger kids with no responsibilities!!XXX,One of my favorite parts about my work day is that each day is unpredictable. I never know who I am going to talk to and as a result, I get to learn about so many unique and interesting businesses, people and meet a lot of entrepreneurs that educate me, too.XXX,The best perk is definitely the people and culture… and I suppose our brand new office with shuffleboard, ping pong and Rock Band. But truly, I get to work side by side with amazing, talented people every day.XXX,Yelp is a fun place to work with a youthful environment.  Through a combination of hard work and getting a good territory you have an opportunity to be very successful.XXX,No one likes cold-calling, but that's what you're going to be doing every day. Yes, you get the freedom to churn the whole sales process from open calling to closing, but managing that while handling objections is a tough sell. Co-workers are friendly, and management could be held to another standard. Hard to differentiate managers as friend or micromanaging sticklers, because people move up quick in this job. It can be very emotionally draining and dry, so mentality is everything in this job.XXX,I am given tools to be my own boss and impact my own small business. I am also able to change businesses in a positive light. Every work day was an extremely exciting opportunity.XXX",,,"Free foodXXX,Great coworkers, awesome events.XXX,breaks, ping pong, outingsXXX,Fully stocked kitchen, stress relief resources like ping pong tables, lounges, couches, TV.

This may include setting up the laboratory for upcoming experiments, printing/e-mailing any applicable materials to co-workers and customers, and/or analyzing previous data I've obtained through research projects.  I've been with the company for 5 years and have had the same manager since day 1.  I have a lot of respect for him because he is more of a mentor than boss to me.  He has an open door policy that allows me to visit with him and talk about anything (work, life, etc.).  The hardest part of the job is trying to fit everything in an 8 hour work day.  Because of my many responsibilities it can be difficult at times to manage the deliverables I'm asked to complete.

The facade has worked really well with job candidates, the press, college interns, trade associations, and philanthropic organizations. Every single action made is purely for a photo opp and a press release. Managers who foster a hostile work environment are paraded around like heroes to distract from the fact that they're actually really horrible people. Doing good work and producing real results doesn't matter. Management respects people who are overly aggressive, rather than kind-hearted, down to earth professionals who are the best at what they do. Across the board, people are paranoid about losing their jobs and feel the need to prove themselves which is also creating a nasty work environment. The negativity is spreading like wildfire and it's sad to say that most of the good people are leaving as soon as they get another job.XXX,•	Operate as service point-of-contact for help-desk, helping to diagnose, troubleshoot, and resolve approximately 10 tickets per day.

My coworkers found it fun to annoy each other and goof off when they had the chance, making work harder for others.

Overall, enjoyed working at this firm.XXX,Technologies division is in the process of transitioning into using the Agile Project Management methodologies. However, they are forcing this into the organization regardless whether or not the methodology Is appropriate for the area, which makes it difficult to meet objectives. Minimal training was provided before being forced into using the methodology.XXX,Company was definitely more interested in its bottom line than employees. Decisions often didn't take employees into consideration.

Very clean environment.XXX,working in a call center is tedious and aggrevation...  If you have worked in this feild before and are fine with it, then amex is probably one of the best paying telemarketing jobs out there.XXX,I have worked for American Express for over ten years and gone through a lot of changes.  I feel it has been a great job but I feel that employees get lost because of how large the company is.  I have worked in many capacities with American Express and feel like it is time for a new adventure which is why I decided to go back to school to pursue my Bachelors degree.XXX,American Express used to be a GREAT place to work - but no more.  Company culture - especially within technologies - is shifting rapidly and is becoming very focused on short-term goals at the expense of the employees.  Work-life balance is laughable. Meetings with offshore teams at all hours (10pm, 5am common).  Vacations frequently canceled. Preference to hire from outside rather than promote from within.XXX,robotic, dialer-calling.... scripted conversations required. management was good. Work environment was great. very corporate, not personal. it was not the right job for meXXX,The problem with Amex is that there is a huge disconnect between Business team & Technology teams.XXX,Its a good place to work with others.XXX,Each day the travelers cheques came in and all balancing, filing, photocopying was processed. It was a paper environment.XXX,As time progressed the paper environment turned to computer submissions more and more.XXX,Management was great.XXX,Going with the flow and learning new and modern processes was awesome and uplifting!!XXX,The hardest part seemed to be the new processes at first, then it just all fell into place - looking back - how far modern technology had come!!XXX,Most enjoyable was seeing the transition.XXX,I really like the group I work with in IT Operations. Everyone is highly skilled and knows their job inside and out. Service Owners care about their people but above that level everyone else seems to only care about securing their own future within American Express and are extremely disconnected on what is going on at the ground level. I believe company is what you make of it and we have fun whenever we can but never lose focus on our daily tasks that need to be completed. I have learned so much as I have worked for 6 different managers in my time at AMEX and I've tried to learn something from each one.XXX,A lot to learn and atmoshpere was really good at the place of my work and team which had was really very cooperative. the best place to learn about every thing.XXX,The management lacked professionalism.   My first day the manager told me personal information about another employee and stated her meds were not working.  She is still there.XXX,It was ok while it lasted. Need more professional managers. The environment in which working at the workstation was not clean enough to work. Better managers.XXX,I feel that this company is a great place to work and also has a very desirable amount of people that are always wanting to help with any questions you may have.

I got to know clients on a very personal level having to work with them in their homes. The job it'self was very satisfying, but there is no management over clients.

They were very nice and would call you every so often to ask how everything was going at work.XXX,With Collabera, I worked at CAT in Denison, TX.  I enjoyed my position while working there because I knew exactly what my job requirements were and had the knowledge to achieve my duties.  I appreciated that the management team gave me direction and tools, and allowed me to come up with my own techniques/processes to complete the task at hand.XXX,My co-workers and I were very successful at dividing the workload and completing the tasks that were assigned to us.  We actually completed our project 6 months earlier than expected.  This was partially due to the reports that I created to show and changes within the system on a daily basis. This report prevented duplicate efforts since there were several departments working on the same project.XXX,The hardest part of the job was when a supplier didn't respond at all to a request that was sent to them. To tackle this obstacle, emails were sent with follow up reminders.  If we continued to receive no response, the supplier's lack of response was escalated to the management team for further action.XXX,I truly enjoyed working with a fun group of people at CAT.

They have a history of being a fair and balance employer.XXX,When I first started working at Teva, I actually enjoyed coming to work.  The work environment slowly became more and more toxic over the years due to management's lack of involvement when it came to addressing bad apples in the crew.  It seems like all of the good employees come and go while the bad ones, the ones that make coming to work dreadful, hang around.  Management and HR also tend to not be very forthcoming with information to it's employees about the future of the company.  There always seems to be rumors of downsizing and layoffs.

Work was stimulating and I had a good relationship with immediate management. The team I ran had fantastic camaraderie and, I like to think, worked happily and efficiently. The hardest part of the job was working with systems that were unsuited to the task they had to perform and having to cope with inadequate IT provision. I particularly loved the varied nature of the job - editing, liaising with other depts (ad dept, subscriptions, PRs, advertisers, marketing).XXX,A typical day at work usually includes fixing watches, ringing up sales, faxing invoices and filing, and handling any customer issues. I've learned about the many aspects of watches and working with them with precision. Working in a management position has taught me to deal with customers on a higher level, to build relationships with our host store, to learn how to complete invoices and how to juggle scheduling and direction of employees.

I'd then test various games, review open bugs and find new bugs through out the day. I'd get to chat with some of the people near by and eventually got to sit with my friends and joke around with them. Eventually some of the games would be closed for testing and we'd have to test different games for overtime. Finally when that was complete we'd shuffle off, tired and bored back to our homes.XXX,I learned to develop my critical eye for error, communication and writing skills and how to think outside of the box. I had to break the game and that meant to play it in odd and strange ways that don't fit my play style.XXX,Managment felt just right. They weren't over bearing like some companies, but they were always around to help or correct you. They were knowledgeable in their craft and knew how to put you in the right direction.XXX,The coworkers were fun and energetic. They knew the job itself was boring, so they tried to have fun with it. They would challenge each other on finding bugs or just playing the game. They would joke and make the overall experience fun. They were by far the best reason for going to work. you wanted to catch up and enjoy their company. they were friendly, helpful and supportive.XXX,The hardest part of the job was staying awake. The games you play were generally boring and made for a younger audiance, however some of the games were actually big hits. Either way you'd play these games for weeks and months on end. It gets boring and you get tired.XXX,  XXX, XXX,The best part of the job was the people. Every one there loves video games and wants to see a bright future for games and gamers. It's easy to make friends and connections. Also, at the end of the day, you are playing games. It's not the funnest way to play, but you could be working as a cashier instead.XXX,  XXX,A typical day at work compares to a typical day in the life of a hardcore gamer. This company is really good at providing the best products to their wide fan-base of loyal games. The management team is wonderful and helpful.XXX,Everyday was different and complexed. Gained a lot of experience in regards to facilities and construction project management. Being on-call 24/7 was tasking and challenging at times. Gained a lot of friends & extended family members.XXX,I come in grab a build then start play testing on the project that I am working on then find bugs on the area I am in then report and crash to my leads. Then if found any right then up or check if they are not in the system already. I learned that you have to quick and on top of your game in the QA be fast and quick. My management where good people had no problems with them every time I asked a question I get it back quick. Co-workers where enthusiastic, fun, smart, and joyful, love working in that environment.XXX,Typical day is to play video games and write up reports about bugs found in game.XXX,Nothing special, night shift, decent team. High turn over rate, it's definitely a temporary type of job.XXX,2K Games continually stayed current with the trends in technology infrastructure and industry practices. Working for a studio of over 300 on site employees for over four years taught me the skills necessary to work in a fast paced, professional environment with consistently changing needs and requirements. The projects that were required to keep our studio at the cutting edge of business were always changing. A typical day would certainly include tackling dozens of help desk tickets that either halted or impacted the work flow for artists, engineers, marketers and management, setting up hardware for new hires, and working on long term projects such as upgrading our asset tracking system or adding UPS battery backup units to all employees work stations. XXX,Since I remained at the company for 2 years and a few months, I witnessed the complete overhaul of upper management and the move from Westlake Village to Northridge. Both facilities were good, but there was a time when they had packed too many testers onto the test floor in the Northridge facility. This led to sharing computers, cramped spaces, and sometimes loss of personal belongings, which led to extremely unhappy testers, and a bad work environment. Testers were told to care more about quantity over quality of bugs, which I believe forced the testers to write up anything they could, clogging the database with useless bugs (dupe, by design, NAB, WNF) and angering the developers. Management was then blinded by bug counts, and this allowed a tester with less skill to move up the rankings quicker than a tester who paid attention to detail.XXX,I worked in a small division of 2k and I didnt feel it was managed as well as it should have been. However, my experience with the overall organization was good. The division I worked in closed a few months after I left.XXX",,,"Friendly work enviornment, nice office, casual enviornment, well managedXXX,Many perks; met awesome peopleXXX,Had pot locks on fridaysXXX,You get to play games all dayXXX","Required overtime, had quota to fill, boringXXX,Tasking being on-call 24/7XXX,Short jobXXX,Gaming doesnt feel like fun anymoreXXX"

If you have a family, they require a doctor's not even if you're out for one day. They aren't friendly, no ""good morning"", or ""how's everything going"" , and don't really care to get to know you either. They don't talk to you, and have no time for you. Have you ever worked for a company that doesn't give you a paid break every 4 hours, well don't work here. You can be making a phone call and away from your desk for 10 minutes, but you're required to stay extra. The people are nasty, and they play favorites, so don't rub them the wrong way, because you'll be an outkast. To make matters worse there's NO WORK.

It's hilarious that they will tell you that they are competitive with other banks which is a complete joke.  Since I was in a commercial real estate group.

The company compensates well and provides incredible health benefits. However because of this, upward mobility is difficult and the company is rather bureaucratic in their efforts to promote employees.XXX,Overall, a very solid Bank. A little too politically correct for my taste. New HR leadership was good for San Francisco PR but the truth is well managed.XXX,No upward mobility as they have eliminated all positions between entry level and supervisor. There is just no way to advance through the company. Entry level now has to do more of the duties from the positions that were removed at a lower rate of pay.

This was my first working in this field and I love it. I have never worked with people that has mental problems but they're just like the rest of us. They are so much fun to work with, their different personality are adventurous.XXX,If you want to devote your entire career to civil service, slowly moving up the ranks and owing your life to the city, then this is for you. XXX,The cubicle life and structure of management creates a feeling of captivity. I felt mostly that the strict roles and management got in my way (creatively, constructively) and didn't allow for much autonomy or respect for talent and abilities. The morale is generally low and turnover is high. You will be a cog in the wheel and will be overlooked and underutilized. The benefits are NOT that great. Sub par in-network doctors and 2 weeks vacation earned after 6-12 months probation. XXX,Mostly importantly, do NOT WORK FOR THE CAT TEAM. The team leader is highly inappropriate, unprofessional and sets impossible standards to meet all while over-familiarity acting as a best friend to employees. She speakers negatively and inappropriately about others colleagues and then will smile to their faces. There have been 2 recent terminations in a 3 month period and would have been a 3rd if someone hadn't been transferred. Worse is that the management above supports these practices and doesn't do anything about the common denominator here. This management style severely limited the workers' abilities and undermined their talents. Find an agency where you can be recognized and respected and don't have to deal with permanent civil servants who negatively contribute to the workplace and cannot be removed.XXX,The Department of Health is a refreshing place to work.

Don't forget to be ready to be written up weekly with lots of threats to be fired while being told fairy tales that you could make $20,000 a month. By the way, they don't just threaten to fire you, they really do it. 2 slow weeks and you are gone. 4 times not hitting your 125 calls per day in one month you are gone, even if you have high sales. XXX,Are there good points? Yes, they did teach some good sales techniques, they did feed us often, and the $35,000 base is comparable to other centers.XXX,The days started at 5 am every morning. We would meet and discuss the days schedule/goals. The staff was very young and self - motivated. Everyone worked together as a team to accomplish goals. Really enjoyed working here.XXX,*** take note the only decent reviews ARE NOT SALES IN WESTLAKE OR AZ****XXX,Stay away from the sales lure...The management and sales culture are completely sold out to the almighty dollar and do not care about their employees or their customers.  You have to crank out 150 calls per day - work ""mandatory overtime?"" and if you don't you are lambasted and treated even worse...your ""requirements"" change by the month and sometimes by the hour based on the VP sales mood and that trickles down and sucks the life out of any real productivity.XXX,Consultative sales approach, my foot!  They tell you to lie to the customer.XXX,The most dark, negative, manipulative and awful place.  Not to mention they do have their ""sell outs"" favorites that they feed the big accounts to.  More of those big accounts are wising up that they are not cared about beyond their credit card.XXX,The turn over is constant...read the other reviews.  Just sayingXXX,The salary is great, if they don't give you a lousy book.  If they give you a lousy book, there isn't anything you can do about it.  They have no readily apparent criteria for selecting who gets the most productive books.  It appears if they like you, you get it all; hand fed prequalified leads, big books, time off, etc.  If the phone rings, you better pick it up and if it isn't one of your clients, you better close it anyway and then happily walk your money over to the chosen one who owns the account.  That's right.  Give the money away,  and then you can attend the bonus ceremony where they award the chosen ones with big bonus bucks for closing a lot of business.  Of course, the fact that you and many others closed a lot of business for the chosen ones, doesn't count.  You don't count.  Naturally, most of the inbound calls were for the larger, more productive books, so you can wind up giving away a lot of the business you worked to close.  If you don't do it, you're not a team player.  If it wasn't so insane it might be funny.  I can't believe I subjected myself to this.XXX,If you're doing new business, good luck with that.  You're just feeding the chosen ones.  Have fun making those 100 dials per day.  You better meet quota for phone time too, or else probation!  Nah, it doesn't matter if you closed a lot of business and met your quota.  If you didn't hit call time or dials, you're on probation.  It was like working in the Twilight Zone for me.   People were always on probation.  Then they come by and beat you with a verbal stick to motivate you to get on the phone and closeXXX,  XXX, more business.

They worked with me to create this position and it's been a really great 4 years working for MBG.XXX,A great work environment - they provide outstanding training and then let you do your thing! Since they hire very professional people, this type of management works well for everyone that is motivated and has self-discipline. The compensation is great and so are the benfitsXXX,I've been a technical recruiter for over a decade and I made the switch to MBG about 4 years ago. My quality of life has improved, I can afford to give my children the kind of education I want, and I work with people who care about me as a person. While hard work is expected in this line of work, it feels fun because of the vibe given off by management. The office staff is great and I hope I continue working here for years to come.XXX,The management is just awful. The work environment is unpredictable and hostile most times. The manager curses and yells at his employees and threatens his employees to motivate by fear.XXX,The management team (in Portland as well as in the Bay area) will verbally call you out in front of the team. They will criticize you and tell you you're a failu)re. They have also told the team personal information that I shared in confidence with the entire company, medical information. There are no boundaries for this manager. (Rhymes with Candy Town).XXX,Overall this company is a hostile place to work and I have never been more miserable. Perhaps some people are able to work in that type of environment but I would say 95% can't or will not stay long. They have really high turnover because of ""the manager"" in the Portland office and they way he treats his people.XXX,All I can say is don't be deceived when you first walk into the office. I know I was. It all looks great. Do your due diligence and check around. Call a few people that have worked there.XXX,We will all tell you the same thing, to run for your life.XXX",,,"Good releationship with clientsXXX,Rate is okayXXX,nice officeXXX","health insurance too expensiveXXX,No contact, you're not important so watch out for yourselfXXX,everythingXXX"

NREL hosts thousands of dedicated and talented people, but the executive management team has reduced communication (both channels and information) in the last year following new leadership.  This research engine hosts some of the most sophisticated facilities and capabilities in the world for studying energy efficiency, and if you're a research scientist or engineer, it could be very fun to work here.  However, if you do anything on the business support side of the house, you are held in low esteem.  Project management rigor is virtually nonexistent, resulting in poorly planned and sloppily executed projects.  Business units are now more siloed than ever, and there is little integration between them, resulting in increasing inefficiencies.  Funding is largely from Congress, although there is increasing emphasis on acquiring industrial partnerships.XXX,Assisted in the development of a model of a LASER ANNEALING SYSTEM that will produce better PV Cells (programming with LAB View).XXX,It was a pleasure working at NREL and to be a part of their mission.  I was very proud of the laboratory's accomplishments while I was there.XXX,Pros: Great company!  A good place to retire.  Easy going. Culture is nice.  People are nice.  Great pay. Great Benefits.  XXX,Cons: Not for the ambitious.  Glass ceilings.XXX,Great place to work in; I enjoyed my tenure as an intern. Everyday I get to work on exciting problems and the colleagues are just wonderfulXXX,Like anywhere, your experience as an employee at NREL depends upon your direct management. I've been lucky enough to have a manager that's alright. With budget cuts over the past few years, things are a bit tight, and some divisions could use a moral boost.XXX,A very good place to work. They involve you in great projects which you really want specially in early stages of your career.XXX,NREL mission is superb. Renewable energy has potential to be the way of the future. The downside is that it's funding by the national government could be better. Other than that, the atmosphere is great, and the work-life balance is respected. Benefits are also a plus.XXX,Inexperienced technical teams - bad solutions result in bad performance. Unwilling or unable to accept criticism or suggestion. Learning as they go - but leave a wake of problems behind as they jump to the next new project.XXX,Has a nice cafeteria.XXX,Budgets and funding are poorly managed, it would appear that some in the leadership may be involved in corruption and misappropriation of finances.XXX,Amazing facility and an amazing town. There for only a short time in one department, but it is a fantastic place to even visit.XXX,National Renewable Energy Lab is the excellent place to work with very high tech equipment and very helpful and skillful employees. Definitely recommend.XXX,You better make sure you are an expert at what you're applying for before you accept the job offer. NREL only hires the best, the flawless, the ultra-intelligent systematic super humans. XXX,There is little training and zero to little mentoring for your specific job. You are expected to learn quickly and independently, without much guidance. Most people are willing to help, but your manager will most likely be informed and irritated if you are continuously asking for help (even if it's a new type of task). Don't put your trust in everyone, because if they do not like you or are unsatisfied with what you are doing, they will tell on you like a tattling child. If management decides that you are not performing to their expectations (they are usually so busy, they don't actually know what you are doing half the time and go by what others tell them), or you are not intuitively catching on to the functions of federal government fast enough, or your manager doesn't like your personality (combined with pointing out every flaw and not praising the positives), they will fearlessly terminate you without warning.XXX,Tips:XXX,Make sure you treat your managers like superiors and always act professional around them. XXX,Treat everyone with respect because they all deserve it. XXX,Read about NREL's programs and research in your free time (after work because you won't have time while you are there) to become more familiar with everything, but don't report those hours on your time sheet.XXX,NREL highly values education, so the more you have the better. XXX,Dress professionally, act professionally, do notXXX,  XXX, share about your personal life.XXX,On the plus side- they have great benefits and everyone who works at NREL is extremely intelligent and an expert in their field.XXX,  XXX,They care about their people and strongly believe in their mission.XXX,Reconciling vendor invoices against terms of contracts, including labor rates and occurrence pricing.

XXX,The most enjoyable part of the job was completing and awarding a complex procurement.XXX,A great location to work, but limited by management decisionsXXX,I learned much more at this job than I could possibly include here. Most importantly, I learned to independently conduct multiple high-level experiments, manage several projects, and communicate effectively with other busy co-workers.XXX,I worked for Autozone for a long time and most of the time i really liked it.  As a store manager the demand from upper management was unrealistic.XXX,Careen advancement for people without Ph.D. is very limited. Even with Ph.D., opportunity for those with hands-on and evolution instead of revolution mind set is not that great.  Those who can charm others with their fantasy move to the top; those who do the hard work stay at the bottom.XXX,The National Renewable Energy Laboratory protective Force officer job is the classic situation of it  ""Much to do about nothing."" The basic Patrol function is nothing more than checking and rechecking the same locked doors to the same buildings over the course of an 8 to 12 hour shift.  The emergency preparedness procedures are overly detailed and convoluted. This step by step process for things such as fire alarms medical emergencies and HVAC issues is often used as ammunition against security if the slightest thing goes wrong or someone complains about how it was handled even if handled correctly. The communication and dispatch center for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory often doesn't work due to power issues, making it difficult for security personnel to do their jobs. The worst part of the National Renewable Energy Lab protective Force officer position is the security management and supervision. Security supervision will often hideout for several hours expecting the regular security personnel to do all of the work. Security supervision often will not make on the spot supervisory decisions and leave it up to the regular officer to ""Make the Call""  only to be criticized later for making the decision that they made. Often especially during shift change security supervision will argue and yell and sometimes use profanity at the other officers in front of other employees. These arguments were usually about last minute call offs, schedule changes and disagreements on policy and procedures. Sometimes these arguments escalated and almost became physical confrontations. WhenXXX,  XXX, all of these above mentioned issues were brought to the attention of upper management, nothing was ever done and the behavior continued.

The good was that it allowed our company to tap into more resources and we got better employee perks.  The bad was that we went from a small tech company to being a small cog in a behemoth of a international company.

During the interview they stressed to me that I would have ""numbers"" or ""metrics"" I would have to meet monthly, which I am comfortable with due to 4 years of call center experience. I knew that we would also be doing outbound cold type calls to leads given to us. However, whenever I had a potential person of interest to get into school, the ""high pressured sales tactics"" kicked in with management. If a student needed time to think about getting back into school, or they had a huge family crisis they needed to deal with, I would follow up with them in a few weeks to see how things were going.

However, the opportunity to expand and grow in the finance field is rather limited and doesn't fully align with my ultimate career goals.XXX,I need to put 150 characters here. It was a good experience and I learned a lot when working here. The culture and atmosphere simply fostered excellence.XXX,Large variety of challenging clients & situations across the globe and incredible people to work with.  Plenty of opportunity and ability to forge your own path.XXX,They really try to build you up and make you succeed in your time there, helping with advancement.XXX,They keep the kitchen fully stocked and have regular reviews to ensure the entire team understands where the projects stand and how to improve/lessons learned.XXX,A place where you can explore you area of interest. Good people. Daily you will learn new things . You can travel all around the Globe on various engagements.XXX,Come in early and enter day in a very easy going environment. It was a lot of tedious work but it flew by and it was a great learning experienceXXX,Set up equipment for consultants. The processes of internal technology. Co-workers were self centered. Working around the strict budget placed on IT.XXX,Many e-mails.  Travel arrangements. Meeting scheduling.XXX,Learned to be extra pro-active.XXX,Management of support staff is fair.XXX,Great peers - always ready to help each other.XXX,Hardest part of job is constant change of schedules.XXX,Enjoyable part of job is figuring out complex travel arrangements and offering solutions.XXX,Exceptional workplace where you get to work with some really smart people. You get to do interesting work in a fast paced environment.  XXX,Limited advancement opportunities and professional development.XXX,Fun environment where employees become a close knit community and become life long friends.  Employees are highly intelligent and have rock solid values.  The benefits are incredible, and work/life balance is a priority.  The only drawback is that there isn't any growth opportunity for the support staff.  As a non-hierarchical company, employees are all equal, so promotions do not exist.  Unfortunately, the job responsibilities never change, which can eventually create boredom in this position even though the position is very fast paced with a heavy workload.XXX,This company has many good qualities preferred skills and knowledge can be implemented in future job replacements to better advance your professional needs.XXX,Most management that work under Procurement- GPG- do not have experience in procurement. They are only there because they know someone higher up. It's a great company if you work on the consulting side and starting at the bottom will not get you there. They only hire consultants from top 10% in ivy league schools. If you work as an assistant in procurement, be careful who your managers are. Some will belittle you, yell at you in from of people over the most stupid thing and require you to take a test before being hired which doesn't apply to assistant work at all. Benefits are great if you are a full time employee and they won't let you take time off in the first year. Following year, approach with caution. This place is all about politics and favoritism. If you get on the wrong side of a manager, you won't get a promotion. They are experts are making you believe you will move up and when the time comes they will give you some excuse. They will try to give you the least amount of money and work you like a dog.XXX,Only good to put on resume because of the name.XXX,The work was pretty boring and kind of a grind but the people here were so nice to work with. Great company to work for, lots good memories here.XXX,McKinsey & Company is one of the top companies to work for but beware that this only applies if you have a career as a Consultant, Engagement manager, etc and working on the Client side.  However if you're working in Operations, Reconciliations, Card Service, Purchasing, Procurement... you won't have a life, you will be humiliated, yelled at and you will put in more than 50 hours a week. Yes you'll have great benefits and vacations but you'll work during your vacation or expect a call from your manager.  If you leave on vacation, you'll pay the price when you return.  It's a nightmare.  Some that have been there for several years, are use to this type of treatment and think this is normal. Leaving that place was the best thing I've done!!  The only positive thing was to have McKinsey in my resume which it landed me a great job with great people who actually treat me with respect. I want people to know so they won't go through the same nightmare I went through. If you land an interview, please ask the right questions, make sure this place is for you.  Ask the employees questions about their supervisor, manager, etc, ask them if there happy, ask about work & life balance. Think twice about it if you have a family and kids... because you won't be spending much time with them.XXX,McKinseywas a great place to work and the guidance I received there was exceptional. I had the opportunity to work with individuals throughout the country.XXX,There were about 100 + team in McKinsey and 1000 + employees.XXX,A regular day would be motoring the work done by my teams.

I loved the pay and vacation time. Nights could get long but worth it. Many jobs to try.XXX,if you are good at being a ""yes"" person, even if you disagree, then you have a good start.

My mangers was good at what he did .. and he helped me learn about the Truck field..XXX,I have learned a lot about manufacturing working here.  A typical day is 8 hours long.  Many of the employees help each other out, and there is very little animosity in the workplace. It's a very positive space and very laid back.XXX,For the most part, the moral is up, until the end of each quarter when pretty much everyone freaks out because they haven't met their quota yet. Once that starts happening, the stress and competition build. I personally think that this happening forces sales executives to work even harder to meet their goals.XXX,The best part of being with 3M is that you get to meet such great people and everyone there is so good at doing their job. We always learn from each other and give each other constructive criticism when needed.XXX,It is the best company to work with the greatest salaries compensation and life balance. 3M is a family when you work with them. 3M is a solid company around the world.XXX,Very fast pace energetic environment. Most of the time typical day was not typical. Things were changing and you have to get things on fly. Friendly culture with lots of emphasis on accountability, with no micro management.

My role was essential for the company to ensure successful sales numbers and overall company productivity.XXX,Work place is fast paced and an enjoyable job but the pay doesn't fit the physical demand that is required.

Good work life balance with flexible hours and no issues and proper support for daily operations both personally and profesionallyXXX,The group that I work for is most populated by career Morgan Stanley  employees that have grown disgruntled with repeated years of low or non-existent raises. To combat decreasing morale leadership has decided to focus on creating a better work life balance via work from home days. The trade off for a young professional is worth while though my peers have stressed that the luster of this short term fix will wear off after a while .XXX,I was an in house temp for Morgan Stanley.  Overall the company was a great company to work for- great facilities, human resources etc.  Once you know the ins and outs of Morgan Stanley's procedures it is a very nice place to work for.  The people I worked for varied- mainly Managing Directors and VPs- in the three years I temped there I only had two bad experiences.  Because I was a temp, I found that I could easily communicate with the human resources/ temping department if something was a bad fit.

Never a dull moment with the day to day interaction between peers and clients. One objective ""Service"".XXX,Financial Advisers were usually appreciative of my client service skills and established long term relationships to make life changes easier for aging clients. Enjoyed collegiality with co-workers.  Was able to learn new systems and to achieve both my Series 7 and Series 66.XXX,The hardest part of the job was the constantly changing federal and Finra rules and assuring clients that the additional information was required.XXX,The best part of the job was exceeding both the Adviser's and the Client's expectations regarding their financial well being.XXX,Poor management, no job security. Good compensation. Lack of support from branch management.____________________XXX,The company is diverse and does have a solid foundation. The turnover rate is high, but I think the current upper management staff is working to keep employees longer.XXX,It was a summer job for me in high school. This location is downtown and I loved it and enjoyed working around important people. I was just a receptionist but I talked to actual clients often.XXX,Not a good company if you are looking to advance in other professional areas, company is primarily about the advisers and not other employees.XXX,Excellent work life balance, ability to learn from a diverse group of experts.

Many of my co-workers are CSC or other sub contractor employees and not DAC employees.XXX,It is a really wonderful company that has some really good benefits.  One of the best benefits, is that it is an employee owned company, which really helps make it a great culture.  Perhaps the biggest drawback is that it is a small company, and the contracts that it has is primarily if not exclusively connected to the government, so with all the uncertainty with government budgets, so are the contracts that this company is working on.XXX,DAC is a great place to work.

The work culture could have been better but there were a lot of learning opportunities within the firmXXX,I have been with the firm and I am not happy with the main focus being on utilization. I don't have anything else to say. I would like a work life balance.XXX,Grant Thornton lacks in opportunity and camaraderie.  Most recently, Human Resources has hired a great number of recent college graduates, but not enough projects to place them on. These individuals are provided leadership roles without much work experience.  They also provide inadequate direction, which is also apparent at the leadership level as well.  Experienced hires a often placed on opportunities that are not compatible with their skill set, and has resulted in a high turn over of knowledgeable professionals.XXX,The disparity of between experience and inexperience creates an environment that lacks genuine camaraderie, and more often seen as a threatening situation, even observed at the management level.  Grant Thornton's CLEARRLY slogan does not come close to being adapted on the job, in particular the aspect of mutual Respect.XXX,I like this firm, good culture. I like the ppl here. Everyone support each other. GT provides very good learning opportunity, people here grow very fast.XXX,Grant Thornton does a very great job at making sure that their interns are getting a full perspective of what it would be like to work there full-time. It is very informative and I learned a lot in just the 8 weeks of my internship.XXX,Thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Grant Thornton and I could not say more positive things about the people and work environment they provided.

Definitely the best part about this job are the people you work with.XXX,Hardest part of the job was pressure to complete work by deadlines and pressure from management. There is always a ""life or death"" type atmosphere with any assignment. XXX,No work life balance - the expectation is to always be available to work, even on weekends, holidays, and vacations.XXX,Great firm to work for but personally public accounting can be boring work if you don't get on the right clients. I would suggest staying in public for a few years then jumping ship.XXX,The Accounting Department is an environment different from the other groups at the firm.  I enjoy the work, it is challenging, but the work/ life balance gets challenging during certain peak times.  Advancement in this department is close to non existent, the advancement opportunities are either leave the department or leave the firm.  The talent pool in this department is top notch.  It's a great place to get your feet wet, and then advance in another company.XXX,It's a good place if you want to be an expert in accounting. Sometimes expectations are so high even you do not know how the job will be done, they will blame you for it.XXX,As Audit Associate for Grant Thornton our work environment changed on a semi-regular basis. Working at client sites allowed us to directly collaborate with staff and exercise communication skills. My work was directly supervised by a senior associate, however, tracking and recording my progress was entirely my responsibility. This final step taught me how to be thorough in my written communication. XXX,  Management accessibility was one of the greatest tools to have as an associate. Learning a new skill involves asking a lot of questions, and my superiors never seemed to tire of training. Working as a close team we developed strong interpersonal skills and became a unit working as one.XXX,The company overhired its interns. it had to lay off staff to get the new people get into the job. it needs to think twice before it hires so many people.XXX,The work environment while not travelling was not productive.  There was no cubicles to use for privacy. Excellent co-workers at the office and on the road.XXX,Only for young people fresh out of college with no children or outside responsibilities.

Learned how to file different reports for multiple states taxes, and IRS forms.  The best part of the job was all the different functions within the tax department.XXX,The work environment is supportive, but you are overloaded with work.  It is expected you stay to get your work completed to avoid getting behind. The work/life balance doesn't seem to be a priority, although you do get plenty of vacation time.  You may have to work on days off to catch up on work.XXX,It is a lax environment, but it can get stressful with the expectations and upset clients.  I do like the recognition and appreciation because management knows it is a hard job.XXX,I don't like all of the junk food everywhere. It doesn't seem like health is much of the culture or priority.XXX,An excellent place to work. I wanted to work more in my field of study, that's why I changed careers. Wonderful benefits, opportunities, job environment, and experience.XXX,With Tax Software, the person entering an amount on a Line number has to know how that line will calculate the amount they entered. The customers are NOT trained on the software because their company will not take the time out to train them. This puts more pressure on the Product support rep to explain to the client how a line calculates when it should already be understood (This is something that should be done in the software itself but it is not). Therefore, a 10 minute call will be last for 30-45 minutes because the product support rep has to explain to the client how the line calculates - this is in addition to the actual problem that the customer called about.  During busy season, the same customers call 4-6 times a day. This could easily be remedied if there was an icon next to each line that the client could click on and it would explain how the line functions but because the software is outdated, this cannot be done.XXX,Over the last 2 - 3 years Thomson has been eliminating staff positions.

""Too Big to Fail"" type of company as nothing gets done in a reasonable time and the quality has gone way down.XXX,Unfortunately, although this job paid well, the company was unorganized.  The new employees weren't given a logon ID for about the first month.  We had to read about the company and the procedures the entire first month.  This was hard to understand not knowing anything about the job.XXX,The management in my department was very family oriented and very fair.  Very willing to work with you on any level needed. My department was ""one big family"".XXX,There are companies that care about their employees. This one used to, now it's all about the money. It started 2 years ago with major layoffs, then the conversion of outsourcing began. Employees were either let go, or converted to contractors. Part-time contractors were limited to 35 hours a week, with no vacation or benefits. Those who were fortunate enough to be full-time contractors found their pay reduced, and their heath benefits go up 35%.

Management treats you as if you are only a number and could not care less about you. They love enforcing their own rules, even though the hospital has difference rules.

He ensures everyone's schedule is stable and able to work to the best of all employees ability. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is a diverse workplace with a high magnitude of experience in all areas of concentration.

Managers are incompetent to destructive--and are tolerated by upper  management. And there is no hope of advancement or professional development. A culture of fear and frustration exists. Be sure to negotiate an adequate salary and title coming in. They think their M&Ms, underfunded gym, and conveniences make up for their broken corporate culture and below-average salaries.XXX,The company itself is a great place to work.

That is, the tools are non-standard and cumbersome to the point of absurdity, leading to job security. Incompetent, unsupportive managers make the work environment unpleasant and needlessly tedious; there's a culture of fear. Ideas for improvement are given lip service by management, year after year, although employees clearly ask for change. Professional development does not exist, and advancement is a popularity contest not based on merit. Work/life balance depends on the whims of your manager, so it's easy to be unlucky. Unfair hiring, pay, and bonus practices foster resentment.

Management wasn't always clear why some people were given promotions and others weren't. Some leads/managers had been there a long time and didn't want to disturb the status quo. Organization was a bit lacking in some areas...there were mismanagements of time allocations, with some people having a lot of work and others having too little work. They needed more help/organizational system of training new hires. I realized too late that if you want something done right you should do it yourself...and that the people who have the attitudes to be leaders aren't always the ones who should be leading, for whatever reason - in this case, disorganization.Coworkers were great, for the most part.

I also enjoyed the ability to advance my career as well as build professional experience.XXX,Working on new and advanced applications to keep track of the thousands of projects State Street Bank has nationwide provided me the opportunity to really challenge my creative thinking in order to best serve the company and the project at hand. This challenging environment allowed me to feel increasingly motivated to over come the next complication and work to the projects success.XXX,Although I only participated in State Street for a summer, I left with many skills.

Management is great though, which is helpful.There needs to be a better way of getting things done here.XXX,No work life balance with no clear direction from upper management. XXX,New hires were not prepared for the work required of them to perform their duties.  Workload was pushed off to senior people which were already overloaded resulting in poor production.XXX,There are a lot of talented people working at the company. Many are stuck in their position because the opportunity to grow is a struggle. The company is very catty and title driven. Many of the  departments are like high school. The separation between friendships and best business practices are not clearly defined.XXX,Man of the people are friendly however there those that impossible to work with because of their attitudes.XXX,Great first company to work for as you learn very much. Senior people generally very helpful and want to teach you. Endless possibilites if you put in time and effort into the work.XXX,Through a combination of hubris, lack of vision, and total ineptitude, this once respected company is now the laughing stock of the industry.  XXX,The culture is absolutely toxic and employee morale is at an all-time low.  Virtually all of the good talent have jumped ship, or are in the process of doing so.  Incompetents stay on, thanks to their connections, while great talents are let go.  Look at the number of open head counts--there's a reason the company can't fill these roles!XXX,Clients are aware of this as well, which makes it even harder for Ipsos.   The revolving door of management has created utter confusion among top clients.  From ""Game Changers,"" to ""Connect,"" to ""Madtech,"" to ""BrandX,"" nobody is quite sure who is doing what.  The only certainty is that the buffoons at the helm seem to think that success will be secured by bringing on more overpriced and incompetent cronies and goons.XXX,Think long and hard before accepting an offer here--it's a miserable, miserable place.XXX,Legal department was in flexible. Very militant structure. No flexibility with hours. Long hours and hardly and guidance from supervisors. Little to no communication amongst the unit.XXX,Hours are not guaranteed, supervisors play favorites, no benefits offered, no overtime allowed, projects are terrible, you are not told of holidays off until 3 days prior, no guaranteed raises, not enough breaks given.XXX,No Happy medium.  Extremely slow and no work at times.  When busy they beg for hours.  Supervisors are demoted to lower positions when slow and have limited hours as well.  You are viewed as a number not an employee.  No recognition or rewards, it all about how much they can make.  I enjoy my job when I get to do it.XXX,There are a lot of initiatives but sometimes it is hard to get things done.  If you get connected to the correct people, there is a lot to learn.  It's a large global company with many different opportunities.  Work-life balance is definitely a challenge even with work-at-home opportunities.XXX,One of the best places iv'e worked just no hours really available.I like the fact that they give you plenty of independence and we can also listen to headphones while we work. overall, working here is great!XXX,I was trusted to do a lot of important things for the company, though the compensation should have been higher for the responsibilities I had.XXX,Ny everyday at work was great, I had a position where I met differentXXX,people different cultures, busy morning time went by very fast, because I always had something to do.

The benefits are great, 3 weeks vacation for all full time employees. 50% 401k match for the first 3%.XXX,Descent company. HR was great most of the time especially when personal situations occurred. Project manager never really talked to employees unless they were hire ups. Some supervisors had power trips. Work become tideous and repetitive. Good for someone looking for easy work or is in school. Shouldn't have stayed as long as i did because now i have no desire to ever work for a call center company again.XXX,Fast paced environment, in Market Research. Dedicated to helping clients with their business needs.XXX,It was an honor for me to work with great people and to learn from them. It was great to learn about healthcare industries in the US and to build a strong relationship with Ipsos Russia. Being a liaison between two countries with different mentalities and work style, has taught me a lot about people and business. Presenting at HIV World Conference in Washington D.C. in 2012 was definitely a highlight of my time in Ipsos and it was an incredible experience.XXX,Ipsos is a great place to learn and work with team members. The job work/life balance is tough to find consistently.XXX,This company was very unorganized from the start. I was supposed to work on election night as an election agent. I completed all training and the only thing left was the rehearsal, which was basically submit data into an app. My 2 year old daughter got very ill and I could not submit the data at the exact time of rehearsal. I was emailed by a number of people saying I could submit anytime. No big deal. I submitted all the data and contacted my regional coordinator who informed me that I was being replaced because I didn't attend the rehearsal after others told me it was fine.

Creativity, productivity and thinking outside the box flourish.XXX,Employees give 200 percent. They strive to be the best and to deliver top-quality products and services. They take responsibility for their actions and decisionsXXX,Kindness and understanding prevail when employees face challenges such as accidents, illnesses, personal tragedies and natural disasters. People will usually go the extra mile for others when they’re treated well and with understanding, compassion and respectXXX,People are friendly.  Really organized.  I learned a lot about the systems and how everything worked at the site.  Management was great.  The only thing I really did not like was the fact that growth opportunities took a while.  I have a lot of experience in security but needed to be patient in order to grow in the company.XXX,Working is not clearly directed. Direction is being changed every moment. Management has no enough experience to work on the system product and handing the people who from various cultures previously.XXX,Nvidia was a great company to work with. Employees are smart and creative thinker. Company takes care of its employees.You would learn a lot of new technologies here.XXX,Nvidia is one of the best company. I learned lot from my team. People are very cooperative. Sometimes, work load was not manageable but over all I rate 5 out of 5.XXX,Great co-workers, fun, challenging innovative products.  Upper management tends to have unrealistic schedule expectations that leads to long hours, stress and low morale.XXX,Every GPU cycle presents new challenges, features and work. Nvidia constantly pushes the envelopes in all aspects and leads the industry with new technologies.XXX,Most of the time, I am working with multiple teams to bring new chips and features to market. I am constantly learning and am supported by capable leaders and peers.XXX,Constantly working on new features and different teams across the world means I'm working around the clock. Work/life balance is reasonable but at times can be quite challenging over long periods of time. XXX,Management has good vision and direction. CEO is always thinking years in advance and pivots the company when beneficial to the future. Nvidia is constantly pushing gross margins which can be felt at the engineering level. Intent is good but can be overly restrictive at times (e.g.: lab equipment, computer purchases, etc).XXX,Was very informative to learn about how conferences work from outside in. Worked from checkin to after party and concluded with take down of the event. Was a great learning experience working along side the Events team at Nvidia.XXX,it is good company and really friendly environment to work with. My daily responsibilities are debugging, troubleshoot and fixing all the RMA devices. Sometime i have to work with software engineer in flashing and making sure the devices have a good and functioning image. I have enjoy and love to work for this company.XXX,As with many big corporations, there's a big game being played on employees..here it was primarily using West Valley Staffing, the in house staffing agency to lure people in with potential jobs at a growing co/dept but in fact, the department has NO requisition/authority to make this contractor a permanent employee, and NO incentive to, because WV pays below market, with almost no benefits, no sick time, no holiday pay unless you've been there 6 mos, etc. Good luck going through years of being underpaid, below market, for the ""hopes"" of becoming a permanent employee.  (stories of people being contractors for 2-5 years abound)XXX,And the other game is people working cross functionally, with reporting/performance/pay managed by one manager, but actual work and projects with multiple managers who don't communicate, so no one really knows everything you're being asked to do, or should be paid to do.XXX,One thing to remember before starting a job at NVIDIA that is, you are responsible for your work. Super Cool people and super smart minds. Your every word has weight. So when you say something to management or peers you better get it done because your word stands for your commitment. You will get all the help you need but you gotta ask for it. Nobody is going to do spoon feeding for you. The best part about it is you will learn a lot in the process and you feel confident. That's my best take away from NVIDIA.XXX,fair place to work, the culture is not so good in my team, but some team is better, pretty much depend on the style of the managerXXX,Management is off hand which provides personal growth XXX,There is a lot of room for creativity. Work here to work in a environment that promotes growth.XXX,Nvidia is a great company to work for.   It is well known for GPU products using in gaming and High Performance Computing.  It is growing in Visual Computing  and Virtual RealityXXX,This was a volunteer experience in which I setup monitors, booths, posters, and tables for the GTC conference. In addition I help setup lan cables in each room to provide everyone with a connection to the internet. This is one of the most memorable and enjoyable volunteer work I have ever done. Talking to the executives during the conference and learning about IT and how important it is before a day of a big event opens my eyes about the men and women of the IT industry.XXX,The company is run by  business savvy engineers which is quite rare for a company of this size.  The primary focus in the mobile products is always on delivery of a quality product.XXX,The CEO has demonstrated the ability to make strategic investments without bending to shareholder fickleness.  Sometimes these investments work out, other times they do not.  This is extremely important for companies long term health.XXX,The company focuses hiring on top talent across the industry.  This results in a diverse workforce that may be overwhelmed but is generally quite technically competent.XXX,This company has no regard for you or your family.  As long as you perform you will be OK...but if you are not a culture fit.  Good bye.    It is micromanaged by a megalomanic.  And frankly there is not much upside in their product line.  Intel will eventually eat their lunch.XXX,highly talented peopleXXX,good managementXXX,good base packageXXX,co-workers support is very goodXXX,good work-life balanceXXX,Company always tries to come up with good products and has courage to enter new markets.XXX,Nvidia is a great place to work, but it's lacking when it comes to having a conducive environment for younger or start-upy kinds of employees. It's a very classic style of doing business, and many of the middle people (who've been there for less than 10 years) will tell you that you could do worse in many places, but you could also easily do a lot better.XXX,Management is pretty hands off, certain ones will micromanage, but in general the structure of power is accessible from the lower rungs.

HR was a bit detached from employee but all other areas of this company proved to be top notch,XXX,I am very happy working for CBRE. The company is well organized and constantly growing. CBRE provides a challenging and team type work environment for their employees.XXX,Lots to learn at CBRE, an exceptional workplace environment where you can develop the education and skills needed for the land management, property leasing and development markets.XXX,This is an absolutely awful place to work. They only care about making as much money as possible and don't care about their employees at all. They give everyone the same training no matter their position, which is useless because accounting training does you absolutely no good if you work in IT. The culture is similar to that of a high school. People will be artificially nice to you in front of others, but are awful to you when you are alone. If you are not one of the ""popular crowd"", then you can forget about ever advancing in the company no matter how hard you work. The management does not care about you (unless you are one of the ""popular crowd"") and will demean you and make you question your self-worth. A typical day at work consisted of constantly having managers and other people complain about all of their problems and when you solved their problems, telling you that it wasn't the solution they wanted.  Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this company. Working here will cost your your happiness and sanity.XXX,No real thrills or personality.

They have treated me very good. Great benefits and great values. Management backed me and allowed me to excel at my job.XXX,The company offers excellent pay and benefits.  However, the job can be very stressful and tedious.  Like any job, the stress level is greatly impacted by your supervisor.  I have had 3 different managers at this company - one was helpful and empathetic with vast knowledge, one was aloof and gave little/no guidance, but was kind, and the other was a micro-manager with little compassion who saw all things in black and white.  My stress level and quality of professional life was best when I had a supervisor who tried to understand me and offered assistance when I felt overwhelmed.  The worst situation was feeling micro-managed when I am such a hard worker and do not need to be babysat.XXX,- Entrepreneurial Corporate CultureXXX,- Very hard working dedicated employeesXXX, -Strategic forward thinking Executive Leadership TeamXXX,I worked as a temp on a special GSA contract. Work was primarily administrative, little to no training, great company culture.XXX,The place is nice to work at. Great atmosphere. but the CBRE Management Staff is lacking in skill.I would not recommend anyone wanting to work with these 3 individuals. Some other so called management Staff will probably be better inclined to not have favoritism.XXX,Overall good business culture, but management not receptive to rank-and-file needs or manpower required to properly serve clients.XXX,Growing very large.

Working in shared services can be quite demanding but also rewarding when completing tasks that can benefit the entire US workforce.XXX,Hard working and demanding environment with tight deadlines.

I would recommend Prime Therapeutics to others as they have a good life/work balance.  Management is very open to hearing the individual.XXX,I spent my years at Prime Therapeutics in the Inventory department.I was given projects and that required use of my experience in Purchasing and Inventory. I learned every day and expanded my knowledge of  project management as well as maintaining different system types over the years.The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to be turned loose on a project, complete the project and see results after completion.XXX,I really enjoyed at Prime Therapeutics.  I learned to work in a fast-paced environment with expert attention to detail and accuracy.  I worked for two great supervisors and very nice co-workers.XXX,Work at prime was a really good experience for me. The daily flow of work had a steady pace, the on the job training was very helpful especially the processing of multiple software. The was I worked with were very understanding and universal. The most useful parts of the days were the team meetings, they gave everyone an opportunity to share ideas on ways to help others improve.XXX,I learned a lot about Medicare Part D and drug coverage related to insurance. The company itself requires a lot of the temp employees and the training sessions are short, so you don't learn all you need to know before going live.XXX,The pay and benefits are great but there is way too much overtime. The work is monotonous and not very challenging.  Not a lot of opportunity for projects or variety of tasks.XXX,People are respectful and there is room for growth if you work hard. I don't love how much they rely on contract work and I feel like there are a lot of growing pains right now. Mostly, its very good.XXX,Prime Therapeutics made work life balance very easy. Management was always available to speak with whenever I had any question or concerns.XXX,Prime the company has a whole is great. But in the Orlando office it's not about your work ethics or performance it's about who you know and who likes you. The management in the Orlando office is horrible! They take positions away without giving you a notice and reason onto why. You can be the hardest most dedicated worker and it will go unnoticed if your not apart of their like squad. If Prime cleans house from the top down this would be the ideal company. The benefits is great, they do a lot with the employees as far as activities. But they also work you like a dog the phones never stop ringing. Orlando Management walks around with walkie talkies and treat you like a child. Their leads never want to take an escalated call. If your a PCC but another dept. screws up you will take the fall. I think for this company to continue to grow in Orlando they need to hire passionate management staff.XXX,They were very under staffed int eh department I worked at and I would work through my lunch with ultimately was my down fall.

Each project is a legacy of another and very little innovation (perhaps except for some science based stuff) is accomplished.

I've lost count how many engineers I've worked with who admit to not being able to do anything else if they leave this place.  They are left with little to no new skills and outside industry is so far ahead in almost every aspect it's sad.XXX,Not to mention the entire culture of the lab has changed.  The place has become very paranoid and corporate.  They have engaged in unscrupulous hiring and firing behaviors and are engaged in some serious lawsuits with individuals over unlawful termination, age discrimination, and security issues.  They are spending millions of tax payer dollars on high priced lawyers so they can save a few dollars and their terrible reputation from the public.XXX,It's a really poor place to work these days...uninspiring, boring, and the whole ""rocket engineering"" nonsense is just that...nonsense.XXX,Ever changing environment surrounded by some of the greatest minds in the world, filled with innovation and possibilities.XXX,I first started working at JPL in 2001 which gave me the opportunity to see a lot of missions over a ten year period.XXX,Multi-tasking positionXXX,Gained knowledge regarding spacecraft struction and launchingXXX,Engineers very knowlegable in their specialty/expertiseXXX,ethnicly diverse employees XXX,after classes learned, job not hard but demandingXXX,Learning what is involved to build and launch spacecraftXXX,Daily tasks vary.XXX,I learned to further myself.XXX,Management structure is organized.XXX,Co-workers are highly educated.XXX,Hardest part of the job is multi-tasking.

Full Autonomy granted to make your sales goals.  Management is very understanding to real life issues.XXX,This company has a lot of potential and can be a great employer, depending on your department.  Operations and sales feel like a completely different company when considered along with other parts of the organization. I worked on cross-functional teams and I was always amazed at the lattitude that other departments experienced on a daily basis. If you are considering a role in operations, don't do it! You'll find yourself in a silo with no room to advance. Other parts of the company function well as a team; in Operations leadership is only concerned in covering their own tails. There were no development programs or feedback mechanisms. Offering solutions often leads to reprimand.  There's a reason why people frequently leave here.  It's a great place for the culture in the short term, but I don't anticipate retiring from here.XXX,Job was not difficult very repetitive and extremely boring but the company did offer great benifits including 401k immediate paid time off and plenty of overtime.

Working with Management can be difficult, too many employees and not enough managers. Customer satisfaction is one of the hardest parts since the work is client driven, not every customer is happy or willing to work with you. What I enjoy the most aside from leaving everyday is the great people I work with. Once you find the right group of colleagues to surround yourself with the office and job becomes a better experience.XXX,If you want a home work life balance this is not the place. If your life interferes with your scheduled time to work prepare to get a write up. The accumulation of points is very easy as they charge you with 1/3 of a point if you are 6 or more minutes late to work. Be advised to leave home early as Richmond traffic at certain times of the day can be an issue. As many know working a Customer Service position is already the equivalent of working in H.S. and there is no difference here. I apparently had a disagreement with a co-worker of which I knew nothing about and he made up a ludicrous story to tell our manager to feel better about his bruised ego. And of course the usual no upward mobility as again this is a call center. But if you want decent pay this could be a good second job.XXX,Absolutely love the core values of the company.  It is a company that has the most positive work environment.  Everyone works together as a team and everyone thrives on providing superior customer service.XXX,A culture where your contributions are recognized & rewarded--at all job levels. Advancement is possible--many coworkers have left the call center to move to jobs in other divisions. It's busy, but there are great coworkers and friends, opportunities to interact in relaxed/social events, lots of great benefits and amenities in the building. The hardest thing--juggling priorities of many projects.XXX,Management should actually adhere to all the values that are stated for the company, such as work/life balance and reward for skill & hard work.  The career opportunities are only for people who hire in at the manager level or higher.  Anyone who works in ANY of the call centers; travel, bank card, or claims, will not get promoted within this company.  You may move laterally from one department to another, but not upward to a higher position.XXX,The management staff and the upper levels are HORRIBLE to the employees.  They cannot keep Managers.  They have a life of approximately 1 year.  They do not care about quality staff which can be frustrating.  The upper management team is very clique-ish.  They will block you from moving to other areas of the company as well.  The management staff are not educated in most cases.  The HR staff is bullied by the upper management instead of functioning in the best interest of the company/people.  They do not know how to run companies because they are pushed up through the company because they are friends and not qualifications.

It's great.  The people, the benefits and the salary was decent.  My boss was difficult as a black woman, she ad two chips on her shoulder.XXX,Cox automotive was overall a good company to work for. since they were the parent company of autotrader, being part of autotrader meant I had access to all the available resources of a Cox employee.XXX,Little work life balance despite the communication strategy to promote it.  Poor leadership in constant change and flux.  Ongoing talk with poor implementation follow through creates nothing getting done.  Great owners who want to do good things and yet those great things get poorly implemented.XXX,Exceptional company with a focus on growth of their employees.

The people who make the company & keep things going are incredible and passionate. Great team building environment and fellowship within the company is certainly a positive. The only negative I can say about the company is if management tells you there is an open door policy they are lying. Most managers are robots with no emotion or care of the employees that work for them. I have noticed every time the company does a company wide survey, that the only complaint is management. Not pay, not benefits, not culture, not product etc..XXX,The company continues to moves managers within the company just to put them in new departments until eventually they run out of places to move them. The company tries to model all software division companies they own like vAuto. Which is positive and negative. The negative is the metrics they base your performance off of is almost impossible to obtain, because some software markets don't change daily like vAuto does. Combine that with a huge account load isn't healthy either. So that is the negative.XXX,Back to the positive, even though having a huge account load is a burden, you are well compensated based off performance. Training has improved substantially over the last coupe years as well.XXX,Hands down, the culture and people are the best thing about the company.XXX,This is an awesome place to work however, the call center is not a great department to work for.

Sometimes have to be at work on weekend due to the nature of the job. Very friendly environment. Coworkers are very helpful. XXX,The hardest part is to be self motivated to keep project going. XXX,Enjoyable part is to do cutting-edge research.XXX,Staff is typically expected to accommodate a variety of different tasks. This can make the job challenging and fast-paced. However, this also means that there is a grey area as to what is your job and what is not. UCSF bureacracy often makes simple tasks such as reimbursements and ordering supplies difficult and time-consuming.XXX,UCSF employees share a passion of conducting innovative and mission-driven research, which is perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the job. Staff contributions are often overlooked since their work is often behind-the-scenes. Faculty are not well-trained in managing people so considerations for promotions and career advancement are often on the back-burner of priorities.XXX,Great institution built on the intellect of students and guidance of the faculty. I enjoyed working in this fast paced environmet with like-minded, driven individuals.XXX,I worked in a research lab under an incredibly kind and caring PI (principal investigator). All of the members of the lab were helpful, kind, and experienced. I was able to gather a good deal of technical knowledge that could see application outside of biomedical imaging, as well as a good deal of knowledge which will probably not see use in any other field. XXX,Work on a daily basis was on average relaxed with only a few tasks to be done (or more generally a single larger project with loose deadline to be worked on). There were maybe a handful of ongoing tasks that had to be done involving the collecting and processing of patient data. Hardest part of the job was learning to do things that I hadn't done before because they were usually technical and others didn't have a good idea of how to do them (hence asking me). But I kind of enjoyed self-teaching so it wasn't that bad.XXX,Collaborative, intense, and dynamic research institute. I enjoyed learning from the post-docs and the professors. I also enjoyed the campus a lot.XXX,UCSF is a great place to work. I have great co workers and a great management team. The biggest and only issue I have with working here is my salary.XXX,Working at UCSF is a great opportunity for me, and I like the environment and the people. The only problem is the salary is not sufficient to have a decent housing situation in the city.XXX,Dedicated staff enhances the patient services, the individual contributors set UCSF apart from many healthcare provided.XXX,Answer phones and operate a switchboard.XXX,Route calls to specific people.XXX,Answer inquiries about company.XXX,Greet visitors warmly and make sure they are comfortable.XXX,Call persons waiting for visitor and book them a room to meet in.XXX,Make coffee and set out food.XXX,Ensure reception area is tidy.XXX,Research Administration leadership in the School of Medicine is constrained by lack of experience in any organization  other than UCSF.  Leadership does not work collaboratively with Contracts and Grants administration.  Systems are inadequate for the fiscal management of clinical trials and this Division relies heavily on shadow systems to track critical information.  Workload is overwhelming and investment in additional, skilled manpower is non-existent in this Division.XXX,A great place to work with a great mindset and goal. People are friendly and very caring. All people that are working towards a better future for universities, hospitals and communities.XXX,I had a great time working at the David Copenhagen lab. I worked on the area of basic neuroscience with the specific focus on synaptic pathways in the retina. I would strongly recommend working for UCSF. It's a great school. I enjoyed my time thereXXX,Excellent work environment to do your job.  To be promoted requires higher education.  Diversified workforce to tackle challenging projects and university programs.XXX,Highly recommended to everyone.

Working with families was the best and most enjoyable part of the job.XXX,What I learned: importance of utilizing and expanding my own skills in order to be more self reliant and complete tasks on time. This involved lots of self study in order to expedite tasks which I enjoyed.XXX,Hardest part of the job was the overtime hours in order to ensure tight deadlines that needed to met due to lack of staffing. I took the responsibility upon myself to complete the tasks in order to be site ready. Study representatives appreciated my diligence, which made the job more pleasurable. XXX,UCSF is a very demanding employer that finally took funds to invest in their infrastructure in order to get depts. up to speed on using technolgical advances.XXX,I created great working relationships with various departments that made the environment more enjoyable to work in.XXX,Fast-paced, complex academic teaching facility.  Lots of red tape and politics.  Supportive management.  Difficult to find time for professional development.  High turnover.XXX,I was proud to be an employee at UCSF. It's a very enjoyable place to work and they make sure you are well informed about pharmaceuticals and equipment you use on a daily basis.XXX,I am lucky enough to have a supervisor that strongly promotes work/life balance and allows for creativity and for me to present new ideas.  She does not micro manage but instead allows me to pave my own path and seek advice and assistance when required.  I complete my work by the deadline and am trusted with confidential and high level projects.  It is a supportive and friendly environment to work in.XXX,Additionally, XXX,Egoism and power trips are the normal way handling disputes/fair treatment from the higher ups and HR is toothless and ineffectual. Despite the liberal nature of the constituents of the this massive bay area machine, it is quite clear that even the nobility of the scientific endeavor can be muddled for the benefit of the few. As staff we are left to observe this quietly and if we speak out you may as well count on being relegated to cleaning the -80C as your primary duty, and say goodby to your potential ""authorship."" I have worked in 4 labs, only one is noble and genuinely good to their staff and students. One! And in that one lab my most beloved superior ever (a Harvard organic chemist and MD), left to go kaiser, stating ""UC is going don the tubes."" I believe him now and I am looking for my chance to move on to something better in industry. That being said, it would suck to have to accept horrible wages just for good benefits. UC, you can do much better for us but you choose to keep staff just above water financially in this city-not cool for people wanting to and in some cases changing the world.XXX,I suppose its a good start for recent grads and maybe for a year or two, but don't get your hopes up.

Provided constructive guidance rather than critical.  Nice!XXX,I am a current employee, I hate it! For the most part, the people I wok with are cool. But the hours are horrible!!! hours have dropped drastically. I haven't made 20 hours in one week in about two months. If you want something part time, this would be the perfect job for you. However, if you have real bills to pay and it would be your only form of income, I don't suggest it. Oh, and management does NOT care about the employees. All they care about is you showing up for your shift.XXX,They didn't provide much training, and the pay was lousy. Most employees I worked with had negative attitudes, probably because they are paid very little.XXX,A good company to gain experience. The culture is ""fast, fun and friendly."" The people are positive and work well together.XXX,It was an okay job. I made a lot of money working for them as I was able to open or close. The benefits were wonderful, I got a discount card, flexible job hours, and they were heavily into the volunteer community. The work was sometimes overwhelming as they had very high expectations, which I didn't mind and would have gladly learned to adjust to if the management wasn't so poor. Every shift was a toss-up of who was managing that day. They had wild requests of someone who just started and whatever I did, they didn't want me to do. It was impossible to work independently as they wanted because when one manager gave me a task to complete, another manager would change it, and then another manager would change that task. I was always confused as nothing was said to me directly, I would have to hunt down a manager to find out what my task change was. I would have stayed with them for the money and benefits, but I ended up moving before my seniority date. Aside from the management, the coworkers were nice, the pay was good, they were very accepting of the LGBTQ+ community, they defended basic human rights that many companies would not.XXX,When hired seasonally I was offered a full time position, which I accepted. When it come time to transfer over to full time after the season, I was told I wasn't ever offered that position. Although management was decent and everyone was friendly, I was disappointed in their unorganization.XXX,Be prepared to have hours cut, 3 different managers telling you to do 3 different things.

But it is a fun place to work.XXX,It was a very positive environment to work in. The only downside is that I received very little training and schedules were consistently incorrect. I worked at the cash register the first day by myself. Very quickly I moved up to Guest Service to handle complicated returns and corrections.XXX,The best part of working at Target are the people you work along side. They are always very helpful, and it's like a small community with an inside joke. The worst part is the pay.XXX,The people were nice but the actual tasks were mind numbing.

I was given the minimal amount of training to do the job of a full service Customer Service Rep. but most of my training experience came from on the job training and with the little help of my Lead Rep when she was available.  My co-workers loved my spirit and were helpful when they could be, but most of the time, I learned things on my own.

Starting pay is very low for the unexperienced.  Corporate culture can tend to be poor with individuals employed for long periods of time who never were checked for their attitudes and ways of doing things.  Some upper level management have very poor ways of communicating and putting forth objectives.  It is very difficult to get a promotion and pay only slightly increases.  The experience I gained was the most valuable part of my time there.XXX,The good thing about CareFirst was the coworkers, the ability to work from home when needed, benefits and reimbursement. XXX,It's a very stressful environment due to unreasonable job performance expectations. Recommendations and improvements have been suggested by multiple employees to management but are often disregarded or snubbed. It is a stagnant position where you are unable to advance due to common, unfavorable performance reviews.XXX,Working at BCBS was an excellent experience.

The higher-up's are sketchy and do terrible things to their employees who have given up their lives to make them look good.XXX,Basically if you're cool with losing your soul and tirelessly working to appease a group of people who will never be happy - because they're not happy in their personal lives - then you'll do great here. If you're an actual human being... RUN FOR THE HILLS.XXX,Typical day I am adjusting claims, supporting customer service representatives. Answering phones when the representatives need help. Directing inquires to Dental Directors as needed.XXX,I had a very tough working boss who also found time to make jokes. He taught me so very much in my years there. By far my favorite job!XXX,I am extremely lucky in that, in the Federal Employee Program, I am blessed with great upper management. They are fully invested in the total development of their staff and work tirelessly to retain their best people. However, in recent months there has been a push to blend three offices into one and in the ensuing transition, there has been a massive exodus of representatives due to the overwhelming work that the Owings Mills office was burdened with while the DC and Cascii offices went through training. I enjoy working with providers and members but the volume of work can be daunting at times, as much as 300 calls/cases in a week which leaves little time for the investigational side of claims case work. The clinical/insurance/medical side of the job is second nature to me but it can be difficult dealing with the emotional side of members when they have issues. I very much enjoy case work and correspondence and work to solve every issue as if its my own, each like its own little mystery.XXX,I am a full time intern here and CareFirst has been a wonderful experience.  My team is very helpful in my professional development and has taught me many skills such as Microsoft Office and Research.  The mist enjoyable part of my job is working on multiple different projects to expand my knowledge and the hardest part of my job is making assumptions based on data and research that I have compiled.XXX,After thousands of interviews and recruiters calling to give feedback, the reality is that CareFirst has me on a do not hire list that once companies ask for the last numbers of your SS#, the Company interests goes cold...Frozen Solid.  They have ruined my career life as I am unemployable to work in my career. A 25+ yr seasoned professional in pursuit of Master's and PMP, and I can't get a job in my profession because of CareFirst BCBS. Attorney's are afraid to take the case... I won my EEOC case but with no compensation. By the time I realized the damage they have...it was too late.  My faith keeps me alive though I have thought of ending it all. Thanks CareFirst and its slave existence mentality. What's the point of investing further in my career if I am blacklisted across the country?  Management there has cast an Iron Curtain.

Hopefully, the new owners will take the old Aprimo products in a good direction.XXX,There was a nice laid back IT officevibe. If you did your work well and showed up to work on time, there was a decent amount of flexibility. The company recently has experienced a reduction in force with lots of uncertainty ahead.

Typical business with good and not so good situations you deal with over 25 years.XXX,Most of the employees at Teradata did not have the appropriate computer educations to be working for this company.  It seemed as if they hired MBAs and tried to turn them into Technical Consultants or Watchdogs;  Upper management seemed OK, middle management was unprofessional to say the least and in my opinion a great reason for the downfall of this company.  There was ZERO logical reason for this downfall other than recruiting people with appropriate educational backgrounds and getting rid of DEAD WOOD long ago.XXX,It was an honor to work for this company.

I have learned and improved a lot with the company. The hardest part of the job is when everyone are not corporate to solve the issues.XXX,The work flow is steady. There isn't much room for advancement even if you have higher education. All of the people are nice and easy to get along with.

Best place to workXXX,It is interesting, to say the least, how some of the managers at this company got to where they are. It's a good ol' boy system and if you know the right people and can talk sports and hot air, you've got a chance at promotion. But, if you do the right thing, know your job well and try to help others, you just might find your clearance being threatened because the manager is intimidated by you. Then, instead of Human Resources removing the manager(s) that cause the problems, they take dedicated and hard working employees and move them to places where they'll either be miserable and quit, or to a proposal which may not be won, so they can ""justifiably"" be laid off in the future.XXX,The life of a HR Generalist / Recruiter is filled with opportunities and challenges. Every decision presents the opportunity to support and drive the company brand. As the HR Generalist, I deal with employee relations by implementing organizational laws and regulations. As the corporate recruiter, I have the honor of selecting the talent and character of potential employees that would carry the brand of the organization / company. The most exciting thing about the position of HR Generalist / Recruiter is when presented with challenges are keeping the company brand at the forefront of all decisions, popular or unpopular. I except both opportunities and challenges the are inherent with the position of HR Generalist / Recruiter.XXX,Northrop has some of the highest standards of excellence I've ever encountered. It's daunting at first, you worry about living up to the expectations set forth. However, I can say that the work environment puts excellence within your grasp.

We worked as a team and made work fun.  There are some arrogant doctors there and some managers do not stick up for their nursing staffs.XXX,I am a graduate student in Biochemistry division of Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. As a graduate teaching assistant, the insurance coverage is quite well. The department also is very warm--the chair and staffs are all caring. There are some fun activities through the year.

Compensation is poor compared to the private sector. A Masters in Science may only earn you $14 to $15/hr at OSU, which is embarrassingly low. XXX,Job security is not that good if you are hired as a term employee. It would be easier to invest yourself fully in the job if you didn't have to think about possibly being out of a job in a year or two. It also appears that term employees are less valued by the university. The department I worked for gave me a 1% raise after two years of work because I was a term employee (full-time employees received 2%).XXX,If you have a good supervisor it can be a great place to work. If your supervisor is a good scientist and not a good people manager (as can often be the case), then you might have a somewhat dysfunctional and not very enjoyable work experience.XXX,Parking is expensive.

It was always fun to learn new skills though and grow as a person.XXX,Some departments at Ohio State are wonderful to work for. Others are very disorganized with their leadership. They also do not treat term workers well.XXX,Working at OSU is a mixed bag.  You have the great atmosphere of being at OSU, and having a great culture for student success and professional accomplishments.  Then you also have the political side of it being OSU, and a state run facility.  I know people that have had great bosses, and some that have had ones that play the game.

I found out many years later that he ended up being terminated.  XXX,Management is not good. You always feel like you have a target on your back. Look out for yourself and don't trust anyone.

Typical day for me is 9am-6pm.

It's not hard work, there's just a lot of it.  The volume will keep you on your toes.XXX,The nature of an insurance company is to cut costs and maximize its shareholder interests. Progressive is very good at ripping off customers and employee salaries and resources. Don't work here.

XXX,Like most companies you may run into a few issues here and there. However the open door policy at Progressive is very comforting during times of conflict. They provide several classes addressing the different ways you can address any issue. Always looking for a way to make the company a place of happiness.XXX,Depending on the area you work in the job may be more demanding at different times of years. In slow times of the departments employees are encouraged to ""loan-out"" to other departments and learn more about other business areas. XXX,I've never worked for a company that offer several learning classes and courses to help their employees grow in their skills.XXX,Progressive can be a great place to work if you have the right personality for the corporate environment and culture that existed when I worked there.   I do not miss it.XXX,Typical day included interactions with project team, sponsors, and key stakeholders in support of project, program, or portfolio assignments.  Learned how centralized Enterprise Project Management Office (EPMO) functions can serve needs across a broad spectrum of organizational business areas.XXX,Culture was diverse, and encouraged risk taking in pursuit of solution building.  Although leadership was strong, support for those positioned as change agents remained critical to personal success.XXX,Most challenging element of the job was assignments where support was inconsistent or inadequate to satisfy the goals of the project or program.  XXX,Most enjoyable part of the job was delivering IT outcomes that impacted the bottom line in substantial ways, and strengthened the company's pursuit of becoming the number 1 national insurer.XXX,Progressive is an excellent company to work for, so long as the supervisor or managing person is ""properly"" trained to handle the volume of it's employees under that person's supervision and coaching, etc. The training and furtherance of education is readily available and free, so the problem is hiring and training the persons in charge, so that the employees can work to their full potential!XXX,•	Served as liaison between customer and manager to resolve customer complaintsXXX,•	Handled complex, escalated issues independentlyXXX,The claims world is never easy. The people you work with at Progressive make it a fun environment if there aren't any toxic employees. There is a political game but I suppose that's everywhere you go. ""They say"" tenure doesn't matter, but that's contrary to what I've seen.  Usually, you'll work more than the allotted 8 hours and that really affects work/life balance. If you can't manage the work within those 8 hours and ask for help from managers, you're placed on an action plan which counts against your performance evaluation which in turn affects your salary. So, if you're like me, you'll work more than 40+ hours a week. Upsides are being able to help customers everyday and be a positive light when they've just experienced a terrible accident. It makes you feel good doing the work for good people.

Biggest perk about the company is that every Friday is half day work day.XXX,Company continues to work on a turnaround and while there are some positive signs (e.g. new CEO, new CBO from prominent organizations) there is still much to be done internally to make Mattel a great company.

Bonuses and raises have been either  meager or non-existent due to the company's continuing struggle to meet financial goals.XXX,Work/life balance is entirely dependent on your team.  Mattel is a matrix-style organization with many small, highly-specialized teams that each have their own subcultures.  XXX,Company leadership is not a strong suit.  Mattel is a very, very top-heavy culture so expect that your voice won't be heard until you're at least a Sr. Manager or a Director level.  Leadership relies on a trickle-down communication style which, frankly, doesn't work.  Due to this style, important information like strategy, business priorities, etc. aren't communicated to lower levels, which makes doing your day-to-day work difficult.

Also they do not pay us enough money for the work we do.XXX,My typical day at work would be clocking in, reading what sections are assigned to me, then moving at an extremely rapid pace to restock missing items and also to pull larger items from the back for cash wrap clerks. I also at times have to play the sales person, even though there are assigned sales people. So, at times it feels like I'm doing everything at once while a few at times sham knowing that I'm going to cover behind them. Other than that, it's a lovely place to work as far as a part time job.

In addition, their focus on degrees and GPAs creates an elite environment where people constantly feel the need to prove themselves and will go to great lengths to do so.  I find these facets the hardest part of working there.XXX,The most enjoyable part of the job is there are a lot of great and innovative people who want to achieve great things.XXX,Sandia National Laboratories is a well respected institution within the nuclear weapon complex as well as in the general science and engineering community. The laboratory is committed to recruiting the best and brightest individuals to carry out its mission and committed to creating solutions to the world's technical problems.XXX,Good place to work.  A typical day at work consists of meeting with technical experts to consult on projects of interest. My role is to provide expert statistical consulting.XXX,Since I'm from Albuquerque, I felt at home at SNL. I've been on the base since I was a kid and enjoyed finally being apart of the SNL family as an intern.XXX,Was a great place to develop research experience.

All employees, management, staff and technicians were approachable with asking for help to solve problems.XXX,recommend for just about any job description whether engineering or not. onsite cafeterias, gym and auto maintenance. weather is not too hot or too cold.XXX,Sandia National Laboratories is a fine company to work for.  They have wonderful people and staff to work for.  The work life balance is key to being employed there.XXX,Sandia is a fantastic place to work.  While acclimating to the bureaucracy inherent to working in a government entity is somewhat challenging, everyone is invested in helping you succeed.XXX,For lower level types, it is a great place to work. However, its main reason for being (modernizing and refurbishing the nuclear weapons stockpile) is going to cease in the near future, no matter how many new projects are dreamed up to delay that and keep the money flowing. Sandia is doing its best to expand into other areas of technology, but the looming loss of the weapons is causing a huge amount of stress at the Labs, I believe.XXX,Great place to work for anyone.XXX,Management takes good care of their employees.XXX,Employees are given the ability to grow and gain new skills.XXX,Interesting place to work with many opportunities to learn. Employees are friendly. My work was a mix of CAD/FEA and hands-on fabrication.XXX,The people I worked with were very nice and my supervisor was wonderful.  I enjoyed the work very much, but it doesn't matter how well you do your job, if you are a contractor, their policy is that you have to leave after 3 years. The policy needs to be done away with.XXX,There is actually a ping pong table in the lunch room (given as an example for the review).  Sandia National Laboratories has many positives.  The work/life balance is great with healthy vacation and the 9/80 schedule where you can get every other Friday off.  There is also some incredible science that occurs.  They struggle to stay with trends, but that is related to the business and the need for stringent security.  Albuquerque is a very reasonable place to live, so your dollar will go far.  The job culture depends on the group and does vary considerably.  The hardest part may be the trend towards compliance structure (not directly tied with safety) which may or may not be conducive to research.  Historically the benefits have made up for other short comings, but the newer trend to tie benefits with a market based model has diminished some of the better attributes of working there.XXX,I am currently working full time at Sandia and love the job.  The problem is that the contract is running out and I have to find other employment.XXX,Company has great benefits and offers all the training you will need. Strict deadlines, many levels of management, and average communication. Not a bad company to work for if you don't have much of an outside life. Co-workers are good.XXX,This was my first project I managed and I had a lot of support and positive feedback from the engineers I worked with.XXX,This allowed me to implement by version and vision of project management. I had worked with other people that did not have a project management style and that caused a lot of problems.XXX,SNL is a great place to work.  Lots of different things to work on.  The hardest part is the security levels you have to be mindful of.XXX,As a student intern, I appreciate being able to make my own schedule. I appreciate how supportive they are with school. I truly believe this is the ideal job for students.XXX,Drive out to the remote site and make coffee, then start prepping for the job at hand.  I learned tons here...Antennas, RCS, Testing techniques and ""why"".  Management was driven by customer's needs and funding...they did a great job.  Co-workers couldn't be beat.  They were like family...and not just the few at the range, but the whole department.  Scientists with Bachelors, Masters and PhD's were the best Mentors I ever had.  The hardest part of the job was in moving all the radar absorber every week or two to set up for the next configuration...but the most enjoyable part was knowing we had all worked as a team, had fun, and got the job done, with good data going out to the customer.  This was a place where they assigned you a task, and then let you accomplish it on your own without ""Micro-Management"".XXX,Hardest yet most rewarding job! Challenged everyday with new projects and new ideas. SNL pushes you to your limit. You discover things in yourself you didn't know you are capable of. Overwhelming at times and empowering at other times. Must be dedicated, but will be well worth it.

I learned a great deal from my Management and peers.XXX,Adobe is the Shangri-La of software development companies. They have excellent benefits, awesome perks, beautiful campuses, amazing people, and some very cool products. They're so good, in fact, that nobody ever leaves. This leads to pretty much the only problem: Since people typically stay their till retirement, no one ever really moves up the chain of advancement till someone retires (or, very rarely, leaves). So if you want to advance your career, you might have to leave (and might not be able to come back till someone else leaves).XXX,I have amazing colleagues in Adobe, they are helpful and diligent.

Multitudes of different computer programs to assist and complete customers requests.  The management is lacking in this business not very professional as to say the least.  Co-workers are the balance between management and daily duties.  They are what makes working for a company worthwhile and what making comes to work satisfying.

Not being able to interrupt and let the other person know you are here to help and to try and assist to the best of your ability.

Many opportunities availble for you to explore and it was arranged for you to use work hours to obtain, education, training and coaching.XXX,90% of files involved litigation.  Received and review transfer files when suit was filed.  Most of the time, my job involved working with local management and home office management.  Completed large loss reports and evaluated exposure(s) in order to set appropriate reserves.  Worked with defense counsel and attended mediations which involved a lot of traveling. Even though I did not work directly with my co-workers, it was a very friendly environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to travel.XXX,EMC was a great place to work.  They promoted education and team work so that everyone, regardless of what department, worked together for the end result.XXX,quantity of work was above average but varied greatly between inside and outside department staffs which were kept separated rather than joined. When working away from office meeting customers and clients was most joyful part of the job but was reduced due to adjustments directed by management.XXX,Quality benefits was second to none.XXX,Prioritizing workload with constant demands for everything on your desk to be completed that day. Underwriters were eager to teach their knowledge of things.XXX,I have really enjoyed working at EMC. People are friendly and employees are treated well. My boss is very flexible to the needs of the employees within our department, making it easy to have a good work/life balance. XXX,Management was discriminating, demanding.  The company itself, based out of Des Moines, is a solid company, but the new VP gradually changed the enviroment in a negative way.XXX,The corporate culture is changing at this company. It appears that the home office in Des Moines, Iowa is dictating the terms of employment and job requirements. The claims mgmt has given automy to its claims personnel until recently. Home office and the district superintendents seemed to be dictating the investigation and settlement authority. This is resulting in longer hours at work and more stress. The coworkers are great to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was the variety of cases. From munincipal/school law claims, to asbestos/prodiucts liaiblity claims to large litigated file cases involving auto/ liability claims. The hardest part of the job was wearing too many hats that involved public relations with broker/agents and meeting thoses entities expectations, and not receiving the support of management.XXX,Company is small so hard to promote. Fun place to be and good atmosphereXXX,Well oiled company that provides its employees ample opportunities to grow and develop. Management is fair and easy to communicate with.

My managers were supportive and effective and my coworkers were friendly. XXX,The company fostered a really open work environment were people were encouraged to mingle with other departments and understand how other people's work affected them. I think the free food and casual atmosphere helped people take breaks and socialize when they needed to and to get more work done without burning out.XXX,Most importantly, my job taught me how tech and social media companies work and how intellectual property laws affect them. It was a fascinating look into the way site policies were informed and reformed as well.XXX,Tumblr has recently announced that they will start paying bloggers, however this is to come in the future. For now you need to seek third party businesses in order to monetize your site. Depending on your traffic, it is good passive income.XXX,Great culture and growing company. Fun place to work and think on your feet. Have the ability to make an impact on the company and bottom line.XXX,I joined Tumblr blogging web site in 2012, to share and contribute my love of the hit cable series, The Walking Dead.  The site is nicely outlined and formatted for experienced bloggers and writers to compose stories, fiction, media footage, quotes, and photos.

It also is a terrific avenue for newbies to practice and perfect their writing, designing, and blogging skills.XXX,Tumblr has trained me for this social media frenzy of a world we live in and has taught me the essentials.

The fast response to its customers and the customer loyalty is key to our success.  The environment is very fast past.  A typical day at work could be running a requirement gathering meeting, or spending an entire day transition documentation into templates.  We could have an all day/Week Testing with a project team, or a 4 hr conference call to our Asia team on training of the new software.  Creating communications to learning how to query, there is no typical day at Polaris.  The culture encourages this.  You are not a project manager, engineer, or buyer, you are a Polaris employee.  The most enjoyable part of the job is you will never get bored.  There are always a challenge.XXX,location was not family oriented and hours shifted too much. no room for advancement. Pay scale was not all that well. Shifts were all over the place not very organized.XXX,Fun place to work. If you enjoy talking about four wheeling in the out doors or riding motorcycles, this is the place for you. Theres  a culture. It's interesting to hear about peoples adventures.XXX,My only problem really with Polaris is the pay. There are plenty of people working with the company that are definitely overqualified and don't make enough to provide for their family.XXX,I learned a lot about manufacturing, partly due to to good training and partly due to onsite college courses.  Compensation was great but the job could get pretty hectic.XXX,I have worked for this company for 10 years and then they said they were closing so I went to school in hopes to utilize that experience and hoping a degree in business management would help me obtain another job in either manufacturing or in a business office that I could learn and grow with all my experiences. I worked as an assembler for several years and then was in materials until I went to school. I worked in an office for three months before returning to Polaris for another two years of work. Basically I have done general labor with assembly and done shipping, receiving, parts delivery to the assembly lines, picked the parts, unloaded trailers and loaded trailers.  The company was still under part of the restructure with personnel and leadership when I decided to leave and try an office job as I was not feeling that there was much chance for advancement even with all the experience and a degree due to all the changes the company was still going through.XXX,I helped start the new plant in Huntsville and it was a horrible experience. They are trying to use lean manufacturing principles but none of the management really believes in them so it's just very confusing in what's going on.XXX,Its cool being able to work with power sports products and learn how they are made they supply all tools and process know how in order to have a successful productive day.XXX,It's your typical production job. Nothing really exciting about it. Unfortunately lack of planning and terrible decision making by higher ups leads to a lot of ""mandatory overtime"". And mandatory means mandatory. So if you have any other commitments that are hard to handle working 6 days a week (up to 12 hours a day, with two 10min. Breaks and one unpaid 30 minute break) with the possibility of 7 days a week and holidays. then you wouldn't last long at Polaris.XXX,Used to work at Polaris in Spirit Lake, Iowa. Overall the facility was nice and up to date. But, if you work on the wrong line it could be rough. Arrogant and cocky supervisors and production managers. Line Engineers who feel like they own you and place all blame on you if issues arise. Get whipped for hours in 2 months. Then everything goes stale rest of year for hours and fighting unemployment office just to get enough money for food and gas to survive. A true paycheck to paycheck job.XXX,Health insurance is sky high. $1200.00 deductable per year for a single person with a 49.00 bi weekly premium and have to pay full out of pocket to go to doctor all year. XXX,Raise issues to management and they will scoff at you and push it aside. Engineers will tell you to ""figure it out yourself"" reguarding safety concerns on vehicles. And they wonder why everything is catching on fire now.XXX,Only good thing is the profit sharing and nice breakrooms with catered food. Other than that nothing else. Hard to advance up the ladder unless your a woman who sleeps with the leads or flirts with them. Or your buddies with management. XXX,Line techs can be real jerks and will write you up any chance they get. They will sneak up on you at times even. If you miss one checkback. They will take a picture and make you sign a paper. Some operators down the line will sabotage you and wipe your checkback off with towels to get you in trouble.XXX,Too many layoffs such as this current 2 month layoff over the holidays no less. XXX,Most co-workers here are hardcore biker type and rude. XXX,All management caresXXX,  XXX, about is their stock prices and bottom line.XXX,  XXX,In my opinion, Polaris is a good place to work. I have learned about teamwork and how to interact with others. The management at Polaris is decent and they know how to get the job done. The hardest part about working at Polaris is the unset work hours. We could have a ten hour workday or an eight hour workday. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is the people I work with.XXX,HR plays games with hiring qualified people. Wants to keep it local but the small town environment doesn't have the experience in manufacturing to compliment the workforce..XXX,Our processes and tools are years behind and we are are trying to play catch up.XXX,Great people to work with.XXX,Fast pace environment.XXX,Below base salaries but huge bonuses (profit sharing) and free vehicles.XXX,Co-workers for the most part were hard working and easy to get along with.XXX,Could communicate openly with management. Management encouraged suggestions for making processes more efficient.XXX,Expect to get work butt worked with very little appreciation, seniority means nothing! Majority of coworkers are friendly other than the negative attitudes because they are burnt out and very tired from being run ragged! A lot of people don't last long there because it is very fast pasted and they can't handle that. Most jobs on the assembly lines are either very overwhelming or to simple the jobs are not very well balanced.XXX,They awesome benefits and it's a great work environment. The only downside was that the management was having trouble keeping a constant work load.XXX,Be aware they have a high turn around here. They lay you off seasonally and even when you do a great job they dont call you back. They also dont do call backs. If you have had an injury on the job with them. They are great if you can get full time but if you are in the right plant that is.XXX,-Hours are not flexible. Resource MFG who hires temps for Polaris  back up Polaris in the practice of giving little notice to overtime changes with little to plan for family needs or personal medical appointments. XXX, XXX,-I learned several processes to build and test motorcycle engines. XXX,-Management is not cohesive in with workers needs, e.g. if there is a bad design on the line, the worker is to blame and not the design, so workers are put into overtime and workers do a last minute shuffle with managing their personal lives on their own time like taking care of day care issues and not  being able to go to personal medical appointments.   XXX,-My co-workers are great except one, but there might always be one in any group of people.XXX,-The hardest part of my job was dealing with the inflexibility of management and being isolated when I raised concernsXXX,-For the most part, my co-workers were the reason why I kept going back to work every day.XXX,Great place to work, Benefits were great, Then the company decided to move to Mexico. They came back. Whish I would or could have stayed.XXX,Polaris has a long way to go. Giving the benefit of a doubt they are a start up company but they are very un-organized in everything they attempt to do. Management does not have a clue and does not get in a hurry for anything.

Reasonable pay scale, some benefits are good, some not so good.  XXX,Dignity and respect is a big part of the rhetoric.  Regular staff members work well together.  Middle managers relate fairly well with employees under them as far as I've seen.  Upper management is distant from the regular staff.XXX,I worked in a grant funded program for a number of years. I hate that I stayed as long as I did. It was a terrible environment and culture. The director did not have adequate experience for the role. The whole program suffered from gross lack of skill  and experience on many levels. The work was wonderful, but the environment was so awful I had to leave. The salaries are much lower in the system as well.  Do not expect to stay market competitive if you stay in the system long. They do not promote equity, despite being a very profitable organization. They claim non-profit but continue to grow and expand, but fail to pay all employees equitably.  I don't respect UPMCs wage practices, but I do feel there are redeeming qualities, like good PTO and insurance.  At the end of the day, I did choose to stay with the system after leaving the grant program. So far I am happy I remained with UPMC, but I remain cautious as well.  If you are choosing a position at UPMC, be careful. Ask a lot of questions. Get to know the manager or leadership as much as possible before hiring. Ask about their background and experience leading teams (before their current position).  Talk with real, frontline staff. Ask about turnover.  Pick a healthy culture.XXX,The job is ok.

Most of my time was spent at Children's Hospital on the hematology/oncology floor. While it was a emotionally trying environment, everyone that worked on the floor and in the whole building tried their best to make clients feel welcome and important. I would recommend others to apply for a position at UPMC.XXX,I was just an intern for 3 months. I relocated to Pittsburgh for that time just to complete my rotations.

Most of the people who work here are not college educated so expect to be amongst a certain ""class"" of individuals. The pay isn't all that great and you will have to work until 7pm and every Saturday until 2pm when you start. If you have a family, this schedule will be quite inconvenient. They write you up for having your mobile phone on your desk. They want you to be ""customer focused"". But you barely get a chance to breathe because the calls come in back to back from the time you log into the phone until the time you log off. You have the opportunity to get a bonus if you meet your quality assurance goals. However, the quality advisors who listen to calls find every reason to give you a low score on your calls. So don't expect to get the bonus often. If you can't find anything and you just need some money coming in (which was the situation in my case) this will get you by.

Really great upper management, but like any large company, communication seems to take forever. Since we got hacked it’s been a customer service nightmare. I think Oracle bought Micros because they had a plan in mind but whatever that plan was, it’s slowly falling apart.XXX,Oracle is very professional and laid back company. The hours are long and can sometimes be a bit much but at the end of the week it's always worth it.XXX,I loved working here.  Daily there would be something new to challenge me, a new acquisition, new policy, new process, new contract, new negotiation.  XXX,I loved the people, who are still some of my favorite people and friends.  I had fun working at Oracle, because of the people and the enthusiasm that my colleagues and I had over what we were doing. XXX,There were always challenges, good and bad.  I regret leaving there.XXX,Oracle have no regard for their employees. when they have lay offs they keep everything quite until the day, then you're called into the office and that's it, done. You get 3.5 weeks vacation max, then they make you take a week Christmas, and tell you they are doing you a favor.  If you get a 1.3% pay raise you are lucky, then come open enrollment, they up your payments by 1.4%. By far the worst compeny I have ever worked for.XXX,If you're a recent college grad this is a good job to start building your resume career - especially for a career within sales. However, change is extremely constant which could get stressful. 2 year position max.XXX,The place was nice to work because of the people around are very professional, knowledgeable and friendlly. Management are very helpful. The only setback was Oracle US based employees works long hours because of job reduction here in the US.XXX,Good Professional Services company with lot of challenging consulting engagements that requires lot of travel across America and good pay and benefits however limited scope for advancement.XXX,Management just hasn't figured out how to structure the company efficiently. For sales reps it's sink or swim. Also, no correlation to pay. You could do nothing and make a lot of money, and you could work hard and make nothing.XXX,Typically, I would answer between 5 to 10 calls per day dealing with a variety of issues dealing with a software under the acquired company Micros, which services the food and beverage/hospitality industry.XXX,I learned many troubleshooting/IT skills, organizational and productivity skills, time management, attention to detail, problem solving, etc.XXX,Management is constantly monitoring your metrics (how long you took to answer the call, how long you were on the call, etc.)XXX,On days that are less busy, such as a Saturday, many employees would be found surfing the internet and social media.XXX,The hardest part about the job is receiving adequate training using real scenarios. I don't think there has been a day where I haven't had to ask for help on something. Had I received training on all of the facets of the product I supported, resolving issues would be a lot easier.XXX,The easiest part of the job comes when there aren't any calls coming in. This gives you time to work on other cases, personal endeavors, etc.XXX,Oracle is a fun place to work with. Job work/ Life balance is the best thing I like in Oracle. The most enjoyable part of the job is working on the cutting edge technologies;XXX,Brain stimulating and challenging place to work, however, it was fun and the people I worked with felt like family.  We worked together really well by learning together, working with another and engaging in team building events.XXX,You must adapt and manage yourself every single issue in this company, fix your problem quickly.

Trend there is: one real person work will be tied to minimum of 4-5 levels/layers of different other folks related or not before it goes to some little use. In simple words of summary ""sincere and hardworking folks continue to be poor(all aspects), political, influenced and tribal nature folks continue to be rich(all aspects) irrespective of tech skills or talentXXX,Oracle has its up and downs.

In my job I spent a significant amount of time in the offices of other companies and I have to say that I always felt very lucky to work for Denver when comparing office comfort.  The office areas are very modern and well kept, the management has always been very good about providing good quality office furniture, the security in the building includes staff and metal detectors.  While the pay at the City of Denver is only in the mid-range of the pay scale for professionals such as myself, the benefits are good, the working conditions are great, and they are located at the Webb Building in upper downtown Denver and has very nice views from the 10th floor of the mountain range, the Civic Center Park, and is one block from the pedestrian mall with all the amenities of a big downtown locale.XXX,The current management team in my Department is highly skilled and professional and very responsive to input, and they care very much about employee development and happiness.XXX,Working for a Govt Agency as a professional Tax Auditor can be very stressful as you are in a negative relationship with everyone you contact, and you are also answerable to the City to meet fairly rigorous efficiency and quantitative expectations.

You get easy work and hard work. early morning shift.XXX,A typical day at work means you don't know what's coming your way.  You deal with everyday people AND government officials, so you have to be prepared for anything.  They often set up the lobby area with tv news reporters interviewing government officials, and heads of departments, so you could be walking past them at any given time to walk to another department on that floor.  You may attend meetings with officials or employees of theirs.  The building has security, so be prepared to walk through metal detectors, just like the airports.  It's easy to network here.  It's a nice place to work.  They post job openings, so if you're looking for job advancement and you have the skills for a higher level job, it's not hard to apply.  If you network with the right people, ask for a personal reference from them, you could land a GREAT job. The best part is the benefits.  When you get a government job, you CAN'T get laid off.  Raises may be hard earned though.  The economy isn't that great.  There are 13? holidays on the calendar.  You get most of them off - paid.XXX,Required long working hours, with lack of management recognition of what was actually required to do the job.  Issues with co-workers, such as hostility in the workplace, were not addressed proactively.  Also,  uneven workloads - those who are most productive carry too much of the workload.

Overall the community is made up of extremely kind and impressive people. However retention of current employees is not a priority combined with illegal human resources practices I would carefully ask questions of your supervisor and get everything in writing. The policies that are listed on the website are not necessarily institute wide. Also there is a huge difference in benefits for salary and non salary employees. I believe MIT was a great employer at one time, however I can say my experience and several other individuals was poor. The vacation and benefits are excellent. Work life balance is difficult.

Management provides  an opportunity to learn and grow within the company.XXX,Fast paced and busy. A competitive work environment. Sometimes busy to the point that it is hard to get to take a break or a lunch. Other than that I enjoyed talking with people on the phone and helping them to select benefits for themselves and their family.XXX,At Allstate Insurance I sold Insurance to customers who were not insured with Allstate Insurance; who I offered a quote to.  I enjoyed the customers, and being able to save them money on  what they needed to insure.XXX,Good management, lots of nice co-workers, fairly easy work. Hardest part was trying to find someone to help another person in rural areas. I learned better phone etiquette and also to be more precise with information, more to the point. I enjoyed the easy going customer and turning a angry customers situation into a positive one by getting them the help they needed. Sometimes I had to clean up another reps mistakes or service providers, but as long as the customer received their service I did my job correctly.XXX,Not knowing that allstate is an individually owned company there were alot of questions that were not answered while I was there.

Good work/life balance, company holidays, PTO and other benefits to employees.XXX,Was told on the initial interview that there was plenty of room for growth after coming in at the entry level position. After several years of working in the same department and several interviews later no advancement had happened. Low pay/hard work and production goals to meet.XXX,Allstate product is competitive and offers some very enticing coverage options.  Make sure you work in an established office opposed to a new agency.  The only issue I have come across is lack of focus and direction with many new owners.XXX,Business model for financial services is a good one; however, management commitment to its implementation is sorely lacking.  As a result, opportunities for meaningful partnerships with more established agencies are slim.XXX,I learned a lot working for All State insurance company.

They do care about their employees a lot and the environment is very supportive. I would recommend working here!XXX,Great work atmosphere and culture. Everyday is structured with the same schedule but many fun activities and team bonding experience are incorporated as much as possible. Management is very understanding and resourceful with assisting in daily work.XXX,When I was there, I enjoyed the employee appreciation days where they held little activities and also the performance bonuses yearly. The benefits were good the flexibility with sick time and time off were okay as well, I did not though agree with their ever changing metrics, and updates to the employee money. Such as the sales or cross selling opportunities they were capped when before they were not and motivated the employees to definitely strive to become better then themselves.XXX,Hard company to work for. Management has NO clue on the work load, how to handle there employees and only cares about numbers. There is zero room for advancement.  The office is run by a bunch of young kids who have no knowledge of how to get things done! Over the years it has been like a revolving door.

Hard to get used to a good boss before they transfer or leave the company.XXX,Work day may consist of any where from 8 to 16 hour workdays. I learned a great deal of loading procedures and operating front loaders for containers. Management was ok but only worried about the job and not the employees. The hardest part of the job was the long hours that was demanding and the most enjoyable part was working with others to accomplish the goals for the day.XXX,Switching out freight cars to build outgoing trainsXXX,Learned the importance of safety and working as a teamXXX,Hardest thing to deal with was the weather and being outside in all the elements.XXX,Management is very strict on how the job has to be done.XXX,Even though being outside in rain or shine I enjoyed doing it.XXX,Great benefits, good retirement. Can be seriously dangerous if you arent alert and safety conscious. A lot of nepotism among higher management.  An insurance policy known as ""run-off "" insurance is a must. Everyone that works as union labor has been run-off at least once. Many rules are arbitrary and pointless. Many managers are nothing more than rule enforcing evaluators with no job experience. A lot of managers have a quota of discipline. In Jacksonville Division, a manager was required to have 60 test failures per month. Most resulting in days off without pay. The other engineers and conductors were great comrades and friends, trying to do the job safely and remain injury free. All while locked in an adversarial relation with managers who were expected and pressured to fire them. Money was good. Stress terrible.XXX,Csx is a very rewarding company to work for as a carman. There is routine but something different every day. Hard work, but you are rewarded for it. Great benefits, medical, retirement, holidays etc.XXX,This job is very rewarding. Each day you go in, you're assigned a route for the day, or days. Typically you stay in a hotel for the night of your trip, or at least in my experience as a conductor. They pay is very well for not having a college degree. Although you are not guaranteed holidays or weekends, that's told upon interview. You're on a 24/7 call schedule, with rotating guaranteed off days. I would say the hardest part of this job is that there is a possibility of missing important events with family and friends. The most enjoyable part this job is being able to travel, and support yourself and family very well financially. Overall, this is a great trade to get into.XXX,CSX is not what it used to be. The environment is tense and employees are on edge. More than 4,500 people have been furloughed or laid off over the last 18 months or so. Work-life balance is non-existent and you are expected to be available 24/7. There is no security at the company and I would strongly urge anyone interested in this company to think twice before joining. The pay is good, but definitely not worth all the stress and headache. The company is very military-style culturally and new ideas and ways of thinking are not tolerated. The mission statement says the company is ""progressive"" but it is far from that. XXX,If you enjoy being micro-managed or don't have a family, friends or hobbies - then this is the company for you.XXX,This is a great job for the individual who never wants a wife or a family. Once hired you will be expected to work on your rest the rest of your life, spending more time in motels than your own bed.XXX,Delivery of freight based on customer satisfaction is usually fact based, however the hours are long and the schedule drastically changes without much of a warning. More time is spent at work than home by far.XXX,Safety is the number one goal. To move products across the country take a lot of people that are dedicated to getting a job done in the safest manner.XXX,Quality of life is Questionable. Hire you to fire you. Spend more time in a hotel than at home. Great benefits, though. Labor contracts are not worth the paper they are written on. Pay averages out to about $12 per hour.XXX,Coming in the door it could be a lot to learn and very hard work. This job is for people who are ok with working outside. It didn't take long for me to work my way up to a jockey driver considering i have my CDL and knew a little about the container business. Management is very fair to those that come to work and not to play around. The hardest part of the job is being the ground man & coming in the door that will be your first position. The most enjoyable part about the job is working from the jockey truck.

I maintained the Crew Room Train printers...delivering orders to crews and running Rosters to fill jobs for next shift.

I love my managers and my team. They have a direct interest in my well being with the company.XXX,I also love the office setup and vibe. Everyone is super helpful and attentive.XXX,Selling to staffing companies at Indeed is not for the faint of heart. For new sales people considering, recruiters are experts in sales and can sniff out a rehearsed pitch in 10 seconds and are filled with objections.  For experienced sales people, this vertical is micro managed to an extreme which means if you don't fall in line it is difficult to move your career past a call center. To make things more difficult for Staffing AEs there are minimum sizes to the deals which you can close. Your minimums are double what your counterparts on the direct employer side can close. So not only are the clients more difficult to close, your budgets are also twice as limiting as your colleagues. This means deals are more difficult to come by and less commission dollars. There is no monetary compensation for your restrictions, only pride that you're working in the most difficult vertical.XXX,When done properly there is a higher retention rate however this takes time to learn and in sales time is money.  Middle management is fantastic, the AEs in staffing are incredible unique individuals. The culture is great. This is a great vertical to learn about sales but the most difficult to excel in.XXX",,,"Fun environment, great coworkers, stocked pantryXXX,Work life Balance, Competitive Pay, Fun CultureXXX,Wednesday Lunches, Friday breakfasts, Culture, Free Yoga, Cross Fit, Amazing Leadership, a company that really listens to employees, and a comfortable office settingXXX,Great culture, PTO, and BenefitsXXX,Colleagues, compensation, cultureXXX,Free breakfast and lunch, game / break rooms, company gym, happy hour, lots of sponsored events, free beerXXX,great comp plan, flexibility, company sponsored lunches and happy hoursXXX,Great pay, amazing culture, fun events (paid for), benefits, & opportunity for growthXXX,Unlimited PTO, solid work/life balanceXXX,Free breakfast/lunch/snacks/happy hours/swag.

The first 3 years were very busy and I often worked 60-70 hours a week BUT so did my coworkers.  And the environment and our team made it an awesome place to work.  Then came the first management change and as things started to become less of a great team environment and more micro managed I transitioned into the role of Project Manager. In the new position there were wonderful challenges and a good environment until less than 6 months into that position there was another MAJOR management change.  Things went downhill from there and the third CEO level management change was catastrophic for the atmosphere.

The sites I planned to work on get pushed back to a different day.XXX,My coworkers are hard workers who, like myself, are just trying to keep up.

The benefits and pay are very attractive. The only complaint is the seating structure out in the ""bullpen"".XXX,Consistently busy with customers.  Management is very micro-managed.  Must meet specific numbers and maintain good communications with customers.  The hardest part of the job is staying on top of all of the service requests that come in.  Average number of tickets per Engineer is 30 - 35.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the peers you work with in the call center.  A typical day is having a couple of hours on the High/Critical Shift where you take those types of tickets and work them.  Sometimes the tickets can take over your day and all the other priorities get pushed off to the side.  As soon as you get behind, you will never catch up as customers call and want you to work on their tickets exclusively and you continue to get overwhelmed by the ticketing processes.  Things I have learned is to cope with a HIGH Stress Environment.  Management is always looking over your shoulder.  You do not get praised on a good jobs but Management calls you out in front of your peers on issues that go bad or you have no control over.XXX,Since I joined the company it seems that it is on the decline. There is not much communication between the different branches and it is hard to have an overall vision of the group.XXX,The environment and coworkers at Nice are what keep me going. The product we sell is enterprise level and very sophisticated. Work life balance is hard due to the high volume of work during our companies transition into cheaper support methods. Being able to assist clients resolve their issues and and being recognized for my hard work is the best part of the day. The hardest part about working for Nice is being unable to provide customers with the level of service they deserve due to work load and staffing.XXX,Spend a great deal of time in training.

Its a never ending grind, corporate expects certain production levels each month.  They are a credit based insurance company, if your prospect doesn't have great credit, probably not going to save them any money.

Its hard to beat State Farm in their home state and the dozens of other fly by night insurance companies in Chicagoland area.XXX,it was like working in a small office.

The day-to-day work can be busy and hectic, but it is not complicated work most of the time. High-volume and fast-paced. The culture, unfortunately, is at times a little bit toxic. This is because of the drastic differences in treatment between ""employees"" and ""temps"".

Politics run rapid and it really depends on who you know here.  The students are usually the only reason why you would want to come and work here.

Great staff, good pay and benefits. Not many opportunities for growth. Could improve on their training as well. Need to invest more in their employees.XXX,Great company, great compensation with benefits, great core values. Worked as ICC in Inpatient Programs over 6 years. Management and Supervision atrocious. Micro managed & scutinized highly professional, skilled, proficient nurses and rewarded employees who were less stellar with poor work ethic. Management did NOT foster teamwork or innovative ideas to improve the daily work flow of its department. If you expressed your opinion with ideas for improvement- you would later get called into office and be excused of being unhappy with your job duties and be given a performance plan for improvement.  20+ years as a professional RN have I never made to feel as incompetent or questioned why I continued to work for CDPHP. Why- because I believed in the the Company, its values and its members!  I now work for a National Company that truely values it's employees, their multifaceted experience and promotes teamwork as well as work/life balance.  I have never been more happier as a professional nurse to work for a company that appreciates my talents. CDPHP should consider micro managing the management staff of the departments with high turnovers of excellent employees.XXX,Typical day during HEDIS season, hectic training followed by micro-managing  ""peer"" orientation. This was the hardest part of the job, I have never before or since experienced the kind of scrutiny that I experienced as a minority (as what I experienced at CDPHP).XXX,The pay: less than what other area Health plans paid for similar positions and without benefits.XXX,What I learned, the company wanted to apply IRS rules for expenses of office workers versus the IRS rules for seasonal work from home workers. Eventually, what that meant was that I ""ate"" the travel costs for their business purposes.XXX,The company environment, nice corporate offices with gym and cafeteria( higher prices for temps vs permanent employees) great  if you had time to use them.XXX,Permanent non-seasonal employees wouldn't even acknowledge temporary employees with common courtesy like opening or holding a door for someone who badge accessed the building and held the door for themselves simultaneously while bringing in or taking out materials/equipment for company use.  XXX,Would I ever go back, not to their quality dept. I have since learned that this dept is to be avoided because of the micromanagement and high exit rate of permanent employees who move speedily to other local quality depts at other insurers.XXX,Embarrassed being micromanaged and spoken down to. Management ignores employee morale and allows abuse of power within ""teams"". Rewards repeat offending employees that exhibit conduct unbecoming and turning a blind eye to rude behavior.XXX,Interesting project and good growth opportunities. I liked the fact that managers were helpful and believed in team work.XXX,The work environement is good , work pressure is high. Flexible timings.Work from home option should be there. Other amenities such as gym is there.XXX,I really had a good time working for CDPHP. It's a great opportunity to work for them. I really liked the work environment. I had my personal desk with multi windows to perform my testing which I liked also. We all worked as team and also helped each other for our work needs to accomplish our goals. Also we offer our clients higher priority if there's need to be any changes while making the application. Over all i would say I love to work for a big company like ""Capital District Physician Health Plan"" and it was one of my good experience working for them.XXX,Great place to work. Nice environment.  I loved my job but was released due to department restructure. Wonderful co-workers.XXX,Although this was a remote position, the management and my coworkers were very professional and helpful.  We had daily meetings and was given the opportunity to ask questions and give our opinion on the work processes.XXX,I worked in the phone unit where I was logged into the phones all day.  It was a production environment with little flexibility for hours or time off.  The company is very well run, all of the upper management are doctors, so the company is run by brilliant people.  my co-workers were fun people to be around but I hardly got to interact with them due to the high call volume.  Overall the job was not very challenging and the training program is terrific. The hardest part of the job for me was juggling a family life with the inflexibility of scheduling.  It was next to impossible to call in if I had a sick child at home and you only get one break per shift and it is a scheduled break which is sometimes scheduled an hour and fifteen minutes after the start of your shift.  The best part of the job was the pay and benefits.  Very competitive wages and the benefits are great, it is a health insurance company after all.  There is a minimal cost of living raise every year, although due to changes in tax rates and insurance premiums my take home went down two consecutive years.  Opportunity for advancement and overtime availability.  Hours of operation are 6:30am to 7:00 pm M-F.  All first shift weekday hours which was great.XXX,The environment  was really nice & it was fun to working in this company.XXX,Capital District Physicians Health Plan is a healthcare provider for group, individual and government health plans to dental and vision, along with health savings plan. At CDPHP, the project is creation of Impact pro reports (graph and table) for getting full history of member data and integrating it with claims and related needs.

The culture on the floor is also wonderful and enjoyable.XXX,CDK has a great life/work balance. They do offer in my position to work remotely. The people are great to work with and they are redesigning many of their products which is much needed.XXX,My position required that I give primary support to the CMO and secondary support to the marketing VPs and team as a whole. I supported and even lead several marketing projects in conjunction with my daily tasks as an assistant. Some other tasks included tracking invoices, submitting invoices, onboarding new hires, promotional item research, and internal promotional catalog development.XXX,During my time at CDK there were immense transitional developments across the company. From the beginning, my role and tasks were continually changing and it required that I remain flexible and positive throughout. I am confident in saying that at all times I achieved this and any of those I directly managed and worked with would say the same.XXX,I worked at CDK Global for a little over a year. I worked with one of their products, PartsVoice. This was a product that car dealerships used to buy and sell idle inventory.

However, management does not support staff to help with growth and support. Sales team is great to work with and helps reach goals.XXX,I loved working for this company.  I'm leaving on good terms.  They are relocating and I can't move to the new location.  They place an emphasis on continuing education.  I believe they are truly working to be the best business they can be.XXX,Exciting employment, with plenty of opportunity to see the country and meet new people. Although long days and lots of travel, 80% of my career was on the road. Management can be is very demanding but sales oriented. Provided plenty of training and automated sales tools.XXX,Growth opportunities provided to favorites not people who actually work. There are limited positions open for promotion, they hardly promote from within the company in the Detroit office. You have to pay for parking and parking fees are only increasing in Detroit.The office in Seattle receives better treatment than the Detroit office. One example is the Seattle Office receives more work from home days.XXX,CDK is a tech company trying to emulate big companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc..., but they aren't even close to getting it right. Clients are the unhappiest. It takes employees months to get their pay checks on time. Lots of micro-management. Parking is a nightmare. There is high turn-over. You can't get an answer through HR because they tell you to call a service line (like a 1-800 customer service #) and they call center associates never know the answer and takes a ticket number but never fix the issue!

Employee morale is low, layoffs are rampant, and frontline employees are the ones who suffer to help the company meet its bottom line.XXX,CDK is evolving the automotive industry through technology with 27,000+ clients across 100+ countries and 9,000+ employees worldwide.XXX,Great place to work with a great benefits package. Awesome and friendly work environment with a supportive management staff! Casual dress code with a easy office schedule.XXX,CDK were good to work for when they were know as ADP, but since the company spun off of it's parent company it hasn't been the same. benefits have gotten worst, they took away are tenure after the spin off which they said they wouldn't do (which effects retirement benefits). They send us to other territories to cover issues that requires an hotel stay (sometimes requiring weeks at a time) when we were originally hired just to cover our own territories so we can be home at night. They make merit raises as a competition between other peers then they split the percentages of the merit raise. Overall not that great of a company to work for. They also let a lot of people go to make there overhead look good so they can be picked up and bought out by another company.XXX,While change is a part of any job, CDK seems to be changing more than the norm.

All the science behind their practices is in vain when it comes to internal engagement. Good company to work with, bad company to work for.XXX,The best thing I liked about this job was that I was able to create my own pay based on the amount of interviews I had. I liked being able to set my own schedule, and work as much as I wanted. The only thing I didn't like about this job was that some of the employees seemed to be ""Debbie downers"" and had a negative attitude. Other than that it was a great job.XXX,For my first job right when I turned 16 making two dollars over minimum wage; I was ecstatic about this job.  We made our own work schedule with breaks whenever we decided. I learned how to time managed and it taught me what being accountable for yourself is about.XXX,I worked at Gallup for a very short period of time. This was because I had been ill and just recently found out I was pregnant. They have a minimal 20 hours you must meet weekly, but with being ill and doctors appointments, I was unable to meet that requirement and was terminated. Truthfully, my medical absents should have been excused, but clearly was not. I was working as a telephone interviewer, and by outbound calls, spoke to various people about taking a survey. Many said no, due to the fact we were always calling around their dinner times, and I was often cursed at, yelled at, or hung up on. Although these statements are true, my experience at Gallup was not entirely miserable. During my employment there, I learned how to professionally handle complicated situations over the phone and how to maintain an understanding of people's time schedules. The management and other employees were very nice, especially during the training period of this journey. It seemed there was always something going on in the office, other than working. They had games set up that you could earn a spot to, and each hour team were able to win prizes.XXX,I got to do the StrengthsFinder and found out that my strengths are- Competition, Strategic, Achiever, Activator and WooXXX,Worked part and full time through college earning tuition reimbursement while a full time college athlete and part time employee at Strike Zone and at the Gateway.XXX,Gallup has an amazing culture, which allows for a material amount of autonomy in execution.  Their only requirement of employees is the completion of time sheets.  This enables the teams to develop ways to complete work that fits the individual or small team needs very well.XXX,It's a fairly straight forward job; you know what is expected of you, you come in and get your work done and leave. The work environment is incredibly positive and encouraging, and there is plenty of room to advance in that career. The cold calling can be difficult at times, and dealing with difficult customers on the phone can be challenging, but in the end, you know what you're doing is going towards something bigger than yourself.XXX,You'll love this job if you like struggling to meet quota and talking to rude people all day. The pay is good when you can actually meet quota which is rare unless you're a chick. Nobody wants to pick up their phone and participate in a stupid Gallup poll. The questions are very personal and repetitive. If I got called by Gallup I'd tell them to f*%# offXXX,I loved Gallup & the people who worked there, had there been a chance for FT, benefits etc, I'd have stayed there until I retired.XXX,You make your own schedule but Gallup doesn't open until 3pm. The training takes three to four weeks. During the training period you get a guaranteed $10.00 an hour.  Once off the training team you can start on banks if youre good enough. Your days consist of mainly taking surveys. You get a half hour break time that wont affect your dial time, any longer than that and you lose some.XXX,good flexibility and good pay if you can handle the work.  I had no problems when I had 2 best friends there but one left and one got fired.  same thing day after day week after week really gets the best of you after about a year.XXX,Gallup tends to lure most of their applicants in at the beginning: promising you lots of benefits such as health insurance, job security and easy relocation/reestablishment past the contract period, tuition reimbursement, and a high base pay. They also continue when you arrive for training: you are a prestigious member of their company and practically irreplaceable, etc. (their ""group interviews"" and the first night of training is basically sitting through a long propaganda lecture about how great Gallup is). What they neglect to tell you is that is purely a commissions based position (after the training period) and you may struggle to earn minimum wage a lot of the time. XXX,They have a lot of confusing methods you have to learn through a brief classroom training period and also as to how you can ""progress"" at this company. I asked the manager about it at the group interview and he pretty much admitted this is basically a dead-end job; the only real way to ""progress"" is by adding more hours on your schedule, but this definitely isn't a career to carry you through life (unless you're impeccably charismatic and persuasive on the phone, in which case you'd be better off being a used car salesman or a real estate agent where the pay is more promising). Obviously with these kinds of jobs there is a high turnover rate, and the kick to that is that they are constantly dealing with the new people and dealing with space decreases as you desperately try and find a place to work everyday (unless you manage to earn a desk, which can be done in 4 weeks at the very SOONEST). You won't beXXX,  XXX, very appreciated, either in this environment or society in general, because you'll be doing cold calling all over the country at the weirdest hours that disturb people - you're basically a telemarketer in their eyes. Be prepared to deal with that. XXX,The props I can give are the mostly flexible hours. As long as you work 20 hours/week when you start, you can work anytime as long as you work a full shift on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Note that your hours here aren't necessarily calculated in time but production units. So yeah, you can begin work at 3pm, maybe not complete as many surveys as anticipated (yeah there's a quota for each survey project), clock out at 11pm and maybe you've only earned less than promised pay. Because if you're not on the dialer, you many as well be slacking off in their minds. XXX,If you need some extras and you don't mind struggling through a job, this is good for you. If you prefer stability, a stable work environment, more appreciation, then I'd look elsewhere.XXX,  XXX,The work environment and people were awesome and the spirit and everyone  was so positive i enjoyed my time working there.XXX,i currently work here at Gallup and its a great job but only a great student job or part time job. If youre living on your own taking care of bills and things like that its not the best job. Only reason i say this is because you wont have a set pay itll vary depending on your surveys. Besides that its an okay job i guess.XXX,A typical day at work involves greeting my co workers, calling clients and gathering opinions about various topics.

They are very open to make sure you have a good work/life balance. Most of the people that I came into contact with were good people. As of late I think things started to go down hill. Everything became more about the bottom line and less about the people. There were/are to many restructuring changes on going. This made it difficult to be productive and have advancement opportunities as management was always changing. I would say that salary was on par with other places. Benefits used to be very good. But a lot of them were taken away during the various organizational changes.XXX,The Eaton facility in Americus, GA is very resourceful. They teach you basic skills and show you how to perform those skills with proficiency. They teach you how to read the BOM and use the information you obtained to build a fully functional light fixture.XXX,My Eaton Sandbox was full of the daily pressures of being ""Great"" and/or my ""identity""..

,,ProductXXX,,Meetup,,,,,,"Meetup's mission is to create local community and there are few communities as strong as the one within the office itself. Everyone is super supportive and, for the most part, very approachable. It is fairly easy to get face time with management and express your concerns. They are constantly working out better ways to get employee feedback. However, the company has moved slowly in the 12 years that it's been around and has had to play catchup in order to get modern. There's a lot of technical debt and a lot of obvious features that are missing. There was an unusual amount of shifts in management during my time at Meetup. As a result, it was unclear what direction the company was moving in or what the roadmap looked like. That made it frustrating from a product development perspective, especially when everyone feels so invested in this wonderful tool they're helping to create.XXX",,,"wonderful people, feel-good missionXXX",shifts in managementXXX

The people are passionate about games and creating the best experience for their players. Everyone strives to help one another and keep the environment fun. If you are a gamer and enjoy helping others, customer support is a great way to get in the door. It is a contact center, however, so player contacts can be stressful and your work schedule is primarily dictated by what the company needs.

Insureds depended on us to help explain coverages and what would work best for their insurance needs.  The managers were supportive and encouraging.  The workplace environment was comfortable.

The overall goal of the project was to take holographic images of the mid-air collision of two ink droplets after being fired from two inkjet print heads.XXX,It is an ongoing project, the nature of which posed many interesting and challenging engineering problems during the period in which I was involved.  Due to the limited availability of information regarding the behavior of the ink droplets while taking trajectories they were not intended to take, great difficulties were encountered when attempting to determine their exact position at any given instant in time.  However, knowledge of their exact position as a function of time was critical in timing the optical apparatus used to take the holographic images.XXX,This problem of figuring out how to pinpoint the ink droplets, and time the laser and shutter accordingly, led to the design of various optical positioners which could be fine tuned/adjusted.

I handle both incoming and outgoing mail, and responsible for sending out package items for USPS, FedEx, UPS, DHL, Etc. I deliver mail and packages to the AMEX clients and other departments. Lifted heavy packages up to 55 pounds and refill copy rooms with boxes of printer paper. Picked up clients packages from offices or their cubicles. The benefits were great and the manager but unfortunately the hours were only four a day and the schedule wasn't that flexible. I feel this job is beneficial for students and people with less responsibility.XXX,Company has been going through system changes which is causing many issues in processes. These issues were the reason the job of speaking with clients is so difficult and stressful. Company is very behind in work and does not have enough staff to do the back office work that the front line callers have to do deal with.XXX,They were friendly to me but as I've said everyone is not going to be pleased per person. Mangers are willing to help if needed but not all as in any job.XXX,Pitney Bowes is going through huge change. It is trying its best to take its people with it but the pace of change means that some will get left behind. As the market gets more competitive and the company tries new products, life gets tougher and targets get more challenging. That said, there is great cooperative spirit in the company and everyone wants to do their best.XXX,The hardest part of the job are the long hours.

Advancement opportunities are not based on experience and education but if you're liked by management.  New hires for positions of leadership start off making more than senior staff.  That's their way of being competitive in the job market.  Wouldn't discourage anyone from applying at any locations because Pitney Bowes is a well established company internationally.XXX,Very tough work environment with little to no support.

There are times where you'll be working one flight or 2 or 3 flights at the same time. There's a rush and you're busy the entire time and don't even notice the time go by. Between communicating via radios with the pilots, the ramp, and passenger service and also communicating via phones with the towers, you'll forget you've been there since 4am. Shift end at 4pm.

It's a job that requires a lot of multi tasking and attention to detail.XXX,The most difficult part of the job is being able to determine which calls or flights have the most priority. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the multi tasking required from working several flights all at once. The rush of working a flight with a mechanical or a medical, while waiting for the next flight to arrive. There's a rush on the pressure that makes it worth while and exciting.XXX,On a typical day I unload trucks, stock products and rotate food products.

My supervisor was incredible. Developed a strong bond with many employeesXXX,Culture is not good. They constantly compare themselves to benchmarks Delta has set, and always fall short.

Usually I just prepared the set up of the experiments and write up the blackboard. Our course coordinator are easy going since whenever I have a question. He is willing to answer and solve for me. During teaching, I learned how to speak more comfortable in public and how to demonstrate and show what I know to students. Also I learnt the problem solving skills since all kinds of accidents might rise during a lab. The hardest part is to learn how to teach a basic chemistry concept to the student clearly and how to communicate with them. But the part I like most is to talk to the students and help them with the lab.

Little opportunity to better integrate or get to know any of colleagues as everyone worked alone in their office behind closed doors. Staff appeared skillfull and knowledgeable but overscheduled and spread thin. Little contact with upper management. Suggestions or questions/ concerns were discouraged and reprimanded.

I did however enjoy the experience I have had working with the general public.XXX,Dominos was very flexible with weekly scheduling. However, managment overall was unsatisfactory and unprofessional.

Enough is enough.XXX,I worked for the Summer with children that ranged from the ages 4-5.  A typical day at work would be supervising the children playing in the morning, then I would take them to pool and help them swim for 40 minutes at a time.  I learned to have a lot of patience during this job.  We would rotate the children throughout the day between the different activities. The management I worked for was amazing and very energetic. My coworkers were other students that either graduated from Kamehameha or currently in school.  Everyone I worked with were great and were very helpful.  The hardest part of the job was trying to gain the trust of the non experience swimmers.  I would usually have the group that didn't really know how to swim.  This was also the most enjoyable part of the job.  It was a great feelings to see them progress, learn and even jump towards me with full confidence.  I enjoyed helping the children learn the basics of swimming and it was great to see their excitement grow throughout the summer.XXX,Typical day included resolving staff IT issues (Hardware, software, network) creating tickets when work needed to be sent to higher tier.XXX,Large Private Education Institution that provided generous opportunities to  keep the education of the students in the limelight.

This opportunity eposed me the the many facets of the military and civilian community.XXX,I especially enjoyed helping the students become succesful in their required curriculum and working with very qualifed staffXXX,Typical day included setting up laptops for the students to use throughout the day and helping students with laptop usage.  The end of the day was dedicated to making sure that the students were on their buses on time back to their places of residence.  I learned a great deal of patients and persistence as I continued to help the students.XXX,A typical day for me is teaching Hawaiian choral music to students in grades 9-12. The staff prepares the students for an annual song contest competition that usually takes place in March. The students have two months or so to memorize their music. I also help out with any office tasks that the music director may need for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing what you love. I absolutely love being able to teach and share with the students the importance of knowing who they are and where they come from as Hawaiians. It's fun to see the students face light up when they make that connection.XXX,The organization maintains a long-term vision with strategic goals.XXX,Working as a Lifeguard for Kamehameha Schools can be a very rewarding experience. Some days you get to accompany groups of students of all ages to various locations around the island. Most days are spent at the Olympic size swimming pool located on the campus where students K-12 supervised by teachers come and swim. The management and co-workers for the most part are very friendly and helpful, you can come to them with any questions or concerns.XXX,Employees who work hard and dedicate themselves to the school, suffer criticism, are considered an outcast, and soon sent to the door. XXX,Princess Pauahi Bishop would be, and maybe is saddened, that her good deed turned into a monopoly over power and money. There is no genuine care for employees, much of whom are under-paid, those who spend time gossiping and wasting company monies are honored. Students are not receiving the highest level of education for a private school. Don't be fooled. It is not the same. Have you seen Kamehameha students from the Hawaii campus? Disgraceful.XXX,Nothing changed through the reorganization 20 years ago. There is absolutely no fairness and even aloha for employees. Employees run that school into a disgrace. XXX,Gossiping is very bad and the way you can be targeted if they don't like you. Take a look at the high rate of vacancies the schools have in Keaau. Very political. I would not recommend anyone to work there or even send your kids there. You will be sadly disappointed. Working here is like living in prison. Don't let the fake smiles fool you, because those are the ones gaining all the rewards. The real workers, educated workers, are bullied and picked on constantly.XXX,There is no teaching of Hawaiian values and morals. Why? Because the adults there can't even do it. You would think an organization like this would be different. Full of love and not tolerate idle gossip. It is, instead filled with people who maneuvered their way into a job who care nothing for the Hawaiian people.

The only problem that I have is Rover takes 20% of your earnings. I set my prices to be affordable for my customers, so the extra 20% taken away kind of hurts.XXX,as a rover it gave me a chance to move from post to post around the complex which was a promotion. this gave me a chance to move up in the company and explore other positions within the companyXXX,A typical day is mostly having fun with the pups and making sure they are well fed and get plenty of exercise.

Many local dog owners contact me year round to inquire about my services, and every stay that was booked has been great. It takes hard work and dedication but I've met a lot of awesome people and dogs along the way.XXX,Rover was great and I wish I could do it again in this town. It works with whatever your schedule is and is a great way to make money and if you love dogs you'll love roverXXX,I really enjoy working for rover, but there are a few downsides. They dont take taxes out and they do take 15% of what you earn, while also charging your clients fees on top of that. They do have great customer service and I have never had a problem with rover while trying to figure something out with them.XXX,A typical day at work was about 7 hours long with a lunch break. I learned many things about dentistry and healthcare including how instruments are cleaned as well as tooth and mouth care. The hardest part of my job was making sure that everything was cleaned thoroughly and in the manner that they were supposed to be cleaned.XXX,Rover is the best! You can make your own schedule, work whenever you want and simply put your profile into away mode when you are busy. Everything is customizable, so you get to set your price, choose what kinds of pets you'd like to either sit or walk, whether you also do grooming, what size dog you would be open to watching. However, you are taking on the responsibility of someone;s family member, so that is something to keep in mind.XXX,I love working with Rover.com it has opened my job experience with animals!

I absolutely love working as a dog sitter/walker and its been a great year so far!XXX,As a dog sitter in the retirement area of Sun City West, AZ, I am very pleased with the relationship my wife and I have with Rover. We sincerely enjoy the dogs we watch and have a story to tell about each and every one. We had to put our little blind dog to sleep about three months ago so this does a great job of filling that gap. We have decided to love other people's doggies rather than adopting another. We have had little ones, big ones, puppies and older dogs. Of course we have some favorites, but we love them one and all.XXX,Rover is a great way to connect people who love animals. They thoroughly vet their dog sitters to take the worry off the owners. It's easy for them to find me. I love that the mobile app lets you do dog walk cards, so the owner is always up to date.XXX,I first heard of rover through a coworker at my full time job. She explained being very content with the services provided by the company which is where my interest in the company began. After having looked further and researching, I loved everything the company stands for. Being a past dog owner and knowing how important the services offered by rover are to dog owners it made me want to join the team to offer the same quality service that I would wis to receive. I was also looking for a flexible way to make extra money but at the same time doing something I enjoyed and rover fit all those categories. In addition, the team at rover is super supportive and has always answered all my questions. They are also easy to reach and have great availability. Overall, I love the company.

Rover gave us a chance to fill the companionship void when we are in town, while helping the ownersXXX,Rover provides a unique opportunity for a fun and active side job as well as meeting both pups and people in your area! I started Rover upon moving to a new city and it has been an excellent chance to hang out with some dogs, make some extra cash, meet some new people and explore different areas of the city through housesitting. Rover helps you connect with dog owners you would never meet otherwise and has kept me quite busy as a dog and house sitter.

The company truly invests in its employees and pushes them to overcome personal and professional hesitations to succeed to your utmost capacity.XXX,It's a typical on the phone sales job. The management doesn't care about the employees, but only for themselves and how big their checks can be. They will train you one way and tell you what to say to the customer to make the sale, but will then turn around and penalize you for doing exactly what they told you do. XXX, It's almost impossible to use your earned/given PTO; you have to darn near beg to get days off even if you request it months or weeks in advance.XXX,The only thing that's decent is the commission check at the end of the month IF you're willing to work like crazy for the extra cash.XXX,This was my dream job.  It was the best place I have ever worked.  Great culture, smart people, great food and very transparent company.  You can make a lot of money in the sales field.XXX,You have a very high pressured sales environment with a compensation that doesn't match its intensity. It can be fun at times but one slip on compliance/qa and your out the door.XXX,Red Ventures is ideal for someone fresh out and ready to make a good amount of money quick. The money wasnt bad but the constant micro-managment of the company gets pretty exhausting. Terrible work schedule starting out my schedule was (4pm-1am), which totally threw my sleeping pattern off. The company has alot of incentives and bounuses however they use those to cover up the extremely long and tiring hours. Management will call you into training for the smallest things. Overall company culture is nosy and invading, office is always pretty loud and messy.XXX,Is an excellent place to work but very stressful, you must follow very carefully the sales process and not say anything that is not within the requirements of the agency because you can fall into disciplinary plans and even lose the jobXXX,They care about quantity more than quality.  Some management is not very coordinated since its a fairly new company. Good cafeteria but short lunch breaks.XXX,As a sales agent you will get drained being on the phone constantly and stressing over how successful you are. Compensation is based on a number of factors not just sales like most think, and some of the factors are ""uncontrollable"" which can be frustration. When you first start the schedule will probably be around 3pm-12am. Managers just see you as a number and not a person. When you are not actually working everything else is great(facility, pay, benefits).XXX,Roles are very diverse at Red Ventures, which include Sales, Management, Marketing, IT, Web Development, Security and even Culinary positions. As a Sales Representative your day consists of logging into a web based system that tracks everything you do (I mean everything. i.e. unproductive times, open availability, bathroom breaks, lunch breaks, etc.) while you receive an abundance of inbound call volume. You are paid a reasonable base salary plus commissions based on your total sales per month and overall conversions for the calls that you received that month.XXX,this job is hard but highly rewarding !! taught me everything about sales . perfect training. and lots of money to be madeXXX,Red Ventures was an exciting place to work. Great call flow and a good product made the sale easily obtainable. Management was ok, and co-workers were also.XXX,,                                                                                 Very fun, Very Stressful, Very good pay...did I mention Very Stressful!!XXX,It is a great place to work, it can be a tad stressful at times but the compensation is definitely worth it.  The hardest part of the job is getting burnt out having to talk on the phone all day longXXX,Typical day at work is taking about 20 inbound calls. signing up customers for internet services and convincing  them to bundle with tv and phone service as well.XXX,Fun environment to work in to mask the stress of a sales position. A place for only the resilient and hard working type. Awesome co-workers with very low drama. Great set of personalities and up beat attitudes. Hardest part of the job is the stress if you aren't performing well or there are too many known ops issues affecting your commission plan negatively.XXX,This is pretty much a call center. You will be very micromanaged but the managers do help you get better at selling with 2-3 weekly coaching sessions. You get 30 minutes of break time each day which you have to request- including requests to go to the bathroom, etc. This is very high pressure sales. If you say the slightest thing wrong on the phone you could potentially lose your commission for the month or lose your job all together. The commission plans change every month. The turnover is crazy.XXX,It's very busy all the time every thing is always moving 100 mph.  My co-workers were some of the best people I could work with.  I have learned so much at that company with time management and with my skill set they have really pushed me so far.  My management has changed many times over the years some for the good some for the bad.  The most enjoyable part of the job was was the people I worked with and the experience that I gained. Overall it was one of the best company's I have had a chance to work for.XXX,Get on the phones and start your day. No two days are the same. Co-workers were awesome as it was a great work environment. TVs, ping-pong tables, bowling alley, outstanding food and selection, flexible schedule. Hardest part of the job was constantly change compensation structures. But the job culture was overall awesome.XXX,Overall, A great place to work and begin a career. You will learn alot. Have the opportunity to work with great people and make good money. The saying ""Work Hard, Play Hard"", reigns true at RV.XXX,A typical day at Red Ventures is answering about 25-30 incoming calls. I've learned a great sales process through the companies intense training program. The management has always been great to work for and very helpful in making sure each employee succeeds. All the employees have been great to work with and being apart of a team was a great experience. The hardest part of the job is closing sales for certain customers that are shopping and not wanting to buy. The employees are not allowed to call the customers back so each call is very important and closing the sales is the main goal before the customer hangs up. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and the people working for the company.XXX,No complaints.  The business focuses on the younger work demographic.

Most of the people who work there are friendly, and they offer a huge selection of food that means you can skip the drive through for breakfast and save money by staying in for lunch.  XXX,The tough part is that the management team acts more like a ""big brother"" than a leader. Promotions are also based on popularity instead actual skill sets. XXX,If you are looking for a good starter job Trulia is the place to be, but if you are looking for a career then you should look in a different direction.XXX,Trulia has a very positive and forward looking corporate culture.  The company is product focused, customer focused and employee focused.  All of the employees are smart, hardworking, and able to laugh at themselves.XXX,Great company great culture.

The hardest part of the job would be the low amount of hours you worked per week if you was not full-time, and the most enjoyable part of the job would be working with the team, and meeting new people making great bonds.XXX,I felt that the assignment that was given to me was a dead end job, where I would never be hired on. I found out that no one had been hired in my position in 3 years. If you want to be a temp for years with no paid vacation and no benefits help yourself.XXX,omg nothing bad to say about working for express had to leave for family emergency but would go back in a heart beat XXX,super professional management up beat environment always busy and always something to do XXX,hardest things was all the go backs on holidays but management made it funXXX,I love this job. I have learned how to greet people, how to work more on the cash register, how to do the fitting rooms, and how to properly fold clothes.XXX,fast pasted. computer skills.good management. work environment clean.learning new skills.learning new skills. helping company improve work environment and safety.XXX,Very long days. You have to be into retail to work at express. Hardest part is the people and the messes they leave for you to clean up.XXX,So far my experience has been great with Express. The people are great at the office and always help with what ever you need. but some times the manager at the schools I get sent to aren't great and i don't want to be a lunch lady forever though.XXX,We layer water pipe and sewer pipe. I was the ditch man so I had to lay the pipe in the ditch and stick them together.  We also layer man holes for the sewer.XXX,Was a great job, just not many opportunities or benefits. Don't really have more to say about it. I would wake up at 7, call and ask them what job place I needed to go to and what time and I went.XXX,This store is closed now so it does not matter what I say about it. I enjoyed working here when it was open, but I left because I wasn't getting enough hours.XXX,If you're looking for a quick job the is the place to be, but you can't expect top of the line work, it's menial grunt work, but if you despise the place you are placed at you have any chance you want to change jobs.XXX,This was my first job and was a great place to learn the first few things about retail. However, I was not given the opportunity to work very often, as I was only a seasonal employee, which made it rather difficult to gain any valuable experience.XXX,I would start off my day by filling the empty slots on the sales floor with merchandise. Some days I would have to rearrange the sales floor because as every retail specialist knows, rearranging draws a customers eye to product more often. Ending the day I would clean the sales floor, back room, organize, and clock out.XXX,Was a great retail-clothing experience. Got along with all the co-workers and management. Sad the store closed down. Most enjoyable part was helping others with finding the right outfit whether it be a man or woman.XXX,A Typically good day at work would be when you and your coworkers have an understanding of the jobs and tasks that need to be done that day. Making is tasks fun and enjoyable for everyone and learning new things everydayXXX,Just go to work and be on time,loved the environment,lunch breaks.Also tha work I do I'm good at it and its no stopping me once I clock in and given my taskXXX",,,"Quick placement, interviewers are very nice.XXX,fun busy hoursXXX,We are friendly and there to helpXXX,long hoursXXX,discountsXXX,Bonus if job is completed before deadlineXXX,Got a decent pay.XXX,Successful companyXXX,peopleXXX","Not a career.

A typical day consisted of lifting materials and food, cleaning, speaking to new people at every function and practicing respectable workmanship. The co-workers left me to do most work because I was the youngest but I speak up for myself while getting my job done so that did not remain an issue for long. The most enjoyable thing would be smelling the food and serving smiling faces.XXX,The co workers were sometimes nice when they weren't competing for sales. I hated that if you werent making goal they would definetly fire you without hesitation.XXX,I loved working at Dillards and although the hours were long it was a great work experience that I was able to be creative and I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with very much. Dillards is a SPH driven company and you must work very hard and to keep a great atmosphere and enjoy it be a great sales person and offer great customer service. In return your work efforts will be rewarded. Dillards honors its employees and customers often.XXX,I do not really have any negative to say about this company except hard work is not being noticed for those who work very well and put a lot of effort to be recognizeXXX,As I worked diligently to grow the business, I learned how to build customer retention through follow up phone calls and sending notes of appreciation for continuing to purchase products.XXX,In this store i learned what I need to do with my life. I learned  about customer service, how to assist the customers, how to sell products, how ro present a product foe sell.XXX,Typical day at work is high performance environment yet fun and motivational and best customer service !XXX,How to engage with customers and 5 star sales.XXX,Management rather not sayXXX,Work Place culture is constant stressXXX,Having to deal with traffic makes it uneasy for our clients to visit with us.XXX,Most enjoyable when I have made a customer happy !XXX,putting out shipment, opening and closing register, straightening, cleaning, doing displays, assisting customers w/ clothing choices. learned about retail. management at the time they were not involved a lot of shady things going on w/ merchandise. this job was not very hard pretty chill.XXX,It was an okay job. Upper management was very rude. If you asked for a day off they wouldn't let you have the day off or if requested more hours. Overall experience was okay.XXX,If you don't reach impossible sales goals then they threaten you with pay decreases or the fire you.  They don't appreciate the great customer service or upkeep of store and merchandise, only sales. Managers and assistant managers talk badly about employees to employees. There is no recourse for employees.  Complaining only makes you a bigger target.  Gen manager doesn't care about the work environment or that dept managers yell at employees. Don't take this job if you're looking for longevity or respect.  Working under fear of being fired is not worth it.XXX,Some locations are fun and enjoyable.It depends upon the leadership in each store. Different districts are enjoyable to work in with advancement and recognition. The Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma region is challenging with little to no job secuirty in recent months under new VP. XXX,The overall company is wonderful with family feel and The Dillards are a consistent part of their business.XXX,Gained sales learning experience and also a lot about customer relationships and merchandise at Dillard's. The money you could earn here was unbeatable!XXX,Working at Dillard's has given me a lot of experience working in customer service. I have been able to be myself with customers and co-workers. The hardest thing working in retail is being on my feet all day, organizing and marking down items, because then I come home and have to clean up after a toddler. Management isn't the strongest here at Dillard's but other than that I really have enjoyed working here.XXX,You must be confident in yourself to succeed. I have learned that you can not allow the issues of life to interrupt your time at work. The customer is the most important person in any situation.XXX,Everyone on staff at Dillards is very friendly and outgoing. Also, gained a lot of work experience in my time there.The hardest part of the job was conflict resolution with some of the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and getting to help customers solve issues that they were having.XXX,All they talked about was numbers in the morning. It is not inspiring and everyone seemed depressed and stressed to me. The breakroom was gloomy and full of daily quota complaints.XXX,Dillards was a mistake on my part. I tried to get into retail and got stuck trying to sell womens' shoes. Why would you put a testosterone filled military veteran in a environment to sell womens shoes? really? I should've stayed in the warehouse instead. I was successful with the company there.XXX,The management was the worse. The department I worked in only had me in it most of the time. I was cussed out the third day of being employed. The only enjoyable part of the day was the customers.XXX,I like it here, but it's not a forever place and quotas are high and you are punished if you don't meet them... XXX,I don't really feel appreciated even though I work my butt off, and if I have a problem with another employee they don't do anything, they just tell me to push through and make my sales.XXX,Team members are expected to stand all day with only a one hour break for lunch.  Management never offers praise - always negative feedback.  Goals are excessive and if they are not met, Dllards will cut your pay.  There is absolutely no team work.  Associates compete for sales and no one can be trusted.XXX,Dillard's was my first job.

They will just pull you out of service with no pay.  They may even to dismiss you no matter how much time you have with company.  You can NEVER EVER let your guard down.  So basically, its a good job considering pay, benefits, etc...management is so out of tune with you personally, they dont care if they put you on the street.  Always live below your means just incase one day at work they decide to pull the plug on you and throw you out.  Union is ok, but they are limited to the companies Court when your in a investigation.  The best way I can put it, the Company is Judge, prosecutor and the jury, you only the defense.

No upward mobility - often ""higher"" positions are given the same or less pay.XXX,Typical day at work; you pick orders when they come in, you load out each others vehicles, and you deliver the product to the dealerships on the manifest.

The majority of the company works outside of the corporate office, however, benefits are only really available to the corporate employees.

But beware if you're going to be working as an outside account manager. XXX,I lived in Texas and covered most of southern Texas and Louisiana. I had over 40 dealers I handled from New Orleans to San Antonio. They expect you to spend 60% face-time in your dealers, submit a daily detailed report, and travel from account to account. Hardly anytime to do all of this in just a day. Expect to spend 10-12 hours a day completing everything required of you. Almost no work-life balance with these guys and they will tell you this isn't a 40 hour work week position. XXX,The worst part? Imagine hitting all of your sales goals over 100%, developing relationships at all your dealers, working with all your OEM reps, and traveling an average of 2000 miles a month to cover a territory. You'd think this would make them happy? No! They will pull reports and point out ridiculous ""KPI's (key performance indicators)"" they want to measure you on. How many GM's did you visit? How many business plans did you present this quarter? Did you do a target activity review of every account? These are a few of the ridiculous, time consuming and in many cases, unnecessary reports you must do. You'd think hitting your goals and delivering results would be good enough. After all, they deposit money in the bank, not how many GM contacts you had, right?XXX,And don't expect to just check a box on your daily report. You have to copy everyone on your email at the end of the day. You have to go into detail of what you talked about, what products you discussed,XXX,  XXX, what programs you went over, who you visited with, what was the results, how is it going to impact the dealer, what are the next steps, who will be accountable for implementation...blah, blah, blah. You then have to copy about 10 people on the detailed daily report. It will go to your direct manager, his manager, your inside sales partner, the parts and service managers at the dealership, the fixed operations manager, the GM at the dealership, the OEM rep that covers that dealership and sometimes even people you've never met or worked with like regional people at whatever company they are trying to impress. If not, they will fire you over this ""KPI"" you didn't do. I'm proof of that.XXX,The starting pay is 60K a year....I got no raises in the 3 years I was there. If you decide to work here, be sure you get the money you want up front. You do get monthly commissions but where they pull the numbers you're supposed to hit is sometimes a joke. You'd think increasing your sales by 20% year over year would be outstanding right? Especially in an industry that grow by 5-6 percent at the most year after year. Nope!  They only tell you by quarter what your sales goal is. If you have an outstanding sales quarter at hit 105% you'll make commissions of about 6K for that quarter. Not bad right? Well, expect them to adjust the next quarter to keep your commissions at $0 to even it out a bit. It happens all the time to everybody. XXX,You never know what your yearly number is to hit. At the beginning of every year they bring in everyone for a dog and pony show and explain where we are going with our new ""XYZ"" sales approach. They will have a number that is usually 15%-20 growth. You'd think with this they'd have it broke down to every car line, division, territory and account manager so everyone knew what their individual goal was, right? Nope!XXX,As I said before it's rolled out quarterly and fluctuates however necessary so nobody gets too big an advantage. A lot of politics too. It's about who you know and can win over than your sales results. I hit 100% for over 3 years combined but I wasn't a valued asset because I didn't check boxes next to a GM's name on my daily call sheet. It's their way of getting rid of people who they feel get the job done but don't conform to their micro-managed style of managing. Imagine getting rid of someone who did their job, delivered results, had dealers praise their consultative approach, yet was let go because out of 45 dealers, I didn't have a GM contact at 16 of them? By the way, all 16 of those locations had very happy parts, service and sometime fixed ops managers that were very happy with my work there and a GM relationship was not needed nor required to get the goal done.

The hardest part of the job was that they frowned upon such things as funerals that would be counted against you at time of review. They provide training. A full lunch center with chefs is provided but expensive. The company also provides refrigerators on each floor. They also provide free parking in Quincy.XXX,Harvard Pilgrim is an inclusive, supportive, comfortable environment to work in. Working in Member Services can be draining because the work can be difficult at times, but the team leaders are extremely supportive and want to see you succeed.XXX,Wonderful people and friendly environment. Typical day is taking 60+ calls a day meetings every Wednesday to learn something new that all the time to help you with your calls.XXX,Management is keen to ensure a proper work-life balance. Managers are very much involved in day-to-day activities.XXX,Learned a lot about the health insurance business.XXX,Fast-paced environment with lots of interpersonal relations.  Traveled to hospital business departments to discuss issues with claim submissions.  Work with other departments to resolve issues identified by providers.XXX,Harvard Pilgrim is overall a good company to work for. The pay is decent, and the benefits are great. Working in the company call center, however, became a very physically and emotionally draining experience.  There was an extensive 6 week training which was intense, but very informative - the instructors were terrific and truly wanted to help everyone succeed.XXX,Once on the floor, the reality of the job became quite apparent.  First of all, you are leashed to your desk by your headset. Every minute of your day is highly monitored. As a newbie this was expected and not so bad, but, as time passed it became more and more difficult to sit all day chained to your station- a ten minute break in the AM, an hour lunch, and a ten minute break in the afternoon.XXX,There were many days, when I felt like the customers' private punching bag. As a Customer Service Associate, we are on the front lines, trying to assist the members with their plans, and all their issues, complaints, and dissatisfaction with the company, and their insurance coverage. When a customer requested to speak with a supervisor, rarely, would one be available to take the call.  The Call Center Reps were always having to apologize for computer ""glitches"" that caused claim processing errors, as well as many other issues.XXX,One major perk is the ability to work from home. Such a time saver in many ways.XXX,The position was not what I thought it would be. XXX,Need to have a good background on health insurance and be able to explain it to members. No face to face interactions with members. Hold high standards of their employees.XXX,Assisted a team of pharmacists and technicians in a fast paced managed care outpatient setting.  Environment was very organized and collaborative.XXX,I've only worked here a few weeks..... But everyday I see a whole bunch of smiling faces. Everyone is so happy at work, I've never worked somewhere where of course you'd rather be in bed, but completely do not mind being at work. Also with the telecommunicating capabilities, if you weren't an office person you didn't have to be bothered! The food in the cafe is good, and decently priced. Even the cafeteria workers are happy and content with their job. The starting pay is EXCELLENT, and everyone I've spoken to have been promoted at least twice inside of 1 year! I hope I can make HPHC my home for a long time to come.XXX,Great benefits make it difficult to leave this company! Affordable health insurance and generous time off, most departments have great work/home ethics. Management is aggressively watching the bottom line financially-understandable. Again, depending on where you work will drive compensation-my area is not getting much in the way of annual merit increases and my income has not changed much in 5 years...but the benefits and coworkers are great!XXX,The staff is very polite and considerate of one another.

UT's close association with Oak Ridge National Laboratory also allows many opportunities for performing globally impactful research across disciplines.XXX,My typical day as a doctoral student was relatively unregulated (except for some classes the first two years).  My advisor's policy was that he didn't care where or how I worked as long as I was making progress with my research.  This type of environment was well-suited for my work style and allowed me to get more done than I otherwise would have in a more structured laboratory setting.XXX,The hardest part of the job was the research itself (as it should be),  because you are pushing against the boundaries of human knowledge and trying to develop something significant and impactful.  But the work is worth it, because I learned a lot from many intelligent people from a variety of fields.  The multitude of conference trips were nice as well.XXX,The University of Tennessee is not a place I can recommend. Faculty mentorship is nonexistent. Resources are promised, but not delivered.

You do not know the doctors you are working for and do not even get to meet some of them. Unfortunately the manager that hired me retied a month later leaving the office with out a office manager. The office then had  ""too many chief's not enough indians."" The hardest part of the job would have to be trying to explain to a patient why they owe a balance when you have no access to details of why they owe it, plus no training. I would not say there were any enjoyable parts of this job. I was let go after 4 months of working there, after they had just told me a month earlier that I was doing a great job and they were happy with me.XXX,The University of Tennessee is a great place to grow and learn.

The pay is great and makes you want to come and be a part of a great team.XXX,I actually got to work at a few different stores and everything great the management is great and sales are actually pretty good! the only issue I had was working more hours and more pay...XXX,Men's Wearhouse was a great company to work for.  Although I worked from home my team was extremely motivated and hard working.  We managed all of the opening construction and on going maintenance for 2000+ stores and office locations.  I worked from home for the last 15 years, and learned a lot about time management and good communication.  I enjoyed everything about my job, the daily duties assisting the stores as well as the large projects.XXX,Having watched the company drastically change some of it's core beliefs over the last few years, once consistently on the Forbes top 100 companies to work. Those days are leaving us behind for. Shifting away from a rich corporate culture of the past, we are now just becoming expendable assets. Only as good as our previous months sales numbers and stats.XXX,Men's Wearhouse is constantly evolving to keep pace with retail trends.

The manager of my store was a little toxic and corrupt. I'm not about to go on and on to just complain(for lack of an explicit word) about the manager. Fellow employees specifically the other CSAs and Wardrobe Consultants were fun to work with because we were all young men. I felt highly underpaid working here for all that I did.XXX,best work experience ever. if there was one in my location I would have transferred. The training was mostly hands on but everyone was a team player and treated each other like family.XXX,It has always been a good place to work regarding my school schedule and a good work life balance. There is room for advancement but in my opinion, managers are often underpaid.XXX,Mens Wearhouse has slowly become the typical company that seems to look out for their executives financially while we worker bees get the squeeze.XXX,I worked here and I felt like they didn't know how to keep my personal business out side the job. If the manager know you outside the job she will tell all the new people your business. The company is unprofessional in the PoconosXXX,A typical day is a stream of rapid fire intimate and meaningful connections with customers.

But as far as them wanting to help their employees move up the ladder or even giving them a chance to prove themselves is only  given to a chosen few.XXX,I was able to make a good living working for this company, However The focus of the IT department is not to make the business more efficient and finding solutions derived from technology. This department only cares about appearing like it is useful to the business. As a result IT analyst were simply focused on inflating numbers and appearing like IT mattered. It all came down to lack of leadership from IT management.  I am not surprised that TE is finally looking at outsourcing IT services. IT management for the most part focused on coming up with numbers such as ticket resolution, how many tickets were resolved etc instead of coming up with actual solutions to business problems.XXX,TE Connectivity was my employment for 15 years and my job was eliminated due to a reduction in workforce.  Really enjoyed my time their and go to work some really good peopleXXX,When I was there it was a great place to work. Clean workplace, great people, benefits and advancement within company.

Harassed for overtime, overworked you end up working 10x harder then people that are FT....XXX,fun workplace and nice coworkers. I work 5 days a week . very motivated people. great boss . good benefits. very busy companyXXX,TE ReviewXXX,Worked for this company for a few years.  Do your research before working for this company.  Over the last 5 years they have laid of workers every year.  Good, intelligent people with 20+, or 30+ years, were given their walking papers, as well as some with much less years of service . This has not just been going on for the last 5 years either.  I spoke to people who won't apply for a job at TE,  because they know they are constantly laying off workers. You truly are just a number when you work for this company . I knew a guy who received an impact bonus signed by the top divisional manager, and a promotion in the same year only to be laid off 3 months later.  XXX,They also use creative techniques to get around the work laws.  There have been people laid off on a Friday with the rest of their group, and then a ""younger"" guy, or two (read that as under 50) were brought back into the company the following Monday.  Sure, there are a couple who are in the right place at the right time, and can make it to retirement, but you roll the dice as time goes by.  Older workers cost money to insure and pay.  If you are young this company can be a good spring board to better places to work, but I would not sign up with this company looking for a long term career.XXX,I met a lot of good people working there, and still have good relationships with them. Management is a bit shaky from the top all the way down. For example, management decided to pump millions of dollars into the Whisper products only to find it was very difficult to manufacture, and very expensive to make.  CustomersXXX,  XXX, didn't need to pay the high cost when competitors had products for today's market that were good enough, and much cheaper.  They also tipped their hand to the competition trying to release it to the market so the competition now all know what to shoot for, and have plenty of time to design a better product.  Their big money maker will probably end up with lower margins when they do finally find someone willing to buy it because of this, coupled with the cost to make it.  The point is the little guys were the ones who suffered for this management blunder. Thee company needed to make the numbers look good even though the cash cow wasn't paying off so jobs were lost.  Now they are trying to push hiring more women.  A brilliant move in that they can pay them less!XXX,Culture, and work environment are good.  They remodeled all the buildings in Middletown over the last couple of years to ""trick"" perspective employees into thinking it is a great company.  It looks pretty, but don't base your decision to work there, or any place else for that matter on how it looks.XXX,  XXX,I had a great time working. The work culture was excellent. My seniors were very professional. I am grateful that this company provided me with good experienceXXX,Wonderful place to work. Great people who work together to get things done. TE is very good about promoting from within, which I`m a firm believer in that. Hardest part of this position is component shortages, and getting them here asap. I enjoy the fact that we have an "" engagement team "" that plans dinners, parties, heart walks, etc., that we can participate in. And programs set up to help the community.

The job is largely based in long hours on the phone and Experian does a wonderful job creating an environment to make you feel calm and comfortable to accommodate.XXX,A typical workday would consist of reading emails to prioritize the workflow for the day. This of course, consisted of monitoring customer affected alerts. I learned how the different business units worked together to achieve the common goal, to ultimately satisfy the customer,s needs. The management staff rolled down departmental and company goals and initiatives that was overall challenging to meet, yet sometimes not achievable. The coworkers were easy to get along with and in most cases exhibited good chemistry. The hardest part of the job was the tension brought on when we engaged in long conference bridge calls between the supporting staff and the clients. This sometimes took several hours or days to resolve. The most enjoyable part of the job when the support team woked collectively to resolve a customer impacted issue in a relatively short period of time.XXX,Experian is VERY old-school in its approach to management, but it's technology and operations were legitimate.

Great place to work if you have the right job in the right department.  Otherwise, you will probably eventually be laid off.XXX,So, the benefits have been great. However, after I started working there, there was a small pay increase to bring the company up to ""competitor standards"", yet we still make a lot less than other companies in the area.

With little to no actual managerial experience (outside of their current employment), they exhibit very large ego's.  All compete for attention and favor, hence management will consistently steal credit for other peoples' hard work.  If you're not management, then don't expect adequate compensation - even when you deliver exceptional performance.

There is little to no advancement opportunity, as VWCU prefers to hire people from outside over growing their internal employees' careers.XXX,Every 3-5 years a new corporate motivational program is force-fed to employees, and management uses cheerleader-style motivational tactics.XXX,The best part about VWCU is the Board of Directors matching 401k donations up to 7%.  Pay scales are somewhat competitive, but slightly lower than average overall.  This modification by HR is intentional.  Management however, is paid lavishly.XXX,They do offer an HSA healthcare plan - dental/vision are options.XXX,If you keep your head down, placate the ego of management, and don't desire advancement in career or financial gain, then you may do well here.XXX,The only thing I liked about working for this company was the people that I worked with and that does not include management. Every co-worker that I worked with did not like working for this company and most have moved on. Management can not be trusted neither can the HR department. There's not a lot of room for promotion as a Teller unless you decide to become a Financial Rep. Honestly this is not a place that I would refer any of my friends or family to work. If you do apply for a job with this company apply for a position at the corporate office.XXX,It's a fine place to work if you don't want to advance.  There is definitely favoritism and managers only care about themselves and their annual bonus.  They try to have a culture of accountability,  but that is a complete joke because sr. leadership does not even practice what they preach.  There are people in HR that are currently not qualified for the roles they are in, and there are others that are complete frauds and have been hiding behind the work of colleagues and spinning their web of lies to cover for their own incompetence.  This is very ironic since the managers in HR are supposed to lead by example, not be the opposite of honest and trustworthy employees. They pay an outrageously high salary to managers and executives, while the staff that is doing the daily work to keep the place afloat makes barely enough to live on.  It is disgusting.  They wonder why there is such high turnover, but they are so full of themselves and blind to the truth that they don't realize that the hard working people that keep the business going every day are treated poorly so they quit.XXX,It was a very great place to work!! Loved my co-workers!XXX,The only issue was management, you could clearly see they showed favoritism. They were encouraging to help you make your goals for the month, but if they disliked  you then they could care less. They would do anything in their power to get rid of you. But overall, great pay, benefits, paid vacation, and paid holidays was awesome!!!XXX,Good to place to work, learned a lot about finance and accounting, but not much opportunity to advance. Also, I feel the leadership is out of sync with its employees.XXX,My experience of working at the branch has been great.  My co-workers are friendly and always happy to help.  No micro-management as long as you do your work and keep up with your goals.XXX,Exceptional training and development program. Cross between a bank and a credit union. Moving toward a big bank philosophy.XXX,Vantage West CU is consistently rated ""Best in Class"" for employee engagement.  The outstanding culture of accountability promotes alignment, open communication, teamwork, and ownership of results.  Great place to work!XXX,Managers are given full responsibility for daily branch operations. Staff is interviewed and hired by managers and assistant managers. They are evaluated monthly, quarterly and given an annual evaluation for promotions and pay increases. Each branch is graded on monthly, quarterly and annual growth. Managers assist in continual training in promoting products and services during working hours to help each employee develop the skills and experience needed in everyday situations. The manager is involved with all aspects of the live working branch. Security, supplies, branch outlook, and company culture are a few of the daily jobs associated with every day work.XXX,Growth in the financial business and for our member's financial security was always top priority with Vantage West. The company was always evolving and upgrading in keeping aligned with new financial trends. I will always be grateful to have worked with good employers in a great company.XXX,Good company to work for. They have taken a lot of time to create a culture of accountability.XXX,I was a teller here. I would say if you got a great manager, your branch should flow smoothly. I know that for a fact my managers were pretty flexible and also it's important to communicate your needs and anything that has to be reviewed whether it's working with member accounts, or your own personal needs. The place here does make it important to promote a company culture so we can motivate ourselves in the morning and also be excited to help our members. It's really the attitude you bring to the plate each morning, so which are you going to choose? We had member service training classes that emphasize on customer service. It's to help everyone and it's good to recap, as well as review what we can improve and continue to work on.XXX,protection of bullet proof glass makes it feel like a more secure bank place to work. The life of a credit union is better than banks. XXX,As a teller at Vantage West, you are the face of the company. You are expected to minimize company loss, and providing exceptional service and sales in order to achieve company goals.XXX",,,"Benefits - low employee costs and great 401kXXX,good 401K planXXX,good management, and benefitsXXX,401k matching, decent HSA healthplanXXX,affordable benefitsXXX,benefits, paid holidays, paid vacation, schedule, tuition reimbursementXXX,Excellent employee matched 401K, and great employee benifitsXXX,Good benefits and good on-going training abilityXXX,Community involvement, several locationsXXX,We get awarded when we go beyond expectation (as a branch)XXX,great work environment, great benefits, room for advancementXXX","Not allowed time off when you have it on the books.XXX,NoneXXX,bad benefits, management, coworkers.XXX,not always the best room for advancementXXX,Terrible managementXXX,very stressful at times, many managers are incompetent, favortismXXX,management- like high schoolXXX,No breaksXXX,Smaller branches were expected to take more risksXXX,promotionsXXX,Sometimes it's hard to reach back office to get questions answered when we needed it.XXX"

However working for a company where you have been employed for over 5 years and knowing that if you are being promoted from within - you should expect to be paid substantially less than someone who came from outside of the company is completely disheartening. I have seen this happen way too many times to way too many people - myself included. When I first started, thank you and appreciation for going above and beyond was given always however in the last few years it is now expected that you not only carry the work load of yourself but also the other employees. This is a company that has grown way too fast too soon and they don't have any idea on how to keep their tenured employees anymore so they are losing them at an alarming rate. There are certain people in key leadership that don't value their employees and as a result they are losing multiple departments full of people. Overall, SCRI is a great place to get your foot into clinical research as the experience will take you far. Just know that if you intend to stay here - you will be vastly underpaid (a 50% or more decrease than the competitor companies).XXX,I learn so many things here. Good chance to work here.

However, there is not much of growth development. It is hard to balance the work/life balance. Lots of work very little assistance. I love the people I work with, they keep it fun and wanting to carry out the missionXXX,Sarah Cannon's tag-line, ""Fighting cancer together"", in a few words provides deep insight into the organization as a whole. This is a mission-driven organization comprised of mission-driven colleagues working together at all levels to prevent and treat cancer.XXX,Enjoy the mission and objectives of the company. High paced performance driven atmosphere and enjoyed the time there.XXX,The company's mission is great and in that respect I feel like I am making a difference.  The benefit packages are good, but compensation is too low for the number of hours employees put in.  Also, advancement is a problem...there is not much room for it based on your role.XXX,I love the patients, but the workload ratio to employees is overbearing and our management does not listen to their workers.XXX,If you like to have reasonable leadership who provide clear directives and are focused on producing a quality product, working at SCRI is not for you.  We are paid less here than most other competitors in town, with no room for advancement.

Things are frequently taken out of context with the managemet; esp. to make a point with you or other staff. Many times you work alone with no back-up; lots of verbal ""we have your back"" but not there when chips are down. Management always backs the doctors; even it they are wrong.

The people in the kitchen are putting together trays and dishes non-stop, the servers are responsible for bringing out the food, and the utility personnel are responsible for managing dishes. During these activities management is running around making sure that all the staff are alright and also checks in with all the guests seeing that they are satisfied with their meal. Before we set up these rooms we are able to eat lunch or dinner for free. The only drawback is that sometimes the food is cold or not fully cooked, but for really major events we are served the best food.

The support and encouragement I have received from my coworkers and managers has been tremendous. I can honestly say that landing this job has been one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me in my life and it means the world to me. Words cannot begin to describe the level of appreciation and gratitude I feel. I never truly understood the saying ""If you love what you do you will never work a day in your life"" until I started working here at Liberty.

The culture is great and the Management is supportive and collaborative.XXX,I also love how the company believes strongly in employee recognition.XXX,Highly recommend!XXX,I love working at Eliassen and coming in each morning. I enjoy complimentary coffee, snacks, outings, and the overall culture of the company. This company is ever changing for the better. Business casual dress is a major plus! My co workers are great, understanding, and respectful. Management rocks, I work really well with them. Personality is key, there is constant interactions with people no matter your role so being friendly, understanding, thoughtful, and open minded goes a long way at Eliassen.XXX,Always great interactions with people that work here. The executive team is passionate and committed to moving the company forward. With a 20 year history, it's a big player in the staffing industry. In preparation for growth, the company needs to be open to the required changes necessary.XXX,The Eliassen Group Resource Specialist program was an excellent introduction to the staffing industry and provided myself and the other Resource Specialist in my training class an amazing training program that was geared toward many different types of learning styles.XXX,On a day-to-day during the three month training I participated in classroom training, roles plays and shadow sessions with senior recruiters, and had phone conversations with candidates.XXX,I received continuous support from my managers and mentor, as well as from others in my Resource Specialist class. Not only did I receive excellent training, but I also built a bond with my co-workers and management team through group lunches and out-of-work social activities.XXX,Good place to work. I would recommenced any new college grad to take a look at Eliassen. It is a great place to get started and gain some real experience.XXX,I have been with the company for a few months now and can truly say it is the healthiest sales environment I have ever worked in. Management and executives are highly present, involved in helping both individuals and teams to grow, and their ""open door"" policy makes them easy to approach about absolutely anything. XXX,A typical work day starts with a daily stand-up meeting with the entire team to provide updates and check in one the status of everyone's priorities.  Really helps with communication and keeping everyone up-to-date. Follow this with standard recruiting of emails, resumes, phone calls and coordinating interviews/offers. XXX,Co-workers, Management and support staff in Bethesda are so great to work with. Everyone gets along, knows how to have fun but also are very focused/supportive to the success of the branch and each other. There is trust and commitment which is great. XXX,The hardest part of the job is putting in all of the time and effort to get a sale and having nothing work out. It happens with any sales job, but it can be a bit disheartening. You just have to keep going! The other con I would say is the base salary -- should vary depending on years of experience and take into account the local economy/cost of living. Commission package is better than other places I have seen though!XXX,The most enjoyable part, again, is the work environment. There is no micromanaging. There is a high level of trust that everyone is doing their job (it shows in your numbers), everyone is just friendly and approachable. We like to have fun and we like to make money!XXX,Everyone here is very nice and personable. We all get along great, and there is always someone willing to help you out if you need it. The managers are appreciative of a hard-working employee, and will always recognize the people who put good effort into their jobs. The company is growing quickly, so there are a lot of opportunities to grow with them.XXX,On an almost daily basis, I am asked to provide in-depth explanations of new 12c architecture and features to a highly knowledgeable staff. A great deal of effort does go into detailed review and explanation of specific technical features that may sound familiar but which function in unexpected ways. 'Selling' new functionality to development teams and operational requires a high degree of verbal finesse as well as the creation of test cases and demonstrations. The hardest aspect of the job - sometimes - are entrenched cliques within the organization which can make evaluation of new approaches unnecessarily difficult.XXX,Awesome team - great pay, great work life balance and training. Best sales job i've ever had and would recommend to all.  The team and management are amazing.  Very successful company.XXX,Working for Eliassen Group on a Government contract has been a nightmare. I am supposed to be paid each week and direct deposit won't start for three weeks so my first couple of paychecks were supposed to be mailed to me. So far, no check has made it to my mailbox. The company claims to have mailed the checks and they verified my address but nothing.XXX,The staff involved with the new employee onboarding process did not seem to know what to do, for example, my security clearance was not migrated over which is usually done the day after the last day of employment from the old company. This held up my access at the new contract location.XXX,In the future, I will avoid any contracts offered through Eliassen Group.XXX,Eliassen group offers a great culture & work environment. It is truly a breath of fresh air to be able to see & speak to upper management and leaders on a regular basis. This is a company that has built up a leadership committee that cares about its employees and keeping them happy. Everyone is very welcoming and helpful, the management team makes a strong effort to build interpersonal relationships with employees while also being very receptive to their opinions and concerns. They also do a great job of promoting career advancement opportunities and offers many training programs to help their employees succeed. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a company to build a career!XXX,Eliassen is one of the best Agencies I have ever worked for. The Account Managers treat Candidates and Consultants like Family. XXX,The pay rate is always good. They are very particular in the ability to keep a consultant on a long term basis and they always have immediate assignments available for consultants when a contract with their clients ends.XXX,Great supportive staff, friendly and productive team to be apart of, I've learned so may aspects of HR and enjoy the day to day functions of my job!XXX,I have only been at the Eliassen Group for a few months now, but feel like I have known everyone for much longer than that. Every employee from upper management, to account execs/recruiters, to the back office are extremely welcoming and outgoing; it really made the transition an easy one and makes every day coming to work pleasant and fun. Days don't only go by quick because of the fast paced nature of the job but also because of the easy going vibe the office has. Everyone is approachable, helpful and willing to have a conversation with you, which makes for a warm, healthy work environment.XXX,I just started here but it has been great so far. Everyone has been extremely helpful and I feel that the growth potential here is enormous. I'm excited for the future here and am confident in the management that we have.XXX,As a young professional just beginning my career, I could not be happier with my decision to join Eliassen. The senior leadership and motivated young talent with this group is unlike any other. Everyday I am surrounded by successful professionals that show up ready to work. The opportunities at Eliassen are endless, making it a place to call home for the long hall.XXX,The management of EG are very nice and personable.

Hardest part of the job? labor job, such as breaking ballets full of computers. the most enjoyable part of the job?

The culture of Columbia University is corporate but casual and the management staff, for the most part, are very helpful.  The hardest part of the job is being exact and paying attention to detail; the most enjoyable part of the job are my co-workers.XXX,I enjoy working at Columbia University. I work with brilliant people that are doing amazing work in the Public Health sector.  At the end of the day being part of the work is super rewarding.XXX,Columbia university medical center is a great place to train as a nephrologist. The glomerular center offers a unique aspect to training.XXX,the most enjoyable part of the my job is when kids and rents enjoy the meal. supervisor and staff are very friendly and supportive.XXX,Job security is an important factor, the benefits are great. We have decent healthcare insurance plans and a tuition benefit program for people who want to go to graduate school. There is no talent management and systematic approach to employee development. No support to employees who want to advance their career. CU rather hires people from outside than promoting from within.XXX,Pleasant to work at but stressful to work with the higher ups. Learned how to handle people's needs and multitask at a fast rate.XXX,Columbia is a great calm place to work if you are working with the right professors and staff, students can be annoying around crunch time but everyone is generally respectful and sensible regardless of your position. The curricula need help adjusting to the modern world though.XXX,I have been Visiting Scholar at Columbia University - ISHR for two years and I liked it very much. It was one of the best academic places I have studied and worked.XXX,I enjoy Columbia, but it's a large organization and I think everyone's experience is determined by their department. Not that easy to grow in the field I am in. I wish they would champion applying within the organization a bit more.XXX,Excellent place to work. Have the option to work on your own and also work with others. Definitely a great place if you want to learn new things and have flexible hours.XXX,Great environment, great co-workers. Everyone is pretty friendly and accommodating. Worked as a work-study, so I didn't have any benefits, but I'm fairly certain they exist. In my particular situation, I didn't.XXX,Excellent place to work because I had the opportunity to work with a group of people, and be supervised by my professor. Also was allowed to work alone.XXX,My overall experience at Columbia was great, except one aspect, but I loved the collaborative and intellectual environment.  Great perks of working at Columbia, but if you are looking to get rich this is not the place, but great people!XXX,Hard to get in, but you'll never get out. Nice place tonwork.. Good atmosphere. .no pressure. Not much I can say didn't work.there long..XXX,I worked on my graduate research project on a daily basis. I interacted with my lab mates and other members of the department. I spent most of my time on the computer or teaching.XXX,Not a lot of room for advancement, but really good benefits and work/life balance and generally a fun environment. Opportunity to enroll for your undergraduate or graduate degree once you've been employed two years.XXX,Great place to work, Friendly and engaging employees. XXX,No two days are the same, have set task to perform, but new request for reports or assistance keeps job fresh.XXX,In the Administrative areas, (HR, Finance, etc.) you will work well over 40 - 50 hours per week, take work home and work on weekends.  Certain departments are understaffed to support a large School population.  XXX,I learned that the onboarding is non-existent and there is no real attempt to integrate new employees into the diverse and distinct culture. XXX,Management are hired based on connections and sometimes do not have sufficient credentials for a senior level position.  There is a lack of collegiality, support and development of staff.  There is virtually no performance review process (not mandatory and not recommended or encouraged throughout the entire organization)XXX,Highly decentralized organization much to the detriment of policy, procedures and benefits to staff.  No consistency in policy and procedure. XXX,The hardest part was finding policy for case specific circumstances and no consistency in information and policy provided by central office.  Lack of clarity in policy and a severe findability and search capability for main website.XXX,The most enjoyable was the campus and academic population.XXX,While attending classes, I've taught at the University in many venues.  This review pertains to the non-profit, Community Impacts classes.  While i feel it is a necessary extension of CU into the nearby under served, under educated neighborhoods, it doesn't take advantage of the wealth of knowledge that the faculty has for advancing those that attend.  I was able to learn and take much from my professors and bring it into the classroom setting to move students along to GED/TASC passing and into college but that wasn't a standard practice.XXX,School work could be stressful, but opportunities are enormous. In a highly competitive place, everybody has the passion and energy to work hard on their individual goals. Instructors have different backgrounds: scholars, engineers, actuaries, businessmen etc. Career fair is a big advantage because networking is easier at NYC.XXX,High grades are challenging to get because of competitions and high level brain powers, which also makes life more enjoyable.XXX,Excellent environment to workXXX,Always workXXX,A lot people XXX,busy departmentsXXX,people respect youXXX,Never a dull moment XXX,Special eventsXXX",,,"flexibilityXXX,tuition benefit, talented people, good work/life balanceXXX,Brilliant PeopleXXX,Very smart and humble peopleXXX,Great social eventsXXX,Great location, academics and academic staffXXX,Great access to the best mindsXXX,Networking, Resources, Education, Academic EnvironmentXXX","lack of professional development planning and talent managementXXX,Sad StudentsXXX,Stupid personXXX,noneXXX,Poor leadership in administration and lack of collegiality, development and onboarding of staff.XXX,Non-profit arm lacks commitment to student/client enhancement.XXX,FoodXXX"

When I first started working there it was fun people were tired but for the most part happy. Shortly after I was hired they started laying off and firing most of the employees. They also kept changing and getting rid of supervisors and managers. It was also very difficult to progress even though they said there was room for growth.XXX,When the company firs came to SLC the culture was phenomenal it was one of those things where you just couldn't wait to go to work. Of course things change, but I feel it tore out the heart of the company.XXX,This company is typical of every large company, they treat you as if you are easy to replace, and make sure that you know that you are easy to replace.XXX,Before the company got a new head of operations, there was a fantastic culture, advancement opportunities everywhere, and great clear coaching. After that it all fell short, the company started hiring eternally instead of promoting within. there were no Promotions offered for CSR2 for over a year while I worked there.

For every holiday and new release there was a celebration including food and games.XXX,My typical day at work was pretty simple if all went well. My job was to answer questions, comments, and concerns with the website and the product we were providing as well as assisting with devices customers where using. It was a new challenge for each call and that was what kept it fun for myself. You would have a few bad eggs of course, but that rarely slowed down the pace of the day overall. Management told you how you could improve on your calls, and co-workers would talk to you during breaks about what they do when you run into a sticky situation. The hardest part about the job was having a rush of callers that gave us no breathing room in between to collect ourselves again. This, however, is standard with most jobs involving customer interaction. Also, compared to the number of customers they have, we were only helping a very small percentage of the overall user base. In short, the customers that called were the ones that definitely needed our help.XXX,This is definitely a great and fun place to work. I love video games and tech so working at this call center was really fun. Getting to know new releases and playing with the different devises that you could load the app ontoXXX,Its alright for a call center, it pays well but that is about it.

I think I didn't hear a response for about 6-7 months later?? The management was so poorly picked and orcustrated that I would highly doubt Netflix CS survival here in Utah.. I bet now they hire the lower bracket of individuals with actual experience and knowledge about tech support that their turnover ratio has to be a record high.. the supervisor I had was very demeaning and condescending and passive aggressive like he had an agenda to ruin folks lives, cause nobody on my team is there anymore as I still communicate with all of them!!XXX,•	Program area DirectorXXX,•	Develop and coordinate program areas  XXX,•	Successfully execute scout enrichment activitiesXXX,it was coolXXX,no standard for advancement processXXX,they bounce you around a lot from team to team, no real stability management wiseXXX,they make advancement almost impossibleXXX,no understanding of family firstXXX,i was a volunteer for a pilot show for netflix that is called fallen cards it was a very good experience i got to do makeup and hair for the actors in the showXXX,Typical day at work is coworkers greeting me as I walk in the call center and customers eager to speak to me to have their issues resolved.

More training is needed for management along with soft skills and people management.XXX,great place to work, people are always so kind and helpful, they make sure you have great benefits, and you also get you own space to work and make it yours, they always try and do something for there employees bc they understand that your at work most of your day!XXX,Don't believe their best places to work survey.  They put a lot of time and money into marketing, not so much into their employees.  Pay is lower than most equivalent jobs.  Time off and flexibility of schedule is better than other companies.  Micromanaging is insane.  Do not look for employee empowerment here as people are treated as underlings that are not as important as management, with the exception of a few events they do, but even those seem like pity presents.  Very modern in it's values, If you're a conservative person of faith it could make you uncomfortable. Proactively EEOC/LGBT-Friendly.

I can say that the way it was leading up to the new CEO was not pleasant. Everyone had the attitude that you should work as much as possible and be available to answer emails at all hours of the day and night.XXX,The hardest part of the job was trying to get the company to give me proper training. Because it wasn't given i never felt like I was doing a appropriate job for my position.XXX,The only enjoyable part of this job was the vacation time that I had earned and some of the friendships that I made. There are no perks and no matter what they say they don't seem to be interested in hiring the most skilled workers.XXX,This a great company to develop your sales, marketing and distribution skills along providing excellence customer serviceXXX,Sabre has some interesting products in play in the market that can be fun to work with but It also has a lot of Legacy technical debt which at times can weigh things downXXX,Sabre's higher management was changed dramatically in preparation to go public.XXX,That improved the company financially and was great since long due changes were finally implemented.XXX,However, after a while, that impacted the moral, and job security feeling and the culture was changed to the worse in less than 3 years.XXX,The employees changed as well. Many of the management level (that knew in advance about the changes!!!) found smart ways to move on.. The laid off people got nice packages and the remaining were either new management, existing management that liked the new culture, and a lot of insecure and resentful people. XXX,The fun coming to the office was limited as well as team work.XXX,Many company-sponsored events to encourage innovation.  Employees and contractors are dispersed all over the world -- Texas, Oklahoma, Poland, Uraguay, India, etc.XXX,Workers have great control over the software loaded on their company laptops, which means that you get to load your own software.  (For those with desktop skills, this is great!  For those with less desktop knowledge, support is available, but you will have to request/schedule it.)XXX,People are generally friendly to newcomers.XXX,Took inbound calls and assist in making hotel reservations. Assist with errors in reservations. Not much else to say. Just easy job.XXX,I worked in Sabre for about 2 and half months and I have enjoyed every minute of it. I had to learn completely new technology called React JS. It was very challenging. There is not a single day, when I don’t learn anything new about the technology that I’m working on. Apart from technical knowledge and skills that I have gained while working here, I also got to know the work culture and how to work as a team. I am constantly being challenged to be a better developer, be inquisitive and innovative while keeping the ethics and values of the company intact. The job not only made me acquire new skills, but also made me a better professional. The job gives me exposure of meeting up with new people of different backgrounds, skills and talent which has made me a better person. I’m sure that I’ll be able to apply the knowledge and skills gained in all my future assignments, be it academic or professionally. It gave me confidence to handle other assignments successfully. The learning experience I gained here will help me even after I graduateXXX,The people are very immature, even the supervisors they are not trained properly but overall it a good place to start off.XXX,Platform to use new and cutting edge technologies.Work culture was awesome.People were helpful and all you need to do is just ask.Compensation was great,in fact best among my batch (in Texas).XXX,This Place is really good for beginners XXX,Helps people to learn things XXX,Co operative and team building is good XXX,Work environment is really niceXXX,No job security is the only problem. Work culture is good and managers were also great. Self organized small teams, space is clutteredXXX,Sabre went from wholly owned subsidiary to a private entity.  When taken private, work morale went up because of modernization of the corporate culture.XXX,There are too many changes in the management in the last 2 years.  All the new managers want to change something, and sometimes it caused communication problems.XXX,Overall, working for the Sabre call center provided sufficient work experience. There were many issues with the software, which made tasks difficult at times.XXX,Individual ideas are given importance and if they see potential they go out of the way to help you implement the ideas.XXX,Fun atmosphere but work life balance takes a beating once in a while.XXX,Good work for interns I particulary liket it and i hope many will join. Less conversion rate to full times.Hope it changes in fututre. Good environmentXXX,Wonderful customers, peers and depth of expertise in travel.  A new grad can gain a wealth of global experience in the first few years on the job.  Now, the downside - The work days are long and the emails never stop.  Unfortunately, the leadership culture involves too many tactics and not enough focus on true strategy and growth.XXX,This place is very strange. On the outside it looks like this great company but once you are inside it's cut throat, there is no familiarization training, it's learn as you go.  One airline runs the AS side of things which leads to losing customers.  Performance reviews are based on heresay, the manager who you report to has little say, they go in front of a committee. If you are not in the cliques they won't know you and if they don't know you, your score will be low and you get no raise or profit sharing. XXX,You are expected to work 14 hour days to accommodate that one airline, and other projects/customers go by the wayside.  You have to work on Sundays and holidays to accommodate THEIR lifestyle and religion.  You are thrown into things without training, with managers that are not trained and expected to do a stellar job.  Things are not good right now for Sabre, the pipeline of work is going to by dry after 1Q 2017.  Work from home depends on your manager. Some employees get permission to move to Florida and work remotely, and others have trouble getting a week to WFH because of personal issues. It's all about who you know not how much you can do.XXX,This is a terrible place to work.  They have a history of massive hirings and massive lay offs.  They don't care about their people.XXX,I worked the early morning shift. I learned a lot about travel agencies and cruise lines. You could work at your own pace within specific deadlines. Reduced costs traveling on American Airlines, especially for international travel.XXX,Surprisingly large technology company serving airlines and other travel suppliers.

You get a decent pay for a stressful amount of work but hey any job you choose has its ups and its downs. There is no reason to not consider this company.XXX,They sell a great product!!!! Stand behind it. Certain managers need to get trained they need basic people skills and how to talk to fellow employees. Very diverse culture as far as staff.  You can work long hours and feel very fatigued. Enjoyable part is hearing how the product has impacted a patients life and changed someone life.XXX,Rude management. No room for advancement. Very minimal work life balance. Micro Management. Poorly compensated for the amount of work that is expected to do, very poor. What the company does for their patients is great but what the company  does  for the employees is awful and it starts with management. Management needs training on how to treat their employees. There is a lot of favoritism and sometimes racism. If you want to move up in this company you better know someone on higher  upper management or know how to brown nose . Various have very minimal management experience and it looks like they are just putting this company together as they go. They do not know how to Value their employees all they care about is sell sell sellXXX,The way can never admit they need their employees. XXX, The salary that they have listed is a lie, that's only for the main positions.XXX,This is a very dynamic and fun atmosphere to work in as they company is experiencing double digit growth! They have a dedicated and professional team of people who seem to really care about the product they make and the patients who benefit from it.XXX,I have been working at Dexcom for almost two years now. Dexcom has opened doors for opportunities for employees with little or no experience. Training was on point. Great activities for employees. Compensation and benefits are exceptional. Fun workplace. People are friendly. Leaders are very approachable and they listen to employees' voices.XXX,Great product, training is okay. You learn more on the job (as with most jobs). Goals are very high and depending on which territory you get and how that territory works will be heavily dependent on your pay.XXX,good company continuously on the move but exciting.  always a fun day at work, just be on time and ready to work.

Poorly compensated for the amount of work that is expected to do, very poor.XXX,Would not recommendXXX,You grow with company, Its a really fast paced environment and the people there are friendly but the expectations for you to catch up with the rest are too high.XXX,This is my first job out of college, and I've learned a lot about both myself, and working for a big corporation. this job will teach you what is expected of you while following strict guidelines from the company. The co-workers there are helpful and friendly and open to any questions you may have, you get hands on training operating multiple sales programs and get to know vital information regarding diabetes and insurance guidelines and qualifications.XXX,I helped Patients and their family's sleep better at night by simply setting up their mobile glucose monitoring system.XXX,a very innovative company with excellent products. I learned a lot in reference to medical products and FDA requirements. working at Dexcom has been rewarding.XXX,I loved working at DexCom, Their CGM is an unbelievable product and has saved many lives. If you look at the stock growth over the years clearly the public sees a future with this company. The management was easy to work for, everyone was driven and very type A so there weren't any issues with someone not doing their part. We were all so excited about the product and the growth that we were happy to be a part of it. Management was so encouraging and positive you wanted to do your best. My typical day was the same as most sales reps, I called on doctors, a few of the progressive doctors had heard about Dexcom and they were interested and excited. Most doctors had no idea what Dexcom was. I also taught Diabetes classes, started new patients on their Dexcom and provided education to health care providers. Both management and my co-workers were great, no complaints. The hardest part of the job was the same challenge most people have. We need more hours in the day. Which also leads me to my most enjoyable part of the job. I needed more hours in the day because I had the great product in my bag that was saving lives and doctors needed to know about it now! They needed to understand it and prescribe it for every type 1 patient out there. I would hear stories of specific patient's lives that were saved by using their Dexcom, that was definitely the most enjoyable part of my job. These stories also motivated me to make sure I could get to my doctors as quickly as possibly and help them to understand how life changing this product is. And they only have more to come in the future.XXX,Life-saving product instills a sense of purpose in the work you do.  The Customer Service department is unfortunately all about the numbers, however, when seeking personal/professional growth, management is helpful in your development.  Promotes from within which makes it easy to advance your career.  The most enjoyable part of my time at Dexcom was the amazing people I worked with.XXX,I was on call to provide guidence and leadership to a team that was new to Managed Care rebating.  Dexcom provided a great working environment.XXX,awesome product! great place!XXX,we all care about our patients who come to rely on us!XXX,A typical day is a good amount of phone calls helping peoploe understand the use of their diabetic supplies all done with a smile in your voiceXXX,I enjoyed working there immensely. I particularly appreciated their flexibility towards available schedules. I'm sorry it didn't work out.XXX,The people are nice and decent and the company is fair. You will advance quickly if you stay. The company is growing and I advise you to really understand your new role and what you want.XXX,There really isn't much to the technical part and troubleshooting is minimal. You do what the paperwork states and that's about it. Highly repetitive. If your looking to advance your computer career this is not the place. Don't come in thinking you will get it. You won't, unless you move to IT and everybody wants that job.XXX,Everything is QA related. EVERYTHING. The FDA paperwork is suffocating and they will micro-manage everything you do. If you like QA this is the place for you. If you don't, stay far away.  I'm glad I left and I'm happy in my new role.XXX,Don't get me wrong. Dexcom is a good company and the people are decent, it just wasn't right for me. It may be for you.XXX,In my 3 years at Dexcom, the company underwent major expansion. The growing pains require employees to be flexible and open to constant change. My daily tasks included outbound calls to outside sales representatives, current and potential patients, doctor's offices, insurance companies and partnering distributors; educating patients on the product and process of obtaining it; gathering all necessary documentation required by insurance companies from the doctor's offices; obtaining authorization (if necessary) from insurance companies while maintaining guidelines; confirming orders with patients and ensuring successful delivery. On a management level, I felt that my coworkers and I could have been more successful with less involvement from supervisory teams. This was a struggle for all inside sales representatives collectively. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that the product I was selling would be saving the lives of many diabetics across the country, and at the very least, giving them the freedom and peace of mind to live a ""normal"" life. I also enjoyed my co-workers as many of us were recent college graduates early in our careers. Working at Dexcom taught me numerous sales skills that I am confident and eager to use moving forward.XXX,Worked 50+ hours every week while other employees doing the same job only had to work 40 because the workload was so unevenly distributed.  Some of the customer ops managers were unwilling or unable to help due to inexperience or laziness.  Large organization, lots of cool people to work with.  Hardest part of the job were the nearly unattainable sales goals and the soul-crushingly long work hours.XXX,A typical day at dexcom is basically like any other job you would go to, for example a clean room environment. Get suited up, check to see the progress of the group that work on your station, and carry on from then. In this type of work environment its plain and simple that you'll learn how to do things properly, fast and efficient. To me co-workers are just like me, come to work and only strive to do a better job. Some co-workers may be a handful but what can you do. Just focus on your job. Hardest part of the job would be nothing, because i've done more than this company. What i enjoy about the job is the consistency of work being finish. I like to see products being pushed through the assembly line without the thought of doing something wrong, and that pretty much is what i enjoy.

With some exceptions they do value their employees which is shown through various company events, initiatives, and perks. XXX,Viacom does employee many freelancers and non-staff personnel in more than just traditionally creative roles. Those personnel do not receive any benefits or paid vacation leave. There is no set path to being staffed and those team members can be left in limbo for years. This model borders on illegality and is not a sound ethical business practice however it does allow many additional team members to be on board.XXX,Viacom & it's management treated me well during my tenure. They willingly advanced me,acknowledging my accomplishments through the years. The employee base is one that is willing to make the company great and will strive to meet company goals.XXX,Interning at Viacom my sophomore year of college was a dream come true! The environment is great - not too strict of a dress policy, everyone is very in touch with media, a wide range of ages across the employees which made for many learning/teaching opportunities, and there's always something fun going on! I learned a lot and felt that my work actually held value for the company.XXX,management is fickle  No consistency to policy procedures  Expectations are above the time allotted  no OT but expects all to be completed  Expects to cross over to other divisions with no trainingXXX,Large company with a lot of room for advancement, I personally did not work with the company culture. I enjoyed my coworkers, but had a frustrating time working as a permalance employee.XXX,Viacom has the greatest employees.  I was blessed with the greatest co-workers.  We all worked together, helped each other, and always taught each other new technologies each week.  We supported each other goals and accomplishments..  The people make it a great place to work.XXX,This is a great company to work for however the pay is always less that what it should be for the position. It is very hard for employees to move up as the managing positions are usually hired from outside of the company.XXX,Working at Viacom was a fun experience.  I interned for my whole senior year a Comedy Central and Logo.  There were no entry level opportunities when I graduated college.  I worked with some great supervisors that cared about teaching the ins and outs of the business.XXX,During my time a Viacom there were pros and cons .My experience at Viacom with my co-workers was very positive. The work environment was great, the projects I worked on were very exciting and challenging. My team pushed me to really grow professionally. Management typically has a difficult time making decisions on just about everything. Expect little value on work/life balance.If management put more into their employees they would have better retention. A single ticket here or there does not make up for time lost while in the office.XXX,The glitz and glamour of Viacom's shows and markets are fun and energizing, and there can be some fun perquisites, but at senior management levels it is serious business.XXX,The benefits were good but the salaries are usually lower.  Great place to start your career in media but you must be willing to work very long hours and be flexible with constantly changing priorities.

,,"MARKETING ASSISTANTXXX,Financial AnalystXXX,Software EngineerXXX,IT ManagerXXX",,DataXu,,,,,,"Considering the tediousness of the job itself, one of the best things about working at DataXu was the work environment and the office culture.  There was an excellent sense of moral because of the hard work of the HR department.  And generally an enjoyable place to work.  There was a great deal of trust with the employees and the benefits and salary grades were incredibly generous.  With these two things, there was a great deal of incentive to be an excellent employee.XXX,Ok place to work - the people are helpful but the managers try to be strict.  the weekly lunches chosen by the lunch club are great.  It is located near south station which is a comfortable commute.  They have video games.XXX,A typical day: come in, make myself a latté with our freaking awesome Jura Impressa espesso machine, pull myself together for the scrum, then get to work. Free lunch on Fridays, beer and wine after 4:30 pm. XBox and PS3 come on at 5:00. There's also an AppleTV for movie nights.XXX,What I've learned: I'm STILL learning. This place really is on the bleeding edge. No one gets hired without completing at least one coding exercise, but even then, you'll probably feel lucky to have made it in. We're working with really BIG data. So big, Cloudera has their monthly user meetings HERE! The internal Wiki is truly awesome. Really love how much everyone uses it. If you can't find what you're looking for there, then you'll want to add it.XXX,Management: Much improved. Our CEO is super serious, but clearly listens. It took a few high-profile departures to get management's attention, but the new ""No Jerks"" policy has definitely improved things immensely for the rest of us (non-management types).XXX,Co-workers: Beyond the technology, it's the people that make working here great. We do a lot of company events & parties (Halloween, Holiday, Super Bowl, Ice Cream, etc.) and outings, such as Kimball Farm or DataXu Cares (one a month community activity helping food banks, schools, prison book dispensaries, Cradles to Crayons, etc.), so there a weekly opportunities to meet and interact. Everyone here is super bright, with a lot of diversity in terms of backgrounds and age-ranges.XXX,Hardest part of the job: Honestly: Not thinking about it when I'm not here. This is probably more my problem than a companyXXX,  XXX, problem--although I know a others who share it. I've had to make real efforts to not check email or think about my projects when I'm not ""working."" On the other hand, some of the challenges we're working on are just that exciting that it's hard to not let yourself get sucked in.XXX,The most enjoyable part of the job: Okay, now we're getting really subjective here, but in my case, beyond the perks (flex hours, cool people, free food, beer, espresso etc.) it's definitely about being able to work on a product that is doing incredible things and is definitely on it's way to even greater things (company's been growing 60% year-over-year since I started!)XXX,  XXX,Sometimes a fun place to work.XXX,My coworkers are my friends.XXX,Free lunch Fridays..yeah!XXX",,,"Free lunch, great work environment, excellent benefitsXXX,Weekly lunchesXXX,great people, great perks, growing fast!XXX","a very large amount of tedious work in a high-volume fast-pace environment.XXX,Tries to be cool, wants to be strictXXX,we keep running out of milk for coffee. not sure why they can't just order more milk!XXX"

XXX,The only thing that I don't like about General Mills is that they can permanently hire people.  They would'nt have as many problems that they have.  Far as keeping regular and consistant people.XXX,it was a very stressful place to work. they are not people persons at all. and they don't appreciate there employees at all. and all they think people do is work 24 7. no time to spend with family at all.XXX,Demanding hours. Continuously running for up to five weeks before a weekend clean out and fumigation. A lot of forced twelve hour days and six day work weeks.

The chance for job advancement is pretty low, despite what the hiring manager says during the interview.  The team aspect of the job is very laid back, and often times members get away with not pulling their weight.  But the compensation is pretty good for a a straight forward job.XXX,This was a really good place to work. I worked in the HRIS area supporting multiple Power Builder applications for the various General Mills Departments. I enjoyed the co-workers and team out there.XXX,Truly a great place to work at. Everyone is very helpful. Does get boring at times but other then that it is wonderful. The one thing that irritated me was they wouldnt hire me cuz i was going to be gone for a month.XXX,I worked on a line and made excellent pay.  The people there were not friendly and I didn't learn a lot.  The breaks and lunch were right on time and never denied.  The down side is that you can get told to stay after your shift and you don't have a choice so if you have a family or other obligations then it's hard and stressful.XXX,Good job nice people just not enough money.

Working remotely is generally acceptable but can vary depending on your department and specific responsibilities.XXX,Coworkers love to play and work is always delayed.  Many of the core systems crash multiple times a week.  Technical teams are extremely slow to respond.  Large gaps in age in the departments making it a struggle to communicate.

Long hours and weekend work. Fun employee events.XXX,A typical work is not a typical day.  Working in the CEO's office you need to be flexible and be able to deal with all types of requests.  Sorting emails, handling calls, getting briefs ready, making changes to the schedule, dealing with other C-level staff and their assistants, etc.XXX,My day consists of supporting two high profile advertising executives. I manage an extremely heavy calendar for both executives. I communicate with current and potential clients via email.

He is not only a famous ad executive, but has an art collection at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. I have had the pleasure of being exposed to both the digital advertising and art world simultaneously. Therefore, manage both business and personal affairs for him.XXX,In the past 28 working at Wunderman I was able to grow and train young talent for a career in Marketing.XXX,Wunderman was a great place to work. It tested my ability to keep my nerves intact and how to play a good prank. For a mid-level move this is a great agency, but their lack of agility can be frustrating. This causes high turn over, under resourced departments, uncertainty with clients and management to put on a veil that freaks everyone out. All stated should be expected of a client that size, but I still believe they will evolve into a stronger agency.XXX,Exciting and progressive ad agency!  Working with some of the best and biggest clients in the world.XXX,Very busy as usual for agency life. Client is Best Buy and it is a very fun, social, innovative agency with an amazing staff who all works together as a team.XXX,It is incredibly fast paced, especially in the first 3 months!  The people are great to work with although management seemed to overlook a lot of individual's hard work if they were not working on that project as well.  There is opportunity for huge accomplishment on the project/client/personal level, however management has many blind spots.  Work/life balance is promoted throughout the company but DOES NOT apply to project managers who, as an unspoken rule, are expected to work 45-70 hours a week without compensation.XXX,Everyone says it's prudent to have agency experience under your belt, and Wunderman is a great place to cut your teeth. As with any agency, the company is chock full of innovation and creativity but unfortunately a lack of process and disonnect between global and local markets stifles that.XXX,Overall, a decent place to put in a couple of years.XXX,Excellent Boss, excellent team, excellent employees.

Cold calling, prospecting, consulting.XXX,Liberty Mutual is an average place to work. There is some room for advancement however they have a highly political environment among management. Good place to work if you want to do your job and go home.XXX,Let's start off with all the amazing things about Liberty... First off, the pay is great, the benefits are amazing, they treat their employees wonderfully, and they invest in each and every person. They offer real development plans to help you get where you want to go within the company. You get monthly coaching along with monthly one on one meetings with your supervisor. In the claims customer care department, we got 3 team meetings per week, and it was always extremely clear what the expectations were and what was going on within the company.XXX,Now, for the less positive stuff. They have a very strict attendance policy, and if you have children that get sick or even if you get sick a lot, you may not last long. Not even doctor's notes will save you on this one. They also require you to work whatever schedule they have available when you're new and you won't know until about half way through training, so you could be working 6am-3pm, 10am-6pm, or potentially 5pm-1am if that is all they have available, or anything in between.XXX,The plus, once you have your foot in the door, there is always an opportunity to get a better schedule as they become available, and first pick is based on your stats. They do however offer great flexible options when available, like work from home schedules, 4x10s, and split shiftsXXX,I worked there for 10 years.  All 10 years we sold the local office and local service to our customers.  Then they decided to consolidate service into 5 locations and close down local service operations.  For 10 years, service felt like second class citizens.  Then the company proved that we are.XXX,The company has a very good work life balance.  The company has the same problems all other big companies have.  It is getting rid of its health benefit plan options and switching to a cdhp.XXX,I worked for Liberty for over 10 years.  Overall the benefits are far better than many companies out there.  Time off is great (although accrual based which can be difficult in the beginning), tuition reimbursement and bonus/merit structure is in line, if not better, than competitors.  Work load is heavy at times which can impact work/life balance.  Company is far more technologically advanced than many of their competitors.  Lean environment can be challenging with continuous changes however this reflects the company's dedication to staying competitive.  More and more flexibility in schedules being offered.XXX,At first I enjoyed working at Liberty, they offer different shifts, 5 day, 4 day work weeks, flex schedule etc. The metrics deffinitly take away from the overall experience of the phone call because your handle time must not be too long, your after call work must be brief and your Time off phone must be very limited. They discouraged you from grabbing a drink a water if not on your break. The biggest issue is work/life balance, if your sick, child is sick, you got a flat tire, family emergency, anything unplanned that causes you to be late or needing the day off you get a point. After a low amount of points, your let go. I feel if I have vacation time available I should be able to use it for what I need too and not be plenalized for not knowing I'd wake up to a flat tire.XXX,Great company to work for. Difficult to make business because most rates are higher than those at other companies. Fun atmosphere.XXX,Work/life balance is hard to maintain. Benefits are good and good vacation plan, but appears that most are overwhelmed with their positions. Good management.XXX,Great place to work and learn about insurance claims, processes and investigations.  The most enjoyable part of the job, is being rewarded for a job well done.XXX,They do not care about the life long employee.  The emphasis is now on youth and inexperience. Hire the less experienced for less pay. Toss the older more experienced employee aside.XXX,Liberty Mutual values its employees, and provides ample opportunity for advancement. The true professionalism of all the employees  makes it a great place to work.XXX,Very demanding from management. Not enough work balance. Customer service is number one priority. Loved helping people get back to normal life.XXX,Awesome coworkersXXX,Great deal of scrutiny on every dollar that is spent, which is good for the bottom line but not so great for the employees.  All monetary benefits have been drastically cut in the last 5-10 years and have been replaced with non-monetary benefits like WFH and a lounge area in the Boston campus.

I enjoy work there with my co-worker. And my boss is so nice that I am willing to work there again.XXX,This is a large company with many opportunities. My department was outsourced.

On the phones all day taking calls. It was impossible to handle your own claims and meet state regulations. Customers were always complaining they never heard from their adjuster.

Great environment, people, atmosphere and overall place to work.XXX,Terrific and supportive atmosphere in which to work.XXX,Great students, articulate and involved classes.XXX,This was a great job in a great location.

As the CEO i have learned a lot operating a new business. Learned various sales and management skillsXXX,Good place to work, but not much room to grow in IT. Great for gaining work experience, but not all that great to advance your career.XXX,Complete disorganization everywhere you look and people are constantly changing groups (sometimes forced). The advancement opportunities are based on politics and not achievement. No pay increases for advancement opportunities. Data is a complete mess, their focus is to look good (in the community) other than doing good (as in work, innovations, optimizations, etc). After years of working there I still felt like everyone was either miserable there or just didn't really care, no one truly enjoyed their workXXX,It is a perfect place if you want to be an underachiever and leave work whenever you want because no one holds you to a standard.

They take great care of their employees.XXX,I was hired as a temp for basic clerical duties and record keeping for their accounting department while the corporation was in the process of digitizing it's files. XXX,Despite my temporary status I was able to work for the company for 2 years and they tried to give me an advancement opportunity by turning me over to data entry.   XXX,I enjoyed working for them and they gave holiday bonuses as well as year end bonuses even to a temp.XXX,There are two distinct classes - contractors and employees. It seems that who you know gets you more job recognition and opportunity than what you know. Social connections count more than job skills and experience do, so if you're on the ""inside"" and fit in with the social culture, you'll do ok. If you don't, you'll be discounted, no matter what you do. Hiring and promotions that I saw were based on social connections instead of quality of the person's work. It may be different in other departments, but that was my experience working there.XXX,Good place to work if you have job security. Management lacks involvement with your daily activities. Work is delegated and ignored unless you're in a critical position. I received very little to do.XXX,Terrible place to work for.  The culture is toxic.  The management goes out of their way to try and get people to quit by excluding people from meetings, making information deliberately concealing information and neglecting to answer emails.XXX,This job was different everyday, I loved that challenge it gave the everyday experience. The laid back atmosphere, and how they were flexible with life and job was appreciated.XXX,Excellent place to work. Management very helpful in daily operations. Safety was number one on our daily work schedule. Great locations.XXX,All management needs to be more involved with the day to day on-goings of the organization.

Also, working with a bunch of Physicists. These people were absolutely Brilliant.    My boss was an 80 something-year-old Nobel Prize Winner Physicist. He was very friendly.XXX,Enjoy working with students and Co workers. and Good Benefits, always there are many opportunities for advancement, very nice people both Co workers and Students,XXX,Stanford is a great place to work as a postdoc. XXX,Although the cost of living is kinda insane in Bay area, Stanford provide better salaries than other universities. XXX,Stanford also provides great resources and platform for postdocs to conduct top-tier research and encourages collaborations.XXX,Working at Stanford is more like adjusting to the culture.  Everyone is very smart and kind to interact with.  It really depends on what your job entails?  Best part of working if you're full time is the free access to public transportation.  Since this is a progressive campus, they don't support people commuting to work via car.XXX,There are so many interesting departments and programs to work for at Stanford; each of which, have very different cultures. Stanford offers fantastic benefits including, medical, dental, wellness incentives, free public transportation and tuition reimbursements. Stanford does have a reputation for low salaries and difficulty with promotions and advancement. Also, it can be very difficult to find good managers that care about your development and want to see you grow. Administrative roles tend to be a very invisible job. Stanford on your resume, it is very easy to always have a career with Stanford.XXX,Working for the University of Medicine at Stanford has been such a great experience because of the professional employees, advanced technology, and friendly atmosphere. A typical day at work is very busy and exciting because everyone is happy to be there because they enjoy what they do. I learned time management and how to communicate more efficiently with patients. The management that I have been involved with is very professional, organized, and they respond promptly. My co-workers are great because we all work hard together and help each other out when needed. The hardest part of my job is when I have to inform people of information that is hard for them to hear. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing people satisfied with their care and educating people about their health.XXX,Overall, Stanford is a great place to work as far as stability and a steady paycheck, not to mention the wonderful benefits the University offers to staff. From experience in two positions at Stanford, growth and advancement was not offered to me in two different departments. Speaking with others throughout campus, it appears that this is somewhat accepted as the 'culture' for certain positions at Stanford. XXX,My co-workers were all in all a great group of people. Most of them are close friends now.XXX,collegial, friendly, interesting technology, always able to work remotely when needed, minor issue: some ""looting"" of staff from one project for another, so planning is disruptedXXX,Working for SLAC was one of the best jobs I have ever had, they offer great benefits, a great work environment to learn and grow. The experience will last a life time and follow me everywhere.XXX,The most enjoyable part of the job is when a patient walks out of the hospital or clinic feeling that we have done everything possible to answer all their questions and  they leave feeling more knowledgeableXXX,about their condition and feeling secure.XXX,I value my work experience at Stanford. I had good co-workers and some interesting projects. However the politics are brutal. People who have worked there for decades run the show and suppress new ideas and a faster pace. Opportunities for advancement are non-existent, even for someone like me who receives raises and bonuses every year. I think it's a good place to gain experience and then to move to a company that values and rewards employee contributions and innovations.XXX,I enjoyed my coursework.  Some courses better than others-depends on who teaches them.  I will consider taking courses there again in the future.  Especially if someone else pays for them.XXX,Working for Stanford was a great experience; I learned a lot with the hospital billing systems that we used in patient's clinic and hospital visits; Our Team Leaders; co-workers and higher management were great; Trying to achieve what Stanford stands for is always hard but through hard work and dedication it was a great experience;  At this great farm I witnessed that the holiday and Christmas seasons always brought us together as the most enjoyable part at our Stanford familyXXX,Stanford is an amazing place.  They provide good compensation, benefits, work life balance, growth, and you get to work with some amazing staff and faculty.XXX,I would recommended Stanford to anyone.  Cost of living though is quite high.XXX,Was a resident assistant in the dorms during summer quarter.  Had flexible hours, but demanding when on the clock.  Co-workers and supervisors were great.XXX,I've worked here for a few years. It's truly is a a great place to work and learn. A small team setting makes it challenging for me since you have to start building things from the ground up. You'll get a lot of support and can follow the direction that you wish to pursue.XXX,They provide many materials to make art projects possible for the children the environment is very controlled so things don't get out of hand, and the co workers are very niceXXX,Stanford can be a wonderful place to work depending on the work environment in your division. It is a large organization but there is little interaction with peers in other divisions and little room for career advancement. Working in an understaffed department leads to burnout.XXX,Enjoyable envireoment. Learning room to grow in a comapny to suceed. Training provided. Productive.

We mainly go there to work, but at the same time some of us get excited to see on another.XXX,Worked by myself filing donor information at Encina Hall for Stanford's Development Office.  Management and co-workers were helpful in teaching me what I needed to know.  Culture was good.  I enjoyed having a large pile of filing and getting it filed efficiently and correctly.  The most difficult was having an overwhelmingly large pile of filing that I had to file in a short deadline.  I was able to meet my deadlines.XXX",,,"Great people.

At year-end, crew are ranked and rated against their peers; consequently, if you do not drink the koolaid, be prepared for a poor performance rating, no merit increase, no bonus and start looking for your next opportunity!  Vanguard has long touted the fact, that despite the many recessions over the years, it has never laid off any employees - Google ""managed out"" and draw your own conclusions.  In addition to the practice of managing crew out, there is a well kept secret  of late, at least internally, and that is that Vanguard recently published its first ever Severance Plan; needless to say, layoffs have begun and the process of offshoring jobs is also underway.

They have so many departments and it has helped me get interviews and job offers from what i have learned here.XXX,Whatever is thrown at me, plus my standard duties.

Work for a professional team. catch some rays in your off time. enjoy life with this careers benefits. Free meals. health insurance, Life insurance, vision insurance, college funds. 5 star rating in my opinionXXX,.XXX,You get to work independently on a relaxed environment.  Colleagues, co-workers and management work like a team to make sure the job gets done.XXX,The only drawback, however, is the pay and room for growth.  The pay is dependent upon the workload and there is not enough work to go around.  Also, due to the freelance status, there is no job security or room for growth.XXX,I worked there eight years and did not advance to ""bigger and better"" things.  When this type of situation occurs, it can be tough to enjoy your job.XXX,Love the team that I work with. Management is amazing!! Have learned a lot about Team managing since being here. Hardest part of my job is not knowing when the day ends.XXX,It was fun while the season lasted. You get to watch MLB games. However as other reviewers have said for part time workers, there is no room for growth, you get no breaks no matter how long your work day is. Hours varied each week depending on the schedule, so there was no set schedule. No extra pay for working holidays. After the season, they say thank you, and that's that. XXX,And as a warning,  they have very strict policies,  particularly with arrival time and social media. So arrive Early Every Day, and don't blabber on social media that you work for them and what your role is.XXX,The environment itself was delightful to work in due to the people that were pretty much always willing to help even if it wasn't in their job description.  That part of coming into work made it enjoyable to participate in the day to day activities.  As for the actual job duties, I found it to be unfulfilling and virtually all menial with no prospects of growth or advancement.  The tasks became tedious, predictable, and there were many instances of down time.  And even as I was trying to find things to do from my manager I didn't feel like I was being utilized to my fullest potential.  I would ask many times if there was anything I could do to help around the building, but was told that there was nothing I could do to contribute to the process or development.  So as a result I would just return to the perfunctory duties that did nothing for growth and development.  There was little to no variety in what I did each day and challenges were few and far between.XXX,They would rather save $.50 per hour and have a much worse employee doing the work. They will lie to get people to work on holidays.XXX,First few weeks of this job, its okay IMO. Its a big company so you'll most likely meet people in your own dept so if kind of clique-ish. I work overnight so I dont really know to much people outside of the overnight crew. The hardest part is sometimes it can get boring especially during overnight and if you're part time you get no benefits which kind of sucks, but the good thing is part-time gets paid hourly and most times you will have full time hours which equals overtime something full time dont have (silver lining).XXX,Live Look-In Operator and Production Assistant. Duties included editing incoming video content for immediate use on MLB.com, including highlight reels and melts, as well as enabling the ""Live Look-In"" window on MLB.com (running parallel with Yahoo Sports internet streamed baseball highlight show ""Full Count"").XXX,Started out as a good job but quickly I learned it's a horrible place to work. Long hours, no breaks, no appreciation. I'm sure they break about a dozen labor laws. Grossly underpaid for the job that's done. Has a holiday party that only a small percentage of the workforce is allowed to attend. I'd only apply here is it was a job right out of college. Use to to build your resume and get out quick.XXX,It's a great place to get started in sports media. A long baseball season and expansive resources are a pro.XXX,I love working here. In many aspects, the company covers both extremes of the spectrum. It's a very relaxed atmosphere, even though we all know it is important to the fans out there that we deliver the media without any hiccups. So, it is fast paced when necessary.XXX,The best part about my job is stepping into something new everyday, troubleshooting and feeling like you're not at work when you are.XXX,MLB itself is a great company, but the Media jobs leave a lot to be desired. Rough hours, poor pay, not really valued or respected. Not great job security once the season is over, likely to get laid off.XXX,Co-workers who are in your same role are nice, but the superiors act superior, and don't show any effort to interact with or respect you.XXX,Amazing company and great environment to work at.

Growth within the organization can be difficult depending on your field but training and development is available as a resource and highly encouraged.XXX,Long time employees whose work ethic and culture are very similar to those who work at the DMV; including the management here. Many employees have been here for several years and some even up to 35 years and are outright scary. XXX,I expected a higher caliber of employee. Because this  institutional learning system is on the cutting edge of healthcare and medicine, I really anticipated so much more and was extremely disappointed. I've had multiple conversations with fairly new employees (two years or less) who, independent of each other, have all reaffirmed what I've experienced there; rude, lazy, ill mannered employees  with very little structure who are a reflection of the managers that are supposed to be holding them accountable but are so lazy they barely show up to actually work half the time.

Great work environment, awesome management and coworkers. Most enjoyable part would be, patients thanking you for your hard work.XXX,A typical day for me at Danville Regional Medical Center, starts with me getting charts together for the facilities that I schedule radiology procedures for, I maintain 12 offices that I have to schedule patients for radiology procedures. The offices fax me the orders, I schedule the patient and pre-register them, If the insurance requires authorization I call the insurance company get the authorization and then get the patient scheduled, if the insurance company denies the patient from having the procedure done then I have to send correspondent back to the office letting them know why their patient has not scheduled. I also, have to collect copays. I have learned a lot about health insurance, Management is fair to their employees, my co-workers are a great group of women to work with. The hardest part of the job would be collecting the copays over the telephone, patient do not like to give their personal information on the telephone, they would rather pay in person. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with many people on the telephone, and just sometime being a listening ear.XXX,Very busy place to work. If you like keeping busy this is the place to work. There are several rotations so the variety of exams are great. Great group of girls to work with!XXX,I always wanted to work here, and now I am only here because of the benefits. Understaffed, broken equipment, over worked, poor management, no room for advancement, interdepartmental chaos and expected to be married to the job. If you use this place as a stepping stone to learn and move on , you should be ok.XXX,STOLE THIS FROM A PREVIOUS REVIEWER.. BUT IT DESCRIBES SPARROW CARSON CITY HOSPITAL TO A T. This hospital is going downhill quickly as far as working here goes. What used to be a great place to work is now a soul sucking experience on a daily basis. You can clearly see that the focus has shifted from focusing on what's best for patients and employees to what's best for the higher ups pocketbooks. It makes me sick to see the total lack of appreciation we employees have at this hospital. Everyone is stressed and miserable due to understaffing, horrible management, and lack of resources. This is not just my opinion but the opinion of the majority of those I work with. This is the truth about this company. I hang in there just hoping things will change but I'm not crossing my fingers.XXX,I loved working with new patients and seeing new people but our management was hectic and unorganized wish it was more solidifiedXXX,•Assisting Patients with daily activities.XXX,•Helping turn or lift or reposition patients. XXX,Assisting with obtaining Vital Signs which include Temperature, Blood Pressure, Respirations, and Heart rate.XXX,•Documentation of Input and output of patients..XXX,•Blood sugar testing.XXX,•Use of EMR, basic computer skills, answering multi-phone line and transferring calls.XXX,Pharmacy staff is always so short handed because the management is terrible.  Scheduling is atrocious,  Management could care less about anything other than themselves.  Atmosphere is negative.  Customers constantly yell at employees and management does nothing.  Management gets raises and declines raises for others.XXX,Sparrow IT is a great place to start your career out of college but don't plan on sticking around for the long haul unless you like to play politics with leadership.  XXX,Job postings for management positions are put up mostly as a joke; the directors get together and cherry-pick the individual they want for the position long before the sham interviews begin.  If you aren't tapped on the shoulder and told to apply (with a wink), you haven't got a shot at breaking through to management.XXX,Performance evals are a joke.  First you self-eval, then your manager takes a pass, then the directors (many of whom are not qualified to judge your performance as they don't work with you) knock your score down as they see fit.XXX,If you want a place to get a start and then quickly move on, Sparrow may be a good choice for you.XXX,I had a great experience at sparrow during my 2nd year of the Radiologic Technology program. The radiologic technologist help you to become the best you could be. Sparrow works hard to provide the best possible care to their patients,alone with working together as a team.XXX,A typical day for me consisted of answering phones, checking in and scheduling a series of appointments for quality patient care. XXX,I have learned that everyone has a story and compassion is very crucial to make sure that every patient feels that they are validated to receive the best care  possible and that they are as important.XXX,Management is as best as possible. Often leaving the office staff to work on their own knowing that they are competent to work unsupervised. XXX,I work with some of the most talented therapist and office staff that I believe bring excellent patient care.XXX,The hardest part of my job is receiving vague direction. I review manuals for information that is not directly supplied to me.XXX,The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting a wide variety of people and working with very special people. XXX,   XXX,Working for Sparrow for 35 years has been quite an adventure in that I have seen many changes regarding excellent patient care and the growth of multiple facilities.XXX,Very good place to work. Excellent advancement opportunities. 100% Tuition reimbursement for BSN. Magnet hospital.XXX,In a smaller community hospital, there is more opportunity to see more variety, which I like.  You learn everyone's names and you also see the same people from the community come in.  It's nice to build a relationship with them because it makes them feel more accepted and valued, which all patients should feel.XXX,The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers and visitors. I enjoy helping them.XXX,My manager is the best she goes above and beyond to advocate for her staff. The hardest part of my job is the 12 hr shift. However working them allows for more days off.XXX,A typical day in medical records - pick up records from medical floors, review each record for correct placement in chart (labs, physician orders, nursing notes etc.)XXX,Make sure physician signatures, nursing signatures are complete signed and datedXXX,I learned the importance of documentation and HIPPAA laws when it pertains to a patient's information within the recordsXXX,The management in medical records was very knowledgeable of the standards for a record completion and was willing to share that knowledge with their employeesXXX,The hardest part of medical records is filing - But, that has changed due to EMRXXX,I enjoyed working in Medical Records department for 8 yrs the management and and co-worker were wonderfulXXX,Enjoyed working here,XXX,Flexible hours, XXX,Worked well around my school scheduleXXX,Enjoyed working with my coworkers as a teamXXX,We worked really hard to do the jobs required with the equipment and staff we were given.XXX,I mostly learned that every one has a different name for the equipment usedXXX,I worked for sparrow for 8 years, I worked with some great people and I had great benefits but there was no room for advancement.XXX,A typical day at work would include plenty of fast paced work. You must be able to work well under pressure and never let the customers (patients) see you sweat. Stay calm and professional at all times and you'll go far in your career.XXX,Having worked there since I was 19 years old I have seen many changes and growth in Sparrow Health SystemXXX,For the most part I found my time at Sparrow rewarding. Have always been a bedside nurse providing direct patient care which is what I enjoy the most. Working in different departments and specialties I learned a great deal on how to care for people with different diagnoses. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing your hard work pay off-a patient recovering, being able to go home, a patient happy with care he/she received.

Backstabbing employees with a lot of mistrust because of dishonest corporate policies. Mostly concerning ""reductions in force"". Everyone is job scared and protective. If you need training on a job task, you are likely to get some misinformation so that someone's job stays safe. XXX,This company is ripe for a lawsuit.

I would not recommend this company to anyone looking for a stable work environment.XXX,This company has many different projects and manages them quite well. Working in my particular facet of the company has been fun and educational. I have gained invaluable contacts and experience. Management is always available to answer any questions or concerns. I noticed many employees had been able to advance on this contract rather quickly, which was encouraging. The most difficult part of the job has been that I was hired on just before the contract was ending. Luckily I was not put out too much, but others moved to the area specifically for their position, just to be told a week after starting that they will be out of a job in a few months. I don't believe ORAU knew, until they received the official word, that the contract was ending three years earlier than projected. I think they have handled the reduction in force very professionally, providing as much time as they could for their employees to find other employment. I also understand this is the nature of contract work.XXX,Overall good place to work.  Flexible hours and alot of opportunity to learn.  Depending on your manager there is autonomy.

They made the day fun and exciting. Had special employee appreciation days often. Really awesome benefits. Somewhat easy work if you're good with customer service. Daily team meetings, will make sure you are well trained. The catch, you will be at a desk for most of your shift, and for a good majority of the week. They want you to give world class service to each and every customer that calls in, but with a time limit of like 6 mins. Kinda stressful.XXX,PayPal is a fantastic company to intially grow in.  They will bring you in from entry level and as long as you are flexible in your work hours you can move up quickly and gain awesome experieinces in leadership.  However once you achieve entry level leadership you once again need to be flexible with schedule and at this point you are 5-10 years in and no longer can afford the flexibility when you have a family.  If you can't be flexible you will remain entry level leadership.  They still do reviews which are subject to manager opinion, goals fluctuate but for me I maintained high performing teams yet one quarter or half I will be an Exceeding expectations and then I may get a new manager who will rate me as a meets for doing the same work I did before.  One manager will tell you its all based off performance, another says its the extra work you put into it, and then they change your teams so much it's impossible at times to remain a high performing team.  They will be very respectful and helpful to entry level but it comes with a mental cost to higher up leaders who are over worked and under appreciated. recently many mid level leaders are stepping back down into entry level due to low pay as a leader, no work life balance,  and low appreciation for the jobs they do.XXX,The best part is the people there, I have formed friendships for a life time and I also learned valuable lessons about coorporate business, structure, and it made me a very strong leader for it.

Training was excellent. Other colleges were polite and very helpful. If I had not moved out of state I would have stayed there for a very long time.XXX,A typical night a work is quiet employees half fast the job and rushing and didn't fill orders properly. Management was great very helpful and motivated to get things done fast and accurate. Hardest part of job was filling all the orders in 12 hour with only 10 employees.XXX,Good company to work for. Good management and work life balance. They attempt to advance within the company. They attempt to accommodate employees that have personal issues.XXX,I had a very positive experience at Thermo Fisher. Job security was never a worry. The company strives to enter every possible market to grow the business. The products produced by Thermo Fisher are used world-wide by laboratories and scientists for the gain of humanity, saving lives, and preventing loss of life. It's a great cause to be involved in.XXX,When I first stated to worked here was as Fisher SCI then Thermo bought Fisher and everything went down the hills. slowly but surely they started to take benefits away. I don't know how is now after 5 yrs but it was not good back then.XXX,Its a Great place to work. XXX,Nothing bad XXX,The workers and managers are Awesome individualsXXX,Its a high pace environment. XXX,They offer classes (paid) for opportunities to advance within company.XXX,Every one did their job in a professional way and worked together to get the product in and out the door. Management took the time to insure you knew what your area required.XXX,7:30AM-4PM or 3:30PM-12AM Overtime if offeredXXX,You work with very dangerous, flammable, corrosive, and toxic chemicals. Chemical Packers pour chemicals into bottles by hand and need to label bottles as well as package and label boxes. Machine operators work machines that bottle chemicals. Make connections for chemicals going to machines as well as tables.  Before each job is started the lines need to be sampled and taken to the lab to test. When they have a chemical spill, they have employees that are train to clean up spills.  The job has a high exposure to chemicals that can cause cancer and many health issues.  I don't believe that the compensation for the risk is reasonable. XXX,Management always emphasizes safety first! However they are always looking at your production! The place is going through some management changes and the group leaders tend to surpass there authority. Workplace is for the most part clean employees are very friendly for the most part.  Some old timers that think they run or own the place can be difficult at timesXXX,work as chemical packer,labeller,machine operator filling chemicals in the bottles etc.Company is near to my house medical facility paid vacation provision is available.XXX,I enjoyed my tenureXXX,Good Amount of Leave Balances XXX,Work Culture is OK and we can enjoy the long weekends and work from home option available.XXX,Productive and engaging atmosphere for a fast pace call center environment.

Friendly atmosphere. Superior products and superb work culture for one to flourish.At Thermo Fisher Scientific, we work together to accelerate research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics and increase laboratory productivity. We know that our people are the source of our global success, and we embrace the unique qualities and differences of each of our professionals. The story of our progress begins with giving our people the freedom and support to drive innovation through cutting-edge thinking.XXX,Great company to learn the business side of science. Allows scientist to transfer from the bench to other departments with ease and little experience.XXX,I enjoy coming to work every day. My typical work day consist of always being a step ahead of myself than I was the day before, pushing for excellence and hungry for more.XXX,I take a great deal of pride in everything that I do. From the moment I say hello to someone in passing to engaging in conversations that improve how we do things on a business capacity.XXX,I've learned a tremendous amount of things so far which gives me an edge over my colleagues in how we can always improve how we move inventory aligned with the expanding business needs.XXX,ThermoFisher encourages and provides us with a work/life balance that I think is very important. As for my personal needs it helps me improve and boost my self esteem while also improving health choices by providing us with a on site gym, fitness programs like yoga, boot-camp training and all sorts classes that improve and impacts my day on a positive level.XXX,The hardest part of my job: We are are always creating new ways to store materials in different temp. controlled environments. Space has always been the enemy. We've overhauled 4 temp. controlled rooms, in which I was very much involved in by strategically planning how to store materials that are sensitive to temp. These projects take time to complete and sometimes pose challenges when material is not moving out as fast as I am introducing it into inventory. So this I'd have to say is the toughest part of my job. - But It challenges me. :)XXX,The most enjoyable aspect of what I do, Is knowing that I implement ""Tangible Quality"" - which lets my customers know that Quality is importantXXX,  XXX, to me. Everything that I encompass (work-personal life) is executed with Integrity and a great deal of care. XXX,I love what I do!XXX,  XXX,management changes daily.  Try to do good but some people don't see it that way.  Few bad managers make everyone miserable. Good is that you can work remote for most positions. Company is too large.XXX,Great place for people who don't want or need job security. Most decisions are based on shareholder value so many jobs go offshore to reduce labor costs.XXX,A typical day was always with conference calls or meetings. I worked in a fast-paced environment so I learned how to budget my time and prioritize tasks. The management could be very demanding at times but was very supportive of its employees. My co-workers were great to work with--the best I've ever had. The hardest part of the job was working on project(s) under a tight schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work-life balance.XXX,This management team cares about how the departments work together to successfully get product out the door.  Impromptu meetings keep each other informed of developing issues. Each member of the management team actually cares about the other.

I did not learn anything more than what I already knew when I came to work for them.  I felt that management needed to improve especially in the laboratory department, I felt I had no support from manager of supervisor. I had no problems with workplace culture. The hardest part of work was the lack of communication between supervisor and co-workers. I enjoyed working with people and I felt pleased to be able to help them in any way I can.XXX,Throughout my time here at Mayo it has been a roller coaster ride of red tape. Mayo offers great pay and great incentives to stay employed here. There is one major problem I constantly run into while employed here. The supervisors have little to no power to actually affect change in a positive manner. Conflicts with co-workers will go unanswered. For that very reason I have chosen to work elsewhere. Through out my two and a half years here i have had three supervisor, all unable to do anything with troublesome employees. This is because Mayo is a top down organisation. The supervisors cannot affect true change without having prior authorization from one of their superiors, so any move they make is slow and unresponsive. This makes their positions very difficult and inhibits many positive would-be leadership decisions. I really enjoy most of the people I work with but management remains immobile in certain situations which has sanctioned my position unworkable. Mayo Clinic has high standard for care and employment. Its not a terrible place to work and build a career, granted you can handle all the politics that comes with it.XXX,Management and co-workers are more than willing to share their knowledge and teamwork as well as individual success thrives in this organization.XXX,This hospital is always at the forefront of the latest innovated technology and medical advancements. It is well known all around the world and looks good on any resume! The experience is incredible and the opportunities for advancement are limitless. I worked with someone that started as a housekeeper then worked his was up to a systems management position with the help of tuition assistance and advancement opportunities. Overall it ahs been one of my favorite places to work.XXX,I will recommend any employee even testing team all people are motivational. Fun at workplace on time submission. I worked for contract role.XXX,Coming into work everyday made you feel like you were really part of something big, prestigious, and well-known.  Well, that's because you were!XXX,supervisors and managers encourage people to get education, but when one gets it there is still no chance for advancement.XXX,Mayo is a great place to work and learn.  Treated with respect by Physicians.  The patient population is amazing.  I have been very happy working there.XXX,My day would start out with getting instruments ready to perform testing. Sample would come in at various time and work load varies. You can be busy one minute and then the next it can be slow. Slow time you can get documentation done along with other projects. Busy times you need to be great at multitasking and communication with co workers about what can be ran and what is calibrating or repeating.XXX,Great place to work for but it is very large to the point where there is a lot of communication gaps.  The city of Rochester is quite small so, it is great for families but not much else outside of work.XXX,my time at mayo was the best time of my life ,going to work was a blast,the culture was amazing and very diverse,not only did i learn from the best but i felt apart of a great team,i regret the day i handed my 2 week notice in....XXX,Through my short employment with housekeeping I felt emotionally abused by my supervisor and that she forced me into a hostile work environment. She used my illness against me to fire me. Great job but horrible boss.XXX,At Mayo Clinic I would work on getting approvals from the insurance companies before patients would be able to be seen. I would also work with insurance companies when they requested medical records of patients that were in the hospital.XXX,Wonderful place to work. Great people and great management. Benefits are not as comprehensive as they once were but I feel like that's hospitals in general. They have the best staffing ratios I've ever seen.XXX,""The needs of the patient are the only ones to be considered."" This is the attitude of all the staff I have worked with for the past four and a half years at Mayo Clinic. Every person brings their best every day to offer patients comfort, hope, guidance and answers. It has been my highest privilege and honor to work side by side with peers who represent the very best in health care today.XXX,Team based care model in a policy driven, physician led institution. Resources readily available. Truly embodies honoring the ""needs of the patient are the only needs to be considered.""XXX,As member of the Health Information Team responsible for implementation and roll out of the Mayo Phoenix Hospital's Electronic Clinical Information Management application my typical day entailed meetings with various division leads and management personnel planning for various patient and workflow procedures and protocols. Meetings also entailed collaborating with vendors involved with building the infrastructure and installing various systems and clinical equipment. Among key lesson learned was the need for a clear and distinct vision and an adequate workforce of skilled professionals as essential elements for successful completion of a complex, project. The management was mission driven and had a keen eye of talents needed. They spared no expense in ensuring that resources were available to accomplish the mission at hand. The hardest part of the job was operating within the established time constraints while becoming familiar with new systems systems and emerging technology. Successful roll out of each clinical application was the most enjoyable part of this job.XXX,Great co-workers. Good benefits. Decent work schedule. Good paid time off. Work short often. Poor management. Pretty fair pay. Do work every other weekend and holiday.XXX,as an aide, we had a lot of busy work to complete before shifts end. Nurses were always willing to help though! its our job to answer calls lights, wash up patients, change linens, transfer, and we can even assist in procedures upon nursing discretion.XXX,Principal investigators are great mentors here and very supportive to build you on your chosen academic career path.

Friendly customer service high priority. Was trained in all levels of retail service by a great team. Team training and meetings were fun silly learning experiences.XXX,Definitely a super fun job, probably the best retail experience I've had. I knew a lot about Disney going in and I know even more now. Management is great and very organized. Dealing with kids and their parents can be hard, but it's typically very rewarding.XXX,The company expects a lot from their employees but its always fun. Most people do the work of 2 people and only have the title of ""Associate"". Associates often have the experience level of over 5 years and could be a manager at any other company. Its difficult to move up within the company. You'll see a lot of people moving from department to department but keeping the ""Associate"" title.XXX,Don't let the recruiters fool you. There is not a lot of growth and development to move up quickly. There are no plans/tracks for people to advance their careers. And don't even think about getting any significant pay increases.XXX,The downside is the senior level managers know there are 1000 people lined up at the door just to work for Disney and they use that to their advantage. You'll definitely feel like a dime a dozen.XXX,the job is actually great, a little stressful. but i enjoy it, The team on the other hand....not so much, Very unprofessional and management does not appreciate hard work. Get pointed for family obligations, and if the computers dont load up in enough time....that is a point. no one in there that i noticed does the job according to what we were taught. its like a jr. high school.XXX,When you work at the Disney store you day start of ok but you never really know what you walking in too.... It really is not the happy go lucky place..... We  just put on a good show.XXX,Fantastic work environment, management and other cast members are encouraging and supportive.  Overall excellent team work.XXX,It was fun and encouraged to work itself. But I got very frustrated by people who liked politics. By those experiences,XXX,I would not work there again.XXX,typical day was short due to lack of hours.

It doesn't feel like work.  The assistant managers are all young and have no leadership experience.  Most are only working there to discounts and free park tickets.  It's like high school.  If you don't belong to the cool crowd, you get treated different.   Not many hours.XXX,Fun Active Work Place. Fun Coworkers and Overall Pleasant Customers. Easy to Understand Duties and Responsibilities.XXX,I was only a seasonal sales associate, but it was usually pretty fun. The only thing I didn't like was that the store manager at the time didn't like me or the fact that I was in college, so she constantly scheduled me for ""call-in"" shifts. Which were basically I had to call in an hour before that allotted shift would start to find out if they needed me or not, and they hardly ever did.XXX,Tough place to work and management needs help.  Many learning opportunities but won't stay long.  Advancement is very difficult. Work life balance can be challenging if not impossible.XXX,A typical day at the Disney Store starts with opening the store with a story and letting a little child turn the ""Story Book"" light on.  If a famous Disney song comes on, everyone is welcomed to join in.  I have learned that every child grows up and every adult must keep learning.  I have worked with and meet people from all over the world and a good attitude can change a bad attitude most times.  I enjoy working with my manager and meeting new co workers each season.  The hardest part about working retail is approaching shop lifters, you just never know where the person's thinking is.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping new grandparents pick out toys and clothes for the new member of the family.XXX,Excellent place to work and is so inviting to everyone of all ages. XXX,It is such a fun place to visit even if you do not plan to buy something. There is something in the Disney Store for everyone!XXX,I had the option to get to work at an earlier time and was able to leave one i completed the 8 hours. I learned how to maintain a set pace while working, once I became acclimated to my work. management was really friendly, and understanding. along with my co-workers were a colorful beam of personalities, all witch enhanced my work experience. The hardest part I would say would be trying to break the occasional monotony that was brought along with the job. The entire 8 hours was just desk/computer work.XXX,I loved working for the Disney Store. Very sad to see the store close, but the customers and events we would have for the kids were extremely fun and brought everyone togetherXXX,Great company, excellent brand. The atmosphere alone is inviting to visit and work in but the culture suffers from poor store management. Both the store level and above are not in tune with the guests or the experience. Over the years they have grown complacent and gone away from what was once special about these stores. They are now like any other retail store when you visit. Advancement is almost non-existent, the management never go anywhere, and the good management always ""disappears"" why do they let them go? Internal guest service is always preached but seldom ever actually experienced.XXX,Who wouldn't love to work at Disney! Working in the retail store was just like any other retail store, running a business. The store cast members make it a magical experience.XXX,A typical day at work included replying to emails regarding our product or a guests order. Working at Disney gave me a lot of patience and helped me deal with people in a better way.

They have a play room that has a ping pong table, tv, mini golf hole. They offer a service I believe in. And it works.XXX,I worked here while going to school. They were very flexible with hours. They made sure you knew what you were doing. There is no script to follow, which made it a bit hard, because you had to memorize questions to ask.XXX,Helping clients with credit repair services and changing the lives of people stuck in financial situations.  Expert advise and continued follow ups.  Management is great as well as training and coaches help you succeed beyond.  Your teammates are always there to help cheer you on as well.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get clients to talk with you at that particular time, there are many excuses that they don't have the time but you need to try to get them interested at that moment, instead of call backs.  Working from home is the best part especially if you need to be home.  No need to go to the office during bad weather.  The company provides you with all the equipment need for you (computer, keyboard, mouse and headphones) all you need is a ethernet connection and your good to goXXX,The environment is nice.

I learned much about credit and laws in connection to it. Management is not that great, you get promised one thing but get another.

Friendly employees and a positive work enviormentXXX,The call center is a nice call center. In the OKC location the site manager and operations manager know who you are. They come out on the floor and talk to you. Other coaches also know your name an will help you even if youre not on their team, which is unlike other call centers.XXX,Watch out for management. The OM Andrea is very fake. As soon as she took over everything drastically starting changing and everyone started quitting. Management is two faced. They will never acknowledge your hard work and dedication. As soon as you mess up or make a mistake they are real quick to write you up. They play favoritism. They all like someone until drama starts and then chooses who sides to be on. Pay sucks. They play with your money. They tell you that you commissioned out but some how your check would be lower from the check you didn't commission out on. They will over pay you and take it out without permission. Payroll is unprofessional and makes up lies. But overall watch out for ANDREA and LANCE. Andrea is extremely fake. You can tell it is extremely hard for her to even smile at work. She has to force herself too only because she is the OM. Not really a friendly person at all. She sits in her office with all the MEN coaches for 2 hours while they all laugh and have fun and there are no sales coaches on the floor to help the agents.  Coaches all of a sudden stopped being available even though that's what they get paid to do supposedly. Management will tell your business to other agents. Not a professional place. It was in the beginning. A lot had changed!XXX,Call center environment, so the work was hard, emotionally taxing, and demanding. Due to this environment, employees learn how to work well with clients, how to assess their needs, and help to resolve their concerns. Employees also learn how to keep a positive attitude to build confidence in clients as well as to help build the moral of their coworkers.XXX,Training was good but once on the floor and working hard to convince the poor they need there credit repaired in order to get ahead was a task in itself but once that was achieved the pay became different that what was presented in training.XXX,I loved working at Progrexion! I was there for a little over two years and it's the best job I've ever had. The work is not hard at all, as long as you pay attention to your trainers and coaches and do what they suggest when you're on the phone. I loved my coworkers and my coaches. We got free food all the time, whether is was hot dog/cereal Friday, pizza, tacos, or doughnuts for meeting our team goals, whole pies for Thanksgiving, or random food just because. We also watched tv/Netflix/dvds basically all day. You just had to be sure you were paying attention to the client when you got a call though. We also had guitar hero live for PS4 in the basement area to play on breaks. I felt valued and appreciated in this company. Basically, if you implement what you're taught in training and coachings, and you actually TRY, you'll be successful. Like I said, the work isn't hard. You just have to want to do it. I will say, if you're not much of a people person, maybe don't apply for this job. You'll have to deal with all kinds of clients in all kinds of moods, so if you can't handle that, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. But I really loved this job so much. I only left because I moved.XXX,Full day on the phones, helping customers with improving their credit so they can achieve their financial goal.

XXX,Otherwise you will be out cancellation charges, sound like a fool for saying you were going to do something but don't, and include your close mates in the process because of Apex management requesting any and all qualified personal for a week long contract gig in a city 400 miles away.

No stabilityXXX,Overall, I was satisfied with the company. The Client they placed me with was a very good fit as well. Apex frequently kept in contact and never missed a single payroll payment, except once through my own fault. The only downside was the position I had was 300% more travel than I was told upon accepting the position.XXX,A typical day was getting into the office at 7:30 and leaving at 6:00, and work wasn't even completed, so you were behind when you came in the next day.  There was no training involved, so it was figure it out as you go.  Also, the director was new, so when you would ask a question, oftentimes you wouldn't get an answer.  There were no guides/resources to refer to and processes changed on a daily basis which made consistency non-existent.  Would have been nice to have a contact list of who to call when issues arose.  Technology was poor - not even set up to print and had to utilize web mail which was awful.

They seemed a lot more concerned with pleasing and catering to the Client's needs, but that's to be expected anywhere.XXX,Apex Systems is a good company they help you find work, the only thing is its through an agency and you don't get alot of the benefits other companies do.XXX,Apex is second to non in job placement and technical managerial skills.

XXX,They take great interest in developing new employees to move the company into the future.XXX,If you like golf and like to travel this is the job for you. Along with this job you'll learn more about different areas and also get to interact with various types of people.XXX,The company focuses on reducing cost by looking at tangible items rather than how to cut cost by improving processes. There is so much opportunity for this company if they'd just pay attention. Recently it has just been layoff after layoff! Which make the work life so difficult.

A place where one can advance their education with the company's assistance.XXX,As in all organizations communication could be a little better.XXX,Great executive team.XXX,This place is a joke. Overworked and under paid. Management is completely ridiculous and decisions are constantly made without keeping the staff informed of the changes. Nothing you do is never enough. No room for growth at all! The amount of people that leave each month is nearly uncountable at this point. There are even temps that will tell you they don't want a full time position here because of the stuff that goes on. Everyone is miserable and it just keeps getting worse. If you call in sick, you get an occurrence and two more of those in a 30 day period, its a write up. So if someone in your life happens to pass and you didnt give a two week notice of your time off, too bad. Occurrences it is for you. They do not care about how stressed and overwhelemed you are, they will keep pushing mandatory overtime on you. You as a person, do not matter to this place.XXX,Bottom line: STEER CLEAR OF WORKING HERE!!! Your sanity is worth much more than what this place will pay you for.XXX,Expect to work with the most useless and uneducated people. There are times you have to read your already sent emails to people to get a response, otherwise they don't have the ability to respond. Management puts you out to deal with items on your own with little to no training.  HR is a joke. HR is a joke. HR is a joke (this needs to be repeated).  HR is the most incompetent group in the entire organization. Other departments need to perform HR functions because HR will otherwise not perform the tasks correctly, instead of simply firing those incompetent individuals and replacing them with individuals that can perform the required functions. Hardest part is coming to work everyday for a company that you don't believe in, doesn't value you, doesn't pay you anywhere what you near deserve, yet expects you to perform at 200%. 3-4 of your coworkers will leave, you will be asked to perform their functions and take on more work, with no pay increase or promotion.XXX,This company is great for work life balance and security, but no advancement or career growth. They don't care about coaching and career path. Low salaries.XXX,All Co-workers have respect, dignity, and value. The amount of unrelenting drive is something to behold. This is a good company to work for.XXX,Most managers use intimidation and fear to get things done. It's all about the bottom line. No empathy for people - employees or customers.XXX,In order to do this line of work, you have to have patience and excellent customer service skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I worked with. You get a lot of irate people calling but it's your job to stay calm and work with the consumer.XXX,I would prefer not to provide commentary at this time, perhaps I can provide it once a new position is found. Once I find myself in a new position then I will gladly provide more feedback.XXX,Most of time was spent on a computer, and entering data. There was not much hands on work in regards to cases.The overall culture of the office was fun and laid back.XXX,I worked for Encore - Aero Drive location for just under a year. From the start I could see that the majority of the employees were young (minus upper management) and everyone had a very ""laid back"" attitude. It's supposed to be business casual but I seemed to be the only one dressed nice the entire time I worked there. People formed their own little cliques and the environment seemed very high schoolish. Group managers were not professional at all, little to no training was offered (everyone is kind of just thrown into their work), turnover is HIGH (people were always quitting and new temps were starting all the time). I constantly heard people complaining about their pay. Raises and promotions were very rare. There is absolutely no growth at this company which is why so many people, even people in higher positions, moved on to bigger and better things. I lost count of how many people quit while I was working there and everyone always talked about how they were searching for new jobs and how they couldn't wait to leave Encore. The friendships that I made while working at Encore I'll always remember. The happy hours after work were always a blast. There's not much more I can say about working at Encore other than walking out on my last day felt AMAZING!! :)XXX,A lot of highly intelligent, professional and courteous people. I've built many strong relationships, gained excellent experience and I've had the opportunity to work with people that truly want to make positive changes in the organization.XXX,Encore has changed a lot over the past few years. The success of the company has inevitably put more focus on making money than taking care of the people in terms of helping them grow and succeed. IT specifically is seen as ""second class citizens"", always blamed when things don't work right, but never given the support to solve the problems the right way (e.g. replace outdated technology). All IT staff is expected to be on call 24x7. If you don't pick up a call then you are reprimanded for it.XXX,Management only cares about making quick decisions instead of thinking through options first. I enjoyed the first few months of working at Encore but most of the good people/leaders have left so there is really nothing that sets this place apart from any other multi-billion dollar corporation. XXX,If you want to work at a place where your opinions matter, where your growth is important, look elsewhere.XXX,Happy to go to work my typical day is on the computer working on  legal documents, updating information. My co-workers are positive people that are fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is when I run out of work. The most enjoyable part of my job when I learning new project.XXX,Was a temp. Managers were excellent, but the work was grueling.XXX,My job is pretty repetitive and the atmosphere is a little ""immature-ish"" for me. Working for so long in an office setting I am used to professional guidelines and in my department there really is none. Overall if you need a job to make money I recommend it, but not one to further a career.XXX,This job provided me with almost no training or orientation.  They made me go through a temp agency via online located in California after the interview.  The job was only temporary, but in the short time I was there the manager provided zero guidance.  I wasn't even sure what I was supposed to be doing as a file clerk.  I was laid off after the first week.XXX,A typical day for my position would include reviewing the attorney calendar to determine which hearings we needed to attend, or dismiss, reviewing files for litigation, reviewing files for service and dismissals, preparing suits for court, preparing instructions for attorneys to appear at court, gathering exhibits and other necessary documents for evidence, reviewing statuses of cases at court, calling courts on occasion, reviewing tentative rulings, reviewing files for bankruptcy, updating files, preparing notices.XXX,The hardest part of my job is a lack of communication between departments. It makes for a lot of wasted time, having to redo tasks that had already been done.XXX,Not a bad place to work, but not a great one either. The pay is slightly below average for the job titles, and promotions are rare (I've only seen one in any department after working here for a year). The company is large, but small teams make it feel more personal. Work can be mundane, and month-end pushes tend to be stress-inducing.XXX,There is a strong push from management to be creative and boost revenue, but a lack of incentives, high pay, promotion opportunities, and moral high-ground make the pushes relatively useless in terms of actually producing productivity.XXX,Hours are not very intense, but they are very rigid. It's hard to get time off on short notice, and shifting your daily schedule by an hour (eg: 8-4 instead of 9-5) necessitates a talk with a manager. Salaried positions are treated like hourly with no overtime. You must be in the office 8 hrs/day or 40 hrs/week, even if you have nothing to do. In addition, you aren't paid extra for working overtime (not even with a year-end bonus for hard work).XXX,Co-workers are a lot of fun, and the culture is good, but it is not an innovative company, nor is it an interesting or inspiring industry - it's debt collection; know what you're getting into.XXX,Encore has changed dramatically over the last couple of years.  The work culture used to be fun, flexible and relaxed.  Now there are lots of rules and regulations.  This is not a professional office, and you are treated like children for the most part.XXX,The company expects you to have a college education, but the hourly wage is not reflective of this.XXX,There is almost always mandatory overtime, averaging at around 15 hours per month.  And when there are incentives to work more hours, they are pretty nondescript.  The overtime does boost your income, but it also interferes heavily with your free time.XXX,The work is very mundane, and requires a high level of concentration throughout the day.  As a Legal Specialist, you are signing affidavits that can end up in the hands of defendants, so you are subjected to a certain level of risk.  Many Legal Specialists have been mentioned in blogs on the internet (myself included), and some have even been served with a summons at home.XXX,The company offers 15 days vacation, however, there are no sick days offered, so vacation days will be used for any periods of sickness.  There's also the opportunity to work back the time at the weekends if you don't want to eat into your vacation time.XXX,The hardest part of the job was trying to keep my opinions to myself with regards to management.XXX,The best part of the job was working alongside some great people.XXX",,,"Great people to work withXXX,Great pace to workXXX,Life balanceXXX,Job Work/Life BalanceXXX,Nice buidlingXXX,BonusesXXX,noneXXX,Free coffee/water and occasional free lunchXXX,Free coffee/waterXXX,NoneXXX,Fun, off sight events, casual work environment, nice co-workersXXX,Stable, friendly co-workers and social environmentXXX,Regular pot lucksXXX","Bad managementXXX,Could be better on promotions and compensationXXX,No advancement, upper management is not nice to work directly forXXX,No advancement opportunities.XXX,Benefits, work-life balanceXXX,noneXXX,Management, employee turnover, compensation, mundane workXXX,Too many to list hereXXX,Terrible orientation, no guidanceXXX,healthcare coverage, lacking communication between departmentsXXX,Low chance of promotion, monthly deadlines, questionable ethicsXXX,Free coffee was disgustingXXX"

Overall, CH had good intent, but lacked the experience and leadership to effectively execute. I think in two or three years, they will be a formidable force in the corporate healthcare community especially now with McKesson's involvement.XXX,This is truly a great company, it is a contract job working for the hospital but excellent benefits and independence.  I had knowledgeable management team and very supportive.  The company would take good care of the employee.  The benefits are outstanding they provided company perks that are very rewording.  The tool to do your job are always present and they help you along the way to set you up on what you need.  The communication with upper management is great and you don't feel like you are under them rather your working as a team.XXX,change company is a great company to work for and offers opportunity for growth. management and staff are outgoing and very helpful. i enjoy what i do and the people i work with.XXX,Change Healthcare's environment is very laid back. The company doesn't have a sense of direction. Laying full-timers off because of a merger.XXX,Was normally organized.  I had one of the best team lead that had a great management style and was a outstanding teacher.  There was many ongoing training session on Claims Formatting, HIPAA Compliance, every aspect of the claims.  The hardest part of the job was pay was low and market rate.  The most enjoyable part was the coworker they were family.XXX,Loved the company, hated that it ended so soon. Loved the benefits and pay and wouldnt mind coming back to work for them if I was able toXXX,Change Healthcare is one of the best places to work. Company culture is awesome! Always a reason to acknowledge and celebrate the people who live to change other peoples lives for the better.XXX,Good working conditions until very abrupt layoff with possibly illegal 1 week break in health insurance. They gave me laptop, docking station and two monitors to use remotely. They paid all expenses when I visited the office.XXX,As a patient advocate, you fulfill different duties as you assist patients and families in applying for state/federal benefits. This is the greatest reward of the job, but sometimes this is overlooked by executive management. Every application completed represents a person and/or family that no longer has to worry about the cost of medical expenses. The advocates are often the voice of reason and voice of comfort to a grieving family or gravely ill patient. The volume of work (patient referrals) are high at times, but it is manageable if you have organizational skills.XXX,I think the company does need to do a better job with training. For too often, young healthcare representatives struggle within their first year because there is not enough classroom training or ongoing support. Management obtains grades or percentage of the new hires, however, trainers are not required to follow up with recruits which may be showing early signs of difficulty grasping the information. Therefore, managers whom often rely on the senior health care representatives have to go through additional training with the new hires with the hopes performance will increase.  Primarily, training is completed through webinars, but the type of work Healthcare Representative are expected to complete requires a more in-depth face to face training particularly on the federal process. The executive management needs to take a look at the training provided to the new hire to ensure their longevity.XXX, Also, they need to rethink the salaries of Healthcare Representative.  Though, I agree the starting salary shouldXXX,  XXX, adequately reflect the cost of living in an area, there should be no reason why a new hire who does not have any experience with the company should make the same salary or more as a person who has been with the company longer  (3+ years) especially if they have no prior experience in working with state or federal benefits. XXX,For my location, I have a manager that is very flexible with time and often is very supportive to personal needs. My manager does assist the team with meeting the goals to ensure we are successful.XXX,  XXX,Development, testing, customer interaction, payer interaction. Training and mentoring developers. Good teamwork environment as well as the ability to work independently.XXX,The company is fast growing, but under employed.  Team atmosphere is low.  Poor training.  Salaried positions require several hrs.XXX,I found myself working above and beyond the required responsibilities of my job and was never recognized or acknowledged.  Management was condescending pay was not comparable.XXX,I actually worked as a contractor here, and just loved the whole atmosphere at this office - the coworkers were awesome, the management was approachable and fair, and it was probably one of my most favorite jobs.XXX,The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry/impatient pharmacists who were having trouble processing the discount coupons, or dealing with those who just wouldn't listen to your instructions.  However, after a time, the problem got resolved and the pharmacist would hang up satisfied with their experience.XXX,As a healthcare rep at the hospital, your day is very busy.  Interviewing patients and trying to stay detached from their problems becomes very stressful.XXX,No comment on this company. No longer familiy oriented and employees who have been there a long time are let go first.

I would have to disagree. They constantly harass you about numbers and make you feel bad about yourself. Instead of helping you they just tell you that you're not doing what they want. Unless you are full time there are absolutely no benefits. If you miss 5 days because of illness you are fired. The management is there because they are loyal, not intelligent and sometimes it is embarrassing to know you work under such uneducated individuals. The job is boring. You take call after call for hours on end with one 15 minute break. The pay is low compared to the responsibility. Honestly, I could go bag groceries and make as much.

I left there after being there about 6 months and ran out of the door.XXX,management tries to create a fun office environment. benefits are good. job is tough but pay is rewarding, company tries to promote from within which is goo, lots of room for advancementXXX,ADP is great with promotions and job growth. ADP Promotes continued education and compensates accordingly. Work life balance is wonderful when eligible to work from home.XXX,This is a very large company, always improving. This company embraces change and always has room for growth. They reviewed the employees constantly and promoted good work ethics. Compensation was great.XXX,did not like the agency liked the company that I worked for and the TL was ok people on the team very young and childish nothing more to say about this placeXXX,Data entry job doing payroll. Lots of opportunity to move up and gain different skills in small business. Upbeat and positive work environment. Great communication between management and employees.XXX,ADP served as a great foundation to hone my challenger and consultative skills. Being one of the original in the industry, the old-guard mentality still exists heavily. My suggestion to management is to give people more opportunity to grow within the organization. Identify key players and move them through the ranks. We also need to shift focus to put clients first. Since ADP is a service provider, that should be key in what we deliver to clients day in and day out.XXX,Barely room to grow. Let's say you do, and you're promoted. You're only allowed up to a 10% increase in salary and 10% being the max if you have a manager that fought for you. So what happens is that when you're promoted, having most likely already been underpaid to begin with, you receive your 6-8% (on average) increase, lets say you got lucky and they give you 10...you still fall below the minimum for the new job grade you fall in. The max increase cap is in effect for anyone and any position, no matter how far away from the minimum you are. Which creates such outrageous inequities. It's common knowledge that staying with most of the larger corporate entities that surround you and growing from within end up hurting you in terms of pay. But not even making the job grade minimum gives me zero interest in growing with a company that doesn't compensate me not even the minimum of what my colleagues would be receiving. XXX,About 80% of employee's at a certain level start off working as temps and are forced to stay as one for up to 2 years, I've heard of someone working as a temp for 5. There's no room to grow, the benefits are awful considering this is what they offer among other things. I've heard of small companies paying for their employee + family's healthcare entirely. ADP's plans are awful and very expensive.XXX,Assisting external clients with ADP branded pay roll product issues, was the main work , located in several locations in the US training was done in Florida, loved to work thereXXX,Working at the Dallas office of ADP was a horrible decision. There was no structure, it was so unprofessional, and only about 10 people in the entire office actually succeeded at their job.XXX,to be able to wake up and have your own business helping customers rebuild and restore their dream vehicle, learned many new ways to build vehicles to customers standards, no hard parts to the job itself, very rewarding to know that customers were satisfiedXXX,ADP is great! Love the call center enviorment some of the supervisors are great. Some are not. Work very hard, still a temp though. Need to get recognized for my hard work and my dedication. Need an employer to take my hard work fully and appreciate the good strong employees.XXX,ADP is a great place to take your career in different directions.  I've managed sales teams for over 10 years at ADP and also in 5 different states.  ADP gave me the flexibility to grow my career.  I had great mentors and had many opportunities to give back as well to many fellow peers.  ADP is an overall great place to be!XXX,Great employee engagement and workplace culture.  However the workload was unrealistic and quality was sacrificed for quantity or productivity.XXX,If you want overtime, it is freely given. I wish i could make more money by working more overtime even though I get five to ten extra hours because they asked me too. If you work mornings, it is a great idea because job life and life is balanced for the most part.XXX,Terrific place to work and a great place to develop new and meaningful skills.  A wonderful place to work and utilize your skills,XXX,They are constantly hiring.They do however, have some high turnover. The culture is a great experience.

XXX,Good pay. XXX,Great Work experienceXXX,Management is fair on employees XXX,Liked it so much I work on weekends on my own timeXXX,Seagate is a great company to work for.   The management values their employees and provide a great work life balance.   They invest in education and create a family environment.   Best company I've ever worked for.XXX,* worked for 27 years at Seagate and got many opportunity to learn new things and apply them in a variety of jobsXXX,* great industry that is reaching the top of the S curveXXX,Worked hard to implement several organizational development programs to company employees.  I learned the importance in providing exceptional customer service to senior management and peers.XXX,Let me preface this by saying that the employees are great; the people are fantastic. XXX,Management is bad. Continuous bad purchases lead to lower quarterly earnings leads to no bonus. Bonuses are based on things which you have no control over. Great quarter = small bonus. Bad quarter = no bonus. There is a constant fear of layoffs. You could be a year into your career and you could get laid off. The cuts are across the board and often arbitrary.XXX,Very good work/life balance, benefits, and on-site amenities such as gym and cafeteria.  Low stress and great people.XXX,Frequent restructurings and RIF's due to changing HDD market.  Expect more to come.XXX,My team was wonderful to work with. The people making the big decisions are another story. XXX,Pay was fairly competitive.XXX,Good benefits.XXX,Good working environment.XXX,Seagate was a place that understood that the developers were their bread and butter.  Even their building was laid out to show that, the windows opened onto the cubicles, and the managers and VPs had offices on the interior.XXX,Seagate is a fast paced technology company which challenges individuals to multitask on a daily basis. I have held many roles at Seagate which has required I learn the day to day systems and process used at the company. Management supports their team and helps nurture their growth within the company. The administrative staff at Seagate performs as a ""team"", everyone is always willing to lend a hand if needed. I truly enjoyed the team I supported.XXX,Offers good experience in the tech industry.  However, working in software for a hardware company can be a bit frustrating at times as software-industry best practices aren't much of a priority.  Good opportunity for advancement for motivated and diligent individualsXXX,overall experience is good. High-tech, dynamic, lay-offs...The business is going up, which is a good sign. The last two years have been suffering.XXX,Multiple projects with complex analysis plans required knowledge of materials, mechanics and analysis.  Also, the job required project/lab management skills, hazardous materials handling, mechanical understanding of the products.  Learned about coaching, lab management, product specfications, component specifications, and database utility.  Learned how to interact with co-workers in an effectively.  The hardest part of the job was conveying scientific principles to non-chemists which sometimes was not realized.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and the challenges we fixed.XXX,Seagate is a great company to work for, and the compensation is also good. Most managers and colleagues are hard working and talented. We are thru technology transition. As a result, people who used to work on old technologies have to leave the job inevitably. Those people are mostly very talented and can make contributions if they get into other industries.XXX,Working at Seagate has its pros and cons. I have learned a lot wokring there and don't regret it but leaving was the best thing I could have done. It was draining me mentally and emottionaly. When you go home everyday crying you know its time for an exchange.XXX,The job is very easy and pays really well. The benefits are great once you become an offical employee. XXX,Management is not very good. They don't seem to care about the employees. They pretend to listen but aren't really. There are a few people there that are great people, but most the people there are suckups and back stabbers. They will do anything they can to move up. Some are so rude to customers and other employees. I've seen several employees make up lies and gossip about others and stab others in the back just to move up. Most of the people that Seagate keeps around are not good people. I lost repect for they company once I realized I there was no room for growth and that Seagate loves to keep terrible people.XXX,That's another thing is that it is very very hard to move up. I worked there for years and tried very hard to move to other departments but you could only move up if you knew someone. XXX,Anyways the pay is amazing and the benefits are perfect. Those are the 2 reasons I stayed as long as I did.XXX,I really enjoyed this place at first. Then there were way to many layoff scares and it became such a sad place. Maybe things will look up in the future.XXX,worked there for 12 years before and got laid off and now worked there for 5 years and laid off again. It's a nice place to work people are great has good benefits and relaxed environment.XXX,Seagate is a very big company so writing a review that is helpful is somewhat difficult.  XXX,Seagate has various locations around the world, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Singapore, China, Thailand to name a few.XXX,Mundane working conditions within manufacturing depts. with little chance for advancement.XXX,Physical working conditions are good and pay is strictly average.XXX,The employees at Seagate were wonderful.  I liked the challenging work and the fast paced environment.XXX,Manager was not interested in helping me advance.  There was more of a click in the group and outsiders were not as welcomed.XXX,Seagate has a powerful brand proposition but it is challenged to find a relevant place. It wants to work successfully but working hard and working well as two different things. Its a very earnest company however.XXX,A decent place to work. Depending on the department you're in, you might work in fear of layoffs. Not much effort for advancing people, you must do that your own. Hard for people like lazy coworkers to get fired unless laid off. Good work life balance though, lower pay than industry average.XXX",,,"Good PayXXX,Inspired culture of cross-functional communication.XXX,great people, great benefits, employee stock purchase programXXX,Unlimited free bad coffeeXXX,interesting workXXX,Great pay and great benefits.XXX,great people fun to work with.XXX,salary and locationXXX,Great people, wonderful building & facilities, and great environmentXXX,brand propositionXXX,cafe and full gym onsiteXXX","NoneXXX,Deceptive co-workers.XXX,no job security, declining industry, low/no bonuses, management is terribleXXX,Bad unlimited free coffeeXXX,frequent lay offs leads to insecurities about futureXXX,Terrible people to work with and no room for growth.XXX,Layoffs seem yearlyXXX,sizeXXX,Management doesn't encourage growth or provide adequate communication.XXX,old style managementXXX,Older employee populationXXX"

Established relationships with many call points in the hospital, providing glucose testing and blood gas analyzing solutions.XXX,I successfully completed three co-op rotations at Roche Carolina Inc., in Engineering, Manufacturing, and Maintenance. At Roche, I was able to learn how pharmaceutical plants operate, and how to work effectively in teams to solve problems and help achieve results. I was fortunate to have worked with many different people from various background. It was a very rewarding experience.XXX,This has been my best working experience yet. I was in charge of a project given by my manager and that gave me responsibilities which made me work harder to show what I'm capable of and leave an impression. Even though I worked there for a month as a summer job due to a program they have work their worker's sons, I enjoyed my time there learning and growing as a working person.XXX,Absolutely loved my team!!

The management is very caring about the employees; they provide needful resources to perform my job.  Co-workers are very supportive to each other.  The hardest part of the job is to participate in the meetings with folks in other continents - EMEA and Asia.  Sometimes, time zone different is challenging.

Unfortunately automation is taking my position. Working at Roach one can expect high quality products and the new automation that's been installed high quality will continue.XXX,Fast pace and good work environment.  The research facility has been closed so no longer applies, but it was a good place to work with a general severance package. Good management and coworkers..  The most enjoyable part of the job was the good science.XXX,Roche Diagnostics specializes in the production of highly technical 'kits' used to diagnose and prevent illness. This complex industry requires tight communication between the United States and Switzerland, and up to the minute financial details required to meet market demand.XXX,The company is progressive, treats employees like family members, and is setting new standards in health care.XXX,Demanding, challenging, and rewarding environment - never a dull day.  Driven to be the best and deliver results for the customer and patients affected by cancer.XXX,Roche is a great place to work. They host plenty of events throughout the year for the employees. As a contract worker, I find it difficult to become a Roche employee, it is definitely based on who you know.XXX,My role in this job ranged from documentations expert to data manager to bio-statistician. Entering with a background in applied physics, I had a diverse and strong skill set, and this job required me to preform at all levels nearly all the time, whether I was networking with colleagues overseas to develop a testing procedure that would yield strong statistical power or to give an open presentation on our team's progress and statistical results. As my contract approached its end, my time was spent on data management and documentation.XXX,The company provided ample support and cross-department assistance. The atmosphere was largely amicable and the employees were incredibly friendly, which alleviated the stress that came with the workload. XXX,I was given the space and guidance to learn R, quickly becoming our office's expert, and developed statistical analysis modalities for verification protocols. I learned quality control procedures and how to produce adequate scientific publication for FDA submission. Learning is my favorite part of any job, and my role at Roche allowed me to absorb the knowledge and experience I need to become a stronger industry scientist.XXX,Our company was approaching launch when I joined, so my employment was restricted to a contractor position which did not grant vacation nor holidays. This was an issue for me, having missed out on holidays for the previous 6 years (4 during undergrad, 2 grad school), impacted by the high-intensity requirements of the job as we approached 510K/CE-marking submissions. These are the only qualms I had.XXX,If you don't agree with anything, make sure to keep it to yourself.  You'll by walked out the door so quickly that it'll make your head spin. HR...cluelessXXX,Roche is a very stable place to work, it provides great health, 401K and maternity benefits and job security. It's an international company with lots of growth opportunities internationally and locally.XXX,The work/life balance and benefits are far superior to other employers in the area.  The overall attitude of all leadership is to be learn from you as they teach you and prep you for the next stage in your career.  The most difficult part of working for an employer like Roche is having corporate headquarters in another country.  It can tend to cause some angst in getting through red tape and the fact that things are ran differently in Switzerland vs the US.  In short, a great place to land and settle in for the long haul.XXX,The direct reports control your outcome of your performance. The cafeteria is decent and the place is full of people who have worked more than 10 years. It is very difficult to win with the constant harassment by your reports and constantly going to HR to create havoc for the Manager.XXX,Roche is full of intelligent people who are always striving to better themselves, their company, and their products.

I don't get enough hours or pay and the company doesn't give part time employees any benefits anymore.XXX,A typical day of work depends on what dept you're in, in shipping mostly you will be on the lines all day, but if they need you somewhere else they will move you around. Mostly gonna be walking all day picking up boxes and taking them to their locations and pulling out pallets and what not. I learned plenty of things as this was my first warehouse job. Management doesn't seem to be that good, the leads and supervisors don't really do much but sit around or stare at u while u work, occasionally they walk around and find ways to get people in trouble. Their really isn't a hard part of the job, once they train you its a pretty easy job, sometimes it can actually be chill if its slow, but expect to be sore when you first start out as your feet and body isnt used to walking all day and carrying boxes. As for the most enjoyable part of the job well that's when your on lunch when you can finally just chill and eat, and when you're finally off work.XXX,I loved working for the corporation. They were very helpful when I had issues using my employee discounts to other stores within the company. I only hear good things from my co-workers.XXX,Your whole life is about VF.

Great place to learn the basics and move on.The store culture is fun and people get along good.XXX,Vf was a great part time job. the staff there was awesome and very supportive. Many employee appreciation days. plus the 20 percent discount off already low prices is pretty sweet.only left because i was offered a full time jobXXX,Leaves employees handicapped by having to ask a team leader for answers while on calls, as well as having to put customer on hold for 15/20 minutes to get the answer almost every call. If you have an emergency at work for personal reasons you will get a point for having to leave work (sick child, school problems etc) they are not efficient in handling product problems in a timely manner, most of the time you are dealing with very angry customers of no fault of your own.

We had amazing co workers. Most enjoyable time at vf outlet was meeting different facesXXX,All the work is layed out for you. Communication skills are great at a corporate level. Too much fraternizing at store level and Store managers have favorites. They also tend to hired friends and family which makes for an uncomfortable work place and unfair promotions.XXX,They were really great to there employees.  Management from the President on down were willing to teach.  Benefits were greatXXX,This job taught me a good leason. Sometimes it's not you as the employee that is bad but the management can also be wrong. Sometimes it's just the wrong fit. Bit when the boss repeatedly tells you that you suck at your job and that's he's going to fire you as an example (at least 3 times a day) you just leave. Change of management was a bad decision for the company. However for some reason they don't care. But when the boss gives you the worst review you've ever had from any person in the company (before this person was there everybody always said i did great and was improving steadily). This manager said a blind monkey could do my job better than i. Pay increases came in the form of a few cents. Benifits sucked and insurance covered nothing. The best thing was that they matched your 401k contributions. Very little room for growth within the company very little support. They make life very stressful in and outside of work. So maybe this was just porr management or I wasn't the right fit but it definitely ruined my opinion of the whole company when my concerns and complaints went ignored.XXX,Great company loved being a part of the team!!

Co-workers are focused and expected to meet specified metrics. The department is divided into several different teams, each with its own ""team lead"" and specific set of assays. More advanced technicians are cross-trained to fill in for absent coworkers. The most difficult part of this position is the constant flow of work and the unrelenting pace of the work.

But still nice co-workers I would say. Management isn't half bad. They tend to hire nothing but youngster these days that aren't men yet. The girls they hire get alot of respect from inmates but when assaulted it's pretty bad.XXX,Wonderful place to work. Enjoyed learning about the trucking industry. Exposed to outstanding trucking company owners and employees. Participated in multiple functions.XXX,Operations management refers to a focus on the practices designed to monitor and manage all of the processes within the production and the distribution of products and services. The largest activities that operations management focuses on are product creation and service development, and the efficiency with which both are distributed. Managing purchases, monitoring inventory and preserving quality are the primary goals. Operations management often includes analyzing a company's internal processes. Ultimately, the way that an organization carries out operations management depends upon the nature of products or services that it offers.XXX,I have work for Adult Protective Services as an investigator 2 years and the only reason I stay is because I can work from home and make my own schedule. The state provides great benefits, but the department does not offer raises, bonuses are scarce and 12% of your paycheck goes toward retirement, which is insane. The employees are typically great to work with, but there is high management turnover and management tends to micromanage you whenever they give you an overload of cases and all of the work can't get done in 40 hours. There are too many cases, not enough workers and it is very hard to get overtime. The worst part of the job is the constant policy changes every few months.XXX,Security is no longer there when your constantly worried about which administration will be there next and what people, managers, etc will change with it.XXX,appointments with clients, case management, develop the plans and services appropriate to clients' needs, documentations, customer service, XXX,Supervisor fully support the counselor.

Management was at my service when ever needed. Co-workes very friendly and great at their jobs. Hardest part was hiring co-workers of trust. Best part was learning about the dental procedures.XXX,A typical day at work for my position would be handling personal files and arranging them. management for this department was the best never worked with such a tight groupXXX,Overall, the job itself was rewarding because we had the ability to impact the lives of many children who had been apart of the system for most of their lives.  However, I believe most upper management positions took for granted how difficult and overwhelming the position could be.  Many case mangers were given an unreasonable work load without consideration for the demands of each case.  The hardest part of this job was trying not to become emotionally attached to the children you worked with, but the most enjoyable part was working with these children and making a difference in their lives.XXX,High learning curve, enjoy the work.. not the rate of pay.  It seems only the people at the top are concerned about their money, and do not remember all the people supporting the agency.  Poor leadership, especially when the leadership have not SEEN the people below them in over five years.  I think there is a lack of coordination, and leadership by the senior staff.XXX,Good place to Begin and End a Career. There are many good people who are dedicated to service the people of the great State of Arizona. Many of the staff and management are willing to go the extra distance to meet and exceed the need of the people of Arizona.XXX,Customer centric but very fast paced. Must remind staff to take breaks. Management turnover high, very unstable for learning new management techniques.XXX,Co-workers are fabulous, the ability to assist people with their needs provides great fulfillment.  The hardest part of the job is having to tell clients that they don't qualify for benefits when you can tell they were counting on receiving anything, no matter how much or little.  Greatest part of the job is being able to tell people that they can receive much needed assistance and seeing some of their daily stress lifting off of their shoulders.XXX,The State pays well but the work environment is mundane with little chance of advancement.  Management has promoted several employees with positions of supervisor when these employees were not good in their current positions.  A highly stressful workload burdens employees with daily tasks which exceed 33 percent the traditional workload.XXX,Decent job. Stable. Excellent benefits. Excellent coworkers.

Very hard work, but refreshing to be heard by management.XXX,I would still be there if government funding had not run out on funding.XXX,I had a great experience working with Praxis. Relaxing and kind environment to work within.XXX,Praxis has more legit work than I am used to. Previous employers had never given me an opportunity to pick the type of work I wanted to do. I don't feel that the good work is a mystery here, it's shared with everyone and I can be in charge of pursuing my own interests and have the support of my management, seemingly profit coming 2nd. I've been encouraged to pursue training in areas of emerging technology, and cost hasn't been a concern. When I had a surgery, my family received a very thoughtful care package, and I have noticed an overall commitment to employees being a priority. It's the first place I've worked where I've felt the company has a heart. The other engineers I work with are very good, consistently. I've not met one that made me wonder how they got hired and I've learned that I am given the benefit of the doubt by customers because I work at Praxis. Because this is confidential and I won't have to admit it publicly, I admit that I have grown professionally here in large part due to the people from Praxis I work/interact with. I've also started brewing at home thanks to a special interest group I am a part of at the office. Excited for my first creation. As long as my profit sharing, bonus, projects, and annual increases aren't cut, I can't currently see any reason to want to move on.XXX,I've only been with Praxis for about 6 months but I love the group here. It's hard to find a company that genuinely encourages a good work/life balance; most companies say they do but rarely follow through. Just about everyone I know here is involved in something outside of work: charities, running clubs, theater, etc..., and whatever you want to participate in, the company will almost always provide some kind of support.XXX,As for the work environment, it's the little things that I've been impressed with here. In this industry it's often the case that the contracts you work on don't vary all that much regardless of who you're working for, but how the company supports you on those contracts does. My initial set up here was quick and seamless, from HR and the whole hiring practice to IT and getting my workstations running. I've seen enough incompetence in those areas in other companies that I notice when it's done well.XXX,Bottom line: In my career I've worked for very large defense companies, an extremely small one, and even a gaming studio, and I can say without reservation that Praxis has the best mix of interesting work, well-rounded employees, and great ownership.XXX,The Praxis Management team is an outstanding group of knowledgeable technical and business professionals. They guide the company and the policies. They ensure that the employees and staff are provided the best training and opportunities. We, as employees, are encouraged to pursue training, certifications and additional degree programs that both interest us and benefit the company. What makes us better makes the company stronger. The dedication of management and employees to customer success drives all of us to do our best. When we exceed customer expectations and requirements we increase the opportunities for the company and employees to expand our base of satisfied customers. The hardest part is choosing what to study next. In a way the training opportunities are like being in a candy store and having to choose one treat at a time. Truly, the only limitation is how much you restrict yourself as an employee. The opportunity is there. My co-workers are great and it's always a relaxed learning environment. The most enjoyable part is the balanced approach. We work hard and the management recognizes that and holds activities to show appreciation for our efforts. What I've learned is that it is okay to speak up and share ideas. On any given day any one of us may come up with an idea that makes a difference to one or more customers. The job is always interesting, challenging and rewarding all at the same time.XXX,Praxis Engineering is a collection of talented minds that like to have fun. Very collaborative and productive culture. Management is available and approachable. Corporate goals are clearly defined and the vision is engrained into the daily routine.

I work very good with my management . my most enjoyable part of my job is that it a very easy to learn jobXXX,They place any one in management that has been working for the company for a number of years even if they don't have leadership skills. They allow leads to run the entire floor with out supervisors there to over see if the job is being done properly. Leads will take their friends off the line so they don't have to work and put more work on others.

We interact with dozens of candidate each day taking various professional licensing exams. We are the security part of the exam to ensure it's integrity is protected. The job also entails administrative work. In this job I have been a Test administrator, Manager, Security, a computer technician, a plumber, a handyman, a customer service representative, a coordinator among other titles.

I learned how basic state tests given to elementary/high school/college students were administered, what happened to the information, and how it either helped or ridiculed school districts. The management was pretty good. Although it was a temporary position, those jobs helped a lot of people earn a living.

There are some expectations that come with calling someone on the phone. No one wants to be on the line for very long and they want results. No one wants the issue to take more than one call either. When all these expectations fall in line with what you can do, everything is great. Of course that is not how many calls each day end up turning out and the stress of dealing with the ramifications of doing all that I can and still having issues with pleasing a customer were really difficult for me.XXX,Personally, I think Fidelity needs to forego the call centers and instead creates offices that people can go to speak with people in person about the management of their pensions or health insurance plans.XXX,Great benefits and work environment, depending on management.

The company culture that was like a family is no longer there. Rather than a culture of those who help one another it is a cut throat enterprise.XXX,Mitre is a great well managed company. This is not always a good thing when you are trying to advance. The people here love being here so they never leave making it harder to climb the ladder. I would say overall management knows how to keep up moral while meeting deadlines. I will miss this place, but I must be career oriented at this stage in my life.XXX,Management is very interested in work-life balance.  There are many opportunities for continuing education and it is encouraged.  Many opportunities for socializing with different groups within the corporation.  Employees are encouraged to give back and volunteerism is very much supported with paid time off to pursue volunteerism. Great place to work.  Very diverse & inclusive.XXX,It is what you make of the opportunities from inside and outside the company. There is a real love for what the company tries to obtain from its employee groups by way of balancing job with passions.XXX,However, the culture is changing from a Senior Government Expert (SME) to that of a contractor house, less the $$$ benefit.  Lapses in the end of the government fiscal year has everyone chasing their tail, looking for little contracts to work under... Musical chairs.XXX,MITRE is very flexible with work/life balance.  They encourage you take your vacation time and enjoy your personal life.XXX,If you are energetic, hard-working, career minded, this is not the place for you because there is almost no chance for career advancement. Typical promotions at low level take 6-7 years where they take 3 yrs in most places.XXX,The company values newcomers more than their own proven and loyal employees, so negotiate when you join as you will not get a promotion after you do. This is so well known that there is huge grade inflation at the time of hire when compared to the tried and tested abilities of existing employees. Sad, but true.XXX,Generally a laid-back place to work.  Good work-life balance - flexible schedules and work locations, healthy leave policies.

You get to help solve some of the most challenging projects in the industry. The management does everything in their power to help you succeed. The hardest part is getting used to the idea of not having to deliver a product and that you'll be doing mostly research for a large portion of your project. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to meet so many smart, insightful, and interesting people.XXX,Lots of flexibility to work from home and other flexibility. Project management and division management is very frustrating to deal with as no one really seems to be in-charge or accountable.XXX,Company was fantastic to work for. They took care of their employees and catered to the employees children. Benefits were greatXXX,Fun and family oriented. No issues, would work here again. My issues are structure. They are constantly reinventing the wheel. No firm plan in place.XXX,The only down fall to working at MITRE is the commute that is just getting worse.  I love the company, the benefits and their missionXXX,Poor management.  Not all organizations adhere to work life balance.  Job tasks are not challenging or innovative.  In the ""This is how it has always been done"" mentality.  No career advancement.  Everything moves as slow or slower than the government.  Trying to figure out why it has been rated such a great company to work for.XXX,As things go, MITRE seems to be an almost ideal place to work.  Amazing benefits are part of the package such as tuition fully covered as education is encouraged,  PTO, and sabbatical available for employees.  Knowledgeable people work at MITRE and you can expect to learn a lot while here. XXX,Problems exist because management has some unrealistic expectations of subordinate employees as they are out of touch with reality.  In fact, some managers are downright sadistic especially if they have tenure with the company.   Expect to see managers play favorites.   Also, rivalries exist between  departments and older employees are sometimes threatened by new staff members and interfere with their ability to learn the particulars of the job.

It took me 7  years to increase a dollar an hour which in my opinion is ridiculous.XXX,A typical day starts with stock replenishment followed by a morning meeting to discuss the plans and projects for the day.

Management is great as I feel that I'm on steady ground with the manager and I feel that though they can be tough at times, they have a lot of faith in me and what I can do. The workplace culture itself is great, sometimes hard since there are so many things I wish to buy, but still its a wonderful setting.

Excellent working condition.  will go back any time.XXX,A typical morning at work includes putting away new merchandise and dropping and filling merchandise to maximize profits. Between helping customers and keeping up with the merchandise rotations, your shift goes by pretty quickly. I am fortunate in that I have great managers and coworkers, so going to work is more fun than it is a chore. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, as with any retail job; but when you help a customer find a product they were looking for or genuinely had a connection and helped them in some way, it really does feel good.XXX,This job would be good for people, working on the side of college or high school, needing some extra cash.

The management was good and organized and carried nice merchandise.XXX,Opening the store required counting tills and filling the registers for business. After walking the store for any safety issues, a game plan is created to put freight away and merchandise any new products. Seasonal areas needed to be dismantled and remerchandised according to the time of year.XXX,Training is always happening whether online or on the floor with trainers.

One great thing about the company is how transparent it is.XXX,Off late with a slew of acquisitions and with the resulting restructuring, layoffs have been too frequent. People working in core teams and who are competent at what they do have been less affected. There are certainly exceptions to this and that is a gamble that a company that needs to preserve its financial statements takes. So there can be a lot of demoralized people depending on the team you join. On the other hand, if you join the right team, you have a great opportunity to grow with the company. The demand for storage is always high, so from that standpoint, it is a great industry to be in.XXX,Storage is an interesting area of work without a doubt. Moving disks and moving parts made traditional storage technically fascinating. SSDs have their own sets of challenges with regards to reliability and performance which need to be solved with innovation and development.XXX,Notice that I said WD is a good company. It is not great because what generally happens is once you get into an area of work, there is not much opportunity to go up in the organization beyond a certain designation. Too many old timers from the HDD times with tremendous but irrelevant (anymore) knowledge need to retire. However, if you want a steady income with a steady job especially in Southern California, you need lookXXX,  XXX, no further.XXX,  XXX,I work from my home.  My co-worders are spread around the country but corporate is in Irvine California.  My typical workday is sitting behind a desk analyzing data, sales trends and forecasts.  I manage item creation as well and many other details.  Management at Western Digital is all very nice people.  Western Digital just acquired Sandisk and Hitachi and we have been under integration.  The culture is changing and still undetermined.  The most enjoyable part of my job is quiet time when working on fine details in a spreadsheet or ""when"" I get to be around co-workers.  The hardest part of my job is the stress that you encounter from customers and simply trying to get it all done during stressful weeks.XXX,Western Digital has a great vision of where they want to go.XXX,They have a great work environment, employees.XXX,I really enjoyed the type of work I did there.XXX,While the reverse commute kept me hanging on longer than I wanted, the reality is that the leadership team has bitten off way more than it can chew: WD acquired Hgst, and Sandisk, and are trying to homogenize the three subs into one company.  This means they went from a 40,000 employee company, to a +/-80,000 person company.  There is a lot of planning and perseverance that need to happen in such an enormous integration.  Systems, teams, product lines and cultures need to meld.  Exec's are making decisions without fully understanding the final impact, because they don't have insight to the lower levels.  Leaders aren't selecting comprehensive tiger teams to plan facilitation of these enormous tasks, and at the end of the day, they're not willing to back off from bad decisions or poor or faulty execution.  That results in tremendous hardship for the lower level people who are just trying to do their jobs. And as people leave (voluntarily, or through many layoffs that are inevitable after acquisitions) there's no urgency to replace or reassign critical roles.  Communication is nearly non-existent.XXX,Any company of this size that misses a pay cycle to all legacy Hgst employees is simply not planning well!  Leaders should be embarrassed.  Exec's need to reach deeper into the employee population to plan and make facilitation and implementation decisions, as they clearly don't understand down the road impacts.  There will be many more employees who give up along the way, and they're likely to be good ones.  My guess is that by 2018 the worst issues will be resolved.  Good luck!XXX,Responsible for Sputter process development of magnetic recording media.Run Sputter Lean & Anelva system for new process development.Work with R&D Engineering to qualify the process.XXX,70 hours / per week was the norm.  lately this has improved since the merger with HGST.  Promotions and raises were nearly non-existent for upper level engineers.XXX,WD is a no nonsense company with little empowerment and most decisions made at the executive level. Company has major amount of debt to pay off, which forces the executive team to focus on getting maximum postive operations cash flow.XXX,Fine work place but hard disk drive TAM is decreasing.XXX,WD is very good at low cost consumer products for PC and external personal storage.XXX,The hardest part is the hands-on working 1st line manager culture.XXX,I hired on as an HGST employee out of college, and enjoyed the company. While it was not quite a startup culture, it was very evident that it was trying to compete in the job market. While things weren't perfect, and I didn't agree with everything the company did (ie use TCL) it was definitely a nice work environment overall. Once the Western Digital merger went through, people were cut, and projects were added. I was laid off in the merge, but none of my co-workers are happy with the increased work load.XXX,The co-workers at Western Digital are very nice; managers and directors are good at technologies; the whole company is well-organized.XXX,Great place to work everyday!!!XXX,Learned: Accountability, Integrity, Respect, Communication and Team Work.

XXX,Hardest part job: Commute, 12 hours shift made it harder sometimes to spend time with family.XXX,Most Enjoyable job: Appreciation and Incentives from the Management.XXX,A typical day at works starts with completing any tasks from the prior day, returning phone calls or emails left on voice mail or email. Then continuing to complete any tasks or projects asked by the management. Tasks such as sales projects, inter departmental projects, and assisting with other coworkers projects. When all is complete, calls are required to new and existing customers to ensure all services are up to par.XXX,WD is the biggest storage company in the world after the merger with HGST and Sandisk. Overall, very good opportunity to learn about storage industry.XXX,A typical day at work is always a busy day but manageable and fun environment because the people i work with are very friendly and family oriented. Management in our department is great. The only hard part of my job is if no one's around when it comes to very critical and sensitive matter but I guess that's where our training comes in handy when where under pressure.XXX,A somewhat progressive environment that took the occasional chance despite a staunchly corporate environment suffered from a series of mergers and acquisitions. What remains is a soulless, unimaginative, ""old-school"" company that relishes the old way of doing things at the cost of employee happiness. XXX,""Well, at least we still have jobs"" became the depressing motto of those individuals ""lucky"" enough to remain after a dizzying bevy of layoffs and restructures.XXX,The company pretty much defines what it does only on the basis of marketing and doesn't really have a vision to lead and innovate anymore. No more vision for technology, only to make money. If you want to really explore and innovate with software, unless they already know someone will buy exactly that, they just don't care. As such, the company is entering a period of stagnation, especially with the decline of drive sales.XXX,I worked along side engineers on NPI hard disk drive development.XXX,I was very happy there for 15 years.

I liked the interested supervision, demonstrating that he cared about motivating me to be a productive researcher. On the other hand work/life balance does not seem to be a concern at Caltech.XXX,I've succeeded at every company I've worked for, including some of the top businesses in the country, because I give 110% everyday. I figured this would be a boon for me to work at such a highly regarding institution. I was WRONG!!! The management is unsupportive and passive aggressive, the pay is very low, the health benefits are subpar and expensive, there is zero room for advancement, no employee incentive program and the HR department likes to sweep conflicts under the rug to maintain the institutions ""reputation"". After 25 years of working for various companies, this is by far the worst place I've worked. The only reason why I stay is for the expensive health benefits because I have a child with a medical condition so I am currently stuck at this horrible job. The only saving grace is the co-workers who, unsurprisingly, are also looking for other jobs because of the poor working conditions and culture. To get me to join their ""team"", I was promised advancement and growth opportunities that never happened. There is never enough money in the budget to give raises. Apparently, there never was or ever will be any money in the budget for raises. They are famous for spending their money on hard costs like installing new doors and awnings but not for soft costs like employee raises. God forbid you actually have happy employees.

I have many fond memories of this place.XXX,SRI International is a good non-profit company, but it has undergone some significant changes in senior management in recent years. I am not really sure about the direction of the company any more, but the people there are top notch.XXX,SRI International is so multi-faceted, opinions in the suggested areas are bound to vary from person to person.  For instance, people working in support roles have a pretty set schedule, as with most jobs, while engineers and research personnel often have a more flexible schedule.XXX,Most of what I learned would fall under the heading ""Intangibles"", other than properly filling out documentation for the project I worked with, according to the client's guidance.XXX,Management seems to be hesitant in holding people as accountable as their peers would like, but that is a reality of any Project-type environment:  the majority of team members primarily work for someone else, and can always opt to leave.XXX,The hardest part of my job was working at such a distance that timely responses were not always possible from the corporate end.  I was in a decided minority compared to the majority of the work situations.XXX,The most enjoyable was the confidence my supervisors had in my abilities, and their consistent and constant support, as well as the timely mentorship.XXX,My supervisor did not train me very well with the everyday assignments that was given to me daily.  My co-workers did not want to cover for me at the front desk for breaks and lunch breaks.

Inconsistent criteria for advancement. Compensation is low for the amount of work required (overtime will be scheduled to the point where one's work/life balance will be disrupted).XXX,As a four year veteran who is just now taking his own advice - do the work, get your training, excel at it, but don't stay here too long.XXX,Confusing management system.  The workforce is growing very old and they are having a hard time attracting younger people.XXX,I believe that any typical day at any job is the same all around. There are times when you could be busy all day, that you don't even realize where the time has gone. And then there are the days when  work is slow that you have to go around asking for work, just trying to look busy. Management was real kick back, but firm when need be. But very open minded people. Not hard to get along with at all. I would have to say that the hardest part about the job was having to pick up after the technicians and maintain the medical supplies in the warehouse. And the most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things and meeting people with many different personalities and characters.XXX,A typical day of work for a Corporate Security Professional is never the same. I learned that most of the time people are not recognized for their hard work, but instead humiliated for any type of mistake made.XXX,A reputable institution and for someone without an PhD, it's a good start. It's very old school so there's very little room to move up without a PhD.

A select few were very understanding of personal issues going on in their associates lives while others, however, couldn't seem to care less.XXX,The work was good and the technical challenges were what kept me going.

I made a fair salary and they were both generous with benefits and seemed to care about their employees. It was also satisfying learning new systems as they advanced through the years. As with any job of course, some people were more pleasant than others to work with but you learn how work around these minor problems. Itself, is a form of learning and maturing. No one enjoys being laid off which was the case here both times. I'm used to working.

On a daily basis, I have to maintain a 90% adherence, service members, quote benefits, take up to 50 inbound calls a day. Also, I have been working with the company 3 plus years, and I had the pleasure of training new hires, being a mentor, and assisting with escalated issues. What I love most about the job?

It is rewarding knowing that you have helped someone with issues dealing with their claims. To make customers happy at the end of the day is top priority.XXX,Working for Blue cros blue shield is a very easy going job for me. I log into the computer, clock in five minutes early and quickly load my systems. After logging into the phone i then auto in and take calls. It definitely depends on the day if it will be a high call volume or not. The job itself is not what's hard but making sure you maintain the pace of the calls. I loved how the job was repetitive. The longer you work there, the easier it becomes to take calls and document everything accurately even if things are moving at a fast pace.XXX,The company as a whole is a great company, the environment is also great. There could be improvement on the management as well as company policy. However I liked the opportunity that i was given.XXX,good job..great benefits.. room for advancement.. good for work life balance..sick child care.. good parking.. flex time..production are goals achievableXXX,My day at work is consist of taking inbound calls. Begining my day with accessing all my programs on my computer, from emails, Power Excel, and data programs. Logging into my phone to take call. Documenting every call and from the caller name to reason and resolution of the call. Management is hands on and always ready to assist when needed. The hardest thing about the job is a right away fix for billing due to the time frame and process it takes to get a resolution.

The staff and management are very nice. It is a small place and is usually pretty manageable.XXX,When I endeavored a case study at the suggestion of an advisor, I had no idea how many connections I would make within the Baylor S&W system. My advisor not only taught well, but directed me to chief residents and community-based faculty who met me for coffee and edited transcripts/posters with me frequently.

Management is friendly but slow moving in communication which can leave departments in the dark. Co-workers are friendly and helpful.XXX,Greeting patients and handling front desk operations. Management works well with family needs, co- workers are hit and miss, some are rude and others are the nicest you could have around.XXX,From the minute your shift starts it is a hardworking and compassionate work environment. I enjoy going to work and getting to help people in need.XXX,I enjoyed working for Scott & White and hope to return in the future. I felt that the ""higher-ups"" took good care of the nursing staff. At my previous job at another company, we wore many hats such as nursing staff, front desk staff, call center, janitor. At Scott and White, there was a cleaning crew, a call center and a full front desk staff. I was able to focus on just nursing duties. XXX,I would give management a 4 out of 5 stars because I did feel one of my managers was biased. I did bump heads with a RN who had more experience then me and that manager took her side of everything and made it seem like everything was my fault. My most recent supervisor was very fair and very attentive and easy to work with.XXX,Besides the one RN, the staff at Scott & White was excellent. We were like an extended family. I will truly miss working with them but I had to move on due to the commute and moving to a new city.XXX,The hardest part of the job and this probably happens everywhere; the RNs look down their noses at lower level nursing staff. Luckily, for me we didn't have many RNs and all the CMAs and LVNs were like a sisterhood. XXX,The part I enjoyed the most about the job was there was a clear job description for a CMA. We did not have to take phone calls all day long unless it was an emergency. The call center would make up a phone note and transfer it to nurse staff inbox. There was a janitorial service where you could call and someone would be there in minutes to help clean something up. A full front desk staff there to make, cancel, reschedule appointments. It was nice, I justXXX,  XXX, came to work, did my specific duties and went home. XXX,Another good thing is you are able to transfer departments every 6 months. You must spend 6mo's minimum in a department. If someone calls in, we usually get moved to that department to fill in and that's great cause you'll get more experience.

Most inenjoyable is taking care of patient and family !!!!XXX,Working at Baylor Scott and White has been an exceptional experience. The culture is positive and the standards for patient care are very high.XXX,Baylor is a fast paced, very busy business.  I learned that all doctors like different ways of doing things.  As long as you strive to do your best and worry with your job it is ok.  Most enjoyable is the thank you's from the patients as you give your best to them daily.  Hardest part is trying to not become emotional with the patients as you go through their sicknesses with them.XXX,My days start by looking at the scheduling make sure insurance are IIN or OON. I learn new things every day about different insurance. Letting patient know about their insurance being OON or insurance isn't active anymore.

I have tough skin and it doesn't bother me so much. I really worry about the new nurses  though. When everyone is failing a test, the problem is not with the employee. The problem is with the education. I won't stay simply on pprincipal. I won't put up with seeing my co-workers beat down.

The lack of red tape and the ability to address any concern with management is also very refreshing.XXX,Do you have superior business instincts?  Are you persistent?  Are you curious about people?

Nice retirement plan for those who devote 5 years with this organization.  Also must establish connections with the right people for upward mobility.XXX,Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine:XXX,Management was completely inept at managing employees and handling employee affairs. Management was overly aggressive and, at the same time, non-interactive, unapproachable, uncommunicative, and unable to take the initiative to investigate and confirm whether there was any substance to perceived problems, often because Management itself would create those misperceptions. Thus, Management simply acted negatively and believed negatively about almost everyone while believing Management to be the ""savior"" of the organization. Management had nothing nice to say about anyone, including other departments like HR, or other units within the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. Management would tout its abilities and achievements to Upper Management while actually being a disaster and not having much experience with handling administrative matters. Management also had a very real problem with the School of Medicine and there was a nonsensical and idiotic rivalry with or hatred for SOM employees and programs (even though, ultimately, they are all part of UCLA, hence the idiocy of it all). This distaste for SOM extended toward even high-ranking SOM employees also within management. Management disparaged and spoke remarkably unprofessionally of SOM Management, saying that SOM Management was not qualified and lucky to be hired. Management verbally prided itself on being scary. Management verbally announced it didn't care about quality applicants but needed positions filled. Management blatantly lied. A specific example is whenXXX,  XXX, Management claimed there was no research within the building. In fact, there are numerous SOM employees working in a subsection entitled, Research & Development. To what purpose or effect this lie was supposed to have, is unable to be ascertained. And to think this lie would never be exposed is completely insane. This is indicative of the poorest management skill and/or training, gross unprofessionalism, disastrous lack of humanitarianism, revolting arrogance, and a nearly complete loss of connection with reality. Former employee feels most for the children (i.e. young adults, interns, students, and postdocs) that come to UCLA Health to learn, grow, and start a career. Former employee was blessed with great mentors and human beings when entering the workforce for the first time. The young people there will not get a great example and may mistakenly believe that the world or every organization is like this. This is sadly Mean Girls being brought to life within an organization that currently enjoys the reputation of being Top 3 in the Nation and Best in the West. UCLA Health is physically fragmented and divided with some units being nearly completely cutoff from the organization and left to develop a Lord of the Flies culture. HR is whittled down to almost nothing but Recruitment and has no neutrality or strength to assert itself. Leadership within the management hierarchy has no vision into cutoff units and therefore no ability or mechanisms to improve or prevent gross misconduct by members of its own management. Leadership is too distant and too far upward to be felt or relied upon in times of need by grassroots employees. Executive Leadership needs to take the time to come down from its high level perch and police its own, ensuring that respectable, moral, and positive mentorship is constantly being applied and that synergy and harmony is enforced within and between units. Executive Leadership needs to promote within management that no decision or action should be taken without moral, sound judgement and good cause. And, of course, to terminate Management that insists on bad-mouthing and lying, even when it is only done behind Leadership's back and to subordinates of Management.XXX,  XXX,Fun job and provided great training on learning Epic system.

God forbid you complain or voice an opinion, you will be under the radar for suspension.    Almost impossible to grow higher in the position due to management being there for 20 or 30 years.

Snap On is life, there is no balance, and not in a good way.XXX,It was simple work but if someone decided not to carry their load it could make things hard on everyone else.  It required full team work to endure all work was completed but sometimes that presented to be an issue.XXX,Snap on is an awesome job to have. The hardest part is probably working in the warehouse stocking and restocking the shelves. While on the truck driving from shop to shop the tools the mechanics and other need/use are mainly selling themselves.XXX,I owned four Snap-On-Tool franchise and Snap-On Tools was such an amazing company to work for.

Plenty of technology and new machines to stay up to date on your skill sets.XXX,a typical day at work consists of: going to ones work station and preparing for the day. bending sheet metal and operating machines. combining parts to make a completed toolbox. lastly: sanding and sending it on to the paint line. the co workers were amazing and friendly. fun and unfiltered in a very comfortable environment.XXX,these days were spent looking for new companies to try to make tool  sales.  We were given a new tool truck for customers to shop in, but the territories were too limited so growth was also limited.XXX,When I arrive to the snap on truck in the morning the first thing I do is check if customers orders have came in put the orders in the days box(meaning if it's a monday customer put it in the monday box). Drive to automotive shops on the days route. Handing out flyers and new sales ads showing customers new tools to make there job easier. Bring customer's ordered tools or find a specific tool customer needs, if I don't have that tool order it for customer after finding it in the catalog. Charge customer for tool thats needed and apply payment to there truck account or snap on credit account. Print a receipt of payment which shows new account balance. At the end of the day close the day by counting till, blanacing till, print out end of day paperwork, file paperwork, check inventory sold to replenish, or order tool to replenish stock on the truck, turn lights off, set alarm and lock up truck.XXX,I was temp who was promised a job, they dismessd most if not all temps once they get there time out of them, racist towards blacks, and treat temps very poorlyXXX,Very busy fast pace, learned to deal with a diverse group of people.

I strongly believe the success of Cigna and the collaboration of everyone coming togetherXXX,Cigna is a great company that offers many things from tuition reimbursement program to healthy living program that helps balance your work life and home life.XXX,Theres nothing good to say about this company.  Mgmt focus is on micro mananging employees.  No growth opportunity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!XXX,Good place to work. Good place to have an opportunity to advance. Good trainers teach you their way of doing things in a 3 month time period.XXX,CIGNA is great at developing talent - going above and beyond for high performers in terms of advancement opportunities, raises and educational aspirations. Corporate culture is quite relaxed for such a highly regulated industry. You will learn a lot on the job - training is well done and thorough. When they closed the office in the city I worked in, they went all out in making sure that the displaced employees could move on in their careers, helping with job searches, resume redevelopment, relocation to other offices, generous severance packages, etc.XXX,Thoroughly enjoyed my daily work.  As a risk manager it was never the same and fascinating as I worked with almost all of the corporate departments.  I was provided opportunities to use my discretion to resolve claims working with our legal department I also had opportunities to reach out to plaintiffs.  XXX,The culture changed over the past few years particularly due to the mergers and acquisitions within the industry.  I was provided an opportunity to take a lay off and thus my departure worked out great.XXX,Good Place to work , employment with Cigna has given me the opportunity  that is needed to further my career in the medical fieldXXX,This initially was a great company to work for however management changed and then the company went down hill.  Not so pleasant place to work for- they don't care about the employees and the company's mission does not actually match how you are treated as an employee.XXX,I process insurance claims after the pharmacists approve them.  My job is to close them out.  I also work in IRE, which are out of compliance cases.  Once cases expire they are packaged and sent to another company to process.  My job is to get the files together.  I've learned a great deal about insurance, the processes, requirements, and time frames.  Management is there, but not active in technicians day-to-day duties.  The culture is very lax.  We can have cellphones,music, jeans.  I like that part very much.  The hardest part of my job is tolerating some of my team members who are not professional and caring.  Also, getting pulled in several different directions (being taken off an important task to do another task that is not as important) is stressful.  Overall, my job is enjoyable.  There is always work to be done, but sometimes the OT can be overwhelming, because they want so much of it.XXX,Good place for freshers to start their career.XXX,right place to enhance skills.XXX,good supervision and very co operative colleagues.XXX,Flexible timings.XXX,adaptable enivironment.XXX,I loved working at Cigna and wish they were still on Long Island They moved out of New York but they treated there employees fantasticXXX,Management has no clue what is going on with their staff on a daily basis.

They only care about promoting themselves.  There is absolutely no advancement opportunities.  Hard work is rewarded with additional responsibilities.XXX,They are NOT SAFETY conscious at ALL!!! When something happens, it is all hush hush. There is NO learning that comes out of it. Surprised OSHA does NOT come down on them harder. Also, people are NOT valued. The head of HR has affiliation with the township in a HIGH RANKING capacity, so, some of what is done is for show! This is a union shop, but, HR runs the show. If you are NOT in the click with them, FORGET IT! Some harassment goes on, but, if you are in the CLICK, it is all swept under the rug! They are out to get you like scavengers. Will make up lies to get you! People are allowed to say and do what they want if they are in the click. If you are NOT in the click, you are treated like garbage until your need has been fulfilled and then you are thrown out on the street like trash without a can!

There are a lot of projects to be done to better the workers and production time. 12 hour shifts on a 2-2-3 schedule. Co-workers are generally nice. They try to hire young to keep workers for a while. Turnover rate is a little on the high side.XXX,It was a good job and I had good coworkers with great benefits but it didn't work out although I did get sent to Hazardous materials training which was very useful.XXX,If you want job security then this is a job for you. It is horrible to work here, even boring. There is zero culture and hardly any of the employees talk to each other. This makes for a horrible work environment and the only thing that is on your mind is when you can have your first drink or when you can go home.XXX,Well documented work flows and processes. Very friendly work environment and people are encouraged to improve their knowledge and to learn other department's processes.XXX,Company keeps up on the latest software/technology and allows for you to train to learn the new software.

There were postings for advancement but often were filled from outside sources. Other than the advancement and job security, as I was layed off, this was a great place to work.XXX,I have been treated very well my entirety of employment. They have developed a great culture for the employees and are willing to teach any employee anything they want to learn. Everyone is very kind and safety in number one.XXX,Large company with tremendous growth, good benefits and workplace. Good training capacity, sorry the NJ office closed down, I had excellent managers at the office and wonderful dealing with the UK head office.XXX,Busy environment and fully work schedule; implementation of a new system almost completed, while previous one was terminated at the same time. XXX,Great working environment and relationship. XXX,Work under pressure and time restriction due to changes in monthly close and new system.XXX,When first working here, I was optimistic about the company. But, as the many years progressed, especially recently, the scales seemed to have fallen off my eyes and I see everything differently. I’m not sure about the other Johnson Matthey sites, but the West Deptford Chemicals and Refining plant is a very callous environment and because of no accountability paired with upper management’s lack of knowledge of what truly happens, there is always someone pointing a blaming finger and that usually leads to someone being let go or even forced to early retirement. Don’t count on your many years/seniority working there, because if one mistake is made they are very spiteful and will dismiss you (unless you have close ties with people like HR, you can essentially get away with murder.)XXX,There is very unhealthy treatment to the people they should be valuing, especially to the union employees: health insurance is not as comprehensive as salary’s; as of currently, when first working there, they are not given paid vacation until after working there a full year and only given 5 days of which you are forced to use 3 of the 5 days for the company’s yearly shutdown/maintenance; the safety aspect is truly disappointing (there is a belief that many areas of the plant are safe, but if you take a closer look, you realize that it’s all an illusion); and they work in extreme temperatures (they have no system to effectively cool or heat up the plant).  The only benefit for union is you have the potential of a higher pay, usually more than the wage of salary employees.  Due to lack of dispensingXXX,  XXX, proper knowledge to those in training, as well as employee shortages, has forced many salary workers to put in a considerable amount of hours over the 40 hour work week without those extra hours being paid (this is common practice in departments, such as engineering or IT where usual work weeks consist of 50-60+ hour work weeks).  With all the money this company makes, you would think working hard has its benefits, but raises are not given to deserving employees and some past salary employees have been forced into early retirement.XXX,HR does little in helping the employees and many feel they cannot truly confide in the department without any repercussions (more like the Department of Corrections).  They should stop focusing on what new food event (wing off, bake off, meatball challenge, etc) they can come up with and start focusing on why many departments have high turnover (union production workers, quality control lab, security, etc). Honestly, times were better with the previous HR manager.XXX,As mentioned previously, Upper Management really requires more knowledge as to what is truly occurring in their site rather than just sitting at their desks strategizing- the best way is to immerse themselves in every department’s environment. If they want to make safety a priority, they need more involvement because as of now, although there is talk of safety being top priority there is inadequate action to improving it. XXX,Those with little knowledge base/experience are placed into decision making roles, such as supervisors/managers, and their choices usually are not the best.  Overall, there is insufficient training for most of the departments.XXX,The pros working at this company- some of the benefits and if you are fortunate to have a good team you work with of which I am very grateful for. XXX,In closing, it’s very interesting that several employees just this past year, have left. But, with all the problems that have evolved, I am not at all surprised.XXX,  XXX,Great benefits, lousy place to work, no care about employees, Look anywhere else. Senior management looks to take credit for all improvements, but accepts no responsibility for lack of support or EHS. Human resource department is unprofessional and only there to back Senior Management in any decision, not create a good work environmentXXX,no real room for advancement.  Pay is subpar also. great place to start and get experience and then you should move on quickly.XXX,Overall a good company to work for.

I like to meet first thing on Monday to discuss our priorities for the week, then meet again in the middle of the week to check progress, and meet once at the end of the week to discuss goal setting for the next week. I meet with smaller groups of my staff during the middle of the week to troubleshoot any issues. For example, during a recent mid-week meeting, I noticed one team was a few days behind on a long-term project. I met with the team and, together, we came up with a strategy for increasing efficiency among the team. Along with constant interaction with my team, I also attend a weekly board meeting where I present my department’s progress to the executive board. On Fridays, once all these tasks are completed, I make sure I have completed all necessary communication for the week via email and in person, and create a list of priorities for next week.XXX,Supervisor not a personable individual, hard to work with, sometimes a hostile work place. supervisor allows personal issues to affect performance on job site, plays favorites, jumps to wrong conclusions, and does not back up employees (no support for field personnel).XXX,Filled and emptied containers of product, documented as needed, co-workers are nice, this is a temp company, able to apply for full time at company offers some health benefitsXXX,It's nice to be able to go in when you want as long as the work is done before the next business day.

You spent weeks on the road, but the job was very rewarding.  Working in the alternative energy field is something everyone can't say they have done and I have.XXX,Management structure seems very disorganized. ""Too many Chiefs and not enough Indians"". Very hard to get in touch with immediate supervisor. They don't want to spend the money for quality equipment/tools. Work trucks onsite were over 10 years old and in very poor condition. Work/Life balance is WAY OFF-balance!!!.  You go to work before the sun comes up, and you usually do not get home until around 6:30pm. So, you can never get your personal business done before 5pm.....which usually requires you to take off work early to get any personal business done. I was contract only, so absolutely NO benefits whatsoever. Hourly and overtime only. THAT'S IT. No per diem. No medical. No dental. No vision. No 401K. NOTHING. Upper management never seemed to know what was going on.XXX,Fun work place, Good communication, Great learning skills, and awesome teamwork. Good starting pay, better pay once you're rolled over.

I learned a lot collaborating with the other QAs in the department. The commute from the train by shuttle made it easy to get to work without having to drive.XXX,Priceline is a great company to work for. They offered great benefits that didn't take up half your check. They had great incentive bonuses for attendance, QA, and customer comments. During a huge Ice Storm if you had made it in to work you were given a $100 visa gift card, they catered in food and drinks. We got to meet several celebrities such as William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy.XXX,The most impressive aspect of Priceline that I saw was the infrastructure.  There was a well-developed, thoroughly-tested infrastructure, in terms of software, hardware, and even personnel and policy.  The software infrastructure was not always well documented, but that was less problematic than usual, as there was a better than ninety percent chance that the developer who built any arbitrary component was still around to ask about it.XXX,Hours were flexible, telecommuting was frequently an option (and heavily recommended in inclement weather), and vacation time was plentiful (as a new employee, I accrued 18 days of vacation a year, anyone who stayed six years would receive 24 days).  There were some snags, developers could expect calls at three in the morning if their code broke, the noise level in the office became problematic on occasion, and there were known bugs in intra-office communication.  All in all, though, these issues were minor, and the company was actively working to remedy the last two (the first rather comes with the territory when coding for high-availability web services and pages).XXX,The only factor that drove me away is completely beyond the company's control: snow.  If one is accustomed to frequent and heavy snowfall, this likely won't be a factor at all.  If, however, one hails from a warmer climate, it can be most troublesome.XXX,I feel the team as a whole is great and motivated, I think the company model is fun to operate in. The only turn off was during their growth it felt reactionary instead of planned. I would certainly refer people to work for Priceline/Booking because they are a stable growing business with high aspirations.XXX,not a bad place to be for a few years but don't look to advance here.XXX,A typical day at work is busy, so you can learn a lot by handling the day to day task.XXX,I really enjoyed working at Priceline.com.

There is lots of favoritism at this company though, they were promoting employees who did not deserve it and were high on the job. What a joke. I loved that there was so many different nationality's working in the same building, I learned so much about so many different people. However, it also caused lots of problems, there is so much harassment that goes on in that company and no one in management does a thing about it.XXX,I really enjoyed my position with Priceline.com as a Business Development Manager. I was able to travel nearly 70% of the time and sharpen my sales skills with extensive outside sales and tele-prospecting. I worked with a strong group of professionals who offered support and training with a common desire to achieve success for the company and optimize revenue.

It has a great product and place in its industry, a great spirit and corporate culture, excellent benefits, and they really work to care about their employees. Since I am not based in their main office, I unfortunately do not get to benefit from a lot of what they offer their employees, but they try to keep us involved. Originally coming from the publishing world, I have learned a lot about selling advertising and marketing services in the digital space. I am much more adept at technology-related tasks and appreciate much more what exposure on the internet can do for a business and my role in all that. I have also learned a ton about the industry they serve, which is much different from my past experiences and quite fascinating.XXX,The problem is that they are growing fast, so they are making changes to what they expect us to do besides sell their products effectively. Some are just a nuisance and some have been very disruptive. Often I have to spend an additional 3 or more hours a night after dinner, just to try to keep up with all the required training, research, record keeping, etc. Plus, they are adding sales staff to do what I do at a lower rate. They seem focused on those newbies at the exclusion and at times determent of the more seasoned staff. They have restructured the company so they have taken very lucrative accounts away from me without leaving me much opportunity to make back that revenue. And, there is really no other job at this company that I want to do, that I can do without moving to their main office.XXX,So, all in all, I am sad toXXX,  XXX, have to leave this company but I feel like it is time to move on. I look forward to finding another great company to produce for and learn from.XXX,  XXX,Milwaukee Tool is a great place to work and learn! They have a fast pace environment that allows you to grow your learning and career.XXX,I've been with the organization since 2009, and the company has always been a great place to work. Management always encouraged feedback from its employees to understand our needs and wants to successful results.XXX,Decent job. Awful work life balance, no room for advancement, management is not always qualified for their job. Long hours, not great benefits at all.XXX,Typical day starts with scrum, meetings, regression and testing the product.XXX,Learned a lot of new features.XXX,Co-workers are ok.XXX,management:  fairXXX,Hardest part of the job: Manager was outsourced in Delaware/New Jersey area.  Not very accommodating.  Never there to help the team.XXX,Enjoyable part of the job:  Happy to be part of Cars.com Company.XXX,Challenging work environment, great team, excellent opportunity to learn new technologies and advancement. Fun place to workXXX,Cars.com is a very nice company located in the downtown Chicago area.  As with all jobs there are good times and there are bad times.XXX,As long as the job get done.XXX,I best thing about Cars.com is they leave you alone to manage your own territory. Yet, they select the wrong people for the most part to manager you. This leads to failure.XXX,There's the saying- the people make the company and I think that is true. I was surrounded by amazing coworkers when I started working for the company, but as I was promoted and the culture shifted following the purchase and some key leaders leaving, I was surrounded by arrogant closed minded alcoholics, who were more concerned with going to happy hour than doing their work. If you are looking for a company to start with, this is great- but for any professionals farther into their career, I advise to keep looking. Unless you are in sales- then this is a great place for you- the sales team is amazing and treated they should be, as that department is ran by some of the best managers I've ever seen. Anything outside of sales and operations- such as marketing, do yourself a favor and keep looking.XXX,The company was at one point in time a fun easy going company, it made me proud to say I worked for this company and was happy to promote the business even considering the low starting salary.  However after the company was bought out and then it's parent company was restructured the company's culture has changed from a work hard play hard company to work hard and work harder, and get less benefits and incentives to work.  There use to be a lot of office parties, game nights, cereal and cartoon days, etc. now there barely is birthday celebrations for the team I worked for.  The company cater more to the sales teams and not as much to other departments. Sure they try to promote that they are a company that values their employees and want to help them with career paths by allowing them to transition to other departments, however there is a lot of office politics that are in place that would keep you from getting the position you want because someone else has the ear of the hiring manager and want someone else in that position.XXX,good company to work for, for entry level. work life balance is great management is good with coaching new hires. cars.com is the leading third party provider for cars salesXXX,It is a good company to start your working career. Good experience and good people around you to help you grow. Pay is low however but that is in part due to the work life balance. The benefits are great also.XXX,Great place to work. Industry is very crowded, but leadership keeps us ahead of the curve. Would recommend for prospective employers.XXX,Cars.com is a great company for young people to begin their careers. There is a lot of growth opportunities for data or product driven people. There is also a lot of career development options for those that want to do be propelled to leadership or management. XXX,There is a lot of micro-management at times to drive big business practices and low communication between departments. There is also a lot of reliance on individual contributors, which is a great opportunity for people to learn. The culture is also very young and fun. People make life long friends here, and you have the ability to interact with senior leadership openly and your opinions are valued. Overall, I recommend starting your career here.XXX,Cars.com has changed a lot since being bought by Gannett.  The culture and people are great, and they provide a decent work-life balance. The people are the only reason I lasted as long as I did there. However, there is not much opportunity for promotions, and a lot of talent and top management has recently left the company. Pay is definitely under market, but it is a good place to start out to get your foot in the door.XXX,I am currently working with the Integrated Marketing Education (Honors Marketing) program at DePaul University to conduct various marketing tests for Cars.comXXX,The people here are great. I've met many, if not most, of my friends here and have had some great experiences. However, in the last 18 months the culture has changed so dramatically it was not a fun or positive place anymore. Now that Gannett has bought them out and they've moved their management and work style into the culture it's even worse than ever before. I'd suggest only recent college graduates to come here and gain some experience but if you are looking to advance your career I would highly suggest looking elsewhere. Also keep in mind that the compensation is WAY BELOW every other digital or even start-ups in Chicago. I was speaking with recruiters who were offering me ranges $10K more than what Cars was giving me. I spent 4 years here and it was 2 years too long. XXX,Pros: People and Work/Life balanceXXX,Cons: Poor compensation, shift of company culture, power-hungry upper management, close-minded management to any idea not their own, no room for growth and advancement, and poor department alignment and communication of responsibilities.XXX,I have learned a lot a Cars.com. It is a great culture with wonderful people. The people make the job wonderful and a joy to come to work everyday.XXX,Cars.com believes in empowering its employees but giving them the right tools and directions to take charge and make any project successful.XXX,As an IT Vendor Analyst, I was responsible for managing the relationships between our internal business owners and our IT vendors, ranging from staffing, hardware, software, etc.XXX,Each day was different, which was challenging and exciting, yet I chose to leave because eventually I wasn't learning anything new.XXX,The company runs on fairly old technologies and I wanted to keep my skills sharp.XXX,While a great organization to work for, with great people, products and innovative/learning environment, the compensation levels were on the lower end relative to similar companies.XXX",,,"interesting business, great corporate culture and benefitsXXX,Work Life BalanceXXX,Free lunches on special occasions.

XXX, In the summer: The lifeguards are expected to watch 100+ people at a time while rotating for 20 minutes from stand to stand for hours in extreme heat without a break because of a bad seed who didn't show up to work and did not call and the manager will not fire for a nonsense reason, all for a whooping 10$/hour. So the hardworking team has to deal with the consequences for the actions of  that bad seed. Sometimes, when you do finally get a ""break"" you need to clean, work with members, and fold towels instead of being able to use the bathroom, get a snack, etc. For the most part the pool attendants will do the a lot of the cleaning and towel folding if they're hard working. However, if you get a lazy pool attendant that day, the rest of the team will be picking up that persons slack. When short handed, on top of sitting non stop for hours, you maybe manipulated into staying an hour or more longer because they may pull the team player card. In the winter, it is way more laid back, it's a smaller group as most of the staff is seasonal, breaks to eat a meal and use the bathroom are more common, there are less people around, and it's a great place to work. XXX,Occasionally communication can be poor and they will schedule you for shifts you did not know about because the schedule was put up very last minute, or you are randomly scheduled for shifts before and after the time you were supposed to be there without being told. Other than the management,XXX,  XXX, the lifeguards and instructors are great and very friendly with each other and the free membership/discounts are unbeatable.XXX,  XXX,They are a wonderful work family, good to their employees and a great place to workout and meet good people. Clean and great equipment the only reason i left was because i moved out of state.XXX,Lifetime was by far the best place I worked for and I enjoyed every moment I spent there. I met so many wonderful people and I highly recommend this gym to anyone.XXX,There is no opportunity for advancement or increased compensation.  Going above and beyond is not recognized or valued. On the other hand, the work environment is very flexible especially if you have a family and need a more flexible schedule.  Obviously a healthy way of life is an easy message to stand behind as well.XXX,I worked in the operations department. Generally your tasks are super easy & don't require a lot. However, mgmt constantly moves your target. Every manager does what they want. There's little to no consistency and communication for overall standards/expectations. Club culture is healthy overall, but inside drama kills any will to work.XXX,Been there 2 years. I moved up in the company within a month of working there. Management is professional and the kids are a joy. Love my work family!XXX,Managing strategies are exciting and the environment is perfect for individuals who are looking for the healthy way of life. XXX,-Keep facility cleanXXX,-Healthy work cultureXXX,-Inviting serviceXXX,-Cleaning tasksXXX,Very energetic, high paced environment. You are around kids all day so make sure you are prepared for the daily difficulties that may come with that. I enjoyed my time.XXX,Management was solid.  One of my first customer service jobs so it taught me a lot about making the most of a customers experience.  Nothing too difficult about the job.XXX,Love the environment and scheduling but needs better compensations. members are great staff and management okay, wish there was better opportunities.XXX,LifeTime Fitness was a fun Company to work for when initially beginning, although there is not much room to advance. Minimum wage for a prolonged period of time (near 2.5+ years) is a norm with lunch breaks (by Law) that do not occur. This is a good place to start for a second job but nothing too serious should be expected from the Company unless you give 70 hours a week to them to prove your loyalty; even then nothing is guaranteed. Networking is the most important part of joining this company because it will help you out in the long run once you decide to part ways.XXX,A typical day at the salon included a multitude of things. XXX,Opening procedures included reviewing the batches of the night before and setting the system up for the current day. Throughout the day setting up appointments and making confirmation calls were key. Maintaining a clean and professional environment was another component to the job.XXX,My review on LifeTime Fitness is good.  Walking into the facility was always bright.  The members at the front desk were always welcoming me in, the sales representatives and i had great relationships, and the general manager and i got along very well.  I learned a lot while working there as being a team member, supervisor, and assistant department head.  I learned great values on how to run a team and my customer services abilities are through the roof.XXX,The turnover rate was so high and management constantly has issues keeping workers staffed. No one want to do this job because they pay you minimum wage while having ridiculous expectations. Management did a poor job of keeping employees accountable so we would usually have to do their job as well. On a daily basis it was my supervisor and I cleaning the entire building, doing the job of the front desk, being security, and all that while trying to keep members happy. The worst part was management did a very poor job of defending their employees when any situation came up.XXX,LT is a great temp job. DO NOT DO SALES. As long as i was there, sales was good for the money, but be prepared to have no social life outside of work.XXX,While I working in 3 different lifetime locations I can confidently say that the job absolutely offers security and are flexible with your work schedule.

I am currently still employed with Life Time Fitness and teach classes in the evenings. I have been a team member for 5 years and wouldn't dream of going elsewhere.XXX,Life Time Fitness is an active and rewarding experience, with days consisting of sports and fitness, yoga and wellness, arts and crafts, etc. The management is respectful and always willing to work with employees' schedules.XXX,A typical day consisted of teaching everyone from infants to adults the mechanics of swim. I learned that teaching adults was actually more difficult than teaching children; I overcame this challenge by asking adults to make small goals for every lesson. Management at Lifetime was excellent. Workplace culture was filled with active and happy employees. The hardest part of the job was encountering students with a fear of water, or putting their head underwater. I overcame this hard part by telling students to do sporadic jumps in the water in order to get used to getting their head and ears wet. From there, we would work on blowing bubbles. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my students happy about their swimming improvements and asking to learn more. There was satisfaction in knowing that my students desired to learn more from me and found class to be an enjoyable experience.XXX,The management lacks the most. It is difficult to get a raise at all if you work here. You are typically by yourself most of the time, which gets diffcult when the spa is busy and it would be benefical to have two coordinators at the same time working.XXX",,,"Flexible hours, employee discount, free membership, benefits, friendly coworkersXXX,Nice work enviorment: free gym membershipXXX,free membership, easy workXXX,Free membershipXXX,Free LifeTime Fitness Membership, NetworkingXXX,Great way to improve on your costumer service and communication skills.XXX,The members and team members in all departmentsXXX,Free Membership & good co-workersXXX,Free membership, free childcare, discounts on all services including the Spa, Cafe, and Kids Activities/Programs.XXX,discounted food and drinks, free gym membershipXXX,Free membership to the gymXXX","Little or no breaks, low pay, understaffedXXX,Long shifts: understaffedXXX,training is spotty, lack of communication, lack of standardsXXX,Short BreaksXXX,Short breaks which usually do not occur, Minimum Wage which raises are infrequent, Management needs improvement, Advancement is near impossibleXXX,Lack of organization from higher ups.XXX,Department HeadXXX,workload & pay &XXX,NoneXXX,when students do not show upXXX,Lack of managementXXX"

,,"Case manager, child protectionXXX,Administrative Assistant IXXX,Program ManagerXXX,Case ManagerXXX",,Idaho Department of Health & Welfare,,,,,,"When Working in Child Protection there is no typical day.  Every family that has their children removed and brought in to the foster care system have multiple and unique needs.  Case managers need to understand community resources, child development, alcohol and drug treatment, homelessness, jail/prison systems, court process and testimony, working with challenging individuals and families, understanding needs of infants/ toddlers/youth/and children who may be aging out of the foster care system.  These are some of the topics that come up on a daily basis.  Case managers spend a majority of their time on the phone, visiting with parents and foster parents, observation of visitation with families and children, documentation of everything that happens for a particular case.XXX,I have learned that there is no 'typical' family and there is no formula to working with families to help them to reunify with their children.  The key is that judgments can wait, because some people will work very hard to accomplish their Court-ordered case plans.  And of course there is the exact opposite where families cannot or will not be able to work the service plan to reunify with their children.XXX,Management at the Department is difficult to understand. There are multiple levels of people and their roles are confusing.  However, the direct line supervision is very good.  The individuals who work at the Department are some of the hardest working people i have ever met, and who are able to keep their sense of humor in a job that is very negative. XXX,The hardest part of the job is writing court reportsXXX,  XXX, that are not favorable to the parents.  Since the case management job is to help families become stable and safe, if the parents are not cooperative then there is no choice but to accurately reflect this lack of progress regarding parental protective capacity. XXX,The best part of the job is when parents reunify with their children because they have determined for themselves that if they work their case plan as ordered, their children will likely be returned to the family unit.  That is a great day, and helps to offset the times when as a Case manager one is required to present an unfavorable report to the management at CPS.XXX,  XXX,This was a very fast-paced working environment. I was very busy, which I loved.  My multi-tasking skills were honed at this job. My co-workers and supervisor were very fun and inspiring for me to work with.  I was learning on the job every day.  The State of Idaho is a great place to work for job security and benefits.XXX,The hardest part of the job for me was trying to work full-time and take care of elderly parents and my own kids as well.XXX,The most enjoyable part of the job was the invigorating pace and the many times we held workshops and provided help to the public, small hospitals and medical offices. I was fortunate to be a part of this office.XXX,The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is a good place to work. Decent management, great people, and job security if you're into that sort of thing. The downside, the state legislature hates state employees and - since the legislature is responsible for setting pay - state employee pay lags ~18% behind the private sector in Idaho. With Idaho being a low wage state anyway, that's saying something.XXX,While Idaho government is one of the less horrible governments to work for, it is still government and you must be able to handle a stupendous amount of bureaucracy to work here.XXX,A day at this agency would consist of correspondence, court hearings, and paperwork. Along with the above problem management is done on a daily basis with children and/or families.

There are very nice chairs on every floor, as well as white boards in multiple locations. On many of my visits, I witnessed many scientists discussing cutting edge research in the common areas. The staff and management were very friendly and created a good sense of community. The hardest part of the job was commuting from Newton to Lowell for school during the day and commuting to Cambridge at the end of the day to conduct experiments, then commuting back to Lowell to drop off scientific supplies before going home. The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of community and togetherness that the Institute prides itself on.

I enjoy working around people with different but awesome personalities. I love meeting and chatting with executives of the company's and getting advice from them about how I could reach my goals. My supervisor is one of a kind; she's so kind and positive. She's always open to discussions and questions that I have. It's an amazing place to work at.XXX,I worked in the Internal Audit department and the managers were some of the most helpful supervisors you could ask for. Management promoted personal growth amongst all employees and provided mentoring. Co-workers were wonderful and friendly and made coming to work each day a happy experience.XXX,The job offered great benefits including discounted healthy options for food in the on-site cafeteria and an on-site gym.XXX,There was a lot of encouragement from managers to continuously build your expertise, obtain certifications, and build out your resume.XXX,Supportive management, good work-life balance, excellent culture, better than average pay and benefits.  Competition for promotional opportunities is extreme and the process from start to end is long and drawn out.XXX,Great benefits and great team environment.

They also try really hard to brainstorm ways to make that happen, which I appreciate.XXX,Wroking for 12 weeks as a summer intern with Cambia Health Solutions was very fun and productive.

My co-workers were fun to work with and we had a great team. I enjoyed the salary and the remote position. XXX,I feel I became a very good Risk Adjustment coder and would go back to the same job if given the opportunity. XXX,The hardest part of the job was having to change gears and direction on a minutes notice and then be marked down for making errors. Another problem was management barely out of diapers expected to make decisions that they do not have the wisdom yet to make.

It's a relatively flat organization, in that I corroborate daily with sr. executives and front line employees alike.  XXX,I enjoy every aspect of the organization.XXX,Cambia Health Solutions has a very laid back management, which is very employee friendly. Employees enjoy flexible working hours, as long as the flexibility does not impact the project.

I was hired by Regence and then a parent company was created several years later called Cambia which my department moved under.  Just like any given day in the office, you go in one day thinking you will finally get to expense reports and when you leave at the end of the day you may have never completed the expense reports as there were hotter fires to handle that day.  I enjoyed this aspect of the company.  There were constant learning opportunities from new software, equipment, company policies, etc. which allowed me to grow throughout my time at the company.  In addition to my department responsibilities, there were plenty of opportunities to volunteer for other company events and assist with other departments.

Forfeiture Systems's (FS) security team deals with continuous monitoring, incident response, vulnerability assessment, vulnerability remediation, working with various security tools, and analysis of vulnerable findings within AFMS networks. The essential part and the most challenging part of the job was to maintain a good security posture so management would be satisfied with overall security structure. The most enjoyable part of the team was the flexibility in work schedules and balance between professional and personal life.XXX,Recently, AIR laid off over 30 employees within less than 24 hours time without any sort of warning. Several of the people who were laid off had been with the company for over 10 years, yet their career at AIR was over in an instant. Even worse, many project directors and staff managers had no idea what was happening and had to scramble to get the leftover work done when the employees who were laid off suddenly disappeared without being able to turn in their deliverables...The whole thing was a management nightmare, and the employees left behind are now unsettled, demoralized, and live in constant fear that another round of layoffs will occur whereby they'll lose their jobs. In addition, AIR hires people based on a certain area of expertise or skill set that individuals have that they think will be put to use. Though once most people land a job there, they immediately find out that their job security and stability depends on getting a certain percentage of their time covered on numerous projects, many of which may be completely unrelated to their skill set.  XXX,Promotions only occur for individuals based on cronyism and favoritism from upper management, and has little to do with whether a person has been there for a long time or actually does their job well. I honestly am surprised to see so many people on here are stating that AIR provides a pleasant and collaborative working environment--it doesn't!!! Overall, it's a very toxic work environment with a serious lack of diversity among upper management, which is both shameful and ironic given that the so-called mission of theXXX,  XXX, company is to improve the lives of the ""disadvantaged"". On the whole, the only people that get help improving their lives at AIR are well-educated, well-connected individuals from historically advantaged groups who find their ways into cliques with upper management. XXX,The best advice most employees, particularly those from historically underrepresented, marginalized groups, is to stay for a short while while learning all that you can, and do your best for as long as you're able to deal with the constant lack of upward mobility, belittlement, and consistently biased treatment from upper management. And if someone is abusive or treating you poorly once you land a job there, don't even think about going to HR for help.

Project profile is very interesting and job profile too.XXX,A typical day involves working 8:00am-4:30pm, training small groups of scorers on rubrics for scoring assessments. Management provides a relaxed atmosphere and lots of schedule flexibility. The compensation is also adequate. The only downside is that scoring projects aren't always happening, so there will often be weeks, even months at a time where no work is available.

Hershey Medical Center,,,,,,"Management is incompetent. Makes decisions best on favoritism. When discussing concerns management will become defensive. Important infuriation is spread by word of mouth as management lacks common sense to send out memos unless they are pertaining to irrelevant information forwarded from higher ups.XXX,Overall, the hospital and benefits are awesome. There are lots of opportunity for education and advancement. However I found the work environment unfriendly,  management uncaring and uninvested in new staff. The unit I was working on was chaotic, disorganized, and had no true leadership. If there was an emergency situation, all staff would rush to help but, many different people were doing the same simple task, no one clear leader was established, taking twice as long to get things accomplished. This was not a professional environment I wanted to be apart of.XXX,Difficult to get time approved to go to the dentist, and you need to say where you are going why and how long you will be gone. Not sure why they give you so much time off but make it nearly impossible to take it. Very fast paced and never had enough staff. Management seemed to have different sets of rules for certain people.XXX,Run if you are planning on working there' fast paced and the bottom line is it's all about the dollar. Work you to the bone and treated bad unless you are  nursing or a doctor, tech service is horrible and some departments mandate everyday. Most  departments understaffed unless you are looking to be in management. Then you will be tripping over each other.Pay is okay ,but each year the increase in health benefits goes up and your small pay increase is not enough to even cover that.XXX,Busy trauma hospital.Challenged x-ray skills every day.Good management.Great co-workers.Great opportunity for advancement.I loved working there but had to leave for better pay.XXX,I start work most days at 7 a.m. retrieving phone messages, e-messages, prepare for clinic for the day or the next day.

I interned with Hershey Medical Center, where I participated in the whole process of organizational culture change through scenario-based training sessions. I accomplished my project by developing six case scenarios as well as two evaluation questionnaires that were used in two facilitated small group training sessions, with the aim of creating a better learning environment in the hospital. The team gave me tremendous support during the internship. This invaluable experience enables me to gain a comprehensive understanding of organizational culture change, which is one of the most difficult leadership challenges.It also helped me to realize my passion on Training and Development.XXX,12 Hour ShiftsXXX,Management is always willing to work with your scheduleXXX,Friendly co-workers that are just as close as familyXXX,HIGH Patient Population - VERY BUSYXXX,Working for MS Hershey Medical Center was educational and an experience.

Everyone works as a team to provide the best care for patients.XXX,It was not what I was looking for. The department I was in was very disorganized.XXX,A typical day is long and hard work. I learned that you must keep to yourself or you will lose your job. Management is very friendly, but does not have a handle on it's employees. Co-workers have a nice demeanor, but will stab you in the back at first chance. The hardest part of the job is keeping to yourself, and a lot of walking. I was not able to find out the most enjoyable part of the job, because I did not get a chance to work there for very long.XXX,Hershey Medical Center is a great place to work. The organizational values are excellent. It is great to work for this magnet organization.XXX,Outstanding organization to be a part of! Superb benefits and great leadership team.XXX,When I returned from living in Ireland last summer, I was contacted by my local gym where I had taught aerobic classes. They were looking for someone to fill in as an Exercise Physiologist while one of their employees had surgery. Since my minor in exercise science sufficed for the position, I gladly accepted.XXX,A typical day at work consisted of opening duties of the gym, meeting with clients to administer fitness testing, orientations, and personal training programs.XXX,During my eight-hour shift, I worked alone so I had little interaction with co-workers. I found this isolating, and trying to deal with work related issues via email proved difficult.XXX,The hardest part of the job was actually finding work to do.

I love it.XXX,Care Resource is not a great place to be working for the managers don't care and work well with others in the office. The Dental office is a department that I wouldn't recommend for people to work in the company.  The work day varied from day to day depending on the clients and how there mood is and the manager is feeling for that day and will not make you feel welcomed to be there.  The HR department in the company is so unprofessional and needs a complete restructuring in the company.  The management could be a lot better than what is there right now or be retrained about how to manage the employees and make them feel valuable.

You are required to jump through hoops just to accomplish simple goals. The majority of the tasks that you are pressured to accomplish should be handled by HR, not an admin. Another downside is employees here seem generally unhappy. There is a sense of gloom and trepidation that is palpable. I would say the work/life balance was decent, but I couldn't personally benefit from this because of the intense workload associated with my department. It really depends on the manager you have. My manager was afraid to rock the boat and go against the status quo, so this caused a lot of undue stress on the employees beneath her. Many of the admins currently there are mature and have been with the company since they were out of high school or in their early 20s.

The best part was a company car.  Used to be a great culture.  Not so much anymore.XXX,Don't waste your time. Management is HORRIBLE. every supervisor thinks they own you so as soon as you mess up once, especially if you're a temp, you're gone! Everybody in the building wants you fired and will snitch on you for anything. it's a he said/she said company, for example if somebody doesn't like you and just randomly say that you said that you didn't like the job or something along the lines to a supervisor then you're gone. All they care about is how much money they make and could care less about their employees. I could write soooo much more. there is a ridiculous amount of drama in the building and everyone trash talks each other behind their backs their including the supervisors. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIMEXXX,When I first started this company was amazing!! The culture was fantastic and everyone seemed to love the job. Fast forward a year later and things changed. There were still amazing days but the bad outweighed the good. XXX,Depending on the market you get, the DMs can be wonderful and the techs even better. It is VERY REWARDING, you talk to very popular companies and build relationships with them. They say you are a ""super hero"" which is kind of true. You help mom and pop companies get their kitchen equipment up so they don't lose anymore revenue. XXX,THE MANAGERS ARE FANTASTIC!! It was very hard to leave because of my direct manager. They are so supportive, and this includes the director. They care so much it is very refreshing + their attitudes make the job mostly okay.XXX,A few bad things to list, you have to meet certain SLA times or your market gets red barred, which means you just have a bad rating for that certain account.

Thanks to such group of professionals, I'm a better version of me today!XXX,Chubb was a company that focused greatly on investing in its people. This included investing in training and developing talent, rather than hiring talent.XXX,Unorthodox.  Innapropriate.  Mismanaged.  Just an all around horrible place to work.  The worst job (Underwriting Associate) I have ever had in my life.XXX,Chubb is one of the largest insurers in the United States. Chubb offers commercial, specialty and personal insurance services.XXX,Overall I think Chubb is a great company. Some members of management not so much. But the company has great benefits and some great co-workers. But do not make friends.XXX,In the interview process I was advised that it would be only 4-5 claims per day and eventually bodily injury claims would be assigned later down the road with appropriate training. I had two informal weeks of training and was thrown out on the floor. One week after being assigned claims I was given bodily injury and premise claims with NO TRAINING AT ALL! About three weeks in we began to get 7-10 claims a day!! We were basically sold something in the interview to get us in the door and now we're stuck until we find something else.XXX,Strong company focused on underwriting discipline and internal advancement of employees.

Managers aren't really friendly which makes the employee standoff is . Keep track of your work and attendance will fire you with no notice or warningXXX,I was the international liaison between USA underwriters and our foreign offices when a customer needed an insurance policy anywhere outside of the USA.  I negotiated with our foreign offices for the customer, from start to finish, when the policy was issued. I was very self-sufficient, a great problem solver and had an excellent rapport with my superiors.  I worked with awesome colleagues around the world.  I was entrusted to work from home the last several years of my employment, and, my productivity was even greater, not having the interruptions and noise of the office.  I won awards for ""Best Service in the World"" twice after I began working from home.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with my colleagues and customers.XXX,Good Work environment, good compensation.  Management is very technical and knowledgable.   Many ongoing changes for the good.  Challenging environment but very satisfyingXXX,Chubb had a progressive culture that supported high morale with low turnover.  The challenge will be integrating ACE in such a way as to continue this trend.  Hopefully the transitioned company will emerge on the other side stronger and not weaker.XXX,I am grateful to Chubb for the incredible opportunities they afforded me during my tenure. It is a highly professional and high stressed environment. However, to whom much is given much is expected and that certainly is the case at Chubb. Again, I am grateful for the time I spent there.XXX,getting work at chubb is have a nice day with the environment that provides us with.XXX,Due to the multiple applications that are are implementing is requires of much knowledge with the latest technologies.XXX,Working for Chubb allows us to keep us updated in the area of information technology and systems management area.XXX,I have a group of collaborators who oversaw in which we have created a good working environment by sharing knowledge and functions of our tasks of every day to provide the best service that the business requires.XXX,When one enjoys what ago and likes the more difficult it becomes in the more easy to respond to any problems that may occur. Every day that I wake up is to submit many viscicitudes work but when one arrives with a mood of work everything will be only a setback.XXX,Everything I do in my job I enjoy it because what I learned by vocation not by obligation and I like what I do.XXX,I worked at this company for almost 2 years.  I came in with experience in the Workers compensation industry, so I was very familiar with jurisdictional and typical claims practices. I was hired to cover NC, VA and SC. Once I got there, I was given a totally different jurisdiction. This is not an issue, as I am up for learning new states, but I was given takeover claims from another TPA in the amount of 200 files! With no formal training of the systems and with no time to get familiar with the new jurisdiction!  It all went downhill from there. Management is very unprofessional. You have to be in the 'cool kid's' circle to get anywhere. I ultimately was given option to leave with severance and I took it.  This the most unprofessional place (and ethically questionable) I have ever encountered. Stay away if you value your career in WC.XXX,Wells Fargo is a really great place to work. You get to help so many people with their finances, Learned a lot about customer service and many banking services.XXX,Chubb is now ACE and with that comes a change in culture to the ACE environment. In acquiring Chubb, ACE not only sought to expand it's operations into the agency market and high end personal lines, but they also bought the Chubb name. ACE had developed a poor reputation among experienced insurance professionals due to the culture that derives from the highest level of leadership through claims management in PA and NJ. ACE claims management is beset with technically incompetent mangers concerned more with their own political positioning with Sr. Management than results and integrity when dealing with their subordinates. This is primarily at the AVP level and above. There are many recent positive reviews of the company which coinciding with ACE's desire to change their brand name may warrant some degree of skepticism regarding the their authenticity. XXX,ACE has made a concerted effort to recruit new entrants into the workforce who are unaware of their culture. XXX,Claims managers are much more concerned with appearance and things that do not add value to the process. For example, be prepared to have a claims manager focus more on grammatical errors in reserve/authority request than the accuracy of an interpretation of a jurisdictional issue and analysis of exposure in general.XXX,ACE provides decent compensation and a good benefit package due to the scope of their operations but the cultural issues are still the albatross for this organization.XXX,I worked for Chubb for 6 years, and it was a great experience, as I've worked with many different people there doing a lot of different functions. The experience and learning opportunity was well appreciated, as I love learning and doing different things.XXX,Multi billion dollar world wide company with great financial strength.

No process or guidelines that resemble a professional company or effective process. Most new folks are still interviewing once they start.XXX,The poor rating in this review is specifically tied to a project I was a part of overseas, not SOSI corporate or SOSI in CONUS locations.

You have to be selected and qualify to do the job.XXX,My immediate supervisor were very nice and very understanding, you can make up your own hours according to the working hours.XXX,I can not recommend this company.  While there are some wonderfully talented individuals who have worked at this company the senior leadership chruns through managers in every department and the turnover is very high with each manager lasting an average of 1 year.  This is due to the ineffective top leadership.  There is no trust established among the senior and departmental leadership and at the time of my employment the company had failed to establish an effective ethics program or transparency in their financials which is key to doing work in the government contracting space.XXX,As a former manager in this company, reviews were conducted for every overhead employee but no direct individuals.  Once rated and reviewed the reviews went before a board of top management where the CEO often directed changes in the ratings (lowering them) for individuals under my supervision whom he had no day to day contact with.  Both merit increases and promotions were predicated on these reviews and I found the process discriminating and ineffective as it became an evaluation of how well the senior management team (specifically the CEO) liked the individual or not and not a fair assessment of performance.  I feel like this is the number one reason employees can not advance in this company or receive proper mentorship and development.

It can be a good work environment for work stability but it can also be a very demanding job.XXX,Executive level management/area manager have unreasonable expectations and apply pressure on a daily basis for sales production through constant conference calls or ""call nights.""  Because the environment is so sales driven, a constant cheater mentality is rampant with the retail banking side on all levels...teller, personal banker and branch manager.  The work/life balance is not obtainable and we're basically told that in order to produce and hit goal, it will take more than 40 hours of work to achieve this; the avg work week for a branch manager is 50 hours.

The people I got to work with were great, but there seemed to be some problems with the management staff that led to the company not thriving as it should.XXX,My experience with Alion was overwhelmingly positive. Each interaction with management was pleasant and made me feel like a valued member of the team.XXX,When working for Alion, I was hoping to find a company that would adequately teach me the basics of Software Engineering. However, when I started, I placed in room largely by myself and forced to learn on the job. Because of this, I had great difficultly doing what I was asked to do. I do not recommend this position for someone just starting out.XXX,A typical day at work is performing budgets, financial report and management reports.XXX,I learned to work better with employee on financial work. I work effectively with  my co-worker and management. The hardest part of the job was analyzing employees issues to other employees, and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting management satisfaction.XXX,A decent company.  Needs to improve on training options for all employees.  As a new employee, you're kind of thrown into the fire and having to figure out everything as you go.  No one is there to guide you or set you up with the proper training to be able to do your job. Great people to be around, just need better training options.XXX,They will challenge you to provide real work for the company, and as a result, you will gain loads of experience to talk about in any job interview you encounter. It doesn't pay as much as others, but it certainly forces you to learn and contribute meaningful work that you will be proud of.XXX,Working for Alion was a great experience. The only reason I left was the commute was a bit much for me at the time. Great staff. Family oriented...XXX,Job was excellent.Worked for 18 years. Transmitting and receiving messages for government. Updating equipment through the years, and applying security practice.XXX,The company is now owned by a financial firm solely focused on revenue and low bids to win contracts.  Often salaries and benefits of current employees are reduced in order to stay employed on a new contract award.XXX,Management sometimes makes it feel more like a staffing agency.  High turnover has been constant, management is more concerned with filling a billet for a low rate than anything else.XXX,Employees treated like cattle.  All profits go into the pockets of the highly compensated 10%.  Questionable use of govt funding for company overhead expenses.XXX,It pays the Bills- Other than that, I would avoid Alion at all costs.  Zero benefits and an imaginary advancement plan.  Not sure if this is twenty words or not.XXX,Alion had a great health insurance plan for their employees. Unfortunately, over the 3 yrs. I worked their, out of pocket cost got higher and the match for putting away for retire went away, due to poor management in the corporate headquarters.XXX,I was a telework employee, but everything at Alion made me feel part of the team.  All support staff were easy to get in touch with and any issues, when they did arise, were addressed quickly.XXX,Collaborative work environment with both internal teams and Government customer. Excelling place to gain leadership skills and expertise in your domain.XXX,Always a different challenge everyday. Work with amazing people. Personally rewarding due to the fact that we were able to help soldiers regarding fuel, and safety. Cutting edge of technology.XXX,Overall, I would say that this job taught me how to stay on task, even when I did not enjoy the work every day.XXX,A typical work day changed on a daily basis. It was the same type of work, but the parts that we worked on changed every couple of days. We assisted in building a radio system to place on the back of military vehicles. There were around 200 pieces that fit on each pallet so we were tasked with putting them together. XXX,The job tested my motivation but I was able to push through. My co-workers were good people that were pretty easy to work with. We did not develop any outside of work relationship. XXX,The hardest part of the job was doing the same thing about 200 times per day but I learned to persevere. The most enjoyable part of the day was that the day-to-day duties changed.XXX,Everyone was focused on customer satisfaction, so there was good teamwork to do the job well.  Upper level management ran the ship aground.XXX,The best part of the job was my contract work for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The work was interesting and provided for the acquisition of new techniques in my profession.XXX,A great working environment full of intelligent professionals. But company leadership has made many bad choices over years, and this has led to hard times in the current industry environment. Two bad quarters and many lost recompetes have led to several hundred employees leaving the company, many involuntarily. Key management has been stripped out so critical thought leadership needed to grow the company is non-existant. Wait a couple of years before considering a job at Alion. They need to turn their ship around first.XXX,I have been employed at this company for 11 years there is great opportunity for advancement I have been promoted 3 times in those 11 years, I started off as a temp for 1 year then hired permanently for the past 10 years nothing but growth there are some management who gave me the ability to learn new things I love everything about my position and manager.

I didn't like the fact that to get additional help it meant that I had to request time to go out and drink with management until 8-8:30. The culture is built pretty heavily around drinking and after work activities which at times can be more exhausting than the actually work you do during the day.XXX,I worked at Workbridge Associates for over six months and LOVED it. Although recruiting just was not a god fit for me personally, I gained amazing skills that I will carry with me throughout my career.XXX,It seems like all these staffing companies (Workbridge, Robert Half, TekSystems) don't really have positions to fill as they keep circulating the same positions over and over again on their websites. Here is what happened:XXX,I applied to what sounds like a legitimate IT position and the next day I get a call from a junior recruiter to discuss the opportunity. We go over skills, experiences, requirements, company location and size, salary requirements, and then set a face-to-face meeting with senior recruiters in their DC office.

I learned how to recruit but management was not helpful. Coworkers were awesome, but that's about the only reason to stay.XXX,Excellent and detailed training program, but little to no work-life balance and constant micromanaging.

They have next to no clientele in Philadelphia, they get them from you, the unsuspecting candidate looking for a job. There is no prestigious university they are recruiting for, they got that information from me.XXX,there're always hireing and looking for more enployies but they never wanted to pay anybody more money that minimum wage for all the work that is required at this job.XXX,Not happy with the posting that advertised a great rate and was then informed that there were no positions for that rate!!

Everyone was around the same age.  However, the hardest part of the job was getting past the countless managers who we were cold calling into to gain our business and respect.  It was difficult dealing with constant rejection, though that didn't slow me down and learn from my mistakes.XXX,I learned how to manage my schedule much better through their guidance.
