Sometimes it's just the wrong fit. Bit when the boss repeatedly tells you that you suck at your job and that's he's going to fire you as an example (at least 3 times a day) you just leave. Change of management was a bad decision for the company. However for some reason they don't care. But when the boss gives you the worst review you've ever had from any person in the company (before this person was there everybody always said i did great and was improving steadily). This manager said a blind monkey could do my job better than i. Pay increases came in the form of a few cents. Benifits sucked and insurance covered nothing. The best thing was that they matched your 401k contributions. Very little room for growth within the company very little support. They make life very stressful in and outside of work.

This is sadly Mean Girls being brought to life within an organization that currently enjoys the reputation of being Top 3 in the Nation and Best in the West. UCLA Health is physically fragmented and divided with some units being nearly completely cutoff from the organization and left to develop a Lord of the Flies culture. HR is whittled down to almost nothing but Recruitment and has no neutrality or strength to assert itself. Leadership within the management hierarchy has no vision into cutoff units and therefore no ability or mechanisms to improve or prevent gross misconduct by members of its own management. Leadership is too distant and too far upward to be felt or relied upon in times of need by grassroots employees. Executive Leadership needs to take the time to come down from its high level perch and police its own, ensuring that respectable, moral, and positive mentorship is constantly being applied and that synergy and harmony is enforced within and between units. Executive Leadership needs to promote within management that no decision or action should be taken without moral, sound judgement and good cause.

I met with the team and, together, we came up with a strategy for increasing efficiency among the team.

"Mayo Clinic","Technical Specialist",83694,4,4.2,3.8,3.7,4,"Paycom",",Paycom has a boatload of challenges to deal with as it tries to grow into a respectable corporation.  At a high level, the corporate culture is nothing short of toxic and like many other reviewers have called out, you are absolutely expected to ""drink the koolaid.""  A perfect example of this is that I was actually told by a business leader not to discuss market challenges with other managers because they ""don't sanction excuses"" and ""my team can't handle the truth.""  Rather than leadership being confident enough to talk about issues honestly and transparently and actually deal with them head on, they prefer to sweep things under the rug.  If you are lucky, you might get told ""this is a safe environment where you can be honest"" then get blasted when you do tell the truth.  They are not open to other's ideas or new ways of doing things and typically demand people accomplish work via the ""professional insanity"" method (you know...keep doing things the same way and expect different results).  One of many examples I could provide is that I had a strategy meeting scheduled with executive leadership to try to fix an entirely broken compensation system for a certain employee population that was cancelled and rescheduled 12 times.  I eventually had to give up and acknowledge they had no intention of fixing internal problems even though that was the spiel I was given.  This tells you how much they care about their employees.  There is a sickening, fear-based leadership style that pervades all levels and is spear-headed by ownership and most team members at the C-level.

"Mayo Clinic","Statistician",76369,4,4.2,3.8,3.7,4,"Paycom",", internal business units there are a handful of people that can make life miserable for everyone else but apparently this is perfectly acceptable and in some cases encouraged if one is fortunate enough to make ""teacher's pet"" status.  Additionally, backstabbing and tattle-telling is another perfectly acceptable means of jockeying for position in leadership ranks as well.  Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of bright, hard-working, and honest people that work there, but unfortunately this is ruined by a handful that are allowed to act incredibly unprofessionally.  Another challenge has to do with pay practices.  Although they will pay leaders quite well, they simply do not pay competitively for many entry and mid-level roles.  They are rigid around this policy and are just now waking up to the reality they may need to pay something semi-competitive for certain roles that they struggle to fill due to a high volume of rejected offers.  Additionally, they truly believe paying someone in NYC or Silicon Valley the exact same for a role as what they pay in Oklahoma is a winning compensation strategy.  Anyone with national hiring experience knows that is ignorant.  Another callout by several reviewers is that they force employees to post positive company reviews to compensate for negative reviews they receive on multiple sites.  This is 100% true and accurate, particularly in sales and recruiting.  Leadership would argue that they don't hold a gun to anyone's head and force them to do this, but I don't know what else to call it when you are repeatedly pressured to leave a positive review until you get it done.  Paycom has been very fortunate to have a boatload of financial success which they continue to count on moving forward, but when this starts to plateau, they will be faced with a sad reality.  Although C-levels would do their best to convince you they are a ""fully established"" and ""mature"" organization this is far from the truth and they have a lot of growing to do.  Overall, they suffer from a bad case of corporate ""little-man"" syndrome and don't appear to care enough to want to change things.  Many people will read this review and immediately chalk it up to ""sour grapes,"" but every thing stated is factual and could be verified by a slew of other employees if they didn't fear losing their job (the brave ones would validate it anyways).  If given the opportunity to work for them, do yourself a favor and pass.  Perhaps 10-15 years from now (if they are still around and have cleaned house in the leadership ranks), it could be worth a shot.

Much has changed in this job over the last few years making it, in my opinion, not worth the high stress and anxiety that are now a daily struggle for most, if not all, adjusters I've worked with.  The freedom and empowerment that used to define this position are sadly gone for the most part.  In times past one had the freedom to choose Parts and extend rentals if truly necessary.  This has now been replaced with a more demanding robotic approach to estimating and managing of rental that makes the average adjuster extremely frustrated most of the time and feeling that they really cannot meet the needs of the customer.  The administrative red tape and documentation, along with recorded phone conversation (to supposedly grade quality of work) have made the job undoable and unbearable for most.  In the last 4 years much of our local work force has moved on or left (about 25% turnover annually) leaving a workload that is unbearable for the remaining adjusters.  With the exit of veteran adjusters, new inexperienced adjusters fill the vacancies left and they have little or no experience leading to its own problems.  Newer adjusters often feel like failures due to the impossible grading scale and rigidly high expectations leading to continued high turnover that seems unending.  Geico continues to sell claims in a massive way leading to overwork and very poor ""work life balance"".

Broken promises of proper staffing and a future lightening of work are empty and unfulfilled at all times.  This leads to an emptiness and overwhelming feeling of failure that lead to leaving geico for those who don't want to be unhappy every working day.  Upper management seems to be unplugged and disinterested in the plights and struggles of the average adjuster.  Our claims director has an open door policy but has never visited the branches to check on anyone in a real way to get a feel or put a finger on the pulse or work environment of the average adjuster.  Most adjusters would be scared to say anything anyway so the problems continue.  As long as local management is not graded on turnover the problem and unhealthy work environment will continue.  If geico could appreciate truly how much money they could save by simply retaining good people it might be a different story.

Ticketing/e-commerce is now commoditized SAAS and the company's ""strategic"" projects has failed to deliver any differentiation. Both Product and Strategy teams have abandoned the marketplace mission as they struggle to make Eventbrite a destination page for event discovery. Instead the team executes multi-year efforts on refreshing the look and feel of the website to occupy time and without substantial metrics impact. The Engineering team moves at glacial speeds and mostly comes from other events-oriented SAAS companies (read: never worked at pedigree like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc). This breads an engineering culture that lacks real processes or documentation. The ""bench strength"" has never worked on large-scale services at aforementioned firms and thus many of its services/experiences have broken under larger loads. This lack of know-how also creates a fear of touching legacy code, building hack upon hack. Recent acquisitions have built off-shore engineering centers making it even harder to develop.

Very little pay for hardwork, standing on your feet for 8-10 hours. Department change or shift change? Good luck. Despite of my 2 year run, I've asked for a shift change so that i can schedule myself to go back to school. In one ear and out the other. Everything goes by favoritism . In order to be liked by the shipping supervisors , mainly the daytime ones, you have to either play video games they like, watch the same sports as them or simply have the same interests. Very unproffessional. New rules are applied everyday. Also there are different rules for different people , and special privileges for some employees. Im glad i got out of that place. The shipping department should only be a pit stop in your life , unless you really like the workload it comes with.

We have to schedule installs over a week out, the installs are only in the morning since they last for 6+ hours, and the customers can't place the order over the phone, they have to process it online. All of which causes the customer to be less than reasonable a good portion of the time, and the management doesn't really listen to anything we say when we try to give ideas on how to improve, giving me a less than satisfactory feelings about how the company is run. I have learned how to talk to people the right way to avoid misunderstandings and frustration from either side, and I've learned a lot of how companies work internally. The hardest part of my job would have to be when I can't give a customer what they want, which usually ends up in them asking for my supervisor. In that case I have to carefully de-escalate and explain the entire situation to him/her, and if they still want my supervisor I have to flag one down to have him/her talk to the customer personally and explain everything that I just told them. The best part of the job, I'd say, would be when I finally make a sale. In my department that isn't very often, so when it does happen, its a big deal to the dept. My coworkers are a blessing, they help me get through the day sometimes and are some of my very, very good friends.

There is free coffee, free vitamin water, and sometimes free snacks.There is a game room, a swingset, a crying area, a DJ in the elevator, and a giant cat in a spaceship.

The facade has worked really well with job candidates, the press, college interns, trade associations, and philanthropic organizations. Every single action made is purely for a photo opp and a press release. Managers who foster a hostile work environment are paraded around like heroes to distract from the fact that they're actually really horrible people. Doing good work and producing real results doesn't matter. Management respects people who are overly aggressive, rather than kind-hearted, down to earth professionals who are the best at what they do. Across the board, people are paranoid about losing their jobs and feel the need to prove themselves which is also creating a nasty work environment. The negativity is spreading like wildfire and it's sad to say that most of the good people are leaving as soon as they get another job.","UC San Diego",",Research Assistant",NA,NA,NA,NA

Both facilities were good, but there was a time when they had packed too many testers onto the test floor in the Northridge facility. This led to sharing computers, cramped spaces, and sometimes loss of personal belongings, which led to extremely unhappy testers, and a bad work environment. Testers were told to care more about quantity over quality of bugs, which I believe forced the testers to write up anything they could, clogging the database with useless bugs (dupe, by design, NAB, WNF) and angering the developers. Management was then blinded by bug counts, and this allowed a tester with less skill to move up the rankings quicker than a tester who paid attention to detail.","New York Institute of Technology",",Graduate Assistant, School of Management",NA,NA,NA,NA

Of course, the fact that you and many others closed a lot of business for the chosen ones, doesn't count.  You don't count.

The customers are NOT trained on the software because their company will not take the time out to train them. This puts more pressure on the Product support rep to explain to the client how a line calculates when it should already be understood (This is something that should be done in the software itself but it is not). Therefore, a 10 minute call will be last for 30-45 minutes because the product support rep has to explain to the client how the line calculates - this is in addition to the actual problem that the customer called about.  During busy season, the same customers call 4-6 times a day.

The work was wonderful, but the environment was so awful I had to leave. The salaries are much lower in the system as well.  Do not expect to stay market competitive if you stay in the system long. They do not promote equity, despite being a very profitable organization. They claim non-profit but continue to grow and expand, but fail to pay all employees equitably.  I don't respect UPMCs wage practices, but I do feel there are redeeming qualities, like good PTO and insurance.  At the end of the day, I did choose to stay with the system after leaving the grant program. So far I am happy I remained with UPMC, but I remain cautious as well.  If you are choosing a position at UPMC, be careful. Ask a lot of questions. Get to know the manager or leadership as much as possible before hiring.

For experienced sales people, this vertical is micro managed to an extreme which means if you don't fall in line it is difficult to move your career past a call center. To make things more difficult for Staffing AEs there are minimum sizes to the deals which you can close. Your minimums are double what your counterparts on the direct employer side can close. So not only are the clients more difficult to close, your budgets are also twice as limiting as your colleagues. This means deals are more difficult to come by and less commission dollars.

If you expressed your opinion with ideas for improvement- you would later get called into office and be excused of being unhappy with your job duties and be given a performance plan for improvement.  20+ years as a professional RN have I never made to feel as incompetent or questioned why I continued to work for CDPHP. Why- because I believed in the the Company, its values and its members!  I now work for a National Company that truely values it's employees, their multifaceted experience and promotes teamwork as well as work/life balance.  I have never been more happier as a professional nurse to work for a company that appreciates my talents.

Everyone is super supportive and, for the most part, very approachable. It is fairly easy to get face time with management and express your concerns. They are constantly working out better ways to get employee feedback. However, the company has moved slowly in the 12 years that it's been around and has had to play catchup in order to get modern. There's a lot of technical debt and a lot of obvious features that are missing. There was an unusual amount of shifts in management during my time at Meetup. As a result, it was unclear what direction the company was moving in or what the roadmap looked like. That made it frustrating from a product development perspective, especially when everyone feels so invested in this wonderful tool they're helping to create.","CACI International Inc",",Intelligence Operations Analyst",NA,NA,NA,NA

NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Redfin",",Redfin is a technological Company first and foremost and the only folks getting paid decent wages are the Seattle Engineers and Executives.  Agents are paid based on reviews and sometimes regardless of how hard you work, you're not compensated regardless of the hard work you did.  They claim paid benefits and dues, however your base salary is so menial along with bonus structure, you indeed are paying for all of those benefits they claim to offer.  If you are a RE Agent and want unlimited earning potential, don't work at this place.  If you're a brand new Agent with no experience, Redfin is a great place to start because they'll provide enough leads to keep you stressed out and under water.  You will be expected to close a minimum of 3 deals per month, so forget any kind of work life balance.  If you attempt to take a day off to decompress, you will be scolded and told you're not a team player.  Also, given your compensation is tied to a review by the customer, you better be prepared to miss out on quiet time, family time, or even the birth of your children, because rest assure some consumer will claim in a review that you didn't respond to them in a timely manner and your already menial bonus will be cut further.  The Average bonus after taxes is $1,000.00 and your base salary will be $10,000.00 so you do the math.  A traditional Agent will be paid thousands in commissions, paid right away, and paid regardless of what the consumer thinks.

Everyone who works for Redfin has “drank the Kool-Aid” and become a Redfinian and that included me. I worked for Redfin for 2 years as an Associate Agent, one of their contracted positions. I barely made enough to survive, but hung in there because I thought they would promote me to one of their full time W-2 Agent positions, which is what their ""Market Managers"" led me to believe. Regardless of what I was told about the position when I was hired, it was part time income at best. I never got promoted despite receiving consistent 10s on their Redfin customer satisfaction reviews and my tenured experienced as a successful real estate agent. Redfin is a clickish company managed by nerds with marginal people skills. They preach inclusion and transparency, but they do not practice the mantra with their own employees. The deal writing salaried agents do well income-wise and do get great benefits, but they pay dearly for them in the way of slave labor. They are required to be on-call 24/7, have a huge volume of clients to handle and might as well be working for minimum wage in comparison to the work hours logged.

As publicly traded company they are supposed to make you aware of whistleblower laws but they carefully keep that info away from their employees because the stores are not run properly and as long as the bottom line says $$ they do not investigate impropriety. Also in the event manage changes during your tenure here be careful because if that manager didnt hire you, your the first to go.

When I first started, thank you and appreciation for going above and beyond was given always however in the last few years it is now expected that you not only carry the work load of yourself but also the other employees. This is a company that has grown way too fast too soon and they don't have any idea on how to keep their tenured employees anymore so they are losing them at an alarming rate. There are certain people in key leadership that don't value their employees and as a result they are losing multiple departments full of people.

We serve about 200-500 people throughout the day so the people who work behind the scenes pull together and make sure they are doing the best they can to make everyone satisfied with their dining experience. The people in the kitchen are putting together trays and dishes non-stop, the servers are responsible for bringing out the food, and the utility personnel are responsible for managing dishes. During these activities management is running around making sure that all the staff are alright and also checks in with all the guests seeing that they are satisfied with their meal. Before we set up these rooms we are able to eat lunch or dinner for free. The only drawback is that sometimes the food is cold or not fully cooked, but for really major events we are served the best food.

My typical day was the same as most sales reps, I called on doctors, a few of the progressive doctors had heard about Dexcom and they were interested and excited. Most doctors had no idea what Dexcom was. I also taught Diabetes classes, started new patients on their Dexcom and provided education to health care providers. Both management and my co-workers were great, no complaints. The hardest part of the job was the same challenge most people have. We need more hours in the day. Which also leads me to my most enjoyable part of the job. I needed more hours in the day because I had the great product in my bag that was saving lives and doctors needed to know about it now! They needed to understand it and prescribe it for every type 1 patient out there. I would hear stories of specific patient's lives that were saved by using their Dexcom, that was definitely the most enjoyable part of my job.

They discouraged you from grabbing a drink a water if not on your break. The biggest issue is work/life balance, if your sick, child is sick, you got a flat tire, family emergency, anything unplanned that causes you to be late or needing the day off you get a point.

If you can't be flexible you will remain entry level leadership.

One manager will tell you its all based off performance, another says its the extra work you put into it, and then they change your teams so much it's impossible at times to remain a high performing team.

I constantly heard people complaining about their pay. Raises and promotions were very rare. There is absolutely no growth at this company which is why so many people, even people in higher positions, moved on to bigger and better things. I lost count of how many people quit while I was working there and everyone always talked about how they were searching for new jobs and how they couldn't wait to leave Encore.
