"The Washington Post","the most enjoyable part of the job is the broad subject matter. a typical day at work can include a variety of issue areas, and employees have a lot of opportunity"
"The Washington Post",",Couriers grossly under paid. 10 cents for daily washingtion post is outrageous. 35 cents for the Sunday paper. And they keep your tips.  Again work for Uber or Lyft you make more money hands down.  If you set it up right you make enough to quit your regular job. Don't work here not worth it.  My paper count was constantly off, I did not have enough newspapers to complete my route. Which cause me burn more fuel and waste more time.  They charge you 5.00 for complaints. Which is more than you make per paper.  I'm  so sorry I every work for this company as a independent contractor."
"The Washington Post",",It honored to work with this company. Friendly and helpful environment."
"The Washington Post",",Team lead, Ba, developer and UAT team are realy helpfull and professional."
"The Washington Post",",I learned alot from here."
"The Washington Post",",A typical work day was running the press line to produce newspaper, that were delivered to the DMV areas.  The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I put in a 100% effort to produce the final product"
"The Washington Post",",As a paper route carrier it was a great part time job to have while having a full time job. Good compensation with flexible hours."
"The Washington Post",",I work there for 25 years always have had a fun and friendly atmosphere, people willing to help, management style was helpful in developing and educating the junior staff."

"The Washington Post",",Typical day at work I collect the money for a distributor from all the stores in the downtown area"
"The Washington Post",",The most enjoyable part of work if I work at my own pace"
"The Washington Post",",Typical day at work I delivered papers to the door and put the put the Washington Post papers in the Washington Times paper inside the machine"
"The Washington Post",",This place is very flexible in terms of time & work, so you can maintain the balance in your life, only complaint is about the compensation. But it is up to you, you might get a boost in your career after here for a while."
"The Washington Post",",My job is making sure people stat their day with a smile and a paper. Some even bring me snacks,coffee, things to read and I love playing with the little ones as they are on their way to school. My co-worker and I work together on the job and get the job done from 6am-10am. By me passing the paper out a lot of people ask me about the current events, sports and sales that are going on and also where's a good place to eat or a great movie or free show's for the weekend"
"The Washington Post",",Working for the Washington Post was a great experience. I was basically my own boss. I like the job because I had certain responsibilities and no one really over me all day. I performed my work as asked and completed what I needed to do on time. I was also a warehouse manager and I distributed bundles on the weekend to the carriers and locked up when they left. Everyone's trust in me felt good and my dedication to my job was appreciated."
"The Washington Post",",Very good environment to work at, the management is so amazing. All team members are friendly.Indeed, I learnt so many things!!"
"The Washington Post",",I started at the Post having worshiped the pape for years. I was hired to work in the advocacy/political advertising department. There was nearly 0 training and on boarding, even a ""boot camp"" was scant on actual direction. The person who was supposed to train me was unable to focus and all I heard from the rest of the department was that she was a walking disaster. "
"The Washington Post",",After being there for less than a month, both of the senior sales reps for advocacy left and no one knew what they were doing. There was contention between the sales planning team and marketing and it was a hot mess. People would email you all night and over New Years week everyone went out of town and there was no one to ask questions of as a new employee. They abuse young workers in a fashion similar to how law firms treat new hires. Other than it being the Washington Post there were no possitives about this job. It was like dating a hot guy and being abused, but being like ""well he's hot""."
"The Washington Post",",job was great at first but it took its toll on you working 60-80 hours a week with very little sleep. it was great being my own boss and driving to deliver the newspapers in a peaceful atmosphere. It was great meeting new people as our area tripled."
"The Washington Post",",Working as a journalist was thrilling, fun, and rewarding. But the business model is broken and the industry is dying."
"The Washington Post",",Since the mid-2000s, the newspaper has undergone a series of buyouts, in which hundreds of the Post's most experienced writers and editors left. The paper has pushed out dozens more. The advent of the internet, which undercut the Post's advertising revenue, and some short-sighted business decisions are to blame."
"The Washington Post",",i was young when i was working here don't remember much of it a lot of cleaning i only made 15 dollars a day but i was 16 so i thought i was rich."

"The Washington Post",",Good Digital Experience. Learned a lot about the digital landscape and got to work with a lot of top clients. Ran marketing campaigns from start to finish."
"The Washington Post",",Loved working there. Great managers and co-workers. I added new skills to my resume, such as pre-flighting electronic files. The hardest part of the job was having to leave it via a lay-off. I would still work there if I could."
"The Washington Post",",I had to get up at 2 AM go to Waldorf and pick up my newspapers. I had to go over my list of changes and get them in order to the way I deliver my papers.Then I go deliver my papers. It didn't matter how many papers you had to deliver you had to be done by 6 AM the same morning. Sunday was the hardest day of the week because you had almost twice as many papers then you had thru the week. You still needed to be done by 7 AM the same morning"
"Squarespace","I have the freedom to be creative, and the opportunity to properly execute my ideas. I have all the latest gear, so I can focus on doing what I do best. I don't have to worry about what I'm going to eat, it's catered every day, it's delicious, and my dietary needs are cared for. There's literally nothing stopping me from achieving my goals, except for myself. Plus, there's always a fresh batch of premium coffee in the kitchen."

"Squarespace",",Overall I loved working at Squarespace. Great people,and a fun work environment.  Friendly people from coworkers to management.  Management was very transparent with staff. Plus - catered lunches! "
"Squarespace",",Needing to be flexible with your schedule is needed - lost of OT/EH was required of all team members.  This includes working from home, at times. "
"Squarespace",",It is possible the environment has changed a lot over the past year, for the negative.  But my time there was very positive."
"Squarespace",",A collaborator's dream, it's easy to take the initiative to add features or improve the product, easy to find collaborators, and easy to get support and guidance from management. My favorite place to work so far."

"Squarespace",",The tools are top of the line, with each employee given free reign to assemble a workstation to suit their needs and preferred set up. The software is cutting edge; if there's new software that will make our product better, try it out! The idea is to make the best things for our customers, without letting anything get in the way."
"Squarespace",",This is a company that does require you to be self-motivated. If you want to learn to do something, ask around and someone will be able to help you. But if you're the type of person that prefers to have work assigned to you throughout the day, this might not be the best fit."
"Squarespace",",Everyone is smart and interesting. The environment is laid back and fun. Useless people don't tend to stick around long, but everyone else does. There are plenty of serious engineering challenges and none of the ego and nonsense of the bigger tech companies."

"Amedisys","Not a bad place to work, but try too hard to make each office a cookie cutter operation.  No variances allowed for local needs."
"Amedisys",",I would reapply for the right job with ok benefits and good work enviroment .My boss was great to work with and very helpful"
"Amedisys",",I enjoyed working at Amedisys. The coworkers are great. Management changes frequently which is always frustrating. The upper management works hard and tries to be fair most of the time."
"Amedisys",",Company is forward looking and generally aggressive in the community in terms of marketing services.  It used Technology to its advantage"
"Amedisys",",I was hired into role that I never did from day one. The old bait and switch routine. Then on top of that all the branch supervisors left and along comes some big wigs having the nerve to write me up for occurrences the leaving administration did not do? Absolutely absurd. I can't recommend this place and let's not forget the tons and tons of charting."
"Amedisys",",Mostly pleasant place to work. At first the management staff was very nice and pleasant to work with. Within a few months, everything changed, unfortunately not to the better. Staff was frustrated due to lack of organization. It was hard to be there and do a good job when you don't have good management."
"Amedisys",",I really enjoyed working for amedisys. It was a great company to work for but i was having to drive 125 miles a day so it was to much gas and to much wear and tear on my vehicle"
"Amedisys",",Performed psychiatric assessments on geriatric patients in their homes or places of residence due to multiple losses and difficulty for the caregiver to manage due to a change in their behavior.  Medication were added, changed or dosages adjudged by the physician and I monitored weekly for any changes in behavior or side effects as well as teaching the patient and caregiver in regards to disease process.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the contact with the patient's and their families.  I loved the job itself, the management was great, the workplace culture was good, there was a continuing education program.  The hardest part of the job was the paperwork/documentation."
"Amedisys",",Worked with Case Managers to facilitate patient care. "
"Amedisys",",Learned a lot about the life cycle and holistic care for the dying patient and their families."
"Amedisys",",I hate it.  Haven't been here long and I am leaving.  Lots of things happening that make no sense, everyone confused and stressed out. No director.   Amedisys is bad place to work."
"Amedisys",",No work life balance, no case acuity balance. 6 staff left in the first 3 months I was there. Voicing safety concerns results in passive aggressive treatment from senior staff."
"Amedisys",",Amedisys is a very forward thinking Home Health company that has grown and undergone many changes in upper management in the past few years.  As all home health companies, Medicare and other government agencies required compliance with a lot of regulations and constant change is the norm.  I worked with a large number of very gifted and productive clinicians and other staff."
"Amedisys",",Wonderful staff and management! Could not ask for a better work environment. Have worked here for over 2 years and will continue to stay PRN even if I leave for another job opportunity!"
"Amedisys",",just know that you are under 24/7 watch from the local office manager (who is not your boss, but will treat you as if you are)."
"Amedisys",",your local manager (C.M.) can not be trusted unless you are a thin young blonde thing...in which case you are good to do what ever you want."
"Amedisys",",overall not a bad place to work . hours are good and office staff is friendly and understanding . a family oriented office"
"Amedisys",",Worked in management and it was a good learning experience.  Provided with a lot of training and support."
"Amedisys",",Difficult training positions for home health staff with limited resources.  Management was lean in this company."
"Amedisys",",good place to work they had just got going in springfield and had not built a solid foundation yet they seem to be good now. i have friends working for them and really enjoy the company."
"Amedisys",",This position required visiting patients in their homes and then writing the assessments and orders on the computer at home in the evening.It required and took over my whoe life."
"Amedisys",",This company is the worst company to work for. Overworked,understaffed,  terrible pay and very unprofessional. Supervisors untrained and of no assistance. Company also didn't pay last couples days of work and Mileage. Beware."
"Amedisys",",When I first started at Amedisys I loved my job. It was patient focused and there seemed to be good employee morale. After 6-8 months there things changed drastically. Morale dropped. The office seemed to focus only on numbers, dollars, and scores. Patient care seemed to be of less importance."
"Amedisys",",Enjoyed working. Paid vacations, great benefit package.office staff very supportive.  Full time work. Can work around private life. Overtime is approved. Fast growing company in Yuma. Field staff charting is on tablets. Streamlined charting."
"Spiceworks","You will work with a lot of very smart people, who enjoy taking ownership of their work and who aren't very involved in the politics you find most places that work. The founders are 1 in a million, and I can't stress this enough. THey're extremely transparent, understanding and just down to earth people. You will not regret working here UNLESS you don't enjoy being challenged, growth, and are not a ""go getter"""
"Spiceworks",",Easily the best company I've worked for. Interesting work, great co-workers, and a management team that knows what they're doing."
"Spiceworks",",Perks are great, we have on-site CrossFit and yoga classes and a 24-hour gym a few hundred yards away. There's a well-stocked kitchen with fresh organic fruit...I rarely need to go out to lunch."
"Spiceworks",",I'd work here without the perks, though. What's most important to me in a job are the work itself, the people I work with, and my faith in management. I love my work and have a great team."
"Spiceworks",",The management team is extremely focused on the business...they're not spending time making angel investments or trying to make a name for themselves. This is also the most open management I've seen at any company...we get together as a company every Friday to have a few beers and go over new developments, and I walk out knowing our financial condition, what's working, what isn't, and where we're headed."
"Spiceworks",",I'm also proud to say I've never heard the word ""pivot"" spoken in a meeting here."
"JPMorgan Chase","Client based, focused on clients goals, active and always trying to improve on recommendations . Indulge in more safety and good atmosphere to work and learn."

"JPMorgan Chase",",unfair ending closing the company not letting workers"
"JPMorgan Chase",",who had been with the company many many years then"
"JPMorgan Chase",",to shut down no warning very unfair."
"JPMorgan Chase",",What to say? Plenty of room to grow but don't get lost among your peers especially if you report to a manager that is out of state. Make your voice heard frequently."

"JPMorgan Chase",", "

"JPMorgan Chase",",JP Morgan Chase is an excellent place to work. Teamwork is highly valued, and it is the type of environment where peers take the time to teach you. You interact with different people every day, and you eventually get to know your customers creating a real community environment."
"JPMorgan Chase",",This is a Great Company to work for, great people and staff, friendly and outgoing and always willing to help when others are in need."
"JPMorgan Chase",",Wonderful company to work with. They do not pay you on your performance or attitude, only paid by hours. No matter how horrible or wonderful are you."

"JPMorgan Chase",",I learned a lot being a Private Client Partner and loved coaching the other bankers on how to refer and increase sales opportunities.  I also liked the flexibility of being able to go to clients and meet with them at their place of business and traveling to other branches."
"JPMorgan Chase",",•	Develop and grow business portfolio for the branch"
"JPMorgan Chase",",•	Assist existing Business clients and deepen relationships"

"FactSet Research Systems","Fact set  is one of the best places to work for Moms. The culture and benefits are awesome. My only issue is spending so much time commuting for work."
"FactSet Research Systems",",I am happy that I have worked with Factset Research Systems for over 27 months. It is my first job and got many things to learn. It is a best company to start our career with."
"FactSet Research Systems",",FactSet is a great place to work. My supervisor was very helpful and encouraging. The environment is great. There are no closed off offices, everyone is surrounded by other people. The office kitchen always has snacks and refreshments."
"FactSet Research Systems",",Good place for just after school settlement. The outdated technology in some groups make it dangerous to stick for a long time. Make a leap in 2-3 years."
"FactSet Research Systems",",FactSet is a great place to start your career if you want to get into finance but you're not sure where to start. Excellent exposure to industry professionals."
"FactSet Research Systems",",Consultant role is more of a technology position than finance. You will be working with clients to help with research/problem solving from a technology standpoint and not from a strategic finance position."
"FactSet Research Systems",",I worked at FactSet for 15+ years.  Was fiercely loyal, deflected competitors overtures for years. I worked up through several positions but not management, and did fairly well. "
"FactSet Research Systems",",One Friday this March, I was let go. I was told it was a reevaluation of company priorities,  future investment,  etc.  Reality was it was just cost cutting. I had grown too old and expensive,  and recent process improvements I had made to my product line basically ""improved"" myself out of a job.   "
"FactSet Research Systems",",I could have easily moved to another position.  When I questioned the reason for termination, noting the above, the director of product development actually sat there with a cocky grin on his face and said no can do.   Squirming to keep from wetting himself,  the coward jumped up and left me with the HR rep to finish it off.  No ""I'm sorry, this is hard in me as well"" or any of that nonsense.  "
"FactSet Research Systems",",I blame myself for being so loyal to a company for so long and not moving on sooner.  I had been so good at my job that I allowed myself to get pigeonholed into such a narrow role that I'm finding it almost impossible to convert into a new position. "
"FactSet Research Systems",",So in some regards, when I lose my house and my family is evicted,  I will place the blame on FactSet.  But on the flip side,  this experience has taught me to never be that loyal to another firm again.  I will only be focused on the job at hand, and will be constantly looking for that next position. "
"FactSet Research Systems",",I would strongly recommend anyone considering a non-engineering role at FactSet look elsewhere and be rewarded for your efforts."
"FactSet Research Systems",",fun and young environment good management. i enjoy.. free drinks. management is nice and co workers are easy to get along with"
"FactSet Research Systems",",I liked the technical opportunities that were presented to me.  However, management did not have much of a presence.  There was no clear direction in regards to project management, which lent itself to ambiguity and inefficiency."
"FactSet Research Systems",",People is expected to work 60-70 hours a week even though the company only pays 40 hours per week. Managers utilizes a micro-managing and fault-finding approach. Oncall rotation is not a real ""On call."" This is a poor excuse to make the engineers execute changes during the weekend and after hours during the week. Your weekend work is equal to 16-20 extra hours at least. Company does not pay overtime. Employees are not recognized for their extra efforts instead, they are treated as objects that belongs to them, therefore, you have to do what I want you to do.  There are not words to express the bullying approach used by managers to their employees."
"FactSet Research Systems",",Consulting for FactSet Research Systems was my first job out of college and was the perfect gateway into the working world.  The company entrusted me with responsibility from day one and taught me how to be a working professional.  They provided me with growth opportunities and a great work life balance."
"FactSet Research Systems",",My true passion was to become an investment professional and the knowledge I gained from working at FactSet opened the door for me to become one."
"FactSet Research Systems",",Consulting role is merely customer-service and troubleshooting, with little or no true consultative, strategic work whatsoever.  Additionally, organizational claims to be 'flat' and entrepreneurial, yet management is not clear about professional development or expectations whilst there is virtually no autonomous work that outside of what you're micromanaged on."
"FactSet Research Systems",",Overall good place to work. You are given interesting and ever-changing projects."
"FactSet Research Systems",",The New York City office is in a good location and benefits are comparable to the industry standard!"
"FactSet Research Systems",",I liked the company, but unless you were a software engineer, you did not get all the great perks FactSet has to offer. Longer mandatory hours, no overtime pay, terrible management. Good coworkers but most leave, its a starter job, not something long term."
"FactSet Research Systems",",great first job, great training and benefits"
"FactSet Research Systems",",you get to travel and learn the business"
"FactSet Research Systems",",Excellent Place to Work."
"FactSet Research Systems",",Learnt SQL Server Administration and Windows Administration."

"FactSet Research Systems",",Good health insurance."
"FactSet Research Systems",",Great benefits and free lunch coupled with a good opportunity to network with financial experts in the field. "
"FactSet Research Systems",",Consultants aren't compensated for the amount of work required, and are understaffed. There is a high turnover and employees are expected to pick up the slack without any assistance from management."
"FactSet Research Systems",",Mid level managers seem disconnected and are more preoccupied with their personal lives often doing little to help their subordinates."
"FactSet Research Systems",",After having done lot's of code for myself during my PhD, I learned at Factset how to be part of a software engineer team. We had strict coding style, code review, shared library between project. "
"FactSet Research Systems",",Typical day was lot's of coding from 9am to 7pm. Atmosphere was not so good because interesting projects were occasional and everybody was fighting to be on it."
"FactSet Research Systems",",FactSet was a face paced environment that challenged it's employees to learn something new every day and work hard at fulfilling their job requirements."
"FactSet Research Systems",",Too much in the technology world. Took as a short term role for experience."
"FactSet Research Systems",",A great working environment with collaborative culture.  Good work life balance.  Creative environment that embraces self starters."
"GE Corporate","Responsible for supervising mail room staff, maintenance staff, kitchen staff. Responsible for purchasing supplies and equipment. Responsible for company's auto fleet. Through associates distribute supplies to clerical and managers. Responsible to prepare for shows materials."

"GE Corporate",",A typical work day would touch base with shift manager. Follow up with going over product changeovers, Issues with equipment down time, ect.   The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team."
"GE Corporate",",The hardest part was to keep production running when parts where not available for repairs."
"GE Corporate",",It was a job that fit for me at the time. Hardest part was they did not have a fulfilling budget to allow maintaining operating equipment properly.  They would just let things run until they failed."
"GE Corporate",",This was a straight technical writing position for me. It did allow for me work in a live test environment, which was very interesting. However I felt it offered little outside of that environment."
"GE Corporate",",this was many entry level jobs that consisted of clerical and administrative duties. Great benefits, and the company had tuition reimbursement."
"GE Corporate",",I worked on campus for 9 years as a contractor. I was able to have flexibility to work from home a few days a week. The campus work environment is great with cafeteria and walking track. Fitness center onsite if you want to pay to join."
"GE Corporate",",Worked for GE for 20 years. Great people to work with. Just upper management is very sneaky , they will cut your throat to get their bonus."
"GE Corporate",",Overall, I like to work there. The envionment is friendly, well managed. However, there are some places need to be improved as well."
"GE Corporate",",GE is a company where there are opportunities to advance and grow.  It is so large that you can talk to some people who love it and others who hate it.  It is important to get into a business or technology area where your expertise is valued.  Like most large companies, management decisions are made 90 days at a time (end of quarter) with very little future planning.  This can become frustrating if you let it.  Most of us have learned to live with it and fight another quarter."
"GE Corporate",",I have been recently laid off with 30 other employees. I am sorry to go. I DO blame management for their questionable decisions that led to this, especialy since my group was doing better than forcast. Oh well. Life goes on."
"GE Corporate",",Most new employees will start in assembly, you can move around after you gain a little seniority. Fabrication was a good place to work."
"GE Corporate",",Being tied to an assembly line was the most difficult although there were some people that prefered that. To each their own. Typical factory, hot in the summer, cold in the winter. Seniority determines ability to advance."
"GE Corporate",",A typical day at General Electric.  I was responsible for different labor intense work. Checking the out going and in coming products that GE shipped to and from different manufacturers."
"GE Corporate",",Several Safety issues needed to be address and they didn't seem to want to hire me on full time. Fork lifts drove to fast and didn't always stop at appropriate stop signs."
"GE Corporate",",Chance to work on multiple assignments if you showcase interest. Flexibility in working unless your work doesn't roadblock anyone. New ideas are pouring in analytic field."
"GE Corporate",",GE is going through major changes for the better. Lots of new people and leadership joining the team. Some good, but some in key senior roles are truly disgusting and destroying morale. I'm leaving the people, not the business."
"GE Corporate",",I  worked their temporary through a temp and would like perhaps to go back if I could  I enjoyed the company and the benefits if I could have  more than the years I worked thier"
"GE Corporate",",Great place to learn and grow. Must be willing to put in time and effort. Average to below average compensation (for amount of hours worked). Fast paced culture"
"GE Corporate",",this was a work from home assignment, but taking call after call with little to no time in between calls. The management was always breathing down your neck."
"CGI Group","This job is a good job to gain experience but there is not much room for advancement.  The hours and days are great.  Management is okay not great."
"CGI Group",",CGI Federal is a diverse contracting company that  provides different opportunities for its employees under different federal agencies. Being a contractor as an Administrative Assistant for Department of Justice was a great experience. I have learned the aspects of providing mediation and facilitation between both the public community and the government. I had the pleasure of working with professional and intelligent individuals who have motivated  me to go back to school and pursue my goals of obtaining my degree. The most enjoyable part of the job was the different challenges and accomplishing them. The hardest part of the job is the communication between regions due to the different time zones. Overall, I have gained the experience of working with different federal agencies."
"CGI Group",",CGI is an awesome company. The pay and benefits were amazing but the management was not trustworthy and it made the environment difficult to work in."
"CGI Group",",great place to work for, management is very friendly and supportive. they go above and beyond to help. Best place to work"

"CGI Group",",Cons:"
"CGI Group",",I don't have any at the moment maybe a faster way to move up the ladder."
"CGI Group",",Good place to work. No breaks. Learned to be on time for work and to work alone or as a team. Management was always helpful."
"CGI Group",",This is a horrible place to work for. Your a contractor and will always be reminded and the government employees and administration hazes the contractors, CGI management is incompetent and will not stand up for you. The company does not have an existing contract with the government and they are on a bridge meaning the company gives in to the government's every demand"
"CGI Group",",I enjoyed working with CGI and the people. There was room for advancement and they always tried to prepare you for corporate American being that we did things different overseas."
"CGI Group",",While CGI is a great company to work for with great people and great opportunities, there is a lack of communication throughout the company. "
"CGI Group",",I enjoy the networking that the company has to offer, and they provide tools to help you learn more about any technological field you set your mind to. "
"CGI Group",",However, the opportunity for growth/advancement is a joke. "
"CGI Group",",Under-qualified people get promoted, so in turn they are not much of a team player being that they do not understand a lot of process and procedures that the rest of the team knows. "
"CGI Group",",I've been to other CGI locations that have more involved members working on projects, but sadly that is not the experience I've had. "
"CGI Group",",The opportunity for overtime is great, however at times you can get taken advantage of your overall flexibility. "
"CGI Group",",CGI is an OK place to work. I just wish that there was more opportunity for growth."
"CGI Group",",Been at the company for 10 years. Good work place culture. There is always room to advance. The benefits are excellent. We get yearly bonuses. Everyone in the HR dept is always friendly."
"CGI Group",",CGI is a slow company, does not believe in training or learning opportunities."
"CGI Group",",CGI provided ample PTO while I was there. Compensation was not very competitive and the work was not forward looking or exciting."
"CGI Group",",Benefits were not that great."
"CGI Group",",Not a great place to begin a career in technology."
"CGI Group",",Overall a nice company to work and advance in IT career beginners and medium level programmers"

"CGI Group",",Report the status of documents submitted for authentication to customers calling the status request line."
"CGI Group",",CGI is a good company to work for, they have good benifits and compensation, promotable within, a lot of activities and volunteer with in the company."
"CGI Group",",No employee loyalty, dysfunctional management and work environment, poor management, little commitment to  career training and advancement.  Management provides little to none in terms on mentoring and it is a extremely political environment.  Many egos get in the way of being considered a High Performance organization.   The HQ organization in Montreal is committed to the company growth and employee retention but it doesn't flow down the subsidiaries."
"CGI Group",",I was employed by CGI for 25 years.  It was a good company to work for with good benefits.  The health insurance leaves a lot to be desired, however all the other benefits are good."
"CGI Group",",The department that I worked in was a diverse group of people doing various jobs, such as print operators, insert operators, clerks and warehouse workers."
"CGI Group",",One of the offerings is the employee Social Club where a member decides if they would like to participate. Participants have a deduction taken from their pay each pay date.  The company matches the deduction which is twice what the member puts in.  This money is used to run fun activities.  Our department enjoyed several outings, apple picking for the families, seafood buffets and several other eating activities."
"CGI Group",",Good company to work for.  Consulting firm job security not the best. Stay busy servicing clients. Learn all facets of oil & gas accounting. Good management and co-workers.  A team environment."
"Koch Minerals","I loved the culture of Koch Minerals.  People got to know one another and cheered for the advancements.  Projects were pushed if asked and exposure to new things.  Supervisor there to help you grow in your career"
"Koch Minerals",",Must understand that you are just a number and that the organization can move in a different direction at anytime without your commitment"
"Bank Of America","people who does not have good skills or very bad working habits get the promotion because they know the management, great company benefits"
"Bank Of America",",More team building training is needed. My experience with job was long but beneficial.  I received great training which brought me to where I am now."
"Bank Of America",",difficult to work in an environment where theres only 2 tellers with 30 people in line.  Company did offer good benefits.  Bonuses were paid out but were at management discretion to be paid out."
"Bank Of America",",my daily activities was having meetings and verifying on the bag end jobbs. usually i look into my backup and recover files if any trouble occures."
"Bank Of America",",Great company when it was just Merrill Lynch. All down hill ever since BofA. Advancement & job opportunities are still all about who you know...performance plays minimal role."
"Bank Of America",",I started at entry level pay but the pay increase was steady. Many incentives for employees, good medical benefits, vacation, sick pay time, pay tuition, bonus, flexible work schedule but long hours during deadlines. Promote within, professional and stable job."
"Bank Of America",",Grew tremendously in my personal development.  I had the opportunity to see the transition from Continental Bank to Bank of America.  Learning from a great management team, as I was promoted from a secretary to a Lock Box Manager.  As a younger career oriented professional, the culture allowed me develop into a mature business professional."
"Bank Of America",",Unfortunately, this company didn't present the Work Life Balance they stated they had. My mother was having extreme medical issues, scariest time of my life, this employer wasn't willing to assist in presenting solutions."
"Bank Of America",",Working for bank of america was a decent job for when I was 19 years old. They paid well at the time and I enjoyed my experience there for the most part. I worked there during the economy crisis and being so it became almost cut throat. The pressures of making sales goals became a large amount of stress in my life. They threatened to take away bonuses and even fire employees for not making sales of bank accounts. I have never been a sales person so maybe the banking industry just isn't my setting. Maybe for someone else that is a good work environment. Until then I enjoyed my job there, but quickly after things changed I resigned."
"Bank Of America",",Great company to work for.  Pay is competitive however on the lower side of the scale.This may be due to the size of the company and the stability if offers its associates."
"Bank Of America",",I loved working at Bank of America.  The company was dynamic and invigorating, and would always push you to better yourself.  The people there were great.  It became like a second family."
"Bank Of America",",Can't say enough good about the teammates I worked with. Job was challenging, but rewarding.  It was not easy to maintain a sustainable work life balance."
"Bank Of America",",I worked at Bank of America as a contractor and it was not a good experience. I was there for one year and worked in four different departments and they still terminated my contract and until this day I still do not know why. Honestly I feel like they used me. They were hiring other contractors after me and one of them were hired after being there for a little less than two months. That really made me mad. I would have loved to become a permanent employee but I guess it wasn't meant to be. This was my first banking/corporate job and I have learned that it's not what you know its who you know."
"Bank Of America",",My time at BOA  was a learning experience. I began as a personal banker. And was given hands on learning more about the banking world."
"Bank Of America",",Bank of America has one of the best benefits in the country, including 401K. Great company culture who believes in creating a friendly, cohesive, team-oriented environment. A lot of my closest friends are my friends from work when I worked at BofA. The downside to BofA is that they downsized a lot over the years and you never know if you're going to be transferred to another department or laid off due to downsizing."
"Bank Of America",",Bank of America is a great company to work for. It is great for career growth and has many different branches of business that you can choose from to broaden your career."
"Bank Of America",",Stressful environment, demanding managers, failure to show appreciation, micro manage, low pay, workload is too much for one person. Benefits were the only plus for this company- including a 4 month maternity leave."
"Bank Of America",",It was great "

"Bank Of America",",I loved working for Bank of America. I just don't like the idea that they lay us off the people here in America and send our jobs to India and leave us stuck out. That sucks!!!!"
"Bank Of America",",It is a Big bank with Routine work, not exciting and challenging. And the job is not that stable too.The salary is not good and not much bonus."
"KPMG","fast paced firm -ok place to work -but not enough room for growth."
"KPMG",",It all depends on your team and the type of projects they get. It could be an amazing place to be at. I loved the team and peoplearound me, very professional and knowledgable."
"KPMG",",It is after all public accounting, billable hours is the constant call.  Work life balance is almost non-existent, it is a resume builder and most folks know that."
"KPMG",",Great place to work and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and project driven with a great Security Endpoint Team"
"KPMG",",very political and conservative, all depends on who you work for - beware of insecure people...worst out of four Big 4; however, there are some good pockets in the organization but overall like working for government without benefits"
"KPMG",",The history of the United States is what happened in the past in the United States, a country in North America. Native Americans have lived there for thousands of years, long before Europeans went there."
"KPMG",",In general great company. It all depends on manager and group you work. The capacity of the office at 130-140% load... Expect cubical sharing and work from home."
"KPMG",",KPMG is a world wide Tax/Audit/Accounting firm. Fast paced, and at times, highly stressful position as I reviewed and tracked all federal tax returns being submitted to clients. The position offered me an opportunity to see and be a part of a large team and have intimate knowledge of working for big business."
"KPMG",",This is a very solid company to work for. A big 4 form that I wish I would've stayed at instead of leaving for more money. If you get in, you're in for life."
"KPMG",",The hardest part of the testing is to look at the Software development part. I've enjoyed working with Selenium IDE, Web Driver. Prepared for various UAT Plans based on Business requirements."
"KPMG",",When I started I was happy with mgmt and the projects. About 2 years in, I became frustrated with the mgmt, the project and the politics."
"KPMG",",Long working hours and lots of traveling depending on what function you're in and the kind of work you are doing. This is especially true during busy season. However, this is typical of all of the Big 4."
"KPMG",",I enjoyed my work.  Participated in daily SCRUM meeting and finished all assignments on time.  There could have been a stronger sense of Team, but overall, I enjoyed it."
"KPMG",",Worked at this firm over 12 years ago. Job was made accessable to work from home if needed a day a week. Good environment, with a team atmosphere.  Overall above average to work for."
"KPMG",",Great experience and challenging job. I enjoyed my experience and the people I met. A lot of networking for future opportunities."
"KPMG",",Kpmg is a wonderful organization with a lot of room for growth and development. They do a great job training and making sure their employees have every opportunity to build a career."
"KPMG",",with the right training there is a lot of opportunities to help many industries on the IT world. they always need the consultant to smooth the transition of new systems and new software."
"KPMG",",Great learning experience.  Able to discuss problems and solutions with the client.  Have the ability to learn a lot of different areas within a company performing annual audits."
"KPMG",",You will learn a lot in the big 4 especially about various industries. There is opportunity for travel and growing your network. Work-life balance is just a company slogan it does not exist at all, and it will not get better throughout your career."
"KPMG",",Hardworking, success oriented environment. "
"KPMG",",Learned a lot about Microsoft Excel as well as the company's chosen software. "
"KPMG",",Coworkers were extremely helpful."

By leveraging several partner networks, the service is validated to run with Predix Machine and the Predix cloud and is offered worldwide. Now you can rapidly connect your existing infrastructure and any new deployments to the cloud for managing assets and optimizing operations."
"Reed Elsevier",",Elsevier is so vast, the actual work experience depends largely on the division. By and large, the employees and coworkers are great, intelligent hard workers. Much of the work is very intellectually stimulating. But workloads are highly variable depending on the position, some of which require many extra hours, salary is average to poor, and the benefits, with the exception of retirement (which is decent), are sub-par, particularly insurance, and are periodically down-graded to save the company money. Inconsistent work from home/remote and other policies, so you may be in luck, or not."
"Reed Elsevier",",Performance evaluation process is incredibly painful, and managers scores are altered to conform to an average curve, so yearly salary increases are incremental. Opportunities for advancement depend on the position, but are largely for show or are lateral moves to try to reduce the relatively low employee retention rate of many divisions. Local management's hands are often tied, and corporate policies often overrule local management's wishes, particularly if it involves money."
"Reed Elsevier",",Great company to work for with many intelligent, caring people.  If you enjoy continued development and learning, you'll love this Reed Elsevier."
"Reed Elsevier",",I would not recommend Reed Elsevier if you're looking to advance your career. Too much whispering and office politics to really make a name for yourself there."
"Reed Elsevier",",Slow innovation. Lots of red-tapes and management approval process. Watch what they do, not what they talk. Not recommended."
"Reed Elsevier",",No advancement opportunities with idiotic management.  Would rather spend money hiring outside consultants rather than empowering their own employees."
"Reed Elsevier",",Reed Elsevier saw their future as one that must embrace digital services as well as transfor their contact center across the globe in order to remain competitive"
"Reed Elsevier",",Home based employee worked via computer and phone communications. Early years at LN was the best enjoyed co-workers and management was fair and pretty hands off. Later they increased the workload but didn't replace co-workers you had to get the work done without any help. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the product completed"
"Reed Elsevier",",I totally enjoyed my job because it was challenging and very diverse.  I had a great staff and they worked well together.  The different departments helped each other whenever needed and I worked with each as they had special personal needs or work challenges that required assistance."
"Reed Elsevier",",This was only a temporary position I worked while in law school but it was great position.  It was a great learning experience for legal databases while earning pay."

"Reed Elsevier",",Excellent staff and overall company to work for. Assisted in conversion from Salesforce to Siebel. Work from home abilities. No management pressures...didn't stay long enough to give full review, but if called again would definately go back!"
"Reed Elsevier",",Manager had her strong points but should not be over a team any time soon. Co-workers were pretty cool except two of the women constantly argued and made a few people uncomfortable. Mundane typical schedule, a lot of Excel usage, hardest part of the job was staying busy. Most enjoyable part of the job, the people."
"Reed Elsevier",",Working for Reed Elsevier was definitely a pleasure! I learned what true professionalism was and built lasting friendships with colleagues."
"Reed Elsevier",",Reed provides a good place to grow and challenge yourself.  I enjoyed the corporate culture as well."
"Reed Elsevier",",Solid business model, see other comments for this same company posted earlier."
"Bloomberg","great place to meet people. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with stats, you are a number not a person. management is all over the place"
"Bloomberg",",I was just an extern at the Princeton New Jersey office for Bloomberg. It was a great experience everyone at the company was great and i would recommend it."
"Bloomberg",",Bloomberg is a very renowned company and people are good to work with. People are very knowledgeable and works with the other teams to bring out the best to implement best practices. Management is good and portray leadership skills and makes the workplace environment harmonic and professional."

"Bloomberg",",Bloomberg is an amazing place to work.Benefits are wonderful and staff is great. Wonderful opportunities for to help your fellow man throw their philanthropy work."
"Bloomberg",",Great place to start a career - Management can use some help with clear directions for employees but all in all a good company to work for"

"Bloomberg",",Good compensation and benefits. Great leadership by Mike Bloomberg. Very positive experience to be a part of this company. Many chances to relocate including overseas."
"Bloomberg",",Bloomberg is an excellent employer that provides great benefits and a healthy work environment. The office can become quite silent at times, but the atmosphere livens up often."
"Bloomberg",",Great place to work at. Everyone loves the free meals and snacks of course too. Great vacation to start at 4 weeks and superb health benefits. Very friendly teams open to new ideas and ways to improve on existing methods of going about daily operations. Would like to see them hire more contracted employees full time as there are several I interact with on a daily basis who have a great understanding of the business and go above and beyond every single day as well as have great knowledge of the terminal already."
"Bloomberg",",Project assignment with little to know guidance as to what the overall goal is. Temp work was misguided and length of project was cut short. We were notified at the last minute we were no longer needed."
"Bloomberg",",Benefits are the best of the best and internal mobility is available if you show your worth. In some departments a typical day is 8-5 or 9-6 but it depends where you work, some departments don't offer much work life balance. Co-workers are considerate and the ticketing systems are very useful once you wrap your head around it all. The most enjoyable part if how much programming is available to engage employees in productive thought provoking topics."
"Bloomberg",",Bloomberg manages a large and complex set of software for obtaining, analyzing, and disseminating financial information."
"Bloomberg",",They have a high degree of structure and process that software developers must adhere to. This is necessary, but it can also be overwhelming for some people."
"Bloomberg",",They have a ""people-oriented"" corporate culture."
"Bloomberg",",I enjoyed my entire time there. The people pay careful attention to ensuring that folks have appropriate training. The workforce environment is also positive and open, allowing folks to excel in their positions and work harder than they ever realized."
"Bloomberg",",Great health insurance"
"Bloomberg",",Good 401K"
"Bloomberg",",Global Offices"
"Bloomberg",",Good co-workers"
"Bloomberg",",Good Entry Level "
"Bloomberg",",Free food including breakfast"
"Bloomberg",",Good work life balance for the most part"
"Bloomberg",",Management is lacking big time at this firm. They have a severe disconnect for what it is like to work as a rep in Technical Operations and thus do not offer any type of support or career development to move on further with your career. The pay scale here is horrible and offers ZERO transparency on why external hire that are new to the company receive a higher salary than a individual who works in the same role and has been there for years."
"Bloomberg",",Very nice people here. The place was one of my favorite places to work. People there always go above and beyond to help each other and always being polite. I just wish I could of be there longer. Project over and you move on in life."
"Bloomberg",",Great place to get started in any position. Not for long term as stress levels will increase in time. Department managers are chosen internally and typically understand 15% of the departments functions..this forces any good long term employees to move on, thus losing a valuable resources for the company."
"Bloomberg",",Great first job. Learned a lot and had a great training program. Management can be secretive at times. Not much room for growth or upward mobility. Great co-workers and fun place to work."
"Bloomberg",",A typical day would be to monitor the queue for incoming break fix tickets. These tickets range from service impacting high severity to low priority infrastructure work and operational updates. I've learned a wide variety of skills as diagnosing hardware issues, troubleshooting connection/link down events and also uploading and analyzing core/log files. Management can come down on you for small things, but that is because of Bloomberg is a multi-billion dollar company with potentially millions of dollars at risk. The hardest part of the job is multi tasking and handling multiple issues at once.  Bloomberg has certainly helped with pressure.  The most enjoyable part of the job is learning.  You can learn a little bit of everything here. You can learn networking, storage, the various operating systems, troubleshooting, and much more if you are willing to put in the time."
"Akamai Technologies","My time at Akamai Technologies was the most fascinating job experience I've had. WE worked closely with many up and coming Network giants, streaming video and audio at a time it was very new and challenging over the internet platform. Our successes were many, and the company was all over the Nasdaq, until ultimately the internet ""bubble"" burst and many tech companies went n hiatus, or closed altogether."
"Akamai Technologies",",The management in this marketing position was very unprofessional and treats their employees with little to no respect."
"Akamai Technologies",",There is no clear-cut policy for hours per week or time off, so be very careful. I had a death in the family, and with adequate information provided, I was still reprimanded for not coming to work the day of the funeral. Very sad."
"Akamai Technologies",",Great company, but be weary coming into this role."
"Akamai Technologies",",Great company good people and good technology. Very fast paced and always new things to learn. Commute is hard unless you live in the Boston area. Also not paid parking although they do give you a discount."

"Akamai Technologies",",Con"
"Akamai Technologies",",lower than market compensation and no clear future growth plan"
"Akamai Technologies",",Incredible place, amazing location, terrific benefits, and an indoor gym, table games. You get to work with an incredibly astute set of people and have a hand in making a difference at to how the internet functions daily. Every day is an opportunity to learn and better yourself professionally."
"Akamai Technologies",",I will preface my review by saying Akamai is a global company and the culture varies greatly depending on your location and department. I firmly believe that the good far outweighs the bad. "
"Akamai Technologies",",We are a driven, intellectually curious collective that is always pushing ourselves and those around us to achieve the next level, rethink what is possible, and break through plateaus. In a place where you arrive and you are already behind, finding a healthy work life balance is one of the largest and most common challenges that exist."
"Akamai Technologies",",It's a great company. People are smart. I learns something new every day.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with the politics, but I'm pretty good at ignoring them."
"Akamai Technologies",",The work culture at Akamai was amazing and I learned a lot from the time I spent there. The University Relations Program is perfect and they run many programs during the internships seasons to expose us to the business and to network with others."
"Akamai Technologies",",Akamai has a great helpful culture.  Coworkers are supportive and cooperative. Very smart people working in a fast-paced environment"
"Akamai Technologies",",The work culture at Akamai is very enriching. Everyone is helpful and encourages to enhance your skills. All the colleagues are accommodating in nature and guide you to the best of their capability."
"Akamai Technologies",",Akamai's technical assets, systems and procedures are well developed and mature; a day at Akamai is a day refining and renewing these things in small but important ways.  Engineers must understand that there is 15 years of very diligent work and careful attention to detail that proceeds them.  There are opportunities to innovate, but he pace of change is no faster than that of refinement - and for good reason."
"Akamai Technologies",",The management cares deeply about the employees, they work hard to nurture and encourage career development at all levels.  Akamai invests in the community, students and even sponsors programs to teach those who've never worked in technology the basics.  Akamai has a strong culture of diversity and a good balance across cultures and genders."
"Akamai Technologies",",Fast paced.  Not a fan of the vacation policy.  Lots of smart people.  Not super friendly.  Flexible work policy.  Internationally minded."

"Akamai Technologies",",Nice people, nice environment, nice place to work overall. Due to company policies I am not allowed to divulge to much information, but again a very nice place to work."
"Akamai Technologies",",I had a very good experience working . they are a very good company to work for and through my difficult journey of my mother's illness they were very supportive"
"Akamai Technologies",",Really great company to work for. Excellent place to learn and they are an industry leader and encourage innovation strongly."
"Akamai Technologies",",Great place to work. Very easy to get along with everyone and to get involved with the firm. Could use better communication between departments but overall a great place."
"Akamai Technologies",",They are a great company, I did a co-op there and wish they hired me full time. Great CEO and Management Team, but from what I have gathered, there isn't much room for career advancement."
"Akamai Technologies",",Akamai has very hopeful and ideal work culture. They try and try to make you feel awesome about what you do."
"Akamai Technologies",",But, ""try""ing is not enough. Started from a very small and tightly knit group of people, while the ideal is great, does not necessarily translate into  the future very well, IMHO. Very little to no talent management. Manager trainings are laughable. Stale, older culture remains within groups and very strong office politics drive the majority. Not sure about other BU's but where I'm in, there's dwindling next generation of workers, which in my humble opinion, is not a good sign, especially when you look at the market now, that there are a plenty of competitors who are trying to do the same as Akamai does."
"Akamai Technologies",",Growing pain? maybe. But you can't keep continue to have the ""pain"". You need to learn and adapt to get out of the funk. It seems that senior management is oblivious to what is actually going on below their level."
"Akamai Technologies",",Great company if you're an engineer. They are treated very well."
"Akamai Technologies",",Otherwise, there are plenty of other companies that you CAN get treated very well for your non-technical contribution."
"Akamai Technologies",",Working with cutting edge technology has allowed me to grow as a professional, teammate and increase my personal knowledge. Being able to collaborate with a great team of professional individuals has been a great experience."
"Akamai Technologies",",It has been a wonderful experience working at Akamai. I am so glad that I got a chance to do that. A typical day at work involves a lot of smiling and helping faces, great quality of work and engrossing conversations! The only place where everyone actually cares to know how you're doing."
"Humana","Great job for high school students. Not much room for growth unless you have a career in retail. Long hours and low pay, but it comes with the territory."
"Humana",",This is a very good company to work for if your are looking for a change in your nursing career.  The hours are very flexible, and there is always ongoing education.  In addition, the support system is very strong.  The most enjoyable part about this job is the different people that you will encounter, and how grateful they are when you assistance in any capacity.  The hardest part of the job is the travel."
"Humana",",The most enjoyable part of my job would be being an active help to our members. Always making sure to put them first and assisting them any way that I could always kept a smile on my face."
"Humana",",Fast pace working business, hard work and dedication is a must to move forward in this great company."
"Humana",", The hardest part of the job is basically speeding the calls in a timely manner."
"Humana",",Exceptional company to utilize and acquire knowledge, expertise and case management skills every day !! Member-centered environment where main goal is to provide care based on their needs."
"Humana",",I was hired a few years ago. They are doing a mass layoff without much of an explanation and no promises that there won't be more. It's a typical insurance company. If you don't express your feelings ever, if you like being micromanaged-they literally watch your screen and record every call, if you like being numbers driven, and if you are basically a robot that never leaves their desk for 8 hours, this is the perfect company for you. They offer you ""wellness"" time 1 hour a week, but if you use it, you fall behind, then get in trouble. I'm in the worst health of my life because of this job. I stay for the benefits for my family and that's about it. Growth opportunities are few and far between and management on all levels keep employees in the dark. Job security is basically non-existent. If you express concerns about the layoffs they 1. Fire you 2. Tell you to read educational material about job stress, anxiety, work/life balance 3. Ask you if this is the right place for you to work. The clients you work with are generally nice, but the company and management is greedy and it shows. To sum it up, I don't really recommend Humana to anyone with a soul."
"Humana",",Humana is a large company with a lot of work at home employees. I placed outbound calls to member which I enjoyed. I was required to meet a certain number of calls each day as well as maintain talk time. I was laid off twice with this company."
"Humana",",Good work environment with a positive work atmosphere with the ability to move up and learn more, good job schedule that is flexible and easy to work with."
"Humana",",Humana is a great place to work especially if you enjoy helping others. I work in the pharmacy department so I help refill medications for members and I do get a joy out of doing so. The pay is great most of the people are as well. The department I am in does bonus every quarter again it has great perks."
"Humana",",Enjoyed my 10 plus years working at Humana, Learn a lot about the health industry. Medicare benefits. It was an amazing experience. Enjoy helping seniors people that need the most help with their medical benefits. Amazing years."
"Humana",",Best ever. I really like this company. You can work from home, they support education and growth. Good benefit. They value there employees. The Associates are given opportunities for professional growth. The organization encourages honest feedback.  They provides wellness incentives. Have a great employer who actually cares about the retention of their employees. The company have the last technology.My coworkers and my leader was awesome people."
"Humana",",Humana has great benefits and compensation.  There is also the security of working for a large corporation.  If your position is eliminated, there's a good chance you can find something somewhere else within the company if you choose."
"Humana",",Humana is a fast-paced very high-call volume environment in the department I worked in.  As a result the management focused more on metrics than employee concerns.  At the time, they were more concerned with maintaining low call volumes and shorter hold times than making sure everyone was happy and comfortable."
"Humana",",Very good company, always changing and evolving and improving.  Rapidly changing - employees must adapt quickly to change.  Information does not always trickle down smoothly."
"Humana",",Most days, hold something new, so you don't face the typical redundancy of day to day work load. Sometimes, the hardest part about the job is work-life balance. The culture is good, and very health and education driven. There are ample opportunities for growth and development."
"Humana",",Its an ok place to work, nothing too crazy but nothing to write home about. You must be a self starter who is flexible and willing to learn fast on the go."
"Humana",",I was brought in during their open enrollment period. We did not have a frontline leader in the beginning. When we finally got one she really care about helping us find a permanent position within the company. She had one on one mock interviews with us as well as critiqued our resume. The hardest part of the job was learning all of the systems but eventually caught on. The most enjoyable part was meeting a lot of great people"
"Humana",",Great company to work for, it has it perks like free 3 year bus pass and other discounts that other people dont get discounts on."
"Humana",",Humana is a good company to work for.  The management, as with most corporations, could use improvement.  Pay and benefits are on par with industry standards."
"Humana",",Enjoyed working collaboratively with staff to ensure coordinated health and wellness education.  Unfortunately, we were laid off due to cost effectiveness."
"Humana",",Humana is a good place to work.  I really like the fact that the Supervisor and your team encourages you and assist you with making sure that you succeed."

"TriHealth",",Management is visible and caring. Co-workers are like family. Fair pay and benefits. Ample parking and employee discount in cafeteria and gift shop. Benefit fair each year is a great opportunity to talk with vendors."
"TriHealth",",Loved working for the company. Many opportunities for women. Ability to move up at a fast rate if you are willing to put the work in."
"TriHealth",",I have enjoyed working for TriHealth. I have no complaints about working for the company its self. I just feel like it is my time to move on from my department. I am unable to move up where I am and I am not happy with that."
"TriHealth",",I worked at trihealth Good Sam for five years. After being there I didn't even make $1 more on the hour. They base your raises off of what the manager thinks and you aren't allowed more than $0.25 a year. Always understaffed. I began to notice people retiring at a rapid rate and or switching departments. Some employees are treated fairly some are not. I didn't make enough to provide for my family. The stability is there but the pay is not. I went to different departments but all in all the managers were the same. It went from being a place about caring for the patients to caring about budgeting while making million dollar renovations."
"TriHealth",",After 4 yrs I decided it was time to leave. Management is beyond "
"TriHealth",",Horrific. Pay and Raises suck. Bosses Play favorites. Nobody on the"
"TriHealth",",same page."
"TriHealth",",This is an amazing place to work! I highly recommend TriHealth for anyone searching for a new position. It's like a big family at any of our locations."
"TriHealth",",Stable company and competitive pay. Potential for advancement. Very busy practice. I enjoy being able to utilize my skill set."
"TriHealth",",I worked at Good Samaritan hospital for years. With the new president of the company mark clements a lot of people are retiring or leaving for University Health UC. There are many caring people in the company, but the company itself could care less about patients or its employees."
"TriHealth",",My department was eliminated with 3 weeks notice.  Several of us had worked for TriHealth for more than 25 years.  The mission and vision are talked about often by management, but in action, it is all about money."
"TriHealth",",Hands down the best hospital in Cincinnati. The TriHealth  Hospital truly cares about their employees. The pay is great and so is the work blade balance."
"TriHealth",",Overall, a good company to work for just depends on your manager/department. Benefits aren't too bad. I believe the pay can be more increased for all of the job duties, responsibilities then put on you."
"TriHealth",",It was a very good company to work for.  Very friendly coworkers. I would recommend it for anyone. The Lab was very fun place to work. Everyone got along great."
"TriHealth",",TriHealth was the favorite employer I had"
"TriHealth",",Mission and environment went well with the philosophy of the hospital. TriHeatlh values their employees."
"TriHealth",",i can only speak about my department.It was like working with family you have your up and downs but you look forward to seeing them the next day."
"TriHealth",",i learned my job and gradually was given opportunities for learning other jobs. "
"TriHealth",",enjoyed having the ability to work independently and efficiently"
"TriHealth",",Not a supportive place to work. I loved my co workers, but management began to take favorites....  I went above and beyond, but still found no appreciation."
"TriHealth",",The mission and values are in alignment with my own.  My management team is amazing and cutting edge for creating a positive work environment."
"TriHealth",",I really enjoy working for TriHealth. The people I work with make it easier to work in a such a high stress environment and management is very helpful, even when delivering news that could potentially upset employees."
"TriHealth",",My co-workers are highly educated and professional. Upper management is knows things are not as they should be and do not show their faces or support often."
"GrubHub","1- App crashes almost everyday. They ask you delete the existing one and download again. "
"GrubHub",",2- They send you 4-5 miles away from your location. You drive but you don't get paid for gas. They only pay for the gas you used between the restaurant and customer.  In other words (because you don't get paid until you reach the restaurant), you pay your gas expenses out of your pocket. No need to mention about car depreciation :)"
"GrubHub",",3- Let's say your shift is between 11 AM to 5 PM, and you don't want to accept a delivery which is created 4:57 that shows on your statement as REJECTED. Your acceptance rate goes bad. When acceptance rate is below %75 they don't contribute for min. guaranteed payment ."
"GrubHub",",4- New delivery order may pop up when you are on the way for delivery. You either reject or accept it otherwise you can't inform grubhub that you delivered the existing order. It sucks especially when you drive. It is like texting when you drive."
"GrubHub",",Its a good job for felons and those who want a driving job or someone who likes working alone and the company is going thru Texas with delivery jobs in Houston as well as Austin and San Antonio"
"GrubHub",",GrubHub is a fun friendly work environment. Always something to do for the employees. As I know it's a fairly new company it could have it's Ups and Downs."
"GrubHub",",I started working for GrubHub in Denver. I loved it most of the time. I made more than enough for what I needed. I was pretty much always busy but that's because the delivery zone. It is much more conducive for this service. "
"GrubHub",",Then I had to move to California and I began working in Oakland. The delivery zone is super huge and spread out. People don't tip like they did in Denver. They game the system by saying they will tip in cash but they never do. They snatch their food and slam the door. With how spread out the zone is this is problematic. When its 5 out of 10 deliveries! They need to cut up the zone!! "
"GrubHub",",Everything takes forever to get to. Such wasted time in travel. "
"GrubHub",",They do need to pay milage for between times. Like from the previous location to the next restaurant too. That is all a waste of gas. When you get to an old delivery and the restaurant refuses or is closed you just wasted gas and time and no compensation when it wasn't your fault! "
"GrubHub",",It is NOT worth it in the Bay Area California. "
"GrubHub",",It IS worth it in Denver."
"GrubHub",",Fun place to work. Good people. Nice managers, everyone really listens to you and you can tell that everyone really cares about working there. It's really good to see."
"GrubHub",",Great office environment and culture. The Chicago office is newly renovated  and modern. Young workplace with much talent! Stressful job at times but compensated well in the sales department."
"GrubHub",",Even though you are contracted as Indepedent Contractor (that is what they say), the communication from the payment department is terrible. They don't care and don't read your requested question. I sent a request to clear up some issue about the payment but their representatives were horrible about answering question. Then, they gave you the same answer even the answer wasn't something I asked for. In general, they didn't read your question and have some idiot replied the same thing over and over again until you were tired. At the end, they ignore you and you will never get compensated for your work."
"GrubHub",",Grubhub is the worst of all the delivery platform I have used. They give you this non sense about their professionalism and how they are better than the other platforms..... Meanwhile they are crooks using people for free labor and telling them to prove they made deliveries with an app that wipes itself clean and leaves no proof of your deliveries etc. They also trash your acceptance rate on purpose in order to not pay you the minimum. A very deceptive and sneaky company with no moral compass. From what I'm seeing on their reviews it looks like they have a class action lawsuit coming in the near future."
"GrubHub",",This company expects you to drive 30 miles away to pick up a order and if I reject the order because its to far it counts against my acceptance rate meaning I don't get my guaranteed minimum. Driving 30 miles each way cost more money than I make working, out of all the delivery apps I have worked for none of them ever ask you to drive this far to pick up a order they exercise this shady practice as a bait and switch scheme to get more drivers on board but they know no one in their right mind would drive 30 miles to get food because your losing money thus they don't pay your guaranteed minimum because because you didn't meat their 80% acceptance rate."
"GrubHub",",I highly recommend avoiding this company at all cost because by the time you calculate the wear and tear on your car your actually paying out of pocket to do this job."
"GrubHub",",Sometimes communication can be off but overall the company pays well and they are always busy here in D.C. I like the fact that you can quickly be in touch with a representative if you are needing to speak with someone...LIVE! The driver care department works hard to assure that things run smoothly for both the customer and carrier."
"GrubHub",",They have all new management. Management has no knowledge what so ever on what to do in RCARE. The manager is very unprofessional, and the job is based on favoritism. The pay is okay , which makes the job worth working. The company need new professional, open minded management. The job can become very messy, but as long as you go to work to work you'll be fine. The best par about he job is they feed you during the holiday seasons."
"GrubHub",",Awful company to work for. They send you an hour away. Not worth the headaches. Rude dispatchers, and so on. They treat there drivers like trash."
"GrubHub",",Grubhub has a fantastic work-life balance, great benefits, and  amazing people. Needs work on career advancement, however."
"GrubHub",",Great company to work for. They will prepare you for your future. They give back to their employees and the staff is wonderful. More pay would be nice."
"GrubHub",",GrubHub may have a great concept, delivery direct to your door from the restaurant of your liking, but they have a horrible overall platform for drivers. First, I was with the company just three days before going to, what they call, ""driver care"" for assistance. The representative on the other end of the phone was rude and malicisously didn't help me when I began questioning her reasons for being so rude. It was just a disaster of a call with no assistance for my situation."
"GrubHub",",Despite that issues, I decided to give the company another chance. What a mistake! They claim to pay a minimum hourly wage if your quota is not met. But, the underlining trick to that is that your acceptance rate has to be high enough to qualify. Well, that's really not possible when you're having to reject calls that are over 30 miles away from your current position. It's a trap! "
"GrubHub",",This really is not a company, nor a platform I would encourage anyone to invest themselves in."
"GrubHub",",The night dispatchers try sending you everywhere.... you will have like 1 hour or even 5 mins left to your shift and they will try to send you 45 mins away to another city. like really I have a life I have another job. Plus the gas and wear on your car ! If you want to keep your drivers make sure you treat them right!"
"GrubHub",",The CEO of GrubHub is an intolerant bigot who only caters to one political persuasion and looks to silence balanced views in the work-place."
"GrubHub",",This is a very unfriendly place to work. You need to keep your head down and not stick out or else management will treat you poorly. "
"GrubHub",",Never express your opinion, or wear your hair in a different way, or draw attention to yourself."
"GrubHub",",The office culture here will destroy your life, and stress you out."
"GrubHub",",This is a grotesquely irresponsible and terrible company. The product is extremely poor and it exploits its employees and contractors."
"GrubHub",",The letter from the CEO has highlighted the company culture that bleeds down from the top."
"GrubHub",",It's a democracy - to threaten those who participated in the freedom of democracy is in essence blackmail and inducing fear-mongering tactics."
"GrubHub",",Horrific company culture from the highest level of management. Sub par business model leads to furious customers. The CEO threatens employees saying they have to agree with his political views. I feared for my job and security."
"Google","From the moment I step into work, and the minute I leave, I am on my feet with nonstop workload. My store lead, she's amazing at managing our shift, from giving us a role we are good at on busy days and roles that we need to work on on a slow day. Our morning team has two cutoff time we need to make, and we communicate with each other to make sure we hit the time. This position has taught me a lot; products, prices, stockroom, and working under pressure. I enjoyed this position the most because of the energetic environment and how well a group of strangers could work so well together. The downfall would be the amount of time it took me to get to the Bronx. I live in Queens, and my shift starts at 6am everyday, I needed to be on the train by 4am to make it to work."
"Google",",I'm Google Certified and manage a MCC account because my company is a Google Partner. Not sure why it looks as though I work for Google."

"Google",",You get lot of freedom for work. You have flexible work  hours."
"Google",",Always provide a continous learning experience. Its a fun place to work."
"Google",",It is doubtful if there will be any workplace better than Google in a long time. Google takes care of her employees jealously, and creates an environment where the employees hhighest potentials are achieved. It's definitely a great place to work"
"Google",",I love working for google the team I worked with was absolutely amazing. Along with that the work place felt like I was right at home. I would refer the company to anyone."
"Google",",Google is a terrific place to work.  The wok place culture is enjoyable with many different characters and personalities that fosters a diverse atmosphere to embrace."
"Google",",it was true they do feed you lunch and dinner and the management staff is phenomenally nice.  I wish this hadn't been just a seasonal job."
"Google",",Youtube give the best creative freedom to make original content while  helping a big community of viewers, there is a lot of new techniques that I learned from trying to be competitive to get more views."
"Google",",The work is extremely easy intellectually for I have learned the main primary SOP (standard operating procedures) but it is tiresome on the body after consecutively lifting bulks of items. I think the best part of this position is getting to see customers and communicating with them."
"Google",",A typical day at work was completing orders and shopping on the salesfloor. spent a lot of time traveling from store to store to help. hardest part of the job was trying to get time off from work and starting early."
"Google",",It was a great company who was the delivery service in a lot of people got what they needed without having to go to the store to buy it it was same day delivery some of the managers were a little racist but besides that it was a pretty good experience"
"Google",",A rewarding challenge every day.  There were many new ideas and views on how to tackle the challenges of building a fiber network.  I am glad I took on the challenge.  It helped me to grow professionally."
"Google",",Very fun to work here, the people are very nice and always get our work done but there was times we had fun. We were like a family and we would all eat together on our breaks. Downside is the contract that was limited to only 1 year then 6 months off then you could reapply."
"Google",",Watch the ticket queue and respond according to priority of the issues that were presented."

"Google",",Not always the fun loving, awesome place you read about in media. Things have changed with size. Your career depends on your project and your team. Peer reviews and ratings are often gamed."
"Google",",Fun place to work. Good pay and befits. Most positions are for contract only for 2 years then required 6 months before being able to return. Would work for them again."
"Google",",Many of the perks you will hear about are only in Mountainview. San Francisco is growing but has limited perks and opportunities in comparison. Recruiters may not even mention the San Francisco office even if working in the city is important to you. You may have to ask about it."
"Google",",Quarterly bonuses given. Could listen to music and the hours were very versatile. The company even bought lunch every month for all its employees. Very sad it was only a 24 month assignment.😞"
"Honeywell","I enjoyed working with cars. I learned a lot new things about different cars. I use to drove them back and forth. It was a fun loving job for me."
"Honeywell",",I have been employed for quite some time. We have survived through multiple buyouts and ended up as part of Honeywell. Even now being Honeywell, a global conglomerate, the only advancement opportunities I have available require uprooting my family to another State. And even then, I would be required to get manager's approval. Which would leave them short staffed, and likely not to occur. The job is great, but the atmosphere that is fostered will force good people to become hard to work with. It is almost too competitive in nature, and everyone is pushed towards only doing their ""hired-for"" job. My manager is head of our site, but really has very little actual authority. It seems like his hands are tied at every step. Healthcare is expensive. Took a rather large pay cut when Honeywell insurance was instituted."
"Honeywell",",a struggle to get things done due to culture, tools for getting job done  there was a strong focus on finance management. Very week in project management due to young or still learning work force."
"Honeywell",",Engineers rule at this company causing many road blocks due to egos and power politics."
"Honeywell",",My boss was very supportive and provided me a top of line laptop and desktop computer setup. Every week we had one hour tag up meetings which aloud me to keep my boss very informed regarding the challenges of my position."
"Honeywell",",A great place to work if you do not mind uncertainties, Stress levels are low until management gets caught not doing their job. Poor planning and solutions are ignored unless they come from certain people. People pick and choose who they will work for and how much energy they will use to get the job done."
"Honeywell",",Horrible working environment! One of the leads on my shift (3rd shift) was very rude and inappropriate! He wasn't  professional at all. He would cuss at people over everything and would say nasty things to the women there and would get you in trouble for absolutely no reason!. I told the manager about it on my shift and he did nothing at all and said he would. The work is easy but nobody can deal with some one like that everyday at work especially if it's there lead!"
"Honeywell",",It started out as a great job with great people. A lot of changes occur after a year I was there. Management got worst. The environment was terrible. Everyone was exhausted and always fighting. It was out of control."
"Honeywell",",Honeywell is a pretty big company, and YMMV depending on the site you're at. I've worked at 3 sites. The two in Virginia were very similar. Advancement opportunities were slim, but your job will be secure. It's pretty much a stepping stone company for most young engineers (less than 5 years). You'll learn a lot of useful stuff, and colleagues are eager to help. The work life balance is great."
"Honeywell",",I have fewer good things to say about their facility in southern Illinois. It was also another good stepping stone type of job, but the workplace culture would be a 1/5 stars."
"Honeywell",",My Honeywell work experience was amazing!  Great managers who gave positive employee support, direction and motivation.  Collective team spirit and cooperation coupled with dynamic problem solving goals were vital to our culture. Never found my assignments hard, only challenging and exciting. My jobs focused on good planning, open Communications, developing work and team relationships plus daily meetings interfacing with managers, outside vendors, team players, production and sales."
"Honeywell",",a typical day at work may have been 8 hours or 16 hours. I learned many different facets of making ammonium sulphate. management most of the time was great to work for. sometime the culture was not the best. the hardest part of the job was being drafted..The most enjoyable was the training."
"Honeywell",",Good company with great potential.  However, then they got into financial difficulty they re-organized the company and outsourced employment to lower cost locations."
"Honeywell",",The degree to which Honeywell is a great place to work is predicted on which organization you are working in, and that particular leadership team.  They vary from ""5 star"" to ""1 star"", and changes with time.  Company ethics are solid.  You don't hear much negative press externally nor internally.  I've been there for 6 years, and would overall describe it as just OK.  I've worked for better places, but also much worse places.  Salary is competitive.  Benefits are ever shrinking, particularly medical.  I've been furloughed for 1 week per quarter over the last few (three total) which definitely isn't appreciated."
"Honeywell",",As with any big company, there are some issues with management, but the current management is steadily driving away the good employees."
"Honeywell",",There have also been reductions in pay, at least 4 layoffs, as well as reduction in benefits over the last year and a half."
"Honeywell",",Honeywell bought out Sperian safety and slowly moved machines over seas. They weren't the best, but they taught us Kaizen and 5S."
"Honeywell",",Started off as a great place to work and throughout the years seemed to get worse and worse. Benefits are nothing to brag about anymore for sure. Insurance, Pensions, 401K's hit hard. Furloughs and layoffs many times here lately. I loved what I done as a job not so much the people I worked for at times."

"Ford Motor Company","A typical day at work was answering the phones, calling customers making appointments and genarating sales leads. I learned how to enhance my customer service skills and use microsoft word and excel. Management weren't as professional as some of them were suppose to be, but my co-workers and I still did our jobs and remained professional. I felt like the job was pretty easy as long as you followed directions and stayed on top of your work. I enjoyed going to work every day and working on the computers and telephones."

"Ford Motor Company",",I loved car sales, but I needed a more stable job.  The 8 or the gate policy was stressing and taxing on your head.  A typical day was either getting on the phones to cold call people or waiting for a customer to drive onto the lot.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to drive new vehicles when they launched and working at the Motortrend Auto show."
"Ford Motor Company",",This company wants a BMW on a Chevy budget. Get ready to do more than the average for a lot less. Terrible management. You get to pay for your travel then they reimburse you. If you don't suck up to management then they will make sure you quit or get you fired."

"MacAulay-Brown, Inc.",",I liked this company and am sorry to have to be leaving it but the new contract they are under cuts my position so I must depart.  I spent five good years with Mac-B, enjoying helpful oversight by management, which was even improved upon when an on-site working manager was introduced; task was a contractor position with the Air Force and so our day-to-day work place was in the HQ of the 25th Air Force, Lackland AFB, TX., and the local manager was able to make even better internal communications with the customer possible, to the benefit of all concerned."
"MacAulay-Brown, Inc.",",Good company to work for; positive experience with meeting employee needs, benefits, and advancement.   Good growth and reputation."
"MacAulay-Brown, Inc.",",I've worked for companies large and small. MacB strikes a nice balance between the two. Large enough that they have a cohesive organizational structure (HR, BD, PM, etc), but not so big that it feels like a drunk godzilla (SAIC/Leidos, etc) crashing through a city. As a billable employee I never liked the efforts to make me feel like a part of some corporate-level team. My team is the people in my workplace, a majority of whom do not work for my company. I want support, guidance, and advocacy in those rare situations that I can't get that from my workplace. Other than that, I want to be left to do what I am being paid to do. MacAulay-Brown is a great place to work because they really strike that balance well. I feel like the compensation should have been a little higher, but I really believe that is more a function of my current contract vehicle and not the company as a whole. They did spring for a RedHat bootcamp for us which is getting increasingly rare these days."

They continue to work with me, giving me opportunities for training and have a great benefits package."

"Microsoft","A typical day at work would consist of daily sales of Xbox and Surface. Customers would come to the store and ask questions about our products or would need help updating their OS on either Surfaces, PC's, Xbox One or Windows Phones. I learned about time management and a lot of leadership. By making sure the store stays on top with sales or promotions I would email the team making sure we stay up to par and making sure we give the right information to our customers. The hardest part of the job could be having slow traffic at our location. Slow traffic could usually occur during the beginning of the week but by having limited customers we would do whatever it takes to get the sale as well as having attachments. Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers about the Xbox One. Being able to show customers the greatness of the Xbox One and showing them how efficient it can be for our customers really excite me."

"Microsoft",",I originally worked in the field which I found to be very rewarding.  But when I came to HQ, I was shocked at the terrible back-stabbing culture that existed.  From what I've learned from others, it really depends on which business group you work for.  Some are great, others are completely dysfunctional."

"Microsoft",",Microsoft demands strong performance and hard work, and rewards you with high pay, industry leading benefits and great advancement opportunities. This mature company offers the structure and training one would expect from a world class brand of its size. Much depends on the culture of the group you join and how good your manager is, but overall working at Microsoft is a good deal. They also embrace flexible working arrangements."
"Microsoft",",the hardest part is to get the raw data, not technically, you want. So stay motivated, stay positive, and step out of your comfort zone in communication."
"Microsoft",",Good benefit but relatively low salary compared to other high tech companies. Bad company culture, careless about employees. Really depending on the team and managers"

"University of Pittsburgh",",Not enough compensation for amount worked. Health insurance is most positive benefit. Few opportunities for advancement. Bloated administration.  Too many additional administrative duties."
"University of Pittsburgh",",Simply worked as a grader/teaching assistant, so I can't say much about the company.  It was nice to work closely with a professor and have the opportunity to work through the school rather than working part-time somewhere local."
"University of Pittsburgh",",The child-abuse training was lengthy. However it covered every detail and description of abuse. The online training allowed the learner to save and return to the training. This was important for individuals who have a very busy schedule."
"University of Pittsburgh",",A typical day will vary greatly from person to person, largely depending on research advisors and departments. I enjoyed a great deal of independence from both, sometimes too much. This is a world-class research institution, but still funding is always an issue in research. Nevertheless, I felt I was able to conduct some very meaningful translational research during my time there. Great neuroscience community."

"Redfin","The demand for the Associate agents varies greatly during the year. It’s feast or famine. If you want to make money, then you need availability during the weekends and weekday evenings when the clients want to tour. Which is great for people that want a flexible par time schedule. The local management also hires a lot of associates so they enough people available during the week. How it works is the events are first given to the deal writing agents, and any events they can’t do will be given to us.  We mainly do tours, help out at the open houses and specialized inspections. There will not always be enough work to keep everyone busy so expect some downtime.  "
"Redfin",",The associates are paid a fixed amount per event. We are independent contractors with no benefits or perks though expenses are tax deductible. Tour pay starts off well for the first home but the pay for each additional home is minimal.  The company recently cut Associates pay across the board which makes doing some events less desirable.  One cannot pick which events you want to do. This is a car dependent job, if you don’t like driving, then this job is not for you. If the driving is too much you can limit the areas that you cover but this will affect how much work you will receive. "
"Redfin",",There are a lot of unpaid hours with this job. Event pay doesn’t compensate for all the time it takes to setup appointments, rescheduling events with the clients, or researching the properties on the tour. Clients will expect you to be knowledgeable about the properties and locations. If you come off as unprepared they will slam you"
"Redfin",",  "
"Redfin",", in a review. This makes us spend more time preparing for tours. "
"Redfin",",Another dislike is the clients frequently do not show up to confirmed appointments or will cancel at that last minute which is bad if you have driven over an hour to a property. The cancellation pay is less than what the event would have paid. Clients will also make constant changes to their tours which makes it a hassle to schedule the homes with the listing agents. At least if a client does it excessively management will ban them from using Redfin's services.  "
"Redfin",",Lots of independence with the position. Associates don’t interact with the full-time staff or with each other on a regular basis. We work from home which is great. There is limited training besides the first mandatory training. Associates are left to their own devices with limited oversight. Which is good and bad. After a lot of negative feedback from associates, upper management directed the local offices to have monthly meetings so we could voice questions directly to management but that never materialized. Promotions are available into full time positions though they seem to be hiring more people from outside the company."
"Redfin",",  "
"Redfin",",Redfin is an awesome company. I am currently employed as a full time agent. Before coming to Redfin, I was with a traditional brokerage. Redfin is NOT traditional. Redfin is different in its core values and beliefs, always making sure their customers are first. They are open, honest, transparent, and aren't afraid to tell you if they don't know the answer. Internal HR and IT departments are always super efficient and responsive to any concerns."
"Redfin",",With all these differences, and because they put the customer first, your pay structure is going to not be what it would under a traditional brokerage. Don't let it fool you- paid mileage, bonuses, base salary, and benefits REALLY add up. "
"Redfin",",The environment here is great. Good, upbeat attitudes and honest people make working for Redfin the best thing I've ever done."
"Redfin",",I have been employed with Redfin for two years now as an Associate Agent. I work on my own schedule and make a great amount of extra money. Great Team. I work for another brokerage and received little to now training and with Redfin they are there with you to make you the best. I have learned more about showing houses, open houses, inspections, etc. movement throughout the company is possible as well."
"Redfin",",A week in the life as a Redfin AA is fun and involves a lot of driving and interaction with potential buyers through home tours, inspections, and more."
"Redfin",",Redfin is a technological Company first and foremost and the only folks getting paid decent wages are the Seattle Engineers and Executives.  Agents are paid based on reviews and sometimes regardless of how hard you work, you're not compensated regardless of the hard work you did.  They claim paid benefits and dues, however your base salary is so menial along with bonus structure, you indeed are paying for all of those benefits they claim to offer.  If you are a RE Agent and want unlimited earning potential, don't work at this place.  If you're a brand new Agent with no experience, Redfin is a great place to start because they'll provide enough leads to keep you stressed out and under water.  You will be expected to close a minimum of 3 deals per month, so forget any kind of work life balance.  If you attempt to take a day off to decompress, you will be scolded and told you're not a team player.  Also, given your compensation is tied to a review by the customer, you better be prepared to miss out on quiet time, family time, or even the birth of your children, because rest assure some consumer will claim in a review that you didn't respond to them in a timely manner and your already menial bonus will be cut further.  The Average bonus after taxes is $1,000.00 and your base salary will be $10,000.00 so you do the math.  A traditional Agent will be paid thousands in commissions, paid right away, and paid regardless of what the consumer thinks.  Redfin's business model is rigged to keep you hungry enough to stay, but too poor to leave.  Redfin also promotes unqualified individuals"
"Redfin",",  "
"Redfin",", into leadership positions.  I would assume this is due to the revolving door.  They can't sustain quality Agents because they don't compensate them fairly."
"Redfin",",  "
"Redfin",",Walking into Redfin was a dream come true! The people are experienced, helpful and friendly. The most enjoyable part of my job was the flexibility."
"Redfin",",I don't why people have posted such negative reviews. Everyone was honest with me on our  team you own your own schedule you can work as much as you want are as little as you want."
"Redfin",",This position is perfect for a new agent you will gain a lot of experience taking clients out on tours, performing open house, doing inspections, and doing closings for the deal agents when they are not avaible. Let your manager know that you want to go fulltime.  You get paid for every event and team meeting. Plus they pay for your business cards.  New Jersey South is an expansion market. The marketing manager has been honest and up front.  If your looking to make  career change to real estate and are scared of the traditional format this is the place to start with our amazing website, technology, and putting the customer first. If you have a passion for customer service you will go far."
"Redfin",",I'm not sure why these reviews are so angry! I joined Redfin as an Associate Agent this year, and couldn't be happier! An AA is an independent contractor that is paid for every single event that you perform. One of the many positives is that you make your own schedule. Do you have family obligations? Close your calendar. Want to go on vacation? Close your calendar. There is a whole team of AA's in the area available to make sure that a customer can see a house on their schedule. "
"Redfin",",It's true that the income isn't entirely reliable. It's based on the waves of business. If people aren't wanting to buy or sell, there is nothing for you to do. But I worked full time without any issue over the summer. The winter is quieter, but anyone in the business (or researched real estate before getting their license) knows that it isn't as crazy in the winter months. If you didn't save any money, go out and get a part time seasonal job. You can close your calendar! "
"Redfin",",The Redfin business model is customer centric. We are taking real estate to the next level by putting the needs and wants of our customers first instead of the possibly desperate traditional agent who is wondering where the next paycheck is coming from. Redfin is a business and pays its employees a salary and offers them a great satisfaction bonus in lieu of working for commission only. It allows an agent the opportunity to focus on the customer without struggling to survive."
"Redfin",",Redfin isn't for everyone. Perhaps the other reviewers weren't as successful as they could have been because they didn't have the right attitude. It"
"Redfin",",  "
"Redfin",", isn't an easy way to make money in real estate. It's a choice to be an advocate for your client in the confusing process of buying or selling real estate. You still hustle and work to build and maintain client relationships while working on their deals. You just have a whole team of people working with you to achieve the same client satisfaction goal!"
"Redfin",",Redfin is awesome. I feel like I have finally found a career and a place where all of my many years of customer service experience is put to good use! I ""drank the Kool-aid"" and I could not be happier!"
"Redfin",",  "
"Redfin",",This job is not sustainable...All Management are condescending and arrogant.  They don't know their business...if the job market wasn't so tough, they wouldn't have many employees to do this job."
"Redfin",",The surveys are ridiculous and we don't even get paid for the transaction unless we get a 9 or 10 yet Redfin still takes their commission.  The Middle Managers are promoted because they are part of the clique not because they are skilled and know what they are doing.  If your not in the drinking crowd and kiss up to the local Manager, you won't go anywhere. Everyone I talk to, doesn't  even want to stay with the company.  They are looking for other jobs."
"Redfin",",Redfin is a technology based real estate firm and I believe they are at the cutting edge of blending technology with the real estate business. For a consumer, they have some great home search apps and a creative webpage with current home listings. However, they are not a good company to work for and promote a cult-like atmosphere. Everyone who works for Redfin has “drank the Kool-Aid” and become a Redfinian and that included me. I worked for Redfin for 2 years as an Associate Agent, one of their contracted positions. I barely made enough to survive, but hung in there because I thought they would promote me to one of their full time W-2 Agent positions, which is what their ""Market Managers"" led me to believe. Regardless of what I was told about the position when I was hired, it was part time income at best. I never got promoted despite receiving consistent 10s on their Redfin customer satisfaction reviews and my tenured experienced as a successful real estate agent. Redfin is a clickish company managed by nerds with marginal people skills. They preach inclusion and transparency, but they do not practice the mantra with their own employees. The deal writing salaried agents do well income-wise and do get great benefits, but they pay dearly for them in the way of slave labor. They are required to be on-call 24/7, have a huge volume of clients to handle and might as well be working for minimum wage in comparison to the work hours logged. The consistent consumer complaint by Redfin clients is that their agents are too busy to provide adequate customer service. I met many buyers/sellers"
"Redfin",",  "
"Redfin",", that used Redfins technology to search for homes, but hired a non-Redfin agent to negotiate their home purchase. The Redfin business model is based on sales volume, which allows Redfin to offer benefits, but their agents are not able to keep up with the work load and get burnt out. I witnessed allot of turnover in the time I was there and typically when staff quit, it was strangely kept quiet. Don’t drink the Kool-Aid, run the other way and find another place to work for. If I sound sarcastic and angry, it’s because I am. They treated me like dirt, along with allot of others who got fed up and quit."
"Redfin",",  "
"Redfin",",In general they do not understand real estate. They are an internet based company that lacks agents that know what they are doing. "
"Redfin",",Bonus are confusing don't recommend any true agent transferring to Redfin."

"EZCORP",",Pay is ok, but for work expectations, should be hire. Worked here for 7 years. Job itself was fun. Upper management treated you like you were insignificant. Benefits were great. Met some great people. Glad to be out of EZPAWN tho."
"EZCORP",",I worked at two location. In the Tuscaloosa store the manager would hide in her office instead of helping with customer. Employee moral was terrible. The Bessemer location was the worst tough. Because the store was over ran with cockroaches. They were everywhere. They'd be crawling out of merchandise as you were trying to sell it. I would have to make sure I shook  my clothes out before I got in my car. I would think that would be a health hazard. And there was no real security. They didn't even have proper cash draws. I carried when I worked for them. Which is against company policies. But I would rather be fired than be dead. The company has no concern for employees safety."
"EZCORP",",The best part of being the Store Manager there is being able to train your own employees especially when you come with years of experience. A store is run a lot better when everyone is in sync."
"EZCORP",",The management is horrible and the top level is like a revolving door. I learn to develop a tough skin working at Ezmoney. I do regret not being able to help everybody who walks through those doors"
"EZCORP",",Good job alots of fun very good job for first time employment. Good experience, very diverse and fast paced. A lot of room for growth"
"EZCORP",",The company does not care about employees are customers safety. It was a grueling and stressful environment. It requires much detail."
"EZCORP",",This company thrives off overworking their employees with part time employees being scheduled for 12 hours without complying with Labor laws including lunch breaks. They are deceptive and unconcerned with the safety of their employees. Several employees who have experienced on the job accidents were given false information to contact workers compensation as well as not properly treated with medical care immediately. Store managers have been known to sell items that customers have pawned before the 60 day window expires. Items have been lost, broken, or stolen with little regard to the customer and without compensation. Store has been repeatedly robbed or burglarized and management has showed little concern for fixing inoperable security cameras. Store management has proven to be sexist while leaving two women to close a store alone on a busy road and allowing all males the opportunity to leave their shifts early. Employee appreciation would only include male employees while females were left to tend to the store for hours. District managers micro manage store activity only to damage employee moral and diminish the little capacity one has left to effectively complete his or her job after being bullied and threatened on a constant basis. The only time the store functions properly is when corporate comes in town and they monitor your interaction with the big bosses and threatened anyone who would attempt to carry on a conversation with them.. Anyone have anything to hide maybe?! Vague promises are given during hiring such as management positions, competitive pay and adequate hours."
"EZCORP",",  "
"EZCORP",", Managers have been caught fraudulently taking employee hours before payroll submission to avoid overtime pay. When the store is too short staff, employees may not be given a proper lunch break but Management will secretly deduct the worked lunch hour without the employees knowledge when payroll is submitted. Fraudulent loans are written to boost loans per day and they will loan money on bad items to boost their numbers as well and punish the pawnbroker for following manager direction when the item does not sell after the loan period is up. "
"EZCORP",",If you decide to work here, stand your ground and watch your pay check. Make sure you track your hours separately than the system because you may get shorted. Bonus checks are barely delivered on time or at all and payroll takes their precious time correcting the error if at all. Also be mindful that they will automatically take money out of your check for a sorry 401k without your consent and it takes forever and a day to get that money back without penalty. As publicly traded company they are supposed to make you aware of whistleblower laws but they carefully keep that info away from their employees because the stores are not run properly and as long as the bottom line says $$ they do not investigate impropriety. Also in the event manage changes during your tenure here be careful because if that manager didnt hire you, your the first to go. Also they do not encourage or value higher education as they do not acknowledge college degrees and they have stopped tuition assistance for their employees."

The clothes are ok.....the sizes are not very consistent though...I have been in Retail management for a very long time but I would not consider this a very good Company to work for Long-Term."

I learned how to interact with customers on a more personal level. The things that suck are sometimes the management is less focused on the customers and more on the sales. I've met co workers there who I became really good friends with. The most enjoyable part about the ob is having those repeat customers that you have the most in depth conversations with that help time go by faster on a slow day."

"Stitch Fix",",Management is really poor. They never communicate with one another, so the employee's are always finding things out at the last minute. You can see favoritism all over the place. I have been working there for almost a year now and I have never been given the opportunity to move up. I see new people with less than six months at the warehouse get promoted left and right. Managers run their department however they feel like it and they also make you come in early, but they won't show up until regular showtime or even later."
"Stitch Fix",",Loser trash job stay away. Pure slavery in all forms like working in jail the worst job ever the people there are low class and management is pure garbage. Its like a chinese sweat shop if you are not a favorite then you will get treated like dirt!!"
"Stitch Fix",",This was my first time working at a warehouse.  I was a temp. The atmosphere can be very negative. Alot of the employees have attitudes and are hard to get to know. It seems like management changes policies and rules very often. I did see favoritism, which is not fair to the employess that work hard. Lots of Drama. Adults should act like adults, not childish brats. The amount of insubordination I saw was amazing. These people would have been fired somewhere else.  Not very flexible when it comes to family situations and your schedule. You'll get nowhere there if they don't like you. Free snacks  are great, but not worth working there."
"Stitch Fix",",The job is easy, but I feel like the company is trying to make slaves out of theses workers. They say it's climate controlled, but the temperature is above 80, they have you stand in one place expecting you to pack clothes at a fast pace while trying not to collapse frm the pain frm your feet. They should provide you a chair if all you are doing is standing there. I realize that most workers breaking a sweat getting all the work done are black and hispanics and mainly the managers and the stylists who sits on their butts and doesn't do much yet get paid more are white. Its a major race issue within this company in my opinion, I feel like I'm a slave and us as workers that receive the clothes frm the trucks, put the clothes on the racks, pick the clothes frm the racks, pack the clothes and ship them should be treated with as much respect as the white people who sit down all day. Stop treating the ones that do all the work like slaves, I mean it's already hard for blacks and hispanics to find jobs so the only job we can probably get we get treated like slaves. I would enjoy it more if I didn't feel like a modern slave. I applied to be a stylist for this company and was denied for no apparent reason yet hired for a warehouse worker. Oh I forgot I'm not white nor have blonde hair to work in the cool part of the building. More people need to stand up for what's right and never let people treat you as if you are beneath them. Money is not everything REMEMBER THAT!!"
"Stitch Fix",",I took a job as a stylist part time to ease the transition into full time after having a baby. I was really excited about the opportunities that I thought the company might present down the road but I realized very soon that, even with a degree in fashion and 10 years of experience, I'd never be promoted even though I had very high statistics (they measure these very closely). As mentioned in many other comments, the management team is like a small group of sorority girls that choose favorites. I lost respect for the brand and the culture very quickly. That's what happens when you don't see and tap into your own employees potential and allow negative people to get settled into positions of power. Good luck fellow fashion majors- I feel your pain!"
"Stitch Fix",",This warehouse is very unprofessional. They play loud music with extreme content and profanity, like five different radios at once. The supervisors never speak to you or introduce themselves. All the supervisors do is stand there and talk all day. There is no air in the warehouse but in the offices they're nice and cool. Iv seen females pass out from the heat. Leads/trainers come to work with hang overs. We are always short on Saturdays because people call in. It's extremely ghetto so if that's not the atmosphere you like then I'm telling you right now this isn't the place for you.  If you have an idea they will steal it and take credit for it. All we do for 10 hours is fold clothing, wrap it and put it in a box. If it isn't to their liking then they send it back to you. Sometimes they sabotage your work on purpose so you have to do it over. The breaks are very very short. People have their cliques so it's hard to get to know do workers. Pay is alright and they have stocked drinks of every kind and different snacks. Over all I wouldn't recommend this company or at least the warehouse."
"Stitch Fix",",Managementment team could be a lot more organized. They are very big on favorites. The don't accept doctors excuses or anything."
"Stitch Fix",",I used to enjoy come to work everyday, but first they changed the schedule, second It's hard to get a promotion unless you are friends with the management, even if you are going above and beyond your required job duties your not getting full rise or even worse you get nothing, then you have to wait another year to get cents, the management is really poor, a lot of supervisor for just one department and they never dont know anything, they never can answer a question and will send you with other supervisor. I think every state its different so i guess they have to adjust to Arizona's not benefits"

"The Hanover Insurance Group",",I love the company and the people I work with but Mismanagement is the biggest issue among this company. The pay and benefits are amazing, couldn't wish for more."
"The Hanover Insurance Group",",Outgoing CEO had a dynamic personality and really drove people.  Compensation based on results but little life balance."
"The Hanover Insurance Group",",The local management was horrible and very two faced. Every one in the auto claims office hated their job but were scared to leave. They expect 12 hour work days for little pay. Do not work for this company in Richmond unless you want to be around depressed people all day. It could likely be very different in the other offices. Training is also beyond sub-par and management does not take feedback well. The local office also denies to many claims so you will get stuck with old rental bills for claimants when the subrogation dept overturns local liability decisions as they do not handle rental for claimants if they paid out of pocket. Evan though I put that I approve of the CEO is being pushed out by the board for someone more ""wallstreet"" friendly"

"The Hanover Insurance Group",",I enjoy working at The Hanover Insurance Group. I believe my department has a hard time with keeping good, Reliable management on hand. I find it hard to Have my family and my Job with this company. It seems the management is not as open to needed days off or Shift changes to make it work."

"The Hanover Insurance Group",",Pretty relaxed and they have programs for you to advance your career. Management is nice and will work with you to achieve goals. As far as carriers go there are probably few that are better to work for then Hanover. The negatives are the office is a standard cubicle environment (think office space) and no free coffee.."

"Biogen",",Great company with great benefits! Great Vacation time and floating holidays! Reward you for all of your hard work! I would recommend this company!"
"Biogen",",Biogen was an awesome place to work with a culture of fairness, development and balance.  It has suffered like so many others over the years and the culture has suffered along with the benefits.  Most of the people are genuinely good, but the hiring culture has also changed where the process does not favor the prepared or experienced.  I believe they will learn these lessons and come back strong, but they have a gap to work on for sure."
"Biogen",",Biogen has hired some great people. My manager was one of the best. She made you feel great and gave you the recognition that you deserved. She was very approachable and worked with us closely."
"Biogen",",Good work environment , close team atmosphere, they encourage problem solving, and is a very PC and diverse company. they work hard and  a leader in the idustry."
"Biogen",",Biogen is undergoing some changes.  Senior management is being replaced up to and including the CEO, a new company is being spun out of existing products, one manufacturing site is being built while another one is being closed.   My job is a manager in the manufacturing facility that is being closed and to be honest, I am surprised at the amount of transparency in the closure process and the amount of services that are being provided.  They have excelled in that regard."
"Biogen",",I enjoyed my time at Biogen.  The work/life balance was great.  The people were fantastic, and, you worked with MS patients which made the job worthwhile.  You were helping people."

"Biogen",",Fantastic culture of caring and dedication. superior infrastructure with excellent systems and training. Many perks and great benefits"
"Biogen",",The manufacturing environment was stressful due to the ""shift wars"".  Management did not care about the workload left over from one shift to the next. The schedules were also uneven and recognition was only given to a select few. Performance was evaluated by the amount of projects or meetings an employee participated in and not the actual work performed. Promotions were given to their "" favorites"". Management was unprofessional bad mouthing other supervisors and managers in front of employees. Bad environment to work in if you are serious about your work. Lack of accountability and various  issues that were constantly overlooked. If you weren't part of the ""click"" you were pushed aside and trampled upon. Experienced employees were not taken seriously while the"" favorites"" were compensated. Completely opposite of the supposed company values."

"Analysis Group","AG (Analysis Group) was a great employer experience. "
"Analysis Group",",Depending on case work levels, it could be feast-or-famine so I found work to do. The best part of the job were the people: there was always a sense of thankfulness for the work performed. I learned to be a team player. The culture at Analysis Group was phenomenal. "
"Analysis Group",",The hardest and equally enjoyable parts of work were the hours and managing the requests of counsel as well as the knowledge that you accomplished something when you left the building regardless of the time on your phone."
"Analysis Group",",Great company, with great culture and great people.  A great place to learn broadly about capital markets and to learn from smart, dedicated, and motivated people. I had a great experience."
"Analysis Group",",Analysis Group's work relies heavily on rigorous quantitative analysis, resulting in a steep learning curve for new analysts.  However, once basic analytical skills are mastered, there is an opportunity to assume significant responsibility on case teams and gain wide industry exposure.  Managers also tend to invest in the career development of analysts.  Due to the opportunity for rapid skill development and the supportive culture, Analysis Group is a great place to begin one's career."
"Analysis Group",",This is a good role for undergraduates with a degree in economics, math, or statistics."
"Analysis Group",",lots to learn from very smart people. will develop strong analytical skills. work is often stressful and requires late nights, though."
"Vroom","High volume sales environment, sloppy management, lots of growing pains as the dealership grew rapidly. Sold high end cars which was fun."
"Vroom",",I started off working here young part time then went to school came back full time and learned all my skills and experience at this company. I had to move on I wasn't growing at this company."
"Vroom",",Work would go smoothly sometimes, however it was frustrating working in an environment where everything is so unorganized. The managers really do not care much about the employees. The most enjoyable part of my job there was selling a car and making sure my customer was extremely happy with their purchase. The hardest part was accepting the fact that the managers would throw extra work on our plate and ask us to take care of many other tasks. Yet, not give us more pay, and give me more than what was actually on my job description when I applied. There turn over rate is extremely ridiculous"
"Deloitte","Was given the opportunity after 2 years to manage a team of staff."
"Deloitte",",Deloitte was a great place to work. I really enjoyed it. The people and the company its self are beyond my expectation. The management could have been more involved in the training portion but things happen fast in that environment so over all a great place to work."
"Deloitte",",Most people at Deloitte have inflated views of themselves and the firm. There are of course some people who buck this trend. Most projects are not interesting, and it's hard to see how Deloitte differentiates itself from the rest of the big 4."
"Deloitte",",I have had many incredible professional and personal opportunities with the firm. I have worked on many challenging projects, served large global organizations in different industries, and have always felt supported by team members and leaders."
"Deloitte",",good please to start a career, very fast learning environment, salary is ok, high turn over. crazy busy seasons, managers are agreesive"
"Deloitte",",Great company to gain good experience. "
"Deloitte",",Hardest part is travel and long hours."
"Deloitte",",The most enjoyable part was working with talented folks"
"Deloitte",",Projects are impactful and are career accelerators.  Working at Deloitte is not your typical ""9-5"" job, rather it is an opportunity to analyze and resolve issues that clients themselves cannot resolve."
"Deloitte",",Great place to work.  Top tier organization, very strong brand name, everyone has heard of Deloitte.  Smart people work there and it is a great place to learn"
"Deloitte",",Access was my first job out of undergrad and I learned a lot here. Lessons I learned here are some that I still take with me today, nearly 11 years later. The people were great and I enjoyed the nurturing culture. The pay definitely could have been better though."
"Deloitte",",Started my career here- good culture, great people, and I am glad I started my career at Deloitte.  I learned a lot, and they cultivate their people."
"Deloitte",",great place to start your career and to have on your resume, but they work you like crazy the first few years, but if you can stick through it, it will pay off in the end, but great culture otherwise"
"Deloitte",",Deloitte is an excellent place for a college graduate to start his/her accounting/finance career. You will get to experience a wide breadth of clients, and also gain exposure to Financial Statement audits, along with audits over internal controls."
"Deloitte",",Workplace culture seemed relaxed with an emphasis on networking. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with coworkers that are supportive. Perhaps, I was somewhat fortunate, but my team was full of hardworking, encouraging, and determined individuals. The hardest part of the job was to find time and motivation to be involved in firm initiative work/projects. I understand the idea and goals of firm initiative, but the requirement and impact firm initiative (non-client hours) have on your performance rating seemed a little ridiculous."
"Deloitte",",Terrible experience,long hours. I wasn't promoted even though my clients loved me. I didn't stay long until I left to go corporate. My typical day during tax season was long and hard. I worked like a dog.I learned you reallly have to work hard to climb the corporate ladder,even in an accounting firm. Management was mean and rude."
"Deloitte",",Deloitte is no longer competitive with smaller firms so they introduced a new staffing model. Beware if you are hired into this - when your contract ends it is unlikely you will find a new one. Strategy and Operations is especially challenging. Deloitte has more politics than many of their government clients. Cut throat culture with poor work life balance. ""We hire young people that need experience, work them to death, and then once they realize how terrible we are, they leave."" I'll leave this review on a positive note - the lunches and happy hours were nice!"
"Deloitte",",Very fast paced results driven environment. Working cross industries on various projects aids in building knowledge and skills required to be a successful Consultant"
"Deloitte",",Deloitte is great company to start your career. Ability to work on challenging projects with some of the smartest people in the industry. The things I enjoyed most were the vast amount of diverse project experience, team culture, and vast amount of training opportunities  (soft skills and technical)."
"Deloitte",",This firm, Deloitte, is a very productive and fun place to work. The experience derived from here is great. The people are smart, friendly and great to work with."
"Deloitte",",I found the culture very young and vibrant.  Coworkers were energetic and willing to learn. Management makes many promises concerning career advancement but were often missing in action..."
"Deloitte",",Nice place to work and develop new skills while being able to utilize new skills.  Nice people and a good sense of teamwork."
"Deloitte",",The work culture is really great and have learnt a lot of new technologies. Worked in a good team. Enjoyed the company parties."
"CVS Health","was impossible to get promoted beyond assistant manager, i kept getting transferred from one store to the next as well and never gave me an opportunity to grow the store i was in"
"CVS Health",",I enjoyed being employed at CVS. CVS was a great place for growth as a pharmacist and for the other employees as well. I do not remember a day of work that was not a learning experience."
"CVS Health",",Loved working at CVS for the customers. I also loved my job and what, my job title included but I was very under paid. I also didnt like the drama and how we couldnt work as a team,"
"CVS Health",",This is the same company under a different name.  I am getting really annoyed by this process, It makes no sense to make me review a company multiple times."
"CVS Health",",I learned how to work as a team. My managers were supportive, the encourage me to be a better me. I learned how to manage  my time, especially when it came to helping out customers."
"CVS Health",",A typical day at work is multitasking under pressure. I learned my native language which is spanish while engaging with customers everyday. I learned a lot about inventory, filling prescriptions, and alleviating health insurance company discrepancies. Immediate management in my home store are very caring and thoughtful, but also abide by the rules. District management are very strict to meet their standards and goals that is expected from the front end of the store, as well as pharmacy. The hardest part of the job is knowing that pharmacies sometimes will have to go by a budget, which requires hours to get cut. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting through the day being a problem solver and customers who have been helped go home happy and on a path to a better health when they get their medication."
"CVS Health",",Likely would never work there again, work conditions are sub par to say the least and you are compensated poorly for the amount of trouble you have to deal with on a consistent basis."
"CVS Health",",Cvs was a bad experience for me. It was all about drama instead of work. They had me do everything there is it just wasnt fair. it wasnt a good place to work at and I would never work there again."
"CVS Health",",A typical day at work is ringing and greeting customers. I also did truck on wed and rang up customers. I did photo lab and took passport pictures. i did reshop at the end of the day when the store closed."
"CVS Health",",There are a lot of things to learn working in the pharmacy. If you are willing to put in the work and take the state certification exam it will definitely be worth it. As you can demand more pay or seek employment else where for more pay."
"CVS Health",",great company to work for. hardworking management and staff, great products made affordably. Pharmacy is on the ball and always helps out customers when they need it."
"CVS Health",",Great company to work for, gives you chances to grow and learn. New metrics to improve  customer service  develop all the time and they  help you  meet those metrics."
"CVS Health",",A typical day at work is full of tiny chores to take care of, mostly busy work. Greeting the customers is a big deal here. The customers are more likely to remember the members who smile and are friendly to them throughout the exchange at the register. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customers recognize you and have a genuine interest in your well-being."
"CVS Health",",My responsibilities included, running points of sale, managing cashiers, counting imprest, closing out front store and pharmacy drawers at the end of the day, preforming daily cycle counts, correcting inventory, cleaning, and facing the store. Also, I ran the photo lab and was responsible for all computers and printers; performing diagnostic checks and system cleans periodically."
"CVS Health",",Minimum quality of life while working for this company.  Excessive hours required by their managers.  Low motivation through out the company to assist in a quality of life for their employees."
"CVS Health",",Working with patients that have rare and terminal diseases is a rewarding job.   It is a large company with room for growth."
"CVS Health",",I enjoyed the work and people there is just lack of hours provided to work . If they offer more over time it would be the perfect job. It makes you smile seeing that you are developing many relationship with customers."
"CVS Health",",very typical pharmacy technician job where you fill and decipher, deal with customers, multi-task, handle multipule cases for prior authorizations. I was a floating technician so i different work experiences everyday with different people."
"CVS Health",",As a CVS cashier for 3 years I had the pleasure of interacting with customers on a daily basis. Whether it was to help them find a product in the store, check them out, or just to help answer a simple questions I was always eager to help. I also was there to help customers at the photo kiosk and printing station."
"CVS Health",",A typical day at work involves being able to multi-task quickly yet efficiently while providing excellent customer service. Very many patients come in upset over unresolved prior authorizations or insurance discrepancies, so be prepared to handle these patients with the best set of customer service skills regardless of any negative demeanor they may possess towards you. You will be very busy and slammed while trying to do multiple things accurately at once, so be prepared to handle all of the stress and pressure."
"CVS Health",",when i got hired they told me anywhere from 25 to 30 hours didnt even get that in 2 weeks lack of communication and the pay isnt all that great either"
"Harris Corporation","I worked at Harris Corporation Advertising Solutions Group for over 10 years. I loved the work because each day was different. My co-workers were very talented and hard working. The bad part is there is no room for advancement at all, no matter how good you are at what you do. The best part of the job is working with clients to make them happy and using my previous experience to excel in the job. There is overtime for those who care enough but there were some hard workers and some that did not put in the same effort and dedication. Reviews also do not reflect extra effort, which is not good."
"Harris Corporation",",I filled a contract position with the company for one year. Workplace culture is typical of most Corporate America workplaces. Most employees are in their mid 30s to 50s."
"Harris Corporation",",Company focus is centered about new generation of workers with no regards to the dedicated employees that have been with the company for decades. All incentives to stay with the company have been removed as new employees have the same benefits as those with 20 years experience. Most new positions of responsibility go to the young and inexperienced which is counter productive to this business which demands knowledge and experience. The few remaining old timers are either bullies or are hanging on for retirement."
"Harris Corporation",",Excellent place for new grads if you like being told how it is going to be with no input to the solution."
"Harris Corporation",",It's an ok place to work.  I do not care to share more than that.  Some employees enjoy it and it is certainly better than working in a coal mine.  I assume.  Having neer worked in a coal mine myself."
"Harris Corporation",",Currently, there is more emphasis placed on youth than experience. There is a lack of understanding of quality. There is a lack of communication between programs which causes redundancy."
"Harris Corporation",",Right now I am working as a sub-contractor and and I am gaining a wealth of knowledge in the position that I currently hold and have no doubts that this information will come into play as my career progresses. The culture is very professional with a work hard play hard mentality."
"Harris Corporation",",This is one of the most well know companies in Rochester and looks great to have on your resume if you live in the Western New York area."
"Harris Corporation",",Harris has not given a 1% raise to any of its employees in the San Diego division of Information Technology. People working with the UUV and USV program at Harris Corporation have to spend 6 months or more in Bahrain. Hours are adjust, but the promised hours are never reached. Per Diem is slowly diminishing and there is no vacation when deployed. Management is terrible at communication and don't expect planning in advance, Management will ask you to leave for 6 months with a few weeks notice at best."
"Harris Corporation",",Good place to work. Great people, fast paced, never boring!"
"Harris Corporation",",Good pay. Clean and safe place to work. Sometimes the schedules were tough to meet, but we always got the job done!"
"Harris Corporation",",This summary will not include overseas assignments."
"Harris Corporation",",- A typical day at work was doing my assigned tasks according to work orders. I had moved around the company learning new skills by doing different things, such as making fiberglass products, making transformers of all different sizes making cables of all configurations, making and testing electronic fixtures under government specs, and many others things."
"Harris Corporation",",- I had some of the best co-workers anywhere. They helped me become better at seeing the big picture and I helped them wherever I could."
"Harris Corporation",",- management at Harris were great at listening to me and others and had the knack to give instruction where needed."
"Harris Corporation",",I loved working with Harris Corporation - unfortunately the division I worked for was sold to a private equity firm eliminating my position,"
"Harris Corporation",",My supervisor was outstanding. Very knowledge able and down to earth. She understood that I didn't know everything. Great first experience!"
"Harris Corporation",",Deadlines and ever-changing requirements from customers keep me on my toes. Great environment with plenty of opportunities to network, learn, and even a little upward mobility. Management respects employees and employees return that respect."
"Harris Corporation",",With a great work/life balance, Harris also provides a dynamic learning experience in the work place. Management is quick to acknowledge performance and promote form within."
"Harris Corporation",",If you are looking for experience to work with Government Projects that offer security clearance. Harris is a great place to be. I loved my experience there"
"Harris Corporation",",The only reason I left was due to a layoff. I liked Harris and would go back happily. I liked my manager, and her manager and her manager's manager."
"Harris Corporation",",I enjoyed my coworkers and we worked well as a team.  This may or may not be the culture of the company...it is a very large company, but my division worked well together."
"Harris Corporation",",This place has the angriest, most bitter employees I have ever witnessed in my thirty year career. Everyone is perpetually nasty and complaining about their jobs. It translates blatantly into the quality of their work and customers notice entirely. We are rapidly losing contracts to competitors and widespread layoffs are inevitable. I cannot stand another day here and advise everyone reading this to stay as far away as possible to save your sanity and careers."
"Harris Corporation",",Programs are always delayed, underfunded and fraught with errors. There are zero continuing education or process improvement initiatives, and employees are perpetually unmotivated. People here are enamored with status quo; they love to float by and will viciously destroy the career of anyone with drive and work ethic. Save yourself the headache of a lifetime and stay as far away from this woeful ""company"" as possible."
"Harris Corporation",",The first year was fine. After that, it had been cut after cut to benefits."
"Harris Corporation",",Co-workers work well together."
"Harris Corporation",",Management uneven in how the treat each employee, and with how much they demand from each employee."
"Harris Corporation",",Government Support, supporting the Program Office with required regulatory and statutory documentation during the acquisition process material in support of the warfighter."
"Harris Corporation",",Great work life balance and vacation and 401k, but a very low pay and bad middle and upper management cancel that out. You're just a cog in the chain at Harris. Promotions take too long, and raises don't keep up with inflation."
"Diverse Lynx","Workplace culture is very nice. Salary and benefits are good. Diverse Lyx is very employee friendly company."
"Diverse Lynx",",Working environment is good. "
"Diverse Lynx",",Management is good and supportive."
"Diverse Lynx",",People working at  Diverse lynx are great. We have been trained by one of the most professional trainers that motivates us to do more at work."
"Diverse Lynx",",excellent management"
"Diverse Lynx",",very friendly environment."
"Diverse Lynx",",good salary package"
"Diverse Lynx",",good place to start for freshers, but you can only go so far. No issues with getting paid. that is the biggest advantage when compared to other desi consultants"
"Cox Media Group","The people here is mainly the only reason to stay. Great place to start and make connections. Get your work experience and then move on,"
"Cox Media Group",",I loved going to work every day. Too bad it was just a contract. I liked the interactions with the team and employees, it was a great atmosphere to work in."
"Cox Media Group",",Cox media has been a good place to work after I graduated from college. I have learned quite a bit during my time there and they have treated me very well."
"Cox Media Group",",Great people; poor management and HR department. "
"Cox Media Group",",The benefits are awesome and PTO is a generous amount."
"Cox Media Group",",It's a good entry level job to learn digital sales."
"Cox Media Group",",For event staff it is great for a side gig to gain media experience "
"Cox Media Group",",Not enough pay to do as a main source of income"
"Cox Media Group",",Company is great if you enjoy the music of the stations"
"Cox Media Group",",Diligence leads to promotions but this is hard as you will need a second source of income to make ends meet"
"Cox Media Group",",The media industry continues to see ever-faster change, and a good number of companies in this space are struggling to find a way to cope. Cox Media Group is one of them. Refusing to face realities and develop creative, productive ways to adapt are causing a severe problems for this company. For all the money spent by Cox on research and understanding audiences/consumers (which is a huge amount), the conclusions and direction taken are poor."
"Cox Media Group",",While there are still very good employees within this company, their numbers are in decline and the culture is suffering. A short-sighted view of how to adapt, and refusal to put emphasis on smart change is causing ill-informed, panicked management to push people ever harder to chase unproductive, disappearing ends in old-school ways. The result is a feeling of desperation, not unlike a drowning person struggling harder and harder in the same way, ultimately to their detriment. There are a great many other companies with far better culture and prospects to choose from. I wouldn't recommend a friend seek employment here."
"Cox Media Group",",great place to work for love it miss it , would work there again , I miss my coworkers , miss the place , miss the area , I would recommend the place to anyone ,"
"Cox Media Group",",design on a day to day basis work load depends on you. Co-workers are great. Very demanding job but very fun. If your a flexible person this job can be a good stepping stone"
"Cox Media Group",",A typical day was to count product as it came off the truck and make sure that all product was received in a timely manner. I got to work alone at a newspaper branch for Dayton Daily News. The hardest part of my job was around Thanksgiving when all of the inserts on the skids had to be verified and moved. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to converse with the management in the branch and troubleshoot when there was an issue with their product."
"Cox Media Group",",Management has no clue and there is favoritism."
"Cox Media Group",", Wisconsin trends in shifts in advertising, there's always a panic that seem to trickle down from upper management. "
"Cox Media Group",", There is favoritism, and a high demand to perform as ratings and technology changes.  Scandal with senior manager from Atlanta ."
"Cox Media Group",",still an old boys network… Too bad"
"Cox Media Group",",If you are a highly motivated outgoing person, then this job is for you. You must driven, self motivated, be able to handle rejection with a smile, and be willing to turn that around to a sale,  Its a more challenging job than one thinks.

"Cox Media Group",",Agile process was introduced in the company BuyBook Technologies which was acquired by COX in 2014 and they trained everyone with better understanding of Agile methodology"

"Cox Media Group",",The culture is recovering from a very toxic era. Turnover is rather high, making it difficult to form a cohesive team. It's not the worst place I've worked, for sure, but things could be better."
"Cox Media Group",",I worked for Cox Media Group for five years. At first, it was great! We had a tight group on the desk and it was a positive team environment focused on putting out a quality product. It is amazing to me that in just that five years time, so many changes happened. They minimized staff and made all of the desk merge into a ""universal desk"" located in Dayton. By the time I left, literally 50 percent of the copy desk had quit due to the horrible work conditions and not one of them was replaced. I went from designing and editing a good 20 pages a day to doing well over 80 to 90 a day. Quality went down and management didn't care as long as the paper was being printed. The stressful work environment was constant and you barely had time to take a break. It caused me to have several severe health issues and for a year and a half of my life I suffered from constant panic attacks due to the stress of that job. Never would I ever recommend working in such a toxic environment. The management was horrible and treated employees as disposable. Please for your own well being...look somewhere else!"
"Cox Media Group",",Promotion within this company is very hard you have to be with the IN-Crowd or have a Big Brother mindset. Merit increases are not guaranteed nor based on performance reviews."
"Cox Media Group",",Company is for sale. Management is horrible with no room for advancement. Watched people with twenty years lose their job without any reason. Stay away......"
"Cox Media Group",",I worked in a department that had massive layoffs. That's part of the business. The bad part is how the company handled it. Very unprofessional and callous. It's reflective of the overall corporate culture. The business is tanking and they have no answers."
"Cox Media Group",",Great money, it was a blast dealing with customers management varied from franchise some of it was amazing and others lacked the skills to lead."
"Cox Media Group",",When I first started, it was a blast working there. Employees were respected and looked after and allowed a lot of autonomy in how to conduct their work."
"Cox Media Group",",But things changed and in the end I could not wait to leave. Respect for the individual skills in IT disappeared and enlightened management was replaced with petty micro-managers who had no respect for the skills and experiences of people doing the actual work."
"Cox Media Group",",I made two great decisions in my life - First joining Valpak, and second leaving it."
"Cox Media Group",",I never looked back."
"Cox Media Group",",Only if you have been working for this company for an extended period of time are you allowed any flexibility.  The benefits are not that great compared to other companies. The focus alot on print sales and the branding for their web serves doesn't even match, so alot of people don't even know they offer those services. Overall, if your great at sales this is job for you. If your in any other function, look else where."

The job did not have benefits which is a plus to have a better future for myself and my kids."

"Yahoo! Inc.",",Each day could be different than the last at Yahoo.  One day you are in sports production and the next you could be on a plane to DC intv. the president.  You're able to learn other positions.  Management is extremely fair and treat you like family.  Co-workers are the best in the industry.  Everyone gets along.

"The Weather Channel",",Overall, The Weather Channel was a great place to work. Management tried to adopt a Google-style workplace where everyone was out in the open. Unfortunately, they've invested too much into their morning show AMHQ and lost too much money because of poor ratings, which have also affected other live programming."
"The Weather Channel",",Because of that, restructuring was necessary and, unfortunately, I was one of the casualties."
"The Weather Channel",",However, had there not been layoffs, It was a great place to go to work every day."

"The Weather Channel",",Overall, just not a good place to be. Run away as fast as you can."
"The Weather Channel",",The leadership  of this company is a mess. The CEO has changed directions every six months since he came on board in 2012. The executive team lacks integrity and can often be heard stabbing one another in the back in the hopes to get ahead. Line workers are overlooked so that the company can create more VPs and SVPs."
"The Weather Channel",",I was privileged to work with a fantastic agile team of product owners and developers. Serious talent, serious drive and commitment to produce the best possible product. The iPhone team really knew what they were doing. My experience at TWC was great overall."

"Tesla Motors",",every 6 months possibility of a raise and stocks!!"
"Tesla Motors",",Benefits are really good at tesla, the overall pay could be better based off what they ask of you as you attempt to move up in the company. If you get on managements bad side your chances of advancement are pretty much done. There is a tendency to use workers for multiple jobs to push cost savings regardless of safety. Expect people to cover multiple areas as in supervisors overseeing multiple areas, which then causes leads to have to cover part of the supervisors job if they cannot keep up with all issues occurring. There is no real equal opportunity towards moving up they already know who they want long before they post the position."

"Amazon.com","A typical day at Amazon would include roles like picking, stowing, batching, water-spider, running, and problem solving.

"Amazon.com",",I worked at amazon through a tempt service. I liked working for  amazon but you barely have a life working here.  You work long 10 hours and get only 2 breaks  which are 15 minutes and a lunch that's half an hour even though it takes you 5 minutes to get to the break rooms. They get upset if you leave 2 minutes before break which is ridiculous. The shift leaders and PA are not helpful sometimes at all some won't even bother to help. The PA are like high school students who talk bad about people. I had a PA tell people that I wasn't doing my job correctly because I went to go get water... Not only that there's a lot of older adults who need help but don't get the help they need because of stuck of people. The only thing that made me happy is the pay and wonderful people."

They do not care! No one knows what to do or what is going on! Fired even though I called repeatly to get my job back due to being on a leave of absence from getting hurt on the job. For this to be a high tech workplace, they did not take any time into human resources! -Currently filing a lawsuit! Work for them at your own risk!

"Amazon.com",",The Management was no where to be found if you had any kind of serious questions. 10 hours a day standing in one spot wasn't the worst of it. It was the constant complaints from other employees about the job. When people came to help with the robots or conveyor they would act like you broke it when they constantly broke down."
"Amazon.com",",Amazon is an enormous business. The hours are long and breaks are nearly non-existent. The physical toll on your body is extreme and you can never really find a manager. The training is poor and they would probably have a smaller turnover rate if the had better understanding of employee needs and what positions best suit people."
"Amazon.com",",I was nice to have immediate health care provided in every building, including free over the counter type meds that help you through your workday. I learned that I could push myself further, physically, than i ever have before at work. I also learned that that comes with a hefty price."

I was trained in all aspects of customer service from phone, chat, email and device. I was transferred to 4 different teams in less than 2 months.My skill sets were reduced to just phone. When I was sick I was not told that I could use a waiver for days off instead of sick time. This was told after the fact when I had a negative balance."

"Lockheed Martin",",I always exceeded expectation. Enjoyed working with all of my co-workers. The Lockheed company was different but enjoyed working with them while at Fort Knox ."
"Lockheed Martin",",I worked for Lockheed Martin for almost 7 years.  The only reason I left was because I was tired of driving 1.5-2 hours to/from work even though the distance should've only taken an hour.  I was also working nights, weekends, and holidays which was no longer desirable.  Where I was working there were plenty of other job advancements, in fact I moved from the help desk to a data analyst just because I asked about moving elsewhere.  They took great care of me and was potentially going to move me to Close Support but there were no openings at that time.  They were willing to begin training me so that when a position did come available I could move into it w/o problems.  However I found a position that was only 45 mins from home with another company.  Shortly after leaving I wished I could go back."
"Lockheed Martin",",Its not a bad place to work but could always be better in their treatment and priority of workers. Management could be better to actually listen to their employees."

"Sprint",",Sprint has always been flexible with my time. Great commission and great management as well. They've also had lot of opportunities for advancement and great benefits."
"Sprint",",Constant change , goals change a lot and a bit unrealistic. Favoritism plays a huge part in this company, co workers are the only great part. Don't honor schedules much, don't let you take pto often even if you earn a lot. People get sick a lot and develop sickness because of over work.  They could really give a rip about anyone . "
"Sprint",",Customer care and retail are a constant struggle because they always tell different things and lie to the customer then you get to deal with it when the customer comes in. Not a fun environment ."

I learned how better to motivate a team to meet goals, exceed expectations and enjoy the rewards.  Management at my store was fair and balanced.  Hardest part of my job, is looking for another job and leaving those behind.  The most enjoyable part of my job is my team.  I believe in making them like your family away from home, learn with them and succeed with them and fail with them.  It builds a unity unmatched.  Its what I will miss mostly about my current position."
"Sprint",",My job is to assist customers when they need assistance, if they need a a new phone I will get them a phone that best fits their needs or if they are having phone issues we would try to resolve that for the cusomer."
"Sprint",",We were always able to have fun although the pressure and demand for taking care of the customer was definitely an issue due to lack of consistency between managements. The hardest part of the job was the level of stress and the lack of support from peers, especially after we worked so hard on someone's account and they gave us a bad review but the learning about new resources and being able to have someone leave the call satisfied was very nice."
"Sprint",",Sprint is an amazing work place with growing opportunities. Working at sprint as increased my customer service skills and help me gain some knowledge in the sales field.

"Uber",",The best part about this company is that you work when you want and can. It has its flaws since it is a newish idea. But overall its a good part time side job."
"Uber",",I have met many different people.  I drive people to their designated locations. I really enjoy working for them it gives me the opportunity to meet new faces."
"Uber",",I am writing this review because I was forced to do so what I didn't like about Uber is being self-employed. Other than that is a great place to work while finding another job."
"Uber",",i drive all types of people and give excellent service you are your own boss uber lets you work on your time and you are allowed to deny any one great company"
"Uber",",The marketing and promotions team for UBER is amazing. You get to choose where and when you work and got to attend amazing events to promote UBER."
"Uber",",Great flexibility in ability to set your own hours and earn as much as you would like. Good way to improve your scheduling and resourcefulness skills."
"Uber",",A typical day starts with making sure your vehicle is running and looking one hundred percent, that you're prepared for any minor emergencies (flashlight, roadside assistance, emergency phone numbers, insurance information, etc.) and that you have your decals and permits. Once you are ready, your day consists of picking up and delivering your passengers as efficiently, comfortably and safely as possible. I end my day by tracking my expenses, deductions, and inspecting my vehicle for anything that needs to be addressed."
"Uber",",I get to meet many different types of people. I love driving around getting to know the city in so many ways. This job gives me so much flexibility to spend time with my family. I also can go to school at anytime and still have a second job."
"Uber",",I use it as an extra bit of income form time to time"
"Uber",",but no tips"
"Uber",",It's not always worth it. "
"Uber",",I like the hours and the flexibility "
"Uber",",But an hour working during rush hour may be slightly more than my hourly pay after you factor in gas and milage and car wear and tear it may not be worth more than a typical retail job."
"Uber",",I enjoy meeting new people and going on an adventure, for most of my riders who's destination was out of town enjoyed how excited I was with the trip to go someplace new. I loved being able to get my money deposited in my account right away."

"Uber",",Uber is a good part time job to earn extra money.  I enjoy driving with Uber.  You can work when you want and however long you want to as well. The hardest part of the job is when someone has canceled a ride at the last minute when you have already arrived at their destination."
"Uber",",great job for making extra cash don't try to make living off of this because the wear and tear are not worth the headache. also you never know who is going to give you a horrible rating."
"Uber",",Always on the job love everything I do and also love helping others.also I learned to be patient and humbled on the job hardest part of the job was dealing with toxicated people but I'm used to it,so it really didn't get to me like that but I loved every job I had which was an amazing experience for me."
"Uber",",Uber and other TNC options are great for a ""side hustle."" Lots of flexibility and the most popular times for rides are on the fringe of normal work hours (commutes, nights, weekends). However, the wages are not sustainable as a full time career."
"Uber",",They do not car at all about the drivers that drive for them. taking into to account all expense and withholding your own taxes you only earn an average of 20 cents a mile."
"Uber",",Enjoyable work, meeting a lot of new people and seeing new parts of the city. Flexible schedule and decent pay. Did not interact much with Uber employees, but were friendly and helpful. Typically would drive for 8 hours a day and meet new people as well as have some down time when waiting for a ride to perform other tasks. The hardest part of the job was convincing myself to go to work, since there was no schedule or expectation that I would work any particular day. Having to pay for my own gas and car maintenance became a drag after a while, and I put about 30,000 miles on my personal car in a year just driving for Uber."
"Uber",",The normal day working for UBER would be spent outside walking up to livery Cabs, green cabs, and anyone with a TLC license and suggesting they join UBER."
"Uber",",This is a convenient way to make a small amount of money if you have a car. Very low pay after uber's percentage, fuel, vehicle maintenance, and taxes. I wouldn't recommend driving for uber."
"Uber",",love driving around picking up people. but it puts a lot of miles on your car and you pay your own gas which sucks. i love the freedom that these companies offer. plenty of driving make good many but they work 50-70 hours a week. thats not healthy or good for a normal life style. i recommend people get a full time job, 30-40 hours a week then drive part time or week ends. uber offers two bonus every week, one bonus is M-Thursday for 30-80 bucks if you meet a # of ride requirement. then theirs a weekend requirement for about the same. both are reachable mostly. but harder to meet when working full time."
"TRANZACT","Several different locations.  Each one very different.  Has a good culture base but needs to be reflected in each office.  Very smart people on tech side.  Very competitive on sales side.  Has the ability to be great."
"TRANZACT",",enjoy working here; great folks; like the culture and the management;"
"TRANZACT",",nice events for the employees; good place to refer friends and family"
"TRANZACT",",Highly recommend"
"TRANZACT",",Be to work on time.  Limited training.  Also, you learned as you went along day to day data entry.  Most days same routine.  Other days you learn new ways of entering bills of lading accordance to new clients specifications.  As co-workers we strongly helped each.  Good team work."
"TRANZACT",",Was not a positive work environment, I would rather leave this blank.  It was a new company, that needed some guidance on getting the business off the ground."
"TRANZACT",",Everyone is very busy doing their own work but the days go by quickly.  Depending on which management you work under, you are not micromanaged as long as the work is done."
"TRANZACT",",This company likes to periodically load up on employees and then lay off, it is actually apart of their business model. Stay away"

"TRANZACT",",I would not recommend this company. "
"TRANZACT",",The worked was already batched and prepared to keying and we entered it into the computer"
"T. Rowe Price","If you are an up and coming finance major then T. Rowe Price is an excellent place to work. They promote a healthy atmosphere of putting the client first and they go out of their way to give their employees good benefits and accommodations."
"T. Rowe Price",",Unfortunately that is not enough to lessen the high levels of stress involved in the investment field. Between hard deadlines for trades and frustrated investors this will take a heavy toll on you if you are not a very strong willed person. Entry level is almost exclusively customer service phone positions and they can be very challenging. Luckily I worked through the tough times and transitioned to several other departments that all offer great skills and opportunities."
"T. Rowe Price",",In short, T. Rowe Price is a great company that is admittedly a bit behind the times. You would be fortunate to work for them but just prepare for a very stressful environment, heavy overtime, and occasional weaknesses in leadership. The wages do not feel as competitive as they should but the extra benefits help balance it out."
"T. Rowe Price",",Interesting Place to work. but some departments do not  encourage career development it makes it hard for ambitious employees to move up the corporate ladder."
"T. Rowe Price",",Fantastic company to work for, great benefits, limited upward mobility in FL office.  Typical day consisted of fielding inbound phone calls of clients and prospective clients to bring assets into T. Rowe Price"
"T. Rowe Price",",Excellent company to work for, learn, and have work life balance. Depending on career interest T. Rowe has many paths to travel. management is open and helpful."
"T. Rowe Price",",T. Rowe Price is an absolutely great place to work.  Employees are very friendly.  Fringe benefits are very good.  Leader was great.  Very helpful."
"T. Rowe Price",",T. Rowe Price is an excellent company to grow and develop your skill and knowledge in the investment world. I highly recommend anyone who wants to start somewhere in the investment world to apply for T. Rowe. However, the company has a lot of catching up to do with industry standards and trends."
"T. Rowe Price",",Good place to work but very little communication through teams. There is little to no communication between teams working on the same project. There is even less communication between management to the teams."
"T. Rowe Price",",Great company to work for with advancement opportunities and generous benefits. It can be challenging in the beginning to understand the IT infrastructure and to establish yourself. But the coworkers are very helpful."
"T. Rowe Price",",Best company I have worked for!  Great work environment, co-workers, management team, and numerous opportunities for continuous learning, training, and education.  Solid work/life balance as long as you were efficient and a good time manager.  Easy to move up if you network appropriately."
"T. Rowe Price",",My days here are really enjoyable. I really like the people and the atmosphere. Work/Life balance is really important to the management."
"T. Rowe Price",",There could be more vision in terms of their strategic technology plan, but overall the firm is a good place to work.  They have good benefits packages, and for the most part are good about work/life balance."
"T. Rowe Price",",Company taught me a lot about corp culture - great place to . I learned alot about how a company can teach you about life. "
"T. Rowe Price",",Nothing in life comes easy... you must put in the work to achieve your dreams."
"T. Rowe Price",",I worked for a group of writers who were a very interesting.  I met some great friends there, and learned a bit about stocks.  I made travel arrangements for the writers, kept vacation requests, etc.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact that everyone got along."
"T. Rowe Price",",Great benefits, and an awesome atmosphere. The management and compensation are lacking, and not up to par with other companies in the financial industry."
"T. Rowe Price",",great company to work for. Really good benefits including large 401k contributions. Just have to be able to deal with many different projects and responsibilities at one time. Opportunities are there, you just have to go after and get them."
"T. Rowe Price",",Advancement is more time driven than merit driven - regardless of your skill set, you will not be considered for a promotion until X months/years in your current role."
"T. Rowe Price",",Work life balance was solid with relatively flexible hours and a decent company culture."
"T. Rowe Price",",There is a lack of accountability though, so employees are able to skate by without any risk of punishment."
"T. Rowe Price",",Good and stable company to grow your career in Finance domain. Nice work environment and people to work with."
"T. Rowe Price",",It was very corporate and quiet. Every weekend there was work and never had a day off. Management was never seen"
"T. Rowe Price",",It was nice working with T Rowe Price. Warm Culture. Co workers were very helpful specially Manager. Though there is still some discrimination between contractors and Full Time but I didn't have to face this in my team. Team was supportive and helpful."
"T. Rowe Price",",Everyday is different and brings various challenges as per job. In order to face those challenges there are limitations of what can be done and what can not be done by contractors. knowledge and information shared within department is very limited. Lacks appreciation and credit given for the work done effectively and in timely fashion."
"T. Rowe Price",",I loved working for T. Rowe Price, however I had an opportunity to move to Alaska and took the opportunity which I followed."
"athenahealth","Athena is a great place to work because of a google-esque environment. However, you have to be willing to pivot on a dime, and be adaptable since things can change without any real transparency into these changes."
"athenahealth",",This company is trying to get into the hospital space. Development is arrogant and consistently ignore internal subject matter experts when designing the system. Senior leadership tells the CEO what he wants to hear and if he really knew or cared what was going on the many hospital clients they signed would be touting their go lives which you see nothing in the media about. The company story and hospital product show well so long as its someone who has worked in a hospital before and can avoid the landmines that come up during evaluation. This company pays decent but is consolidating operations to Boston and unless you went to Harvard or MIT forget about having your ideas heard or being anything less than a gopher for the ivy elite. Would recommend suitors looking for a career pass on this company."
"athenahealth",",Productive days precerting patient for needed procedures. Although not in a clinical setting, you still felt as though you were helping with patient care by obtaining the authorization for the much needed test or surgery."
"athenahealth",",I truly enjoyed the work I did with AthenaHealth, Inc. The management was great and easy to work with. Multiple time I was approached and given a new workflow and a promotion. I never had to ask for more challenging work, they always found me and I love it. I was in the remittance department, and the only problem I came across was the ability to leave the department in order to learn within the overall company. I only left the company because I relocated, and I have regretted leaving every day since."
"athenahealth",",This employer has closed the Birmingham location, I was laid off from this company.     This business has closed the Birmingham location, the main office is in Maine."
"athenahealth",",Flexible working hours. More focussed on getting the job done rather than the hours put in. "
"athenahealth",",Learnt to set up successful QA teams from ground up, both onshore and offshore, managing the teams and daily QA activities both in the Agile and Waterfall SDLCs, introducing ongoing improvements to improve the quality of the products. "
"athenahealth",",Hardest part of the job was to meet the deliverables and deadlines and maintaining the quality while working with limited QA resources."
"athenahealth",",Most enjoyable part of the job was the work culture, flexibility to work from home and getting to learn new things everyday."
"athenahealth",",Working with clients to schedule and reschedule medical appointment's.  "
"athenahealth",",Working off of two computer screens, learning how to multitask."
"athenahealth",",Management is great, but too many people who try's to micromanage."
"athenahealth",",It was a great transition job that I enjoyed very much and nothing to complain. Too bad it was just a contract project that I knew the dateline would come one day and I had to move on to another permanent one."
"athenahealth",",Great culture and benefits.The company offers nice facilities, and co-workers are friendly and helpful. However, it is difficult to balance work and life sometimes due to frequent travels."
"athenahealth",",Learned a lot about business operations. Great group of people to work with. Spend 10 years in both account and development roles. Business leaders are smart and worked hard."
"athenahealth",",There are two floors at the Ponce City Market office. 98% of the top floor are whites and 98% of the bottom floor is black. You be the judge."
"athenahealth",",One big focus on our team over the past year has been collaboration. A responsive workflow requires all sorts of disciplines and the closer we can integrate UI designers, front-end developers and UX, the better the end product will ultimately be. In the spirit of, ""the sum is greater than its parts"" here's no better way to think of solutions than to get an extra pair of eyes on it."
"athenahealth",",It's an ok place for a first time job. I would not recommend this company for a minority who takes their career serious and would like true advancement."
"athenahealth",",This is a great fast paced company. They offer a lot of benefits and opportunities to learn. I think its a great platform to get into the healthcare technology field."
"athenahealth",",I wish I could give you a ""typical day"" but honestly it was just all about getting work done, roughly 40 hours a week with crunch time as needed.  Junior developers are both gifted and cursed in that regard: they do what they're assigned."
"athenahealth",",athenahealth is a middle of the road kind of company - there are much better and far worse places to work. During NHO they really overhype the advancement opportunities that will be available to you. I mean, you can ""advance"", but they are almost always lateral moves...no ladder climbing here. Also, their pay is a slap in the face for what you're expected to do. I'm simply putting in my time for the experience, but have been seeking employment elsewhere since I started. For the most part, the employees are pretty cool and the atmosphere is very laid back, tech startup-y. We have monthly Happy Hours where beer is served and sometimes the beer cart will come around just because. Lots of free lunches because we're always in the weeds and they try to show appreciation. Management is a joke. They're really just a middle man between you and the higher ups. They'll hear your grievances and that's about it. Also, be prepared to shuck and jive and kiss a lot of a s s if you want to advance at all - laterally or upward. We were told week 1 it's about your brand - before all else."
"athenahealth",",Then they expect you to do three jobs and get paid for one and when you get run down management dont care about you I am actively looking for a new job and can't believe they are allowed to have managers like that"
"athenahealth",",Everyone at the work place is really chill and of productive at the same time. There's dogs all over the building and that is a good thing, besides all that the work they have me doing is pretty simple stuff, inventory,computer re image,and customer interaction."
"athenahealth",",Its an okay company if you want to get started just be careful of some of the managers as they tend to micro manage and if they feel you are a threat they will do anything to get you out."
"athenahealth",",train clients via phone and company software"
"athenahealth",",Hardest part is making sure the client understands the process"
"athenahealth",",People at the company are amazing."
"athenahealth",",Most enjoyable part is completing a project on time"
"athenahealth",",Excellent place to work and the training is great"
"athenahealth",",Your managers are always willing to help and assist in your projects"
"athenahealth",",Typical day at work varies there are 8 hour cases or more than one case patient at a time"

"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Great experience, coworkers and mentors are all very helpful and the work is constantly changing and always interesting. Events are held on campus frequently."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",Really nice to work here... a lot of space for advancement, management is awesome, coworkers are awesome and helpful. Work life balance is good and the coffee is the best"
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",All colleagues are very friendly and helpful, never had a issue with a supervisor . Pay is great and work schedules are pretty flexible. he community of the workplace is great the company provides several lunch ins through out the year."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",Excellent work experience in PNNL which has good work and life balance, great management and enjoyable working schedule."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",I worked as an intern for a summer at PNNL and learned a lot from the work I was given. I was also allowed to go and listen to talks given by traveling faculty and was able to gain valuable work experience."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",Depending on your group, you can have very interesting work. But in many parts of the lab, funding is very tough. And a long-term career path (at least in the sections with which I am familiar) is extremely hard - I know many senior staff who have left."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",Management wants to have its cake and eat it, too.  They treat scientists/engineers like hourly employees, enforcing charging policies not sustainable for any reasonable work/life balance while expecting salaried work.  Definitely a political minefield, as well.  Look at the wrong person with a perceived wrong look, and good luck finding work in that group again."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",On the other hand, if you know the right people, you can make moves around the lab to do virtually anything you would want, given someone is paying for it."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",Another problem is that they expect post-graduates to be short term help, not really expecting them to stay on as permanent staff.  This is in direct conflict with promises made at job interview."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",Perhaps I had a bad experience, but other people have said similar things."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is very good at producing results, but not very good an retaining researchers. There is a significant turn around because people are hired without a plan to pay them. This would not be a problem if there was a way for those with funding to find employees that fit their needs, but there are not so people with funding will hire new people."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",The facilities are excellent and there is plenty of opportunity to do some real science. Initially things will be a bit slow because there is nobody who's job it is to train you in the use of the equipment and you are not allowed to use the equipment until you are trained. I recommend turning to people who are in your group. They will be able to help you navigate the minor pittfals there are and avoid internal politics if it should ever become relevant."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",Overall it is not a terrible place to work, as long as you are realistic about you situation."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",Innovative operation-EH&S served all Directorates,  Excellent EH&S staff.  Enjoyed providing solutions to EH&S challenges across the organization."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",I liked this job a lot because I learned in depth proteomics by doing lab work for a Chemical Proteomic Group. The group that I worked for is very helpful in guiding me to do laboratory tasks by training me one on one."

"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",PNNL is a widely recognized public laboratory that prides itself on hiring professionals and subject matter experts to drive their mission of science innovation, research and development. This particular laboratory located in Richland, Washington is one of the largest in the United States employing over 4000 staff."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",It is not a bad place to work especially if you are passionate about the job.  I was in operations and it is really just about maintaining the status quo.  Typically all you need to do is log in and make sure all the lights are still on and then monitor your inbox for the rest of the day.  Occasionally there are some administrative tasks or projects to work on.  I learned a lot about operations while I was here and the people do try hard and are probably some of the smartest people on the planet.  There are some strong personalities but for the most part people are pleasant."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",I have worked in worse places but man am I bored."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",Designed projects from inception to final product and novel circuit designs. Worked with nuclear physicists on unique, cutting edge nuclear detection circuitry."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",PNNL is a great place whch balances research and industrial development works and provides a lot of flexibility and career potential."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",My days are spent typically designing PC boards and helping design novel circuitry for radiation detection. I also help scientists with documentation for proposals and papers."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",I have leaned a LOT about radiation, and how it is detected, from large amounts to very tiny amounts. I also learned how to design circuitry to detect this radiation."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",Our management tends to be rather ""hands off"" which I consider a good thing."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",The people I work with have got to be the best part of my job - I only have a BSEET in electronics, and I work with PhD level folks who treat me like an equal - they are some of the nicest people I have EVER worked with or for!"
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",Hardest part of my job is everything is charged to a project, and if you don't have a project to charge to, you don't get paid!"
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",Best part: Again, the people I work with,"
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",If not for management that was ""good old boys"", this would have been an ideal job. It is intellectually alive, fun people, well run, but very old fashioned in its values."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",I was an independent Contractor for PNNL providing maintenance of US SLD Megaport Initiative in the port of Cortes. I was enjoyable and challenge experience."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",The SULI internships are great! They allow for students to become familiar with particular technology subjects, meet a variety of experts, network with peers, and learn how to perform experiments."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",PNNL is a great place for an internship as a student. Getting to work closely with scientists at the national laboratory provides a great opportunity to learn about a variety of technical fields. The quality of staff is great, although projects tend to move slowly."
"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory",",This is undoubtedly the best place I have ever worked! They ""get it"" when it comes to taking care of their employees. They understand safety, family obligations, and having a life outside of work. Hence,  their employees work hard for the company and are enjoyable to be around."
"Yodle","Working ay Yodle was a great sales experience for someone who has never done sales.The training program is very good. I think you they should give more training on the sales floor."
"Yodle",",This was a good launching off job into the corporate sales environment. It very much had a ""start up"" environment with all the bells and whistles in tow. They expected you to make 150 calls a day which was more quantity versus quality."
"Yodle",",Yodle is a pretty fun place to work if cold calling and a constant daily challenge. Although if you like to work at your own pace it may not be ideal as you are required 160 dials per day as an average with 160 being the daily goal. Amazing culture and all off the people get along great!"
"Yodle",",This is an excellent place to get your feet wet and learn about the ins and outs of digital marketing B2B. I was here for 3 years and 9 months, had the opportunity to work hard and get the most out of my sales. The management gave employees the opportunity to work overtime and a lot of employers don't allow that, so to me, that was an advantage, when I had the opportunity to do so. "
"Yodle",",The benefits are average, they offer a 401K plan, but when I was there they didn't match it."
"Yodle",",The hardest part of the job is getting into the mental mind set of cold calling every day for 8 hours, when you are mentally there everything else is easy and setting meetings is very smooth."
"Yodle",",The culture at Yodle is and always has been very casual, since it is over the phone calling.  I always feel my best when I dress professionally, but you make it what it is and many people find that they have an input on what types of events and games happen. "
"Yodle",",I learned that you make it what it is, the more open minded you are with sales, the more you get out of the position and the more you learn and grow. The sky is the limit here, but don't burn yourself out, it's important to go slow and come to work mentally refreshed."
"Yodle",",You will be measured on phone calls, demo opportunities created, and your close rate.  If you succeed in one vertical - you will stay with it.  Call, call, call!!"
"Yodle",",- A typical work day will consisted of engaging with a team and feeding off of others self motivation to achieve a collective goal."
"Yodle",",- I learned the art of over the phone sales and how to manage a team that hit sales goals while training them new material."
"Yodle",",-As a manager I learned numerous techniques for enhancing individuals performance and creating an positive environment."
"Yodle",",- My fellow trainers and sales mangers created a team which was bonded together by shared experience of  cold calling"
"Yodle",",- The hardest part of any over the phone sales job is hearing the no's its how you deal with adversity which makes you a strong salesperson."
"Yodle",",-Inspiring others brought me the most joy in this position, teaching someone with no sales experience how to close a deal is life changing."
"Yodle",",I want to make it very clear, THIS IS A CALL CENTER JOB. 150ish calls a day is normal. However, outside of the call center aspect, Yodle's entire culture is to make sure the employees are happy and energized. Several times a week the managers just stop everyone in whatever they are doing if energy is low to play a game or something to get everyone laughing and moving again. And the training is far and away the best youll get in a call center. Yodle is DESPERATE for you to succeed, all you have to do is listen and have thick enough skin to do the calls."
"Yodle",",Great environment for day to day work and interactions with coworkers.  Not much room for advancement however.  Teams are well run and organized and compensation is more than fair.  Office is big and well lit with natural light."
"Yodle",",Seems like a cool work environment on the outside and on paper, but it is not enough to hide the fact that the days are long, and unsatisfying.  Hard to get behind the product that you are selling."
"Yodle",",Working at Yodle Inc., has been one to the greatest work experiences I've had. It has allowed me the opportunity to develope and grow in a demanding workplace."
"Yodle",",Took really good care of their employees however work/life balance was difficult. Although the job was strenuous it has prepared me to function in high pressure sales."
"Yodle",",great work environment. There are always new things going on to keep the employees engaged and happy. It makes the day go by and also keeps the morale high. In retention client can be very difficult but you have to know how to separate that from your personal life and it all works out."
"Yodle",",The hardest part about the job was the roller coaster sales experience. Bouncing back from rejections but my co-workers and management were all so full of positivity and never ending support. I actually learned a lot about myself at Yodle. It was a very competitive environment which challenged me to be better and achieve my goals."
"Yodle",",The Culture at Yodle is amazing. Our goal each day is to provide the best client experience that we can offer. I teach clients' how to use our program that will help them market their business online."
"Yodle",",My favorite part of my job is that the customers I assist have recently wanted to cancel the program but after I help them establish a marketing strategy they give us another chance."
"Yodle",",There are many online survey from my clients that rave about their experience with me."
"Yodle",",Its a starter sales job. It has a very low retention rate of employees of longer then  months, in sales. But its a good job to cut your teeth on. "
"Yodle",",Unfortunately past experience isn't really helpful."
"Yodle",",Yodle provides decent entry level positions for those seeking sales or customer service careers. A few free perks are also provided, such as daily free lunch."
"Yodle",",Yodle took one of the most difficult and frustrating types of career, telemarketing, and surrounded it with a culture that promotes positivity and happiness. The commission is the best i've ever seen in relation to revenue, the training is literally 2-3 months, and any time you need help, you can get a one on one with a manager with about 30 minutes notice that same day. You have to be willing to put in the hours of perfecting the art of the deal, getting down to the details like your inflection, pauses, breaths and interruptions on the phone. If you don't commit yourself to be great, you WILL WASH OUT."
"Yodle",",The company was purchased by Web.com in February so the culture changed dramatically and the promise of my promotion became non-existent.  If the company had not been purchased I would still work for Yodle."
"Yodle",",The turnover is very high. You're roped in with empty promises and a fun atmosphere only to be blindsided by realization that making a decent living is a stretch. Management spends the majority of their time selling you on the opportunity that you have. In reality only a couple of individuals even come close to the monetary expectations set during your interview."
"Yodle",",A typical day includes sitting in a grey cubicle making as many cold calls as possible to prospects that have been contacted every two months for the last 4 years. The toughest part of the job (besides being able to pay your bills) is keeping positive day after day."
"Yodle",",Most don't make it 3 months."
"Yodle",",amazing company to work for. great work and life balance. great managers and helpful. Always pushing you to motivate you and take your career to the next level."
"Yodle",",There was a ping ping table!  Week long, all expense paid sales training program in Austin, TX.  I learned how to hard sale clients over the phone.  Competitive environment."
"CapTech Consulting","Great if you are young or a developer"
"CapTech Consulting",",Work hard, play hard"
"CapTech Consulting",",Great people, good pay, "
"CapTech Consulting",",Expect to work GT 40 hrs/week, but its not crazy."
"CapTech Consulting",",Great place for young professionals and those starting out in the consulting field.  Fun culture and a variety of projects."
"CapTech Consulting",",Truly flat organization. Incredibly smart people. Most collaborative company I've worked for in my career. 0 politics and 0 egos. Other companies may promise work/life balance but CapTech delivers. I would highly recommend CapTech to potential employees looking to work on the coolest projects with the best and brightest in their fields."
"CapTech Consulting",",Demanding work environment but plenty of room for advancement. Long hours but plenty of variety in work experience and clients."
"CapTech Consulting",",Well managed company that capitalizes on its IT Management Consulting strengths to add value for its' clients.  CapTech has clearly established three core practice areas while maintaining flexibility."
"CapTech Consulting",",CapTech has a lot of great people and some interesting projects. There are opportunities to be heard and create change within the organization. The organization is growing quickly and, while there are some growing pains, they are starting to figure it out. "
"CapTech Consulting",",CapTech is a full time consultancy and not a staffing or contracting firm. I think a lot of people overlook them because they are not as well known outside of the Richmond, VA area. This means that even when you are not on a client you are still working on learning new things and augmenting the business development teams.  "
"CapTech Consulting",",Every office has a different culture but the people are skilled in their work and excited about the company."
"CapTech Consulting",",Everyone is extremely smart and a lot of people are self-starters. There are many opportunities to grow and find your place at the company."
"CapTech Consulting",",I currently work for CapTech and really like it! The leadership is great and I have learned so much since starting there. I have also gotten to do some differernt roles such as Business Development, and lead all the Charity work for our office in Washington, DC."
"Paycom","I've worked with Paycom for over 6 years and cannot express the gratitude I have for the company and family I've gained throughout my experience. I've learned more about myself and grown in a way professionally that I never thought possible. The culture is phenomenal and the opportunity for growth is continuous if you are willing to work hard. The company is extremely fast-paced and constantly growing and changing. It takes a special personality to fit well however if you are able to adapt, you won't be sorry for the benefits the company and it's people are able to provide."
"Paycom",",This company pretends to be a progressive company but they are not. They have extremely old third party software they use that does not ever work correctly. You get written up for everything; if you stand up for yourself, suggest new processes or if you're literally one minute late, one time. Opinions are not valued and the management does not listen to people in the department doing the day to day work they do what works for them which is put more work on the people who are already overworked and underpaid. Very negative environment that will follow you home."
"Paycom",",I am very grateful full to have found Paycom. It is a great place to start a career. I look forward to growing with the company."
"Paycom",",They grind you to the bone. New hire training doesn't prepare you at all for the position. Co-workers were great, and did help answer questions. When they were busy, I would ask my team leader, and their response would be ""Who else have you asked?"" Starting pay is lousy."
"Paycom",",The company does some nice things for the employees, but only because they know how much they over-work their employees."
"Paycom",",Good corporate culture, however they burn you out quickly.  Extremely high turnover due to cycling through recent graduates.  This is a good place to work as a young individual, but it can be hard to find a good work life balance."
"Paycom",",I worked at Paycom for a while as a Paycom Specialist, and the job was different than what I expected. I was told that I would build relationships with clients, and that is what attracted me to the job."
"Paycom",",However, there is a ton of technology to learn and it is rather frustrating at times. These clients that you are supposed to be building relationships with will be very frustrated when they call you 75% of the time, at least in my personal experience. "
"Paycom",",To be fair, they warned me it would be hard, but I was under the impression intellectually difficult, instead of emotionally draining. "
"Paycom",",The company is a good company and they do offer good benefits. I could have explored potentially transferring into another job or department, and I think I would have been happy. "
"Paycom",",So, just be aware of what you are getting yourself into. "
"Paycom",",Also, since I've left, I've had guys from there message me on Facebook...... It's a very ""young"" culture. Be ready for a lot of people to try to ask you out ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"Paycom",",I mean, no judgment, take what you can get."
"Paycom",",The day starts with checking emails and reviewing tickets submitted by PAYCOM Specialists. I have learned a lot about the software development life cycle and the results of a effective collaborative team working together to provide software solutions to customers. The most challenging part of the job is priority management of projects as it can change frequently throughout the development life cycle. The most enjoyable is the people of PAYCOM and their positive supportive attitude towards assisting each other to obtain the main objective."
"Paycom",",The best culture in any place I've worked. I enjoyed learning more about the financial industry, including payroll and taxes. "
"Paycom",",There are several departments within the giant buildings of Paycom. Each department is divided into teams of about 10 specialists supervised by a team lead. It was nice to have the support of a team, especially in such a large company. "
"Paycom",",Also, the year end party is totally worth the hard work you do during year end."
"Paycom",",It was a great company to work for. I did not work there long so I don't have much else to say about it. I obtained good skills and learned how to use Access."
"Paycom",",Productive and fun work place. There is opportunity to advance at Paycom but you will have to work hard to get there. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that you get to work with, they become more like family over time than coworkers. You will have a chance to be creative and innovative here and will learn that the sky is the limit."
"Paycom",",Paycom is somewhere that you can join and build an amazing career.  I have been here for almost five years and watched us build out our campus, enhance our growth paths, start new teams and all in all become the best place in Oklahoma to work!! As a hiring manager I am very proud of the standards of excellence we have.  It can be very frustrating to the people who don't make the cut and probably more so for those that make the cut but quickly realize that they just can't keep the pace of Paycom. However our standards allow us to hire and retain great people. "
"Paycom",",We are growing like crazy and with growth comes many opportunities to shine.  Some people fall behind or just fall out but the best of the best have opportunities like they never thought possible!  So many of my friends have been promoted and we are all making more money. Now that being said, not everyone makes it.  We are doing amazing things at light speed so occasionally people realize that Paycom is not for them."
"Paycom",",Here is what I love the most about Paycom.  Our leaders are truly committed to their people.  We have lots of training programs that help us be better.  We have annual reviews where we use our own system and get feedback and vision for the future.  I have worked many places before that you had no idea what you needed to do to get promoted.  Our founder and CEO cares about everyone. He will eat lunch in the cafeteria with a group of people, he plays basketball with everyone in the league.  I know he has high expectations but that is one of the key reasons Paycom is where we are today!!"
"Paycom",",I enjoy the gym."
"Paycom",",  "
"Paycom",", It has helped me and many others lose weight and get in shape but not take away from family time!  We requested healthy lunch options in our survey and we now have a healthy option every day!  I made a goal to be in shape before the next Year End Party!  YEP is another awesome perk where we are all taken to Dallas for an awesome event at the Omni and Paycom pays for our dinner and hotel!!"
"Paycom",",IF you can earn a spot on the Paycom team then you should jump on board and make the most of it.  We are definitely going places and I know I am personally very excited to be along for the ride!"
"Paycom",",  "
"Paycom",",Paycom has a boatload of challenges to deal with as it tries to grow into a respectable corporation.  At a high level, the corporate culture is nothing short of toxic and like many other reviewers have called out, you are absolutely expected to ""drink the koolaid.""  A perfect example of this is that I was actually told by a business leader not to discuss market challenges with other managers because they ""don't sanction excuses"" and ""my team can't handle the truth.""  Rather than leadership being confident enough to talk about issues honestly and transparently and actually deal with them head on, they prefer to sweep things under the rug.  If you are lucky, you might get told ""this is a safe environment where you can be honest"" then get blasted when you do tell the truth.  They are not open to other's ideas or new ways of doing things and typically demand people accomplish work via the ""professional insanity"" method (you know...keep doing things the same way and expect different results).  One of many examples I could provide is that I had a strategy meeting scheduled with executive leadership to try to fix an entirely broken compensation system for a certain employee population that was cancelled and rescheduled 12 times.  I eventually had to give up and acknowledge they had no intention of fixing internal problems even though that was the spiel I was given.  This tells you how much they care about their employees.  There is a sickening, fear-based leadership style that pervades all levels and is spear-headed by ownership and most team members at the C-level.  Throughout all"
"Paycom",",  "
"Paycom",", internal business units there are a handful of people that can make life miserable for everyone else but apparently this is perfectly acceptable and in some cases encouraged if one is fortunate enough to make ""teacher's pet"" status.  Additionally, backstabbing and tattle-telling is another perfectly acceptable means of jockeying for position in leadership ranks as well.  Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of bright, hard-working, and honest people that work there, but unfortunately this is ruined by a handful that are allowed to act incredibly unprofessionally.  Another challenge has to do with pay practices.  Although they will pay leaders quite well, they simply do not pay competitively for many entry and mid-level roles.  They are rigid around this policy and are just now waking up to the reality they may need to pay something semi-competitive for certain roles that they struggle to fill due to a high volume of rejected offers.  Additionally, they truly believe paying someone in NYC or Silicon Valley the exact same for a role as what they pay in Oklahoma is a winning compensation strategy.  Anyone with national hiring experience knows that is ignorant.  Another callout by several reviewers is that they force employees to post positive company reviews to compensate for negative reviews they receive on multiple sites.  This is 100% true and accurate, particularly in sales and recruiting.  Leadership would argue that they don't hold a gun to anyone's head and force them to do this, but I don't know what else to call it when you are repeatedly pressured to leave a positive review until you get it done.  Paycom has been very fortunate to have a boatload of financial success which they continue to count on moving forward, but when this starts to plateau, they will be faced with a sad reality.  Although C-levels would do their best to convince you they are a ""fully established"" and ""mature"" organization this is far from the truth and they have a lot of growing to do.  Overall, they suffer from a bad case of corporate ""little-man"" syndrome and don't appear to care enough to want to change things.  Many people will read this review and immediately chalk it up to ""sour grapes,"" but every thing stated is factual and could be verified by a slew of other employees if they didn't fear losing their job (the brave ones would validate it anyways).  If given the opportunity to work for them, do yourself a favor and pass.  Perhaps 10-15 years from now (if they are still around and have cleaned house in the leadership ranks), it could be worth a shot.  Paycom:  ""They may have dollars, but they just don't have any sense."""
"Paycom",",  "
"Paycom",",Working at Paycom has not been what I expected. I LOVE working here. The culture here is amazing. The company goes out of its way to make sure everyone is comfortable here. When I first started, I was welcomed with open arms by everyone on my team, now I feel like I have another family. It is a work hard, play hard kind of company. The benefits are amazing as well. Paycom knows how to treat their employees. I would 100% recommend the company to everyone and anyone."
"Paycom",",I haven't been at Paycom very long, but in my short time so far, I have discovered how much of an impact I'm able to make on our customers. Our business model really allows us to identify ways to grow and continue to challenge ourselves. While the work may never stop, and the days may be long sometimes, it's a sign of a growing company and eventually that gets better - just stick with it. If you're looking for cushy, chill, and laid-back, you aren't going to thrive. So many opportunities for growth and managers are available and accessible."
"Paycom",",If you are looking for a long term fit, then Paycom is the right place for you. Working here has given me a new confidence to know I can accomplish great things! I love the atmosphere, culture and how appreciated you feel being part of this team! This is definitely a family atmosphere and one where the employee comes first!"
"Paycom",",I absolutely love working at Paycom HQ. We are constantly being celebrated and rewarded for our successes. My favorite thing about work is that my coworkers are also my friends and they all want me to be the absolutely best that I can be! My manager cares about my personal achievements and continually seeks out ways to mentor me and development into a successful professional."
"Paycom",",I would recommend Paycom to anyone who wishes to find success!"
"Paycom",",Paycom has been the best job I've had since graduating college 5 years ago. There is incredible opportunity for advancement to be had if you work hard. With an on-site gym and catered lunches, Paycom really caters to their employees and wants them to be happy."
"Paycom",",The culture is what drew me to Paycom and the reason I still love working here. Everyone at Paycom has an attitude of servitude, not only with customers but among co-workers as well and that is rare to find I think. At Paycom, you jump right in. A lot is thrown your way the first year, but it's only because this is a fast-paced, constantly growing environment. I want to tell people about Paycom and how we can help their business. Using Paycom myself I know how great it is, so sharing that with others is fun. I would definitely recommend Paycom to my friends or anyone looking for a career you can be proud of!"
"Paycom",",I love working at Paycom because every day is different, and the culture is amazing. My team is like family, and that makes even a bad day worthwhile."
"Paycom",",During my tenure at Paycom, I have witnessed and experienced tremendous growth. The company has a leveling system in most every department, so it is obvious what needs to be accomplished in order to get a raise and move up."
"Paycom",",The leadership team is amazing and is always looking for ways to do more and better the organization as a whole. There are training courses for everyone within the organization. "
"Paycom",",If you are looking for a career where you have limitless opportunities with a high-growth company, I would highly recommend this organization."
"Paycom",",I'm a very hard worker and put my all into my work but Paycom doesn't care and your just a number. They talk all the time on how amazing they are but I disagree. I'm never one to complain but this was the worst job experience I've ever had, they made me doubt myself and all my colleagues feel the same way. If you take the job, you'll be super excited and pumped at first because they feed you this dream but two months in and you'll be living on pins and needles. Don't expect to have a life for at least a year, no lie. "

"GEICO","A typical day is filled with many phone calls to schedule vehicle inspection appointments for customers who have opened claims.  Over the years, I have learned the best routine for myself to be able to complete my daily tasks, and it is all about proper time-management.  I often find my co-workers look to me for advice when they have a process-related question rather than approaching management.  "
"GEICO",",Definitely a good place to start off, they pay very well and most of the supervisors care genuinely about their associates and want the to do well. They go out of their way to make sure you meet your goals to get promoted or get to the department you want to be."
"GEICO",",Geico has great benefits and great management, easy job, to do, my downfall was becoming ill before my one year mark unfortunately they couldn't hold my job."
"GEICO",",A typical day included rushing to try and get all the work done with a ton of caseload and unrealistic expectations. Lots of stress and low morale. Management feels pressure from above and sends that pressure downward to the lower employees. Horrible culture of trying to rise to the top by selling your soul to the employer. The hardest part is trying to keep up without breaking down. The most enjoyable part was going home."
"GEICO",",Geico tends to squeeze as much out of you at possible. The work/life balance is poor, in my opinion. You will really need to be devoted to your job if you plan to travel up the ladder. The entry level positions are much easier, but who wants to stay at the bottom. The job security is great. Unless you do some unethical things, it is hard to get fired. Come in and do your best and you will have a job, although if you arent good at your current position, you may get moved departments. I feel the upper level positions do not pay nearly enough for what is required of the employee. No matter how good you do, the mentality is always ""what have you done for me today"""
"GEICO",",Geico does pay well and has amazing perks, but it is not what you think. Geico looks out for who looks out for them. If it doesn""t benefit upper management they don't bother themselves with it. They do pay well and have amazing perks and career growth but for you to see the growth and perks it has to make sense to upper mangement and benefit them in some sort"
"GEICO",",Worst places to work.   They try to make it as fun as possible.  "
"GEICO",",Chances to move up but raises are small."
"GEICO",",Work load can be overwhelming, time  management is crucial"
"GEICO",",I have been an auto damage adjuster for over a decade with geico and have worked in every capacity offered to the claims adjuster.  Much has changed in this job over the last few years making it, in my opinion, not worth the high stress and anxiety that are now a daily struggle for most, if not all, adjusters I've worked with.  The freedom and empowerment that used to define this position are sadly gone for the most part.  In times past one had the freedom to choose Parts and extend rentals if truly necessary.  This has now been replaced with a more demanding robotic approach to estimating and managing of rental that makes the average adjuster extremely frustrated most of the time and feeling that they really cannot meet the needs of the customer.  The administrative red tape and documentation, along with recorded phone conversation (to supposedly grade quality of work) have made the job undoable and unbearable for most.  In the last 4 years much of our local work force has moved on or left (about 25% turnover annually) leaving a workload that is unbearable for the remaining adjusters.  With the exit of veteran adjusters, new inexperienced adjusters fill the vacancies left and they have little or no experience leading to its own problems.  Newer adjusters often feel like failures due to the impossible grading scale and rigidly high expectations leading to continued high turnover that seems unending.  Geico continues to sell claims in a massive way leading to overwork and very poor ""work life balance"".  Many, if not all adjusters will admit to working thru all lunches and breaks"
"GEICO",",  "
"GEICO",", are unknown due to the pressures to ""succeed"" which means just surviving the onslaught of work and claims that NEVER stop.  Broken promises of proper staffing and a future lightening of work are empty and unfulfilled at all times.  This leads to an emptiness and overwhelming feeling of failure that lead to leaving geico for those who don't want to be unhappy every working day.  Upper management seems to be unplugged and disinterested in the plights and struggles of the average adjuster.  Our claims director has an open door policy but has never visited the branches to check on anyone in a real way to get a feel or put a finger on the pulse or work environment of the average adjuster.  Most adjusters would be scared to say anything anyway so the problems continue.  As long as local management is not graded on turnover the problem and unhealthy work environment will continue.  If geico could appreciate truly how much money they could save by simply retaining good people it might be a different story.  It appears there is no change coming anytime soon."
"GEICO",",  "
"GEICO",",A typical day at work at GEICO can be a roller coaster. The job is not too difficult however it can be mentally draining at times. I learned a multitude of things during my tenure at GEICO, the main thing I focused on, however, was understanding. Becoming an understanding person can dissolve most any elevated situation. The management had its ups and downs, for the most part, everyone wanted you to succeed though. The culture of my job was really family oriented but just like with all situations like this, occasionally you had those who isolated but overall pretty tight knit teams. "
"GEICO",",The hardest part of the job just so happens to be the most enjoyable part of the job, working with irate people can be mentally draining and it can and is the hardest part of the job however its that same irate customer that makes the job enjoyable. Being able to calm someones fears is something that helps groom you into a better person as a whole and that by far was the most enjoyable part."
"GEICO",",I joined GEICO unsure exactly what would become of my time there. The first few years were amazing, they pay well, they have a great bonus structure, profit sharing, and benefits are all amazing, they have a great staff to help you and everyone is very approachable. There is plenty of room to advance. "
"GEICO",",I left because after four years of being in a call center it can be mentally exhausting. They are constantly making changes to goals and sales techniques. Just when you get comfortable with what you are doing they want to come in and change everything. If you can handle working in a call center then this is the best place in the area. It just wasn't for me."
"GEICO",",Great place to work "
"GEICO",",Management knew what it was doing"
"GEICO",",most supervisors were easy to approach"
"GEICO",",quality control was a moving target"
"GEICO",",only complaint was not understanding when needing to take time off for kids/medical issues. "
"GEICO",",enjoyed my coworkers and supervisor. Great benefits but the stress level was unbearable esp if you havent had previous medical issues before. I started getting migraines and was diagnosed with high blood pressure"
"GEICO",",I lobed the pay and benefits at GEICO however I did not like how you cannot ever miss any days even if you have to take your children to the hospital they have no leway and no exceptions which makes it hard for people who have children to work there."
"GEICO",",Geico really believe in a safe encouraging wok place for employees to thrive in. This is shown through their attention to detail in employee benefits to the time and patience that management puts into developing each individual."
"GEICO",",Extremely stressful job! One of closest renditions to modern day slavery that I can think of. Before I quit GEICO in June 2016 I began having panic attacks due to the high stress environment. I knew many collegues that suffered from anxiety, high blood pressure, and migraine headaches after being exposed to the GEICO culture."
"GEICO",",Very fun, fast paced environment.  Challenging, but rewarding.  Can be stressful at times, but they definitely pay well which makes up for the stress."
"GEICO",",Very fast-paced, positive work environment. Co workers are very supportive. Paid training and lots of work schedules available to fit anyone's need. After 6 months, eligibility of education reimbursement is available"
"GEICO",",Standard position where you have no input or voice on anything that happens. Expected to just do what you're told. Office politics takes place as usual"
"GEICO",",Great Company, good benefits. would recommended to anyone looking for a career with a lot of room for growth. not for everybody though."
"GEICO",",A good place to work if you love the insurance business. You will receive a quality education to obtain your insurance license and eventually you could branch off and start your own business with your license."
"GEICO",",I spend a little over 2 years at Geico and they were a great two years.  The management is very supportive and encourage professional and personal development.  Geico has a very strong promote-from-within community."

"ATOS",",If you can work well without a KB Atos is alright. Some companies do not update theirs very often, So you will need to stay on top of any information that you can get your hands on. The turnover rate is a contributing factor as well, considering there seems to be a revolving door at this place, people are often gone before they get all their system access."
"ATOS",",I got rear-ended in a company truck and the company refused to stand behind me. This resulted in my not getting trained on the hoses"
"ATOS",",that resulted in getting me fired."
"ATOS",",This company had been great early on. But after the Atos buy out of Xerox everything has gone down hill. They only bought out the company for a foothold into North American customers. The overall goal at this point is to take all but 10% of domestic jobs and turn them overseas."

"ATOS",",One of the worse company to work for. The management are really lacking, there are no directions given, only complaining when stuff is not their way!!!"
"ATOS",",They need to stop beating down their people and start rewarding them for the company's success. They need to get enterprise level products and not butcher these tools to make them useless or counter-productive."
"ATOS",",Great company to work for with plenty of knowledge and great at helping you further your career. It has been the best IT company I have worked for in my 11 years in the field."
"ATOS",",Stay away.  Management has no interest in fostering a positive workplace environment - they just want bodies in the door to replace those who have quit."

"City of Seattle",",The ""Women in the Trades"" open house has to be staffed by men, because it's almost impossible to find women with anything good to say about the craft environment in City Light.

"Blizzard Entertainment",",Fantastic campus and office culture with diverse employees and excellent inner office communications. However forward progress at this company is exceptionally hard, due to the sheer quantity of people looking to work here management has prime pickings on who will and wont move forward. This can cause people to unfortunately feel like they're stuck in their lot at the company with no potential for promotions etc unless nepotism or other factors are at hand. Beyond that hurdle there are a lot of upsides to Blizzard that make it a fantastic place to work and a bright star on your resume."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",Great place to work at. Team based environment that helps everyone succeed on the day to day stuff. Amazing staff and great atmosphere to come to everyday,"
"Blizzard Entertainment",",Talented and creative people working together to achieve goals at an amazing company that truly cared about its community. Best internship experience."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",Keep in mind that while it is a video game company, entry level is definitely a customer support job.  As such, there are metrics to be held to, and numbers to be met.  "
"Blizzard Entertainment",",Video gamers are a passionate lot.  Support can be challenging at times, but leaves room for fun as well."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",I'll make this short. "
"Blizzard Entertainment",",- Fun jobs (all of them) "
"Blizzard Entertainment",",- Best managers I've ever had "
"Blizzard Entertainment",",- Amazing culture "
"Blizzard Entertainment",",- Terrible job advancement (they want people who can do their job and do it for years to come) "
"Blizzard Entertainment",",- Suffers the ""red-headed stepchild"" syndrome as other companies with contract employees "
"Blizzard Entertainment",",- Benefits are great if you're a full-time employee"
"Blizzard Entertainment",",Not a bad workplace if you have a good boss.  Unfortunately, most of the management that made Blizzard great have either moved on or been pushed out.  Culture shift that is occurring right now cannot be quantified in a few lines.  Decide if you like your boss before you say yes."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",There are some great people at Blizzard, but it's just not the same anymore.  Additionally, the pay is not great.  They like Blizzard fans who are willing to take less pay than they are worth."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",Blizzard was a typical video game industry job. Many of the employees are fans first and not very career focused. While this did create an exciting culture to be a part of the room for advancement was an issue for me."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",While Blizzard Entertainment provides an enjoyable day to day worklife, and a stellar team of coworkers, opportunities for advancement are extremely limited, as is the pay ceiling. However, that said, the job itself is fun and engaging."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",One of the greatest perks of being a Game Mater at Blizzard Entertainment was getting first hand knowledge on how several systems within the games worked.  This was only made better by the core value of teaching our customers why something worked the way it did.  When a customer would petition in with an issue, we had the amazing opportunity to not only explain why the game acted this way but also give great information into the thought process and idea behind the why."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",Thought customer support for such a massive gaming company can be hectic at times, Blizzard always made their employees feel at home and offered all the needed tools and information to continue to adjust and perform well."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",My department was restructured about 3 times in 9 months."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",Management was constantly being rotated in and out, promises for job advancement were made and then never provided."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",Working for Blizzard is not as all you would think it would be. Proclaimed to have amazing culture and to be a great place to work, it only applies to those who are at the main campus in Irvine. The last straw was being put into a room and experiencing a training where we were told that Blizzard was such an amazing place to work. The trainers ignored our concerns and just reiterated that we worked for Blizzard for the pleasure of working for Blizzard."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",Everyone is really friendly and the company is family oriented. It is a very nice place to work and it's a wise company."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",The company Blizzard entertainment is a pointless company. They don't show / tell the public that they have other game developing company's, develop most of the game and Blizzard market the game as there own creation."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",Every position I held within this company was highly dynamic, and required a large amount of agility to meet the demands of the job. "

"Blizzard Entertainment",",QA/ATS were great departments, the products a lifelong love of mine. I was delighted to help ensure these products brought happiness to people's lives!"
"Blizzard Entertainment",",I learned a lot while working for Blizzard and had a great time while I was there. While I was there I felt like I would stay with the company for the rest of my career. "
"Blizzard Entertainment",",After working there for 5 years I took a look around and noticed that many of the people I started with were still there, but that very few of them had been promoted even once, and that none of them (although very talented) had been given the opportunity to join the development team."
"Blizzard Entertainment",",Working at Blizzard was my first Industry Job and i loved every day of it. I would come in and test out the assigned game they gave me and write reports if I found anything. I meet a lot of great people and made a lot of friends while at Blizzard"
"Blizzard Entertainment",",At Blizzard you always feel like you are apart of the family. Everyone from the works at the front desk to the executive managers feel like family and friends right from the start. The people working at this company have the same interests you do and you can find a best friend on every team. I love playing Blizzard games with all of my other coworkers and nerding out over changes/additions to the games."

"Eventbrite",",Eventbrite was an admired brand in '08-'10 full of Stanford grads but many have since moved on and replaced by folks from dying brands like eBay and Twitter. Ticketing/e-commerce is now commoditized SAAS and the company's ""strategic"" projects has failed to deliver any differentiation. Both Product and Strategy teams have abandoned the marketplace mission as they struggle to make Eventbrite a destination page for event discovery. Instead the team executes multi-year efforts on refreshing the look and feel of the website to occupy time and without substantial metrics impact. The Engineering team moves at glacial speeds and mostly comes from other events-oriented SAAS companies (read: never worked at pedigree like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc). This breads an engineering culture that lacks real processes or documentation. The ""bench strength"" has never worked on large-scale services at aforementioned firms and thus many of its services/experiences have broken under larger loads. This lack of know-how also creates a fear of touching legacy code, building hack upon hack. Recent acquisitions have built off-shore engineering centers making it even harder to develop. With compensation well below market rate and and unknown equity value, more subpar talent is recruited."
"Eventbrite",",I loved my time at Eventbrite, I would love to go back to work there.  They have a contract with my staffing agency not to hire temps directly from them"
"Eventbrite",",It is a fab office with a focus on the individual, definitely not cubicle land."

"Washington State University",",Washington State University is an amazing place to learn and work in a very supportive environment. As a graduate assistant I was supported to progress through my degree as well as gain relevant work experience. They treat graduate assistants truly as staff and not any lesser any time."
"Washington State University",",I helped students in the dorm with their first year of school, guiding and advising. I learned a lot about how to be a leader and work with others cooperatively. The managing staff was excellent, as were coworkers."
"Washington State University",",Hardest part of the job was balancing schoolwork with a 40 hr a week job."
"Washington State University",",The most enjoyable part was seeing the positive impact I made in the lives of these students, and the bonds I made with an entire new group of people."
"Washington State University",",A place where you can earn some money. Expected to work and stand all the time of your 3-4 hours shift. Permission to leave for illnesses  are really considered and you are expected to do more than what is required. Your outstanding work won't be prized sometimes even with the simple phrase "" Thank you!"""
"Washington State University",",I learned a lot about teaching and interacting with students while working there. It would have been good to have  opportunities to get more training. My co-workers were very nice and  a lot of fun. The hardest part of the job was the grading."
"Washington State University",",Education is full of bureaucracy, and WSU is no different. There are good and bad parts to that. I was surrounded by both great and terrible co-workers. The good ones are helpful, knowledgable, and pleasant to work with. The difficult ones are condescending and wiling to stab you in the back. Education is a brutal place. The best parts were the students and the ability to help people. The worst part of the job was the way some of the faculty treated both office staff and students."
"Washington State University",",Great faculty, plenty of graduate student resources, inexpensive place to live, not much to do as far as social activities"
"Washington State University",",WSU is a world class university, friendly environment, a lot of nice labs and equipments that open to everyone to use (charge of course). Overaal a good place for study and work"
"Washington State University",",Worked for a good supervisor and had a pleasant experience.  I had a job setting up demonstrations for some undergraduate courses and the job allowed me time to also work on homework during the hours I worked."
"Washington State University",",The time I when to WSU was great learning experience. Also, the Mechanical Engineering department is great and supportive. I have enjoyed living in Pullman, WA."
"Washington State University",",I was a graduate student which is basically cheap labor for professors, hopefully you can work with a good professor otherwise it can be terrible."
"Washington State University",",Was excited about all of the interesting things that we were doing."

"MetLife",",The most enjoyable part of my job is the day goes by really fast."
"MetLife",",The company inspired optimal production for all staff. The bar was continually raised and my department consistently met each challenge, exceeding all expectations.  The company realized our talent and potential before we did but the experience was invaluable."
"MetLife",",I have been given great professional opportunities.  I have learned from my management, my coworkers and my professional partners."
"MetLife",",The hardest parts of my job are the best part of my job!"
"MetLife",",My over-all tenure with MetLife was 21 years.  During this time, I've had the opportunity to work with a lot of different personalities and work styles.  The culture is collaborative but competitive and there is a considerable amount of favoritism regarding opportunity and advancement.  I would like to continue working for the corporation but in a possible different format."
"MetLife",",I was the primary contact for  for large corporate accounts . I monitored the electronic billing process and troubleshooted issues for payroll deductions on policy holders insurance benefits through there employers. I worked closely with the group customer on all questions and concerns for the auto and home voluntary product . on worked in a very high pressure position and was the facilitator for all internal departments assigned to the account."
"MetLife",",This was a very nice office.  I had an amazing operations manager who became my mentor and she taught me some amazing organization skills that I still use."

"MetLife",",This a great company to work for.  The benefits are excellent and the job culture is very appealing.  It is a very large company so there are opportunities for advancement."
"MetLife",",I would come in make some cold calls. Go to training and then back on the phones. Meet with clients sell products such as mutual funds life insurance, Disability insurance and annuities. i learned how to invest money and how to keep a balanced portfolio. Management  was great they were really professional and help full. Work place culture was great everyone was so helpfull. the hardest part of the job prospecting. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you made money for someone."
"MetLife",",There is a lot of personal time expended but very rewarding in the end.  The demands are never ending, be prepared to take your work home with you.  Enjoyed the office staff and hearing from the top in the industry."

"MetLife",",•	Participates in client account audits and strategic planning process"
"MetLife",", Stessful job"
"MetLife",",Very difficult to make a living on 100% commission. I did however, learn a lot about investments and how different asset classes were advantageous for different prospects depending on their investing goals."
"MetLife",",It's not a bad place to work. It is going under seperation of retail business. Some changes are expected in near future. Hopefully, it will settle down soon."
"MetLife",",Very focused on work status and making sure that everyone does everything they can do to get the work done and get it done correctly. The company does have a high focus on work life balance."
"MetLife",",Our department is given a heavy workload with promises of moving up to the next level but those promises are not kept.  They hire people off the street with no insurance experience in a higher pay grade.  The morale there is low also.  They expect us to bend over backwards for them but it does not show in our paychecks.  I would not recommend working for MetLife at all."
"MetLife",",enjoyed working with the people and managers.  Management care for employees and tried to develop a positive management model."
"MetLife",",""At MetLife, we seek to make a meaningful impact in the lives of our customers and our communities. To succeed together in achieving our goals, we have committed to living our values and ways of working that support and challenge us to bring their greatest strengths and talents to work every day."
"MetLife",",The MetLife Cary campus is beautiful. The building is great, there are lots of collaboration rooms, ping pong tables- the works. The downside is that no one really uses or is encouraged to use these things, it seems more like its for show. The culture still feels very much like a stuffy work office. "
"MetLife",",As with most tech companies these days there is a divide in hiring, if you are a full-time employee, the benefits are great (which makes some aspects of the job easier to deal). If you come in as a contractor, don't hold your breath to be converted. As a contractor I felt expendable. "
"MetLife",",MetLife is a company that has been around for over 100 years. Inevitably there are massive inefficiencies and silos that are pretty impossible to break through, especially as a contractor."
"MetLife",",Managment is nothing to write home about. My manager was absent for the most part and failed to set expectations about the job to be performed. It felt like they were very unprepared for their job and were therefore unable to lead."
"MetLife",",Very secure company but lacking in communication with off site employees. Good benefits, local management very easy to work with."
"MetLife",",its a good experience...working in MetLife...it just so happened that I need to leave the work to try work in another country.beacause my wife had to transfer in her company branch here in the U.S.A"
"MetLife",",Good company to work for depending on the department.  In my particular department, management communication had room for improvement but the overall work experience there was very good."
"Cloudera","Cloudera's contributions to the open source community are vast. Having colleagues who care about community as well as one's own business is very refreshing. The Support team, of which I was a part, is one of the best teams I've ever worked with:  every employee a strong, conscientious contributor. Support management also was very strong, helpful, and thoughtful about managing growth. It was hard to stay staffed to meet the workload, however, which can be a morale hit."
"Cloudera",",A bit slower, relaxed. "
"Cloudera",",Work is great, co workers are very helpful. "
"Cloudera",",They give very few return offers, something to keep in mind."
"Cloudera",",Interesting company to work for."
"Cloudera",",The company is growing very quickly."
"Cloudera",",Engineers are great"
"S&P Global","good work life balance. good reputable company and strong brand recognition in the market. Company is value and growth driven and make all necessary changes to do that."
"S&P Global",",Each day is different and interesting.  Working with senior management, allows you to be engaged in the very essence of the corporation."
"S&P Global",",No career pathing but a steady 9-5 job. Management has been overhauled a few times and institutional data has been lost. Luck plays a big growth in growth opportunities."
"S&P Global",",S&P is a wonderful place to work, great leadership and constantly evolving. Very flexible with hours and location. Would recommend."
"S&P Global",",As described in the title. The process is killing us; too much procedural work that significantly slows down the rating process. "
"S&P Global",",People generally are good and the internal collaboration between different groups is good."
"S&P Global",",The company has lost its way; it once was a fabulous place to work, but has become a slave to ""shareholder value,"" rather than quality. There is no security, and no respect for hard work."
"S&P Global",",typical day: networking and building client base that aids in giving you an overall look on market trends for various commodities"
"S&P Global",",Pretty good life-work balance in most groups but promotion/growth is very unlikely or at a very slow path. Compensation is not adequate."
"S&P Global",",Good place to start.  Learn a lot of ins and outs of the business.  Great name recognition.  There are a lot of changes happening, which can be good or bad, however you look at it."
"S&P Global",",Opportunity to lean about many areas of the business. But as with any large company it can be difficult to move quickly or get decisions made."
"S&P Global",",Constant change in senior management and company direction over the last few year has been somewhat demoralizing."
"Expedia, Inc.","It is ok for the pay but prepare to be stressed day and night. You are forced to be customer service no matter what department you work in"
"Expedia, Inc.",",Some teams are better than others. I've worked some jobs at Expedia where I'm working nights and every weekend. Other jobs, I was able to better manage my workload. The people are what keep me around--they are incredibly smart."
"Expedia, Inc.",",Great workplace culture. Everyone is willing to help with any questions or concerns. Definitely a place where you can be part of giving back to the community at any time."
"Expedia, Inc.",",Expedia offer's great pay, job stability, and awesome benefits. A great place to work. If you can get pass the bogus shift bidding, then call center environment is worth a shot."
"Expedia, Inc.",",This is a great company to work for but the job it's self is very stressful. There is room for growth and advancement if you are willing to put in the hours. The company tries to distract you from the bullcrap policies by catering lunches, parties, and other things. Overall not a bad place to work if your okay with the stressful job that you have to do in every department."
"Expedia, Inc.",",Good atmosphere, great benefits, friendly/helpful people. You never get bored at work and everyone makes you feel ""at home"". They have great trainers. It's a little challenging at first because it's a lot of info you have to put together. They say working there is ""like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get""."
"Expedia, Inc.",",UNPROFESSIONAL company. Management does not communicate well with each other. Pay is decent but not worth the headache."
"Expedia, Inc.",",Lots of politics, lots of favoritisms!.  Managers and supervisors are most often unqualified to manage people, all what they care about are numbers and statistics, does not matter how they are obtained. Work ethic, integrity and hard working do not matter as much as being popular, despite of what the company claims.  The work environment is very unprofessional and immature, with lots of slacking."
"Expedia, Inc.",",Nice place to work and aquire new skills. Employees manage themselves for the most part, Leads and Supervisors are very hands off when it comes to managing their teams.EXCELLENT pay rate for contractors, but very few opportunities for career advancement from coming in as a contractor to being promoted to FTE."
"Expedia, Inc.",",Everyone is very helpful when you are trying to learn new systems. Very easy to speak with management about new opportunities."
"Expedia, Inc.",",I absolutely loved my time at Expedia, and regret my decision to leave. I am now working on getting back...somehow. Great people, great benefits. Absolutely awesome!"
"Expedia, Inc.",",Expedia has a great work environment to learn and grow. Management is always there to help and has an open door policy at all times. There are always opportunities to grow to other fields within the company if so desired. There are also tons of opportunities to travel since this is a travel company as well."
"Expedia, Inc.",",Great pay and benefits. Management very sincere and always gave incentives for great job done with bonuses every quarter."
"Expedia, Inc.",",Great hours, very quick and easy to get through the day. They had fun games during break times and provided candy during the shift. Worked with several other college students - worth it!"
"Expedia, Inc.",",A typical day at Expedia starts with meetings."
"Expedia, Inc.",",What new, any changes to apply?! "
"Expedia, Inc.",",It's a place you can learn a lot. The Management team is always ready to assist"
"Expedia, Inc.",",Expedia is great for work life balance. Its not fast paced like Amazon and people here tend to get into one position and never leave. You wont advance your career here much but if you want a comfortable job its a good place."
"Expedia, Inc.",",I started as a developer in Expedia and now currently as an Engineering Manager. The experience is great, people are very helpful, there is so much things to learn. You get challenged everyday, which is good."
"Expedia, Inc.",",Great place to work.  Great work and life balance and excellent benefits."
"Expedia, Inc.",",Management were great and very diverse. They believed in having fun at the same time believed in taking care of business."
"Expedia, Inc.",",Full time job working from home and loving it! The work environment is great and there is clear communication. I have learnt a lot from senior team members and look forward to further growth."
"Expedia, Inc.",",I used to love this job when I started as a Lodging Support Agent. After you've been there for a few months the cracks start showing. Management lacks expertise on everyday work tasks and one is forced to ask other peers for guidance and support. If you are able to reach one of the leadership positions then you'll have a bit more job security. "
"Expedia, Inc.",",Overall the place was fun to work with, good peers, more bad than good supervisors. Benefits are ok, but as far as receiving good travel benefits, then you're better off looking elsewhere."
"Expedia, Inc.",",If you are looking for a stable income with boring employees in the team, then Expedia will be a good fit to you. It is a very low productivity company as well so if you enjoy chit chatting with colleagues and not getting anything done, then it will be an ideal work place for you."
"Boxed","There is no real corporate structure. Great start up company and good idea. This company has a lot of potential to be a fortune 500 company but only time will tell."
"Boxed",",Boxed is a great place to work the management is great they are fair and get there work done perfectly. very diverse i enjoy my job!"
"Boxed",",Management was horrible to the point that they don't communicate with each other. To work there you have to work through Adecco the temp agency and you can get fired without any warning of how you should pick up your production. Management positions are filled with inexperienced people who try to overcompensate their insecurities with their job position. There is no process to how you can lose your job. Literally all they have to do is call the temp agency without showing them any numbers that you're putting up and they'll end your assignment with that job."
"Gatehouse Media","Low Compensation, Demoralized Employees, Frustrated Management, Frustrated  Employees, Everyone Works In Fear Of Loosing Their Job For No Reason, No Hope For A Raise ."
"Gatehouse Media",",The are just bad !! The tell you your job is safe and then take it away. The promise you your bonus is on it's way ther just running behind then tell you your not getting one.  You will lose all of your pay vacation  once a year"
"Gatehouse Media",",Gatehouse Media has no interest in Newspaper or newspaper customers.  Stayed on as long as possible due to I had a union position and wanted to get rid of all union employees."
"Gatehouse Media",",During a typical Monday through Thursday, I create between 80 to 120 inches of content, shoot photos of sporting and community events, schedule freelance photographers and plan content for the upcoming day. "
"Gatehouse Media",",I love that I get to watch and write about young men and women busting into the sports spotlight, especially given they come from small cities and towns. I love being a conduit for their success and helping them move forward and get better opportunities."
"Gatehouse Media",",The office and the help available, however, has shrunk since I began working there. "
"Gatehouse Media",",Rather than fill positions of need to alleviate stress on the news and ad departments GateHouse's modus operandi has been to fill the position with someone in the office and have them do double-duty. "
"Gatehouse Media",",You often work more hours than you get paid for — like working 80 hours but getting paid for 40 — which doesn't leave much for a personal life or compensate you for the time lost. "
"Gatehouse Media",",There also isn't much progression and you have to be proactive about your own career there. There are no evaluations or learning sessions or opportunities to attend growth symposiums. You will have to make that effort for yourself. "
"Gatehouse Media",",The previous management was great and I grew monumentally as a journalist, but the current regime is far more focused on ""clicks"" than community news and telling the rich and compelling stories found within."
"Gatehouse Media",",Gatehouse is cool if you are into practices and policy. I personally was not impressed by the hierarchy here.They have a traditionally corporate mindset hard set on robotic practices."
"Gatehouse Media",",Cohesive unit for building and developing talent to build sustainable relationships with advertisers as well as personal and professional growth of the individual.  "
"Gatehouse Media",",A great company that invests in their talent with on going training of techniques and product knowledge."
"Gatehouse Media",",The company is recently out of bankruptcy and in a failing industry which limits their ability to give raises. The co-workers and the company are enjoyable just ready to move on."
"Gatehouse Media",",Middle management seems more concerned about upper management than the people on the ground and it shows. Communication is the pits here. LOW pay.  Mixed messages and lots of back patting for acquiring new titles, while reporters flail with outdated, broken equipment. No pay raises given for the past 7 years. The one benefit is that even while they expect a lot of ""content"" (not necessarily ""journalism"") out of you, they also are serious about employees only working 40 hour work weeks. It's easy to get sucked into discontent surrounding the work politics, but if you are able to stay out of that and put in your best work it's a great ground floor. That's the silver lining."
"Gatehouse Media",",I enjoyed it there it was fun while it lasted.   Nothing else I can really tell you. I do not know really why i have to fill this out seems kind of silly."
"Gatehouse Media",",The only positive about the paper I worked at for 8 years with 3 different owner ships, were my coworkers.  We did an excellent job of meeting deadlines to assure our advertisers ads would be in the paper as promised. Most customers were great to work for with.  The biggest problem was management and the leadership at the paper! They were very poor leaders who needed training and did not care who they walked over.  Favoritism and uncaring was rampant!  Our local HR was very unhelpful and did not seem to know what her position was and seemed to take managements side without a discussion. Would not recommend this company unless interning only."
"Gatehouse Media",",Not a good company. The best part was the people that I worked with. No job security. We (co-workers), felt that we had job security since it were were the only daily newspaper in the area. We felt comfortable with the previous owners, but had high hopes that this company would be better since they owned a lot of newspapers in different states."
"Gatehouse Media",",Which team you're placed as a designer seems very random. Of course, while your work ethic and skills play a big role in determining your future here, whether you'll grow professionally or adopt more responsibilities will depend on where you're placed...which is probably out of your control. Favoritism is blatant. Most complain about the salary...GateHouse is a very typical corporation in that it would rather see its good, long-time employees leave and have to put in the time and resources to hire and train new people than bring wages up to speed. Just because this isn't Los Angeles or Chicago doesn't mean the employees can afford to live in Austin on the change they're doling out. Coworkers were chill, though. It's a kind of relaxed place."
"Gatehouse Media",",First, this was not a FAIR company to work for. You would have to work 3 months with no day off while everyone else in the office got their time off. If you have a complaint about business or something going on in the office that is unethical, better keep your mouth shut..... no one cares.. no one will do anything.... it literally will be a waist of your time.."
"Gatehouse Media",",I enjoyed my time working at gate house media. Management and culture is all good. I would definitely recommend to a friend."
"Gatehouse Media",",Not a place you would want to work. Employer released me with no given reason. Unemployment was approved, but it left me in a bad situation after just moving to the area where there is not much work. The publisher was very unprofessional!!"
"Gatehouse Media",",The Gatehouse Center for News and Design is a modern-day sweatshop, and the company is unashamed of this fact."
"Gatehouse Media",",Turnover is outrageous. They hire in bulk because fed-up employees often walk out in frustration. Others leave as soon as they can."
"Gatehouse Media",",Managers promote among themselves and sycophants. Pay is abysmal. Promotion is nil unless you're a champion butt-kisser. "
"Gatehouse Media",",In six months' time, five top-lever managers have bailed to take better jobs, including the chief development officer, the HR lady, the operations director and now the center's chief director."
"Gatehouse Media",",Daily newspaper teams are chronically understaffed and overworked, many taking on 8-10 day stretches with no breaks. "
"Gatehouse Media",",Floor plan is spare, designed to emit an air of temporary work, letting employees know not to get too comfortable in their position."
"Gatehouse Media",",the job was difficult due to the limited number of businesses in the area and my limited knowledge and training in the industry."
"Gatehouse Media",",This review is for the Center for News and Design in Austin. I can't speak for the rest of the company in other locations, especially pre-2014."
"Gatehouse Media",",Job Work/Live Balance: If you're young, single and don't mind working second shift, it's probably a good way to gain valuable experience. If you have a spouse and friends with day jobs, expect a great deal of sacrifice."
"Gatehouse Media",",Compensation/Benefits: Pay is low--even for journalism. Especially given the amount of responsibility you'll have right off the bat. Plus, you'll be living in a city with an increasingly high cost of living. Healthcare benefits are relatively good, but you'll pay toward $200 out of pocket per month for them. Scheduling time off is akin to redeeming frequent flier miles: The only periods you can get time off is when nobody else wants it; and vice versa. And forget about spending the holidays with family. If stressing out on deadline at 11:30 PM on Christmas night is your cup of tea, then this is the place for you!"
"Gatehouse Media",",Job Security: There's a very high rate of turnover, so if you're competent, you won't have to worry about job security. But that being said, there's a reason this place earned the nickname ""Gaslight Media."" Your head will be messed with. Team assignments and supervisors change regularly, too."
"Gatehouse Media",",Management: Some supervisors are great and really care; others, not so much. Bear in mind, this is the brave new world of corporate-owned media. Once upon a time, journalism was a field that attracted folks who valued integrity at the end of the day. Now it's all about ""what's in the best interest of the shareholders."""
"Gatehouse Media",",  "
"Gatehouse Media",",Job Culture: The median/average age of your fellow employees will be fairly young. If your idea of a great work environment is a high school cafeteria or the college dorm--with all the requisite gossip and juvenile drama--then you'll love working there."
"Gatehouse Media",",  "
"Gatehouse Media",",Next to no resources  devoted to local properties. Every employee in every department doing the work of multiple people, partnerships with outside marketing companies led to poor customer service. Constant confusion and no direction from corporate. The only place money was devoted to was buying new properties."
"Gatehouse Media",",I worked there for years and still to this day have a professional relationship with the owner.  Great starter job for college students and looks great on resume"
"Gatehouse Media",",I enjoyed going to work everyday. The people I worked with quickly became my friends. Loose dress code and occasional holiday parties."
"Gatehouse Media",",There is no such thing as a performance review, raise, or a bonus unless you were very high up. They do no facilitate growth of employees. Too much gossip/drama with the ubiquitous he said she said taking precedent over facts."

"Crestron Electronics",",Friendly environment.....Good management......very busy everyday....Saturdays are minimal...........very accommodating with special requests.........."
"Crestron Electronics",",Nothing much to note.  This was a temporary work assignment that lasted just 8 weeks with no possible extension or invite to join their company even though I fulfilled my job with excellence."
"Crestron Electronics",",good place to work but they are very unfair my grandfather died "
"Crestron Electronics",",i had to attend his funeral and they were not nice its like family doesnt matter"
"Crestron Electronics",",a typical day at work consists of clocking in and jumping right into work, resolving tickets and shipping out equipment for remote users. The IT staff are very helpful and welcoming. They have a good balance of teaching you things you need to know but while at the same time allowing you to learn on your own. Co-workers in the IT department are unique, funny, and sociable. Hardest part of the job is addressing everyones concerns in one day. IT department is understaffed. Most enjoyable aspect of the job is learning more and being able to address issues on your own and seeing the increase in your knowledge and ability to handle particular issues."
"Crestron Electronics",",Its a simple relatively stable and pleasant company. The Location is not exactly the most fun though. If you don't mind the burbs it's great."
"Crestron Electronics",",I worked at Crestron for 9 years, co- workers were good to work with. In my first years it was great to work at Crestron. As the years went by there were so many rules and regulations it was crazy.In my 9th year I got hurt on the job and I had to get a operation,it took more than 90 days and they terminated me. Imagine after 9 years!!!"
"Crestron Electronics",",A typical day at work in Crestron updating Test plans, Test scripts, attending meetings for new requirements. "

"Crestron Electronics",",We had a good team and was good team player. Worked well with other team members."
"Crestron Electronics",",The hardest part of the job was too much expectations and less communication."
"Crestron Electronics",",The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new everyday."
"Crestron Electronics",",The Company became a nightmare to work for with the arrival of relatively new Management, including HR Director.  They simply do not care about people but themselves and their clueless relatives whom they bring in.  Sad, very-very sad to say the least..."
"Crestron Electronics",",No work life balance"
"Crestron Electronics",",Disorganized on all levels of management"
"Crestron Electronics",",A ridiculous amount of nepotism"

"Crestron Electronics",",Excellent place to work with co-works (fun/enjoyable)"
"Crestron Electronics",",no room to grow"
"Crestron Electronics",",normal red tape and politics - nothing outside the norm"
"Crestron Electronics",",hardest part of the job was not being able to grow into new positions"
"Crestron Electronics",",did learn SAP and was able to pass my knowledge to new hires"
"Crestron Electronics",",If you enjoy working for a company that has you doing hamster wheel activities with almost zero room for advancement at the lowest possible pay wages while simultaneously being treated like a pawn in a chess game to be used up at the hierarchy's expense and receiving no recognition, incentive, or reward for working hard, then Crestron is the company for you."
"Crestron Electronics",",Private company, so things are much different than a publicly owned company. Little room for advancement unless you are an engineer or tech support."
"Crestron Electronics",",Fast paced work environment.  Constantly changing duties and responsibilities,  Crestron Electronics creates hundreds of new products each year.  Employees need to be excellent at multi-tasking, and able to prioritize several objectives continuously.  You need to demonstrate working individually and working with others to accomplish your goals."
"Crestron Electronics",",As mentioned elsewhere, the pay is insulting. The company was recommended to me, but I would not recommend it to anyone else. Culture is non-existent, and there's segregation between buildings, departments, hourly vs. salary employees. The safety rules and policies are over-kill. The head of safety compliance is an abusive person, well protected by senior management. There's not much room for advancement at all. You can only hope to transfer positions after a 6 month period. Training was pitiful. I was essentially just thrown to my desk with expectations....  I enjoyed my co-workers. Lots of decent folks there you work along side with,"
"Crestron Electronics",",Very stingy with its employees in terms of time off and pay. Raises are sad."
"Crestron Electronics",",Work culture changes based on each individual department's management."
"Crestron Electronics",",I've worked for almost 3 years in the shipping department at the Orangburg facility. During my run there I've worked with great people within my department , however management is a joke. With all the the hard work and overtime you put it, it gets un noticed. Very little pay for hardwork, standing on your feet for 8-10 hours. Department change or shift change? Good luck. Despite of my 2 year run, I've asked for a shift change so that i can schedule myself to go back to school. In one ear and out the other. Everything goes by favoritism . In order to be liked by the shipping supervisors , mainly the daytime ones, you have to either play video games they like, watch the same sports as them or simply have the same interests. Very unproffessional. New rules are applied everyday. Also there are different rules for different people , and special privileges for some employees. Im glad i got out of that place. The shipping department should only be a pit stop in your life , unless you really like the workload it comes with. I absolutely do not recommend this place unless you really need a job and are willing to settle for slave work. Only good thing is that if you need overtime and the extra money , its always available ."
"Crestron Electronics",",A good group of people to work with. Senior management though micro-manages and does not listen to employees. Most insight is hindsight."
"DuPont","There in no typical day in the work because the load on the work is balanced by all the team members."

"DuPont",",Good Company going through a lot of changes. A lot of history. Opportunities may come in the future when a planned merge is completed."
"DuPont",",Difficult to work with employee morale very low.  DuPont was a great company to work for.  Learned many new skills through a variety of positions."
"DuPont",",worked in office that makes and supply paint to General Motor corporation. Also work with the Japanese that helps provide paint for the autos at General Motors"
"DuPont",",Best company ever to work for.  I learned a great deal while working for Dupont.  I would have loved to retire from Dupont but circumstances prevented this."

"DuPont",",This is a great company and they really try to help the employees.  they went through very tough times and had to eliminate a lot of jobs, but I always enjoyed the people and the environment.  Their core values are excellent."
"DuPont",",Job would be great if management did a better job. Woring as a contractor is better than full time employee. Once you become a full time employee they look for all kinds of ways to fire you. Other than that the pay is great and overtime is frequent."
"DuPont",",I had to use a pipe cleaners to clean the thread holes it is a huge sewing machine that made carpets.  I got to watch a robot do some work not sure what it was doing just know it came. Out of a door ran on floor looking at the machine"
"DuPont",",Working here was great.  Everyone was always willing to help.  The hours were long.  Clean environment.  Could be stressful at times"
"DuPont",",Changing culture of late. I left company two years ago during time of divesture of businesses. The company is now in the process of merger with Dow Chemical and know there has been a lot of upheavel."
"DuPont",",This has been my first job after graduating college and has been very enjoyable.  I got very lucky finding a job with a great culture (work hard, play hard).  Everybody is eager to share knowledge and supportive of branching out of the department to explore other avenues."
"DuPont",",Worked 3 1/2 years as an Extraction Operator and loved it. The huge downside for me was the 2 week swing shift. 2 weeks on 5am-5pm then 2 weeks on 5pm-5am. Good hours if you're single. You end up working 2 days on and then 2 off. Every other weekend you work Saturday, Sunday, Monday."
"DuPont",",Transferred to a straight dayshift cleanup position after 3 1/2 years of being zombified by the swing shift. I liked the work the position offered: loading shipping containers with meal, helping move rail, cleaning up, etc. After awhile the dept. superintendent put my name in some safety committee and was forced to go to mandatory meetings all the time. That wasn't my cup of tee."
"DuPont",",I was very young when I was at DuPont and really enjoyed working in a large place.  I was a creel operator and I also drove the fork lift on this job.  I worked the last 4 years in the lab,  I performed series of test on the product.  I resigned to raise my children as a stay at home wife and mother."
"DuPont",",Working with my co-worker was my highlight for the day.  Great people.  Being a team player.   There was nothing hard in my job.  I love the challenges.  I did Administrative support for Director, 7 Patent Legal Attorneys and Manager"

"DuPont",",I didn't do the same thing twice everyday."
"DuPont",",I loved my job."
"DuPont",",As chemical companies go, DuPont was amazing - the inventor of Nylon, Teflon, Nomex, Kevlar, Terethane...so many products - truly was a company that lived out their motto at the time, ""Better things for better living""  Today, DuPont is quite changed from when I worked there.  DuPont was my training ground as a young engineer.  Their field engineering program gave me exposure to many different product technologies, and their Safety culture was unparalleled.  Management strongly enforced and supported a safe working environment.  I felt safe and learned so much...and this led to my contributing significant business value.  When I had to leave the company for family reasons, I was very sad to leave."
"DuPont",",DuPont in New Century KS is professional, yet they are very VERY smart and very willing to share their time and knowledge with you about a vast variety of things. The company had a great work-life balance, and treated their employees great. I'm not so sure how things are since the merger with Dow, however."
"DuPont",",I can get a lot of overtime.. I was experience in different Departments .I got my forklift licenses.. It was a 12 hr rotate shift.. And I also had perfect attendance."
"DuPont",",Overall Dupont is an OK company to work for. It's health benefits can be better and it has a pretty bad career advancement but the team environment is great. The environment is relaxed and very friendly. Many team building activities. Work load can be tough at times and very easy other times. The hours can be pretty flexible"
"DuPont",",I liked working here close to home and new faces to meet great workplace and good hours good people to meet very safe place to work"
"Leidos","Direct management very supportive; senior leadership out of touch with most of company. Ridiculous reporting requirements."
"Leidos",",Severe lack of training and manager support. Expect to be thrown papers to read and fend for yourself. You will be promised things that will never happen. Don't let your managers know of your political choices or you will have profanity thrown in your face. Very unprofessional and immature work environment. Upper management doesn't even have a degree. Lots of huddling together and whispering like kindergartners."
"Leidos",",Leidos is a very good company to work for.  CEO on down management is very supportive. Coworkers also very helpful. Just beware if you work under government contracts. Job could disappear instantly."
"Leidos",",I can't say much of Leidos since I haven't experienced much, I've only been apart of Leidos for a few months now since they recently acquired part of Lockheed Martin."
"Leidos",",Co workers as a whole made my job enjoyable.  When I had questions, we all worked together to resolve any hundles that came up.  I love Leidos."
"Leidos",",I enjoy the challenging day-to-day tasks required to meet the service level agreements between my company and our customer."
"Leidos",",I enjoy job satisfaction received by exceeding the requirements of my job."
"Leidos",",They were formerly Lockheed Martin IS&GS.  I have had no issues with Leidos.  Benefits are good, time off is acceptable although only allowing for 3 days of ""personal time"" to include sick leave is a strike against them.  This does not include your vacation time.  Pay is in line with the average for the area.  Overall a good company to work for and with."
"Leidos",",Great teams produce great results. Had the pleasure of working with some great teams, but sadly the economy let us down and many of us were separated. Really fun working with like-minded engineers though!"
"Leidos",",Being legacy SAIC, Leidos comes with many of the same cultural practices as SAIC. However, it's many changes over the last few years have left some feeling unstable or over stepped by reorganization.  Change is good but it doesn't make everyone happy while others have benefited in their careers due to the change."
"Leidos",",Was publicly announce to the office and myself that I would be promoted to team lead; within two days the proposal was denied due to age and lack of experience by the contracting office (after being approved internally). Now, leadership wants me to train the new individual they have hired. Always undermanned. No direction. Had to constantly train new bosses and received low pay."
"Leidos",",Received no training from coworkers as the older coworkers were afraid of losing there jobs to new hires. Had to learn my job through trial and error."
"Leidos",",Great place to work, great people. I really think this company has a lot of room for growth for their employees and I think that is really something to be valued."
"Leidos",",Steady workflow with familiar programs and customers."
"Leidos",",Growing rate of production with 'on the fly' training for customer happiness and satisfaction."
"Leidos",",Trustworthy management, no micromanaging, and open communication. "
"Leidos",",Great group of coworkers are always joining one's team.  Backfilling and being able to communicate with coworkers are a welcomed for a working environment."
"Leidos",",I have mixed feelings. The job was good, but they were always trying to call me in on my off time. The pay was good, but that was negated by the seemingly yearly reduction in benefits. Management turned over in one form or another once every few months in the office I worked in. There wasn't much of a pay increase over time and fewer opportunities for advancement in the company. People seemed to muddle through the day with discontent in the office. It seemed to suck the joy out of some of our coworkers just to be in the office."
"Leidos",",Leidos is a great place to work. Management is engaged and fellow workers are eager to assist each other. Salary was highly satisfactory. The fact that it was a contract job has inherent risks."
"Leidos",",Hired and then let go 6 weeks later because of funding. Lied about the contract being good for a full year."
"Leidos",",Not happy with this company currently."
"Leidos",",Leidos is a young very diverse company that has difficulty figuring out how to organize itself. Needs more mature SR management and  leadership."
"Leidos",",Leidos offers a great work life balance. Leidos offers a competitive 401K plan and insurance plans. Leidos also offers annual performance reviews ensuring that you have a way to move up the ladder."
"Leidos",",Excellent position to help train first responders and help protect the nation from disaster. This is a rewarding position and excellent working conditions."
"Leidos",",I was my own boss and made my own schedule to the needs of the mission. I learned a great deal about turning in old and no longer useful equioment. Management always ensured you had the proper training to complete your mission. Co-Workers were always there to help with moving any equipment that needed to be loaded into a truck or van. The hardest part of the job was not having enough time to get everything completed. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I had complete control over everything I did."
"Leidos",",Leidos is not a bad company to work for, they just aren't great either. Leadership is out of touch, but compensation is competitive and the benefits package rivals other companies. Not a lot of room for advancement."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab","Lots of interesting work and great technical people to produce that work.  Managers are not given proper training to adequately perform their job functions."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",Good pay. Good benefits. Fair work/life balance. Painfully boring work in A4E. Heavy on high level (flow chart) work. Very light on hardcore Mathematics/Physics in A4E. Formal training is completely nonexistent. Expected to become a subject matter expert via osmosis. This is a great place to work if you come in with domain knowledge; otherwise, best of luck!"
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",Great place to work if you're main concerns are job security, pay, benefits and 40 hour work weeks."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",However, some find it too laid back."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",The lab is known for it benefits, job security, and an ""easier"" pace than equivalent jobs in industry."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",They offer free graduate and undergraduate courses."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",Their retirement matching is one of the best."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",JHU/APL is a cornerstone for innovation and ""out of the box"" concepts. Deep thought and experimentation is encouraged and rewarded. The pace and culture of the environment is a bit dated."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",APL-ers are committed to serving their country as defense contractors.  Very smart and innovative in creating solutions to thorny, global problems."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",fun place to work as a grounds keeper learned so much and had a very nice time there and wish I was still there those were the good old days"
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",APL as a whole is an awesome place to work.  The benefits and pay are pretty good.  The issue is certain departments have issues at the top, but instead of removing those issues they remove the workers."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",This place has outstanding salary and benefits.  Some of the work is really exciting, some of it is dull as can be.  Great place if you are just out of grad school, but don't get old.  They don't like older workers."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",It is a challenging and rewarding environment.  Very nice facilities and lab equipment.  People are generally very supportive there."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",Employment their usually starts off well and lasts more years than at most places. However, it can be tricky despite your best efforts to remain employed there. The place frequently reorganizes and the people that support you the most may disappear. Their objectives can change leaving you high and dry for work. Then they give you a choice between a probation assignment (which usually leads to termination) or help in placement outside the lab. Some people leave and come back with great success. Nice campus, offices, activities and efforts to keep employees happy."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",Overall JHUAPL is a decent place to work; however, look elsewhere if you want to work on cutting-edge research.  There is much more of an emphasis on the worth of management over technical staff, which  makes career advancement for engineers and scientist who prefer to stay out of line management very difficult."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",Design a GUI for the ARGO project. Main tasks were the parser and small front end design. This was my first internship and I learn a lot about the computer science field from working here."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",For scientist, engineers, and management JHU/APL truly is a “Best Place to Work.”  However, support staff and other non-professional positions should be leery when considering any offers of employment."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",With twenty and even thirty year careers for professional staff commonplace at JHU/APL one question I recommend every job candidate ask during the interview process: “What is the median number of years my peers have worked at JHU/APL?”  If the answer is not ten years or more, it is a warning indicator of excessively high employee turnover.  The likely culprit is management that characterizes support staff as commodities.  Long-term retention is not a goal and therefore providing opportunity for advancement (promotion, recognition, salary, and training) or work life balance is extraneous."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",My days varied depending on which test stall I was assigned to. They were Scram jet rocket, Particle injection, NASA Aerospace plane thrust and Infrared Laser guidance testing. The work atmosphere and the personnel I worked with made it enjoyable just to go to work."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",- great work life balance"
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",- good for those that are transitioning from military"
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",- great location to Baltmore and Washington"
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",Not a terrific entry-level job, it's better to come in with subject expertise."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",Co-workers were professional; Other sector staff were professional."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",Laid back but very productive.  Very friendly staff and management team."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",Training and seminars encouraged..  Meeting interesting visitors everyday. Fun and interesting co-workers."
"Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab",",This place is amazing. When you work here and there are excess funds, they re-invest it in research projects thought up by their workers."

"Aetna",",Great potential to grow and a very good work Environment. Lot of growth prospect. Amazing infrastructure and process of work."
"Aetna",",I enjoy working for Aetna/Bswift but the company is at times unorganized. I am working as a temporary worker, and when the company has team meetings, we were never included which left us in the dark regarding new plans and concepts that are supposed to take place. I didn't feel valued as a worker, or recognized, for my efforts as well as other temps that work there."
"Aetna",",The training, coaching and response to complex issues was gratifying to me. Also enjoyed the relationships with clients and co-workers."

"Aetna",",While encouraged that this company does the right thing for the right reason with capable and encouraging leadership, Im not sure this transitions to the local market for opportunity.  During my tenure with this company an abundance of change occurred during the turbulent times of the ACA, which contributed to me departure."
"Aetna",",I enjoy completing a claim from beginning to end with a agreeable resolution with the claimant.  This involves settling the claim within the reserves and within a timely matter.  "
"Aetna",",By keeping the claim on a diary this helps the claimant know that you are thinking about them and paying attention to their need."
"Aetna",",I love the people and it was great place to work at for many years. However, due to recent decisions and reorganizations I have decided to take my career in a different direction. This position helped me to learn a great deal about working and managing an IT organization."
"Aetna",",Employees are able to work up the corporate reigns to share and obtain new skills. The mentoring opportunities are a great benefit when working in the corporate environment. I loved the company."
"Aetna",",I was let go due to two companies merging. I worked for Aetna for 10 years. pros: you could work at home. cons: insurance had a deductible of $1600.00 per person per year."

"Aetna",",The workplace is generally quiet and friendly with the typical office politics.  Management is generally terrific.  There is a culture of excellence, and the company does try to do the right thing for the right reasons.  They are committed to diversity, and they provide training and mentoring to ensure you succeed.  Unfortunately, they could provide a better career advancement pathway."
"Aetna",",typical day at work.. go in and get to work.. get on the phone.. "
"Aetna",",training is helpful and good trainers.. good pay and benefits"
"Aetna",",At the time I was there we were not able to work from home.  Also they were very strict about the quality/quantity of claims processing.  It is good if you are a good processor but it can be a bit of a struggle for those not as efficient."

"LexisNexis",",======"
"LexisNexis",",LexisNexis is a good company with many talents.  However, employees' morale is not as strong as it used to be due to its ongoing plan moving the US tech center from Miamisburg OH to Raleigh NC."
"LexisNexis",",helping customers place orders with birth certificates, death certificates, divorce certificates. assist customers with child support payments citation payments"
"LexisNexis",",Good product and great co-workers. Too many reorganizations. Employees are smart but effort and results do not always equate to the reward."
"LexisNexis",",Great place to be through out any phase of your career. "
"LexisNexis",",Internal promotions, lots of buisness and revenue potential. There is a great deal of transparency from the very top to the bottom. We all stay very well informed of what is coming down the pipeline."
"LexisNexis",",Very numbers driven to exceed sales goals. Never enough head count in marketing (everyone doing the work of 2 people) with small marketing budgets. Difficult for work/life balance (many people do not have families). Growth difficult. Supposedly a team environment but seems many people want the ""one-up"".  Some cliques.  Marketing management has very high level of standard and excellence with scrutiny. Handful of people in certain verticals are a pleasure to work with. Traveling is exhausting but can be fun. Alpharetta office is stressful (with management overlooking) but has diverse internal events. Range of benefits good but amount to pay for such a large organization not accurate."
"LexisNexis",",This used to be a great company to work for – I loved it for the first 12 years - but things  have changed! There have been a lot of senior management changes that brought about restructuring and layoffs. And most importantly/sadly, remaining employees are no longer valued. The company is trying to push them out and is lowering salaries  and benefits ...  and doing away with flexible schedules and telework.  Needless to say, moral is low  and attrition high. Think twice before accepting  a job - particularly if based on old reviews and past reputation."
"LexisNexis",",This was a great place to work. I was given a queue of projects to manage daily and great care was taken for the most part to ensure that I was never overwhelmed. My co-workers were almost always very nice and always willing to help. The only real problem is that every six months or so the company had massive lay-offs. You were always wondering if you would be next, so it was hard to get comfortable."
"Cargill","I loved working at Cargill, Inc. Their work culture was excellent and really wanted to invest in their employees."
"Cargill",",Pay was a little lower than comparable industries, but that has more to do with the fact they are a privately owned company. That being said, they had a terrific benefits package, an excellent vacation policy, bonuses, vested pension program and ESOP program."
"Cargill",",Cargil is a great company to work for maintenance is a great position just looking for something with better hours that suit my family life."
"Cargill",",Cargill is unique because it offers great job diversity. Honestly I enjoyed my time here. The hours aren't terrible, the people are generally good natured, and although the quality of management overall varies..you have the option to switch departments as time goes on. Benefits are great even behind health insurance and retirement plans. The deli orders and meat trailer were a great benefit to working there."
"Cargill",",Cargill was a great place to work. Leadership was excellent and you truly feel as though you're part of a team doing important work. Cargill supports the growth and advancement of it's employees and there are many internal opportunities. Cargill believes in promoting from within first and they live this commitment."
"Cargill",",I was fortunate to get an easy job here. it was long hours on my feet and i also worked in the cold. Its a good job but i didn't like the environment. it just wasn't for me. The pay was really great and the weekly pay was even better. I had great bosses in my department and loved the people i worked with. we were all always respectful to each other and everything was always equal for everyone."

"Cargill",",Working at cargill gave me the opportunity to learn how to work as a team as well as to be independent about my job. What I liked about this job was that I had the opportunity to perform and show my abilities."
"Cargill",",I worked for a company that I thought was very employee driven but as it turns out that over the course of my ten years here I see them for what they are, my position is being outsourced to Costa Rica so they can pay less, no benefits, and we have to train them to receive our severence."
"Cargill",",I learned to stay focus and alert of your surroundings. The work place was cold and smelly at first. The hardest part of the job was lifting over 75lbs to 100lbs of ice cold meat with your hands. I enjoyed working as a team."
"Cargill",",Likes to promote from within and is a very good company to work for with great benefits to its employees including YMCA memberships. We are the leader in the industry and take great pride in work safety for all of its employees no matter if you work in a plant or in the corporate office"
"Cargill",",Cargill is a company you would want to stay at there pay is competitive the workload is heavy but not difficult the shift leads are laid back and get the Job done. The company is rough and only wants the best though my experience was short I do not reflect negatively on Cargill or any of its managment"
"Cargill",",nice people to work with managers are friendly and nice and help out a lot when needed. love the daily customers that come in as well"

"Cargill",",outsider coming into a union shop I was not welcome this is why I left work was dirty and hot older factory with a lot of run down equipment I would stay away the pay isn't good enough to put up with issues"
"Cargill",",the most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with tend to be very nice which almost makes you forget how much of a life you don't have because of the long and awkward hours I also liked that you have a very good chance at moving up in the company if you really would like to but you have to be dedicated to the job its almost a guarantee that your going to learn something new everyday"
"Rent the Runway","Once management was changed, the culture shifted. There were a lot of dishonesty going on with the CEO causing a spiral affect in their Customer Insights Department."

"Rent the Runway",",Associates are great. Upper management needs work. Prime example of a startup company that lost sight of the core values that made them."
"Rent the Runway",",Every one was friendly and very helpful with helping new employees.I learned how to do things such as drycleaning, machine operating, and spotting. Co workers are always efficient and on top of work. Hardest part is working a high amount of hours completing a high number of garment , almost 10,000 a day. but it's also fun and challenging. Most enjoyable part was the environment and people that I worked with."
"Rent the Runway",",Awesome Culture.Very young company. Very calm environment. Can drink in the office.No dress code. Very free spirited. End of the month is always a headache but not a big deal."
"Rent the Runway",",Coming into the position, you are trained on all aspects of the rules and guidelines of the company. This is strictly a customer service role. Unfortunately, the only growth within is to become a Senior customer communications associate (with a $1 raise). The pay is not enough for the 9 hour days and weekend shifts."
"Rent the Runway",",The most enjoyable part of the job is the random perks and fun coworkers."
"Rent the Runway",",working at rent the runway was an great opportunity for me. it was fast pace and i like that. they provided me with great hours and worked around my school schedule."

"Rent the Runway",",Lots of lifting, poor management, lots of employee turnover.  Overtime most days due to poor decision making"
"Rent the Runway",",Very hard work"
"Rent the Runway",",I was able to learn how to dry clean garments. I had learned more information on how to wash clothing. So many things I experimented and experienced working are skills I still use today."
"Rent the Runway",",One must have an extremely tough skin working in the corporate office at Rent The Runway. Thank goodness for wonderful co-workers who became friends and confidantes. Many times seeing their faces and getting to talk to them during lunch was the only thing to keep me going."

"Rent the Runway",",I learned that your pay hardly increases"
"Rent the Runway",",co workers are very friendly"
"Rent the Runway",",the hardiest part of the job was staying positive there"
"Rent the Runway",",the most enjoyable was smoke break"
"Rent the Runway",",Company culture is very inclusive and everyone is easy-going, friendly and sociable. As it is still a relatively new company, management is sometimes confusing, but seems to be developing successfully."
"Rent the Runway",",One must have an extremely tough skin working at any of the Rent The Runway stores.  Thank goodness for wonderful co-workers who became friends and confidantes.  Many times seeing their faces and getting to talk to them during lunch was the only thing to keep me going.  The combination of low inventory, extremely long wait times for dressing rooms and irate customers, it definitely took the toll on everyone.  "
"Rent the Runway",",Few things that need to change that would dramatically improve morale:"
"Rent the Runway",",- Please thoroughly TRAIN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM!! It is unacceptable and hurts us when CI tells customers over the phone the wrong things to get them off the phone (ie: telling customers wrong store hours, incorrect information about when their dress will arrive knowing that we cannot guarantee what van a dress will be on, saying that we carry all 65,000 dress in store when we only carry 1,000, etc.)"
"Rent the Runway",",- Please be more clear on the website explaining the ""walk in"" procedure, if you walk in without an appointment you will have to wait for a dressing room to open up you can't just pop in and immediately try on, dressing rooms are reserved for the clients who have paid for an appointment, too much confusion from walk ins who take their anger out on the employees"
"Rent the Runway",",- Management: Please have monthly events for the team to boost morale.  Dealing with a high stress job is emotionally taxing.  Please keep your promises when saying that we will have team outings (bowling, dinner boat cruises, karaoke, team dinners, etc.) and please be open to feedback from employees and do not bring outside drama/personal"

"Rent the Runway",", matters into the job - we should not be subject to your anger over what happened with your boyfriend, friends, etc."

"Rent the Runway",",I like the people I work with. We all work hard but the job is a little underpaid when it comes to how much work and energy we put it in."
"Rent the Runway",",A good company to work for. The work environment is fast pace but an enjoyable work to go to. Enjoyable and fun co-workers, very friendly environment too."
"Rent the Runway",",I worked as a store stylist for Rent the Runway. At first I was excited and thought I would really enjoy the work and in some ways that was right, however things took a bad turn. There is good and bad, the people I worked with are great, but the compensation is a joke. When they tell you you will make $40,000 a year or $20 an hour, run away because that's a lie. Trust me I'm saying this and my sales were some of the best in the country. You really cant move up in the company from retail to corporate, they don't hire from within and they don't promote. Rather than advancing stylist to senior stylists who had been at the retail location they hired outside stylists. What does that tell you? "
"Rent the Runway",",The business also needs SERIOUS work. There are a lot of issues with there never being enough merchandise to sell, dresses never arriving to customers and dresses arriving but being dirty or ripped. Which of course customers will yell at you for that, and when you complain about business practice nothing happens. "
"Rent the Runway",",If it's your first job its a good stepping stone, but if you are experienced and want a career go elsewhere. One of the worst markers of this company is that you could walk into their retail location right how and ask all the associates if they would quit on the spot given any other job offer and they would all say yes. Trust me I have asked."
"Rent the Runway",",Amazing company with some of the best, most methodical people that I have ever worked with! Definitely a fun work environment to be a part of!"
"Rent the Runway",",Fun, cool place to work. However I didn't want to go another year a as a ""temp"""

"Lam Research",",There aren't enough tools for everyone, and you spend a lot of time looking for tools to perform your job, being forced to take tools from someone else that needs them too."

"The Nielsen Company",",Great place to work! We have fun getting surveys while earning prizes at the same time. New CEO took over. Still a fun place to work! Open door policy. Feel free to talk to your manager or team lead without feeling guilty. Occasional free meals. Management likes to reward us whenever we do great. Encouraged to apply for other positions within the company to help you grow."
"The Nielsen Company",",Nielsen is a global company that offers many exciting positions. The excellent career building opportunities are offset by the frequent reorganizations that leave subject matter experts behind, resulting in a company with few (if any) resources who understand the detailed business processes they are working to improve or replace."
"The Nielsen Company",",Flexible and friendly working environment. Most of the departments worked in harmony - but the culture of the department I worked for was NOT ready for new ideas and way of working."

"The Nielsen Company",",Great Company! Unfortunately, the Nieslen is eliminating our jobs via technology. Meaning, the process of using paper diaries to monitor TV viewing is being discontinued. Nielsen can now monitor TV viewing with a device that can be plugged into one's television. Therefore, the company can get more accurate data while saving on payroll and employee benefits."

Clients and Fractalites appreciate our people-centric culture (freedom, flexibility, accountability). Fast growing and promising future. Highly ethical and transparent senior leadership though needs to improve its execution overall."
"Fractal Analytics",",Pros: Great place to work! Fractal has a great set of Fortune 500 clients and is an excellent place for someone looking to solve high impact real world problems. Fractal is very picky about who they work with (clients) and the type of problems they take up (they mostly cater to problems that require sophisticated analytics). "

"SAP",",Great team atmosphere, office space and plenty of opportunities to make connections. As a sales office, it is relatively busy but fun. Great place work"
"SAP",",SAP is fast-paced and detail driven. You must be willing to work independently because it is a virtual working culture. Depending on your location and what team you work for, there may not be much face-time with management and team members. Because of that, feedback might be delayed on completed work. However, management does a great job in constantly communicating the goals and objectives of projects in development"

"SAP",",We were bought out by SAP. It's hard not to notice that they put most of their primary investments behind Sales and to a lesser extent Marketing.  Software Developers and Engineers typically take a back seat. While they may pay more across the board, they overwork the development staff.  Understaff software, overstaff sales."
"SAP",",The movement in this job is great. Never the same position more than twice, always something new going on, the excitement at a San Jose Sharks game is fantastic. Coworkers are honest people always willing to help out, hardest part is knowing when to ask for assistance in a difficult situation with an unruly guest. Best part of the job is the hockey games for most of the year."

"SAP",",This was really a great job, however travel exceeded my expectations. I traveled by air, more that 100,000 air miles each year and it became awful after 911. I learned a lot from this company regarding adult education, in which we taught classes to 26+ adults each week, both at the home office and customer locations. We were required to teach more classes than the job requirements called for and that was unfortunate. The company also had a preference of hiring German instructors."

"SAP",",Working at SAP is like flying in your dream."

"Travelport",",Excellent Culture, great people.  Very skilled staff in a very complex system.  Quality management and great place to work"
"Travelport",",Travelport offers flexible work schedules and the ability to work from home. However, there is almost no direction or training provided. The people are nice, but much of the workforce is near retirement age."
"Travelport",",The vacation time packages are awful."
"Travelport",",we had very fun place "
"Travelport",",and had good team work with supportive management."
"Travelport",",we support each other in team members and made good work environment."
"Travelport",",My management was pretty relaxed about what time you got in and out. They'd only allow 40 hours a week but other than that it was no big deal. I would get in at 6-7 and leave around 3-4. The people around me were super friendly and very helpful. "
"Travelport",",Hardest part of the job was learning the huge software they had already and trying to add more functionality but this was the most fun as well."
"Travelport",",I worked for about 8 hours a day. I learned CSS, html, and jsp. My coworkers, mentors, and manager were always friendly and looking to help me learn. It was very rewarding seeing your code/fixes actually being used while you were there. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people, they were friendly and always had something to share. I learned a lot during my internship from new languages, coding procedures, version control, etc. Definitely good company to be an intern for."

"Travelport",",I started my career with Travelport and enjoyed a lot workng with this company as Intern, because management was supportive and learned a lot of things from manager, mentor and all my colleagues. My manager and HR are very responsible and caring on me. I am completely happy with this experience."
"Travelport",",As my most recent position was through a 1099 contract, I can't speak about (or rate) the benefits and job security portions.  I have had a great experience with this company and the lower level employees and management.  I can't comment about upper manamgent as I have not had any interaction with them.  The company is currently undergoing restructuring and work force reductions due to the latest IPO attempt."
"Travelport",",I enjoyed working at Travelport, nice environment and people. I spent four and half years working at this company and previously I worked there for two and half years."
"Travelport",",I was a contracted for Travelport for nearly a year and all I can say is I never look back! Some of the people are very nice others not so much. This is not a team environment for like ""dog eat dog"".  It wasn't for me and I wouldn't recommend it."
"Travelport",",Travelport is good place to work.Full of talented people.Management is secret. Senior Leadership's vision are not clear to lower level people."
"Travelport",",The company is on the cutting edge of technology.  The employees work well in team settings.  The company is very mature in it's workforce.   A lot of knowledge could retire in the next 5 to 8 years."
"Travelport",",Excellent place to work with good challenges and good opportunities.  Supportive management team.  Good rewards structure.  Flexibility in work timings."

"Apple",",Was able to find best solutions for customers and their technological needs."
"Apple",",Best thing is that you are working from home and they provide you with a computer and a iPod, so that you can serve the customer in a better way. Left because of personal issues."
"Apple",",Apple is an excellent place to work. From enticing benefits to a refreshing corporate culture, Apple strives hard every day to bring above and beyond technical support to those customers who need it."
"Apple",",Apple is a very inclusive and forward thinking company that cares about their customers and their employees. It's fun and fast-paced, and if you know how to talk to people it will be easy most days. There's a good deal of development with managers and it feels personalized. Benefits are amazing and upward mobility always feels like an option if that's what you want/you're ready for it."
"Apple",",company provides great benefits such as health, fitness and tuition reimbursement, vision, 401K, employee stock purchase options, and paid vacation for full time employees."
"Apple",",I worked for Apple for a number of years and saw many ups and downs. Overall it's a positive place to work, but it really depends on which department or manager you are working for."
"Apple",",Love this place managemntwork was excellent!!! everyone was professional.This place had oppertunities to grow but i moved to virginia so i ha to quit!!"
"Apple",",A lot of work to do. Typical day will involved helping customers with their needs. Great culture and you get to meet amazing people. Managers are good."
"Apple",",At apple you will truly grow as a person, not only enhancing the skills you need to work there but also the ones you use in your personal life. Great company."
"Apple",",Working at Apple has been a great pleasure. The typical day consists of communicating with customers along with problem solving on the go. There are times when a situation arises that may test your technical knowledge of systems outside out Apple's scope and realm. However the company has provided us with the training and proper tools to handle any issues that may occur."
"Apple",",I spent almost 6 years of my life here. It was a great place to work though you start to feel a bit complacent after a time. I think its a great starter job for those looking to branch out into other careers."
"Apple",",I loved that I always had something to do. It made the days go by fast. The breaks and lunches suffered however. Assisting in the repair of Apple products was fun and helped to be able to fix your own products."
"Apple",",Assisting customers with their iOS systems for technical issues. Training is the hardest part and passing exams. People are fun and lively"
"Apple",",Everything was upfront and lived up to,what was promised ,you got,it is plain to see why Apple is  tops when it come to product support, they WOW and SURPRISE."

"Apple",",Mission driven, but great culture.  Collegial and friendly.  "
"Apple",",Management is attentive and business friendly.  "
"Apple",",Not many opportunities for advancement (to heavy)."
"Apple",",I learned more at this job than any other job on my resume. I learned almost daily how to become a better manager to all levels at Apple. The teams are very bright, intuitive and driven. You have to be highly adaptable and humble. Each one of us was hired for very specific skills, talents and character we brought to better Apple. You may have been ""the best"" in your previous company in certain areas/competancies..but suddenly you enter Apple and they challenge you in ways that you realize you have a lot to work on. It is a community/team where everyone inspires one another to do more..become better at their job...think differently. It is extremely diverse which creates so many opinions and questions - a reflection of what the world in a way is. I highly recommend Apple to anyone ready for the challenge."
"Apple",",Great place to work, friendly and fun atmosphere. All the people who work there are great people with a lot of different skills and talents!"
"Pilot Flying J","I liked my manager and she helped a lot with transportation and making sure we were all done before our shifts so we could all go home on time."
"Pilot Flying J",",I loved my job it was intense and I enjoyed the fast pace.  Great support system no matter what it is you need help on. You can call a General Manager to the main office for help."
"Pilot Flying J",",If you go to work for Pilot be prepared to work 6 days a week to get your 30 hours a week. They have benefits after you have worked for 60 days. "
"Pilot Flying J",",The best thing about the place in the people. They make it worth the time you put in. The truck drivers are the most awesome people. "
"Pilot Flying J",",Management is demanding and unyielding. If you screw up once you mine as well look for a new job. Do not ever plan on calling out sick or without Transportation. They will come pick you up for your shift. If you call out sick make sure you get Doctors notes."
"Pilot Flying J",",If they had a different Management Team it would be the best job in the world."
"Pilot Flying J",",My time spent at flying j has been short this tine around as I worked there in the past about 5 years ago. However my time gave me some insight on a way to handle things in a new way."
"Pilot Flying J",",No day is exactly the same here at flying j but its something you have to experience yourself."
"Pilot Flying J",",This company is a hard core joke.  Zero training and they throw you into the job to sink or swim. Don't waste your time. Workers are rude along with management."
"Pilot Flying J",",when you get into management it becomes a black hole that will consume all your personal life and eat away at family life."
"Pilot Flying J",",It was a fun job and good pay . The people were nice and I loved working with the truckers. My job title was to make sure the store was clean and nice for the customers."
"Pilot Flying J",",I like my job people were great ,taking care of the drivers , with soo many people coming in a day I was always happy to see the regularys and the employees"
"Pilot Flying J",",This company has a reputation for always hiring, and depending on the location, position, and experience, one can start at a pretty decent hourly wage. The work is very demanding at all levels and the environment can be overwhelming and very stressful. This job will definitely not provide for all your needs unless you are working in corporate management or have more than one income coming in for your household. The benefits are decent and the job culture can be very welcoming at certain locations."
"Pilot Flying J",",Pilot was a fun, upbeat work environment. Unfortunately the opportunity for advancement was not very attainable. After working there for over a year, with the site's best up-sales, and one (excused) absence, the promotion I was going for was given to the boss's friend who missed at least 2-3 days per week."
"Pilot Flying J",",Fairly well organized, management knows what their doing for the most part their a bit too expecting of their employees but they do try to help you before just letting you go as they should really hectic during the day fairly slow on night shift all around not bad if you just need somewhere to start"
"Pilot Flying J",",It is a nice place to work. The owners and supervisors are nice and seem concerned with you as a person. I enjoy working with the public."
"Pilot Flying J",",I worked for this company for over 4 years and I learn so much from my mentor and manager, knowledge that can not be taken away from me."
"Pilot Flying J",",A typical day at Pilot Flying J was long but enjoyable. Management treated employees fairly. The workplace culture was hardworking but fun. The hardest part of the job was unstable weather conditions."
"Pilot Flying J",",Very unorganized and not too safe of a work environment. The work is very intense compared to the pay received. I can say it is a great job for those who love chatting, knowing regulars and meeting new people."
"Pilot Flying J",",If you want to work at a place where mediocrity is promoted than you have found your ideal job. Management is flat out rude to employees and customers. Try to change the public perception by being respectful and helpful... you get removed. It is a job where the truck drivers matter but get trashed talked as soon as they are out of sight. Do you have a degree in Management? Have fun using that at Pilot they target those that do not fit the low intellectual mold they promote into middle management. The grievance reporting line states there should be no retaliation. I know of three people who have ever used it and they where all terminated within three months of placing the call. Run... Stay Away... Horrible Employer!"
"Pilot Flying J",",The schedules were different every week. It probably would have been a lot smoother working there but quite a bit and quite often the employees called in sick."
"Pilot Flying J",",The job is not too hard or physically demanding, but the work is boring and repetitive. Like any customer service job it has its pros and cons. Lunch is fairly short as well."
"Pilot Flying J",",Working for flying j has really changed my life in a matter of a year! I opened up with the company and because of my great attitude and ability to work well with people and manage time efficiently, i was moved up with the company as a manger. The company offers great benefits and a very fun, fast paced environment to work in. I get to interact with many different people from around the world on a daily basses. I enjoy my employer and everything they have too offer. I have learned so much throughout the year that i have been here and am excited to acquire more life skills from this job."
"Pilot Flying J",",Pilot Flying J has a standard reputation among the locals and passing truck drivers. They always had fresh coffee, great food, and amazing customer service towards guests. However upper management heavily lack communications and always played favorites with certain staff members. Employees were always treated as second rate. Corporate is always trying to find ways to keep money in their own pockets by denying certain essentials to their store locations. Couldn't even use employee discount during off hours like some other companies offer."
"Pilot Flying J",",The store as a whole is #1 in the company.  There are many good employees who make that happen.  If we were happy employees we could surpass anyone's expectations. The attitudes of certain managers is appalling.  They are incredibly rude to customers and employees. Downright hateful most of the time.  Their negativity makes me dread going to work.  The schedule changes frequently so you have to take the time to look at it daily, even on your days off because they won't tell you. You have plans? too bad. The female management and shift leads, with the exception of Dawn G, are some of the worst managers I have ever worked for. "
"Pilot Flying J",",Don't make any mistakes because the smallest mistake is a major problem. For example you cash out a transaction where they have to simply do an easy refund and rering is like a major catastrophe and they will humiliate you, chastise you in front of customers because you have greatly inconvenienced them."
"Workday","I've worked for other software giants, and no one compares to Workday! Their comp and onboarding for sales rep is like nothing I've ever seen. The benefits dept is also making huge strides in the family leave policy for 2017. Can't say enough great things about Workday!!"
"Workday",",Workday really cares about their employees. They have great benefits and compensation packages. I would highly recommend this company to anyone who wanted to apply."
"Workday",",Workday provides a great work/life balance and the opportunity to grow your skill set.  I enjoyed working with a diverse group of individuals and look forward to new opportunities."
"Workday",",Workday is the first technology company that I worked for that allows me to use the technology daily and it is the exact same software we sell to prospects."
"Workday",",Hiring spree has resulted in the standards falling especially for the way middle level managers have been hired.  Many of the junior level managers to mid-level managers do not deserve to be managers in the company.  This is fast becoming another Oracle."
"Workday",",Workday places it's employees first in all core values. from that fundamental discipline all other values fall into place and a superior product is developed."
"Workday",",I was recruited by Workday and ended up relocating to Pleasanton from the east coast.  I had hoped Workday a place where i could stay for quite a while but ultimately this was not a good fit for me.  As an SME with over 20 years experience in my industry I was very anxious to develop and delivery best of breed functionality into my product area.  Although the developers, qa and documentation people were great, I found to be the middle and upper management inflexible and stuck in their old ""ERP"" ways given most or previous Peoplesoft or Oracle employees.  If you have background from a best of breed solution and want to work for Workday make sure you get a demo of the product before accepting a position at Workday."
"Workday",",Working at Workday was complete go to market strategy for a subsection of prospects. This required multiple marketing strategies and specific communication cadences to help deliver the Workday message."
"Workday",",I had high hopes of success here, but it was not a good fit for me. I don't know why, but the overall energy is better for a young, just-out-of-school herd of eager folks, I think."
"Workday",",Great company to work for.  Customer Success is the key!  Good eye on the product. Long hours and they treat their employees well."
"Workday",",Very happy customer base that helps with referrals.  A challenge is to find companies that will replace all of their existing HCM applications, and getting them to justify a premium."
"Workday",",On-boarding is the “mechanism through which new employees acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and behaviors to become effective organizational members”"
"Workday",",Helps your ""new hires"" make the transition to becoming:"
"Workday",",• productive"
"Workday",",• well-adjusted"
"Workday",",• and a happy contributing members of your company/team"
"Workday",",Post (Corporate) ""lift off orientation on-boarding"" ranked low on the list of hiring priorities – poorly designed and even more poorly executed if there was one in place."
"Workday",",No on-boarding at multiple organizational levels post (Corporate) ""lift off orientation"" – spent a great deal of time operating blind."
"Workday",",• On-boarding at ""Location Level"" was nonexistent. i.e., Next steps? Working From Home? Go to Local Office? Contact Info? Office supplies?"
"Workday",",• On-boarding at ""Departmental Level"" was sporadic at best. Very California ""centric""."
"Workday",",• On-boarding at ""Team/Job Level"" – No real interaction or introductions if you were not in the California offices. No ‘Go-to Person’ as a contact/mentor. Experienced very little peer/colleague camaraderie. ""everyone out for themselves"" or ""got my own problems"" or ""no time""."
"Workday",",• On-boarding at ""Individual Level"" was nonexistent. Travel Policy? Expenses? Emergency Contact List? Appropriate Contact Protocol? Department Manager failed to make expectations clear."
"Workday",",- how would individual performance be assessed?"
"Workday",",- bonus and promotion criteria/opportunities?"
"Workday",",- clear and written “objectives” that stated accountable and measurable ROI were non-existent."
"Workday",",- generalized discussions on “time to productivity” was all over the map depending on conversation"
"Workday",",  "
"Workday",", and WHO you were speaking with."
"Workday",",- never presented with documentation as reference, guidance, expectations or accountability."
"Workday",",Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!"
"Workday",",  "
"Workday",",If you didn't work around the clock. You didn't get respect. New management that has been coming in has no respect. The culture was dead when I got terminated. However people acted as if nothing had changed. New management loved people who made spread sheets, but didn't care or turned a blind eye to those who really did work."
"Workday",",I was terminated for being late when I was never given a warning. And in-fact some of the late was work related from being on call. I got sick of trying to make my manager happy when he was doing noting but lieing to me, so I accepted the termination with little resistance."
"Workday",",Don't get me wrong. There is some good things still at workday. But don't expect the great place to work as solid gold. Managers ask you to lie to please CEO and management on the public best place to work surveys. I always told the truth. It was a good place for me, till about a year ago."
"Workday",",Its all about the money because they went public."
"Workday",",I love working for Workday, unfortunately, my project is ending so I have to leave.  I love Workday for the following reasons:"
"Workday",",They like to use cutting edge technology"
"Workday",",They are completely professional"
"Workday",",They change around everyone's jobs every 6 months or so which keeps people happy."
"Workday",",Typical day read all emails and handle all priorities. Daily check of all kitchens and copy areas. Handle all service request and complete in a timely manner. I have learned how to time manage my workload and prioritize. I really liked my job there was no negative as far as workday. The toughest part of my job was my manager. I truly believe that upper management should not hiring family members within the same department."
"Workday",",Here is a CEO that is a billionaire and starts another technology company because he does it for the love and his ""passion"" for technology! I call him the ""Picasso"" of technology and the culture here is reflective of his love to this work. How many leaders can you say that about?"
"Workday",",Big ideas but no knowledge how to achieve them. Management is dated and clueless how to update their aging software. Want innovation but have no experience on the process to create innovative products. Be prepared to be blamed for their lack of knowledge. Have your resume ready for your next job interview."
"Workday",",Great top management, and bottom hard working level engineers. The middle management are full of politic. It has turn the company into political power house. The company double and nearly triple in size in less than a year and half, and created huge gap and confusion from top to bottom."
"Workday",",Great place to work but be ready to work more hours than there are in a day."
"Workday",",Co-workers and management are all of high-caliber"
"Workday",",Make sure to get as much feedback from management"
"Workday",",Know who you have to impress"
"Workday",",Fun and Fast moving environment with great leadershio"
"Workday",",Just know that yours and anyone's job is on the line everyday"
"Micron Technology, Inc.","My days start with looking what days(morning shifts) has left me to do and finishing it up,(night shifts) going through my emails and seeing if days miss anythings. i have learned at lot of new skills like driving the forklift, understanding how to be a material handler and knowing how to use the system/programs they use."
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Able to assist internal and external customers. Assisted in the production of microchips. Worked in a diverse environment at different hours of the day and year."

"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Pros"
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Like time off policy, great people, good productivity culture"
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Cons"
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Get the feeling we are lagging behind competition"
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",testing product constantly under stressful condition to make sure it will perform up to standards. running testing equipment all the time"
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Great place to further your education. Depends on your education                         24/7                       operation.                         Long shift,                  great people to work                with!"
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Worked their 30 years, until replaced by temporary employess with no benefits. Right after recieving my 30 year service award. They are  a profit motivated group. Good luck to them."
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Good company to work for"
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Located in Boise Idaho"
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",It matters that you are at headquarter as apposed to outside city"
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Micron is located all over the world"
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Very top heavy. Can not make decisions at the top. Industry is very up and down. They cut people when it's down, then refill the same position 5 month later."
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",The semiconductor business is a highly competitive due to the tremendous requirements for quality while keeping productivity as efficient as possible.  Tremendous competition from global companies forces the to apply constant improvement pressures on the employees and production equipment.  Due to these factors it is a high stress business which can be rewarding to those who are willing to make the sacrifice of time and leisure."
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",It's a great place to work. Great benefit. But its a competitive industry so you have to be pro-active. Work shift are 12 hours if you are working in the fabrication floor. You also have to wear full body smock to work on the floor."
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Difficult and stressful but overall well run company. Company is growing quite rapidly and so there is a lot of change going on. There has been a tendency to build bureaucratic systems that do not seem well served."
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",I learned how to operate many different types of testers. I worked closely with Engineers. I was very versatile in many areas within the company.  I was always busy, and lending a helping hand, when needed"
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",There is a lot of technology and job skills that you can learn.   The management is not so strict.   The most difficult thing is to deal with a co-worker who does not to put in a fair share of work load."
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Constantly bombarded with email, phone and chat without the sufficient amount of people to delegate the tasks to. We all tried our best to keep up with the influx of incidents that would come in but it was clear that they were not interested in boosting company morale, or pay. They did not pay us for the level 2 work we provided. We were paid level 1 or even below."
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Micron is learning how to be a big company.  Improving efforts to align and get everyone on the same page.  Recent focus has been on execution on previous R&D Efforts."
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Benefits are attractive. Compensation is more than adequate. Shift schedule should in theory allow for 4 days off every other week but mandatory overtime was required very regularly. Often given the impression that employees were a burden to management not an asset. Employees are literally reduced to a number."
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Micron is a very good place with talented people. The management is   very open to change and constantly to improve the work environments for its employees. Co-workers balance the need to get the job done with a sense of comradery."
"Micron Technology, Inc.",",Still a great company in the valley and likely unmatched wrt salary ranges in Boise.  Success is less driven by the corporate development efforts and more left to individual drive...if you are driven, you can succeed.  Very department specific wrt leadership style and culture....many acquisitions, long time managers and lack of corporate discipline here create the variance...that said, everything is what you make of it."
"Intuit","Intuit offers great benefits and a very collaberative working environment."
"Intuit",",If you enjoy working in teams, you will thrive here."
"Intuit",",Hoping to go from contract to full-hire, but if given the opportunity, I would take a contract extension or a position in another department.  Love this place."
"Intuit",",The culture of Intuit is upbeat and very healthy to be in! I love the benefits that Intuit has to offer and the relationships that I have built!"
"Intuit",",Great company. Core Values. Learn teach learn. Many courses a team member can take. Travel to work on other sites so the team does't become just a number. Pool tables, TV's, Video games, etc. Worldwide company. I don't have enough words on how to describe this great company. They care about the employees and all stakeholders."
"Intuit",",My time with Intuit was great. The only reason I am leaving is because our jobs were fazed out to a 3rd party vendor. A typical day at work consisted of reviewing account where funds are held by our team for review. The customer feedback we received either by phone or electronically regarding our processes took a special psychology to digest."
"Intuit",",I loved working there. The first tax season I worked there it was great the manger was great. She was nice treated you with respect. The second tax season the new mangers were terrible. They treated everyone like they were stupid and if you weren't one of their favorites well it sucked for you. They had all these rules that intuit themselves don't have and it made the work environment horrible. The leads that the mangers hired had either no experience with TurboTax or no experience being supervisors. I love the program but if intuit keeps it ran by those two it's going to fail."
"Intuit",",Being in CA, Intuit decided it would be more cost effective to move the Support section to a more financially viable location. Being born and raised in California I wasn't willing to relocate to Colorado or Virginia where I would be given a lateral move (i.e no increase in pay raise)."
"Intuit",",It's a great place to work, however the call center environment at Intuit is very busy, very fast-paced, very detailed and very demanding. From the moment you log on, you will be answering calls until the end of your shift or beyond depending on the call. The opportunity to advance is hard to come by because many people don't leave once they are in a position that they like."
"Intuit",",I loved working at Intuit.  The training was very interactive and very informative.  Everyone that I worked with and even those that I came across in passing were very friendly."
"Intuit",",This is a perfect remote job. Management is very helpful. Whenever you have any questions or concerns, there is someone always able to help you.  The pay is adequate for working remotely."
"Intuit",",Was very fortunate to work for Intuit for many years.  Employees are treated with respect and are allowed flexible work hours and can often work from home. I was lucky to work with smart, talented and fun people.  The work was hard and demanding but worth it because we had a great team and leadership."
"Intuit",",Worked there for eight years.  Absolutely great place to work.  Great work-life balance.  Wonderfully managed for such a huge worldwide organization.  Loved it there.  They use a lot of contracted employees."
"Intuit",",I loved the intuit company i just did not like the vendor that i went through i felt as if the company did not have internal communication. therefore things could not get done properly."
"Intuit",",This company makes you work long hours required to work and 2 Saturdays a month leaving no time for your family. Its a lot of pressure to hit your mpnthy quota or your job cant be up for grabs,"

"Intuit",",Learn new technologies and develop great working relationships that help enhance my knowledge in the information technology field."
"Intuit",",Intuit has been the best company I have worked for to date!  There is a real sense of customer and employee satisfaction with management.  As an employee, I feel empowered to make good decisions for the customers I work with and feel supported by my direct supervisor and upper management. "
"Intuit",",The relationship I have with my co-workers is amazing.  The teams are broken into small groups so there is a real sense of closeness with the people I work with directly.  The thing I love the most about my current position is I have the authority to make decisions that will benefit the customer."
"Intuit",",Nice to be able to work remotely from home. The training is exceptional and the staff is helpful. They offer over-time which is great during tax season."
"Epsilon","Work with a lot of smart people, but work environment is not great. a Very ""us vs you"" feeling between departments/groups within the organization. Little knowledge sharing/collaboration between groups i.e. digital solutions, agency services, database etc."
"Epsilon",",This company has a lot of potential, but has poor leadership. This is a great place to get you hands on differetn technologies and build experience if you are starting out.    For the general IT department you will work 60 hour weeks and be expected to avilable 24/7/365 nights, weekends and your vacations.  You will be micro managed and treated as if you do not know what you are doing.   there is high turn over due to the poor leadership, long hours and lack of processes.  the culture outside of the IT department is good and supportive, opportunities for volunteering if you can find the time."
"Epsilon",",Great place and good benefits. Learnt several industry standard applications. Great benefits for the Associates and good place to work!"
"Epsilon",",Just bottom line. No employees just associates. Very short staffed. End up doing the job of three. Not the greatest heath care. No work life balance. But the do reward newcomers and try to push out anyone with tenure"

"Epsilon",",Company does lots of things.  Get ready to buckle down and enjoy the ride.  You get to travel and work with great people, please see previous post that I did"
"Epsilon",",After nearly nine years working there, I was laid off last month so they could outsource my job to their newly built office in India.  I also had to train the person who was replacing me."
"Epsilon",",Marketing can be a rough business. But if you're lucky you'll find a great marketing company with a creative leadership team that will stay current of where the business is going, foster creativity, give constructive critique of work and lay a clear path for professional advancement. Epsilon Chicago is not that place."
"Epsilon",",Via the use of abusive treatment, witch hunting, favoritism they keep their talented and underutilized creatives stunted and believing there isn't growth outside their walls."
"Epsilon",",There's no room for advancement in the budget. The team is great, there's rarely ever any drama. The Management is great but there's too much red tape for them to get through to help their employees' grow."
"Epsilon",",The technical part of the job is great."
"Epsilon",",We need better tools, and more up-to-date versions of tools to make working a bit more productive."

"Epsilon",",Great exposure to many different and new technologies. A variety of customers, team mates, work, and opportunities. It was hard to slow the work flow down to live the rest of my life."
"Epsilon",",With working for such a large organization it can sometimes feel as though you are working for a company inside a company. Epsilon does invest a lot in it's employees with training courses to ensure they are equipped and prepared to do a job well. Most coworkers are friendly and are eager to assist with answering questions and problem solving. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the ever changing rate of technology. With any job, you get out what you put in. It's not always easy to reach the next level but if you have good work ethic and are supported by management you can excel."
"Epsilon",",Not a bad place to work.  A lot of restructuring over the last 18 months will a lot of confusion.  The leadership has had the most turnover especially in the Agency Creative side of the business."
"Epsilon",",10 hour days are typical at Epsilon, skeleton crew,not easy to find a good work/life balance. Compensation is good - good profit sharing"
"Epsilon",",Director/VP level management is immature and lack strategic planning and employee development skills.  Jobs are not secure and  the focus is to reduce Irving employees and replace with associates in Epsilon's offshore office."
"Epsilon",",Epsilon is a decent company to work for with decent managers at the ""ground level"".  The technology is behind the times and for an IT professional, there is massive resistance to change."
"Epsilon",",Typical day starts at 330 pm until midnight unless we are on a 10 or 12 hour shift. weekends are always 10 hours overtime unless its a holiday weekend. Only problems are not enough paid holidays and should be paid more than we do."

"Epsilon",",Epsilon has a great team of people. With the exception of senior management, everyone comes to work with a positive attitude, collaborative spirit and passion for their customers. I learned a lot about digital marketing and loyalty programs at the company. I had a great team of people that delivered top-notch results and received accolades not just from our customers but our customers' vendors as well."
"Epsilon",",While there were many things about the company I liked such as the people, the benefits and company events, the company had a lot of issues. Senior management failed to recognize high performers and high performing teams; instead, awards went to those ""best liked"" or in the political click of senior management. Titles were inflated. Compensation was low. The company lacked a cohesive strategy for long-term growth. Operational and development costs were high because they refused to adapt to new technologies and methodologies. Anti-LGBT sentiment was high. Also, the company was in the midst of shipping jobs overseas. I believe the most roles will be in India in the next 5 years."
"Danone","Good. Very productive, efficient co-workers, management can improve."
"Danone",",Danone is a great company to work for and they take care of their people. There is the opportunity to grow and be a part of the family that does not exist in many other companies"
"Danone",",Business account management- Maintain current customer base along with execution of new increased sales. I've learned sales steps techniques that focus on generious listaning that aid in asking for business from a potential customer.The management group is focused on team unity that strives to assist on accomplishing the task at hand.  The co-workers are requested to take charge of their own business and poineer the ability to come up with ground braking new ideas.  The hardest part of the job is manuevering through a large company employee base. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to think out side the box on ideas that can innovate into a new way of an cause of action of doing things."
"Danone",",A great group of people that assist and help where needed. A real team effort. The brokers loved selling the product and it was easy to develop a strong workforce to meet company objectives."

"Danone",",Great social responsible company, cares about the environment and the people they sale product too. They also care about their local communities and the people that work for them"
"Danone",",Good place to learn and grow.  Work to life balance is great.  Hard to focus on tasks and goals for extended periods as directions and launches are ever changing and sometimes for the work reasons.  Opportunities to grow but only to a certain level."
"Danone",",Dannon is by far the worst place i have ever worked."
"Danone",",The so called Managers back stab each other. They have no management skills at all. If you ask a question be prepared to have manger go off on the deep end on you because chances are they don't have the answer."
"Danone",",Horrible, I wouldn't have my worst enemy work there. It's a bunch of desperate low life losers who are so worried about keeping their job they will do anything at your expense."
"Danone",",The experience was one that will go down in my book as a place that has not reach the level that is possible. The concern for their people was not necessarily at the top of the list."
"Danone",",very great management and scheduling. worked a straight 40 with full benefits and holiday pay. only downside is the wide radius of route paths to attend through the south bay. it was going to be a great opportunity until the auto mileage compensation began to diminish."
"Danone",",I was responsible for the finished goods inventory and warehouse inventory. On a daily basis, I received incoming material needed for supply and conducted a product analyses to determine enough stock for the production runs. I ran reports and communicated daily any material concerns. I would check in drivers and I also created a truck schedule per the production schedule and loads to be delivered. Worked in SAP, procurement, ADP, Outlook, and Lotus notes. It was a fast high stressed environment. The hardest part about my position was the high demand to always be available 24/7. I worked from 45-60 hours per week. I enjoyed the job and the impact I had on a daily basis. I felt valued as an employee and needed for the position."
"Danone",",An overall ok place to work, the job requires some skills and it could be quite fun. Unfortunately most of management is composed of uneducated low class people without any kind of managerial skills, making people's life quite difficult inside the company."
"Danone",",Dannon US is a complete, total disaster.  There is utter disregard, borderline disdain, for folks with real, applicable CPG experience in the United States.  Not a single person in Senior Management has any credible domestic experience nor one solid relationship with any customer of any significance."
"Danone",",Avoid taking a position at this company like the plague.  The level of executive arrogance is mind-bending; the horrible way in which the company treats its employees shocking."
"Danone",",Instead of ""let them eat cake,"" it's ""let them eat yogurt,"" but ""them,"" should go and eat Chobani, Fage or Yoplait."
"Danone",",Co-workers seem very nice. Management is very open and honest. Typical work week is 40 hours. Hardest part of the job is not being able to utilize the systems available to us."
"Danone",",A highly cross functional environment that presents a great opportunity to learn traditional CPG at a fast pace. The environment is entrepreneurial and at the same time highly competitive; there are lots of opportunities to take on new projects and prove yourself. Young (new) managers are not developed in their people management skills as with other companies, however, with this being said there is opportunity for advancement quickly if you are favored by leadership."
"Danone",",French favoritism, work/life balance, corporate social responsibility, free yogurt, fast-paced and lean, good core values"
"Danone",",Isolated workplace. Too many internal layers to resolve immediate issues. Responsible for developing strategic sales plans and executing at a retail level."
"Danone",",Great place to work. I enjoy my employment with Dannon. I would recommend the company to others looking for a good place to work."

"Johnson Controls","Management did not back up staff decisions to make the work life smoother.  Poor on the job training.  Salary was low.  Management did not get involved with how the branch was running."
"Johnson Controls",",Working for Tyco has been a revelation. I've never before worked for a company whose management saw gender as a social construct. That is to say, if Tyco were a farm and needed something to pull a heavy wagon or a plow, it wouldn't use a mule but a Jersey cow. And why not? A job is a job. An animal is an animal. We're all the same and interchangeable."
"Johnson Controls",",Day to day JCI is a company giving the opportunity to succeed and "

"Johnson Controls",",Hired under a contract as an internal consultant to assist turn-around efforts in the energy solutions sector. After almost two-years the writing was on the wall. JCI has proven to be a very unfortunate experience for hundreds (more like thousands) of employees and clients. The off-shoring maneuver was no surprise. Hopefully they will be able to recover and re-emerge under better management."
"Johnson Controls",",Managerment havnt got aclue..everyone who works there are on drugs...they shd do drug test but dont.they cut corners alot and they breaks are 10mins"

Arranged meetings, completed expense reports.  Was responsible for sorting and delivering the mail to the entire building."
"Johnson Controls",",Physically demanding is what i would describe an average day at work. The temperature changes according to the seasonal weather and you have to adapt to your surroundings. Although i have to be on my feet all day i do not mind because i learn wordily capabilities and other things needed to excel in life."
"Johnson Controls",",Assembly line work for too grade car company's. Seats from start to finish, very well organized and fast past. Constant steady work with others to complete task"
"Johnson Controls",",JCI was an extremely rewarding company to work for and they took great care of their employees! They have spectacular insurance and benefits as well as pay and advancement opportunities!"
"Johnson Controls",",The ONLY negative aspect of this position was the last minute ""hold overs"" of when you were expected to stay late (after shift hours) in order to complete a task but that wasn't an issue unless I had an appointment or obligation that was scheduled immediately after work. "
"Johnson Controls",",All in all, Johnson Controls is one of those companies where everyday people (with or without a college education) can build a future and a life for themselves with the right amount of effort and hard work."

"Parker Hannifin",",Very stable place to work until a turn in demand also went overseas for I guess cheaper labor. Can't do much about that. Company has left the United States."
"Parker Hannifin",",The appearance of this company looks great from the outside, but internally is terrible. People are retiring in droves, everyone is doing 3+ jobs, wage increases haven't happened in 6 years (not even to compensate for inflation) and they hire under market value.

"Parker Hannifin",",There is a huge communication problem in the  department I was working in.  I pursued my daily duties and did what was told.  After working there for a month, I no longer expected any transparency from my co workers or manager.  They just fail to recognize my dedication, and I'm sure their stockholders and senior employees are happier that way."

Once you finally learn the basics, it is a fun place to work...as long as you fit in.  Not a welcoming place.  Management picks favorites and if you are a really hard worker and good at your job, it won't matter, so don't try so hard.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the great benefits, tons of time off that no one cares if you take which makes for a great work/life balance.  However, also leaves you short-staffed a lot."

"Virginia Tech",",Got an advanced degree from this institution and was highly regarded in my research group. My career coach, upon leaving the university, seemed disorganized and not very helpful, likewise, my degree has not translated into much thereafter either."
"Virginia Tech",",worked as a student- awesome place! They have given me me many of my jobs so far. I have them to thank for a lot of the jobs on my resume. They really help their students out."
"Virginia Tech",",Virginia Tech takes a hands-on, engaging approach to education, preparing scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities. As the commonwealth’s most comprehensive university and its leading research institution, Virginia Tech offers 250 undergraduate and graduate degree programs to more than 33,000 students and manages a research portfolio of more than $504 million. The university fulfills its land-grant mission of transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and by fueling economic growth and job creation locally, regionally, and across Virginia."
"Virginia Tech",",Typical day was 8 hours with overtime when called.  I was provided many opportunities to expand my knowledge of the work place.  I enjoyed management and my co-workers"
"Virginia Tech",",Amazing people to work with."
"Virginia Tech",",I worked in dining services for 9 years while I was in and out of school. "
"Virginia Tech",",Very flexible with scheduling and I worked with the best people on campus. I loved it so much I worked there part time after I got my degree and they worked around my schedule then as well. "
"Virginia Tech",",Pay is competitive especially for food service. The only complaint I have is paying for parking and being laid off during holidays when the students aren't there"
"Virginia Tech",",The FREE perks that you get are amazing like free gym access, pool access, they give you a shoe voucher, free meal every shift you work, turkey or ham for the holiday, and if you work there long enough they give you a free ticket to a theme park. "
"Virginia Tech",",Hard to get into a supervisory job or to move into a different department but it is possible. "
"Virginia Tech",",Will always miss my Hokies!"
"Virginia Tech",",I enjoyed the responsibility of being a campus police officer and a manager of a very large department. I was able to institute many new programs that are still in existence."
"Virginia Tech",",Consider if you like a rural setting and a development challenge.    College in the midst of change and challenging to work in this environment as a result."
"Virginia Tech",",Working as a promotions intern as a junior college, this opportunity provided me everything I needed to learn the basics of sports marketing."
"Virginia Tech",",I am responsible for distributing and promoting promotional content on campus. I collect and post all relevant social media events on company website, coordinate the printing and dissemination for promotional content, and perform many general duties assigned to me by the Director. I thoroughly enjoy the atmosphere and there is never a dull day at work.3"
"Virginia Tech",",Research based environment excellent for advancing knowledge and inventing the future! My role is:"
"Virginia Tech",",Incorporating non-structural components in a decision support system for multi-hazard performance based design of resilient, sustainable buildings. The project aims to support early design of midrise office buildings exposed to hurricane, earthquake, and tsunami hazards."
"Measured Progress, Inc.","a lot of warehouse work and scanning documents. however it is a great place with great employees. if you are lucky enough you will get hired on permanently through the temporary agency they get their employees from."
"Measured Progress, Inc.",",Worked here on a temp job for 3 mo. in the service center. Enjoyed every minute. The service teams were so helpful in giving information needed the first few wks. when assignment began. I loved my team and the management was on top of everything. Enjoyable work environment. Would have loved to have been here permanently."
"Measured Progress, Inc.",",This is the local ""farm team"" in a sea of national competitors producing similar educational products. This company is still trying to find itself during the throes of today's public education debates, and is experiencing forced adaptation (reacting to, rather than leading) and semi-annual staff reductions. "
"Measured Progress, Inc.",",Since 2010, MP (and the educational testing industry as a whole) has been experiencing a thinning client base due to educational consortia (states teaming up, rather than running their own educational testing programs). Some MP clients remain loyal however because of the Client Service division's ""we'll eventually get it right"" ethos. Internally however, this bending over backwards continually bleeds this company's bottom line due to the lack of better controls over contract agreements and poor risk mgt during work proposal negotiations. Change orders are also almost never enforced, to get back monies spent mopping up client mishaps. "
"Measured Progress, Inc.",",The staff is oddly management top-heavy (what's an 'Assistant Director' anyway?), shepherding a grating mix of yokels and overbearing ""professionals"". The average joe working here has some educational content background (math, science, ELA, social studies), and the company still employs a strange tradition of promoting these people into management roles, where they're usually unsuccessful from inexperience. Most coworkers however aren't too backstabby, but cling to each other in fear of the misdirected managers I just described. MP consistently and deliberately under staffs programs/projects (""building the plane while flying it"" was coined"
"Measured Progress, Inc.",",  "
"Measured Progress, Inc.",", here) which has resulted in some embarrassing client surprises and liquidated damages (see MP vs. State of Nebraska); strangely, this results in fewer staff than before."
"Measured Progress, Inc.",",The culture is strained, with the employee cafeteria consistently empty (everybody working while eating) except during the attendance-mandatory State of the Company addresses. People below the executive levels are consistently underpaid, seduced by the company's ""not-for-profit"" byline, and despite enduring the constant rumors about overpaid execs and board members. The result is a continuing brain drain of top people going to competitors who (shock and surprise), because of their move beyond ""Planet MP"", statistically end up receiving commensurate pay and improved titles elsewhere. Go figure. "
"Measured Progress, Inc.",",Best part of the job is the oddly cushy benefits package, with some admittedly decent perks (vision & medical reimbursements?!), but this has been slimming down steadily over the years to something more equivalent to the national norm. I guess this is the trade off for the other negatives described herein. "
"Measured Progress, Inc.",",Hardest part of the job is enduring the continuing loss of regular business to more adept competitors. This company's contract work is driven by public funding of state education but this is not a good dependency due to today's political climate. "
"Measured Progress, Inc.",",Spiraling downfall of a once-local gem."
"Measured Progress, Inc.",",  "
"Measured Progress, Inc.",",This was a great place to work with flexible schedules, generous paid time off, and great benefits. The team of people I worked with were  fabulous. The hardest part of the job was probably deadlines and meetings. Taking time off was often difficult depending on the time of year."
"Measured Progress, Inc.",",Excellent facilities and opportunities available for the dedicated individual."
"Monsanto","Simple job task of detasseling corn, good pay with a raise for every year you come back. Seasonal job. They care deeply about safety and concerns of workers."
"Monsanto",",Good place to work, with generous compensation structure.  The corporate culture is highly collaborative, seeking buy-in from all relevant stakeholders.  Senior Management carries themselves in an approachable manner and they lead by example, holding themselves to the same standards they expect from the rest of the employees."
"Monsanto",",Good client to work I don't have any negative experience with the client and the team was very good. Te work culture is very good"
"Monsanto",",It was so hot! Pollinating hundreds of tall corn stalks. But it was cool meeting people from all over Southwest Georgia. The supervisor is awesome"
"Monsanto",",I worked with a lot of intelligent people while I worked at Monsanto.  I loved my job, but had to leave company for job relocation for spouse"
"Monsanto",",I enjoyed working for Merisant. The company always had an open door policy and insured safety in every task. Team work is essential at Merisant."
"Monsanto",",I enjoy working there because the bosses are very nice and understanding that we all have a personal life outside of work. A typical day at work is usually pretty easy going and have option to sit or stand."
"Monsanto",",This is a great place for high school and college students to work at during the summer. They are very flexible when it comes to needing days off."
"Monsanto",",A typical day would start by signing in at the main building and waiting till starting time which then we would leave by bus out to the fields and put away our lunch and waited for further instructions. Than we would go out into the fields to cross start working. We took brakes time to time to change locations, jobs, or for lunch and at the end of the day we would get back on the buses to get back to the office so we could check out."
"Monsanto",",Monsanto can be one of the easiest jobs when you apply yourself. With the help of management and co-workers, you always have a great time out in the field."
"Monsanto",",The hardest part of the job was not having enough work to do at the beginning of the hiring date. I like the laid back setting and not having someone watching over you the whole time. Most of the coworkers are nice and helpful."
"Monsanto",",it was worth it & a good job . picking cotton & putting it in a bag loading big bags & throwing them on the trucks then taking it to the company to gin it in the machine . it was long days in the fields some days but i liked it after catching on to everything like picking the cotton & put it in the machine to get the seeds out . Going out of town to pick cotton"
"Monsanto",",Work in the field 7-4. Learned how to collect data. The management is great and the coworkers are too. It is tiring physically. The pay was enjoyable."
"Monsanto",",I have been very fortunate to work for Monsanto for 16 years.  The company is very vested in their people and personal development.  I have gained experiences in many aspects of the business."
"Monsanto",",Working at Monsanto during the summertime includes clocking in, having supplies ready, transportation to the corn fields, and performing the necessary work like pollinating and detasseling the stalks in the corn fields."
"Monsanto",",Typical day at work from 8-5 pm. Co-workers are very friendly and co-operative. Easy going work culture. Though salaries are not very satisfying."
"Monsanto",",Monsanto was a great place to work, and was a very fair place to work for. If you did your job correctly no one had a problem with you and if you show up on time its a good plus because a lot of workers didn't but I did and had a pleasant time."
"Monsanto",",Coworkers are great, benefits are good and most of the managers are competent. This is an aggressive company and if you would like to know how industry leaders behave work for Monsanto."
"Monsanto",",Only downside is internal politics and few managers playing favorites."
"Monsanto",",A lot is demanded in the lab and has a high daily throughput with unrealistic KPI's. The different group work in concert to acheive all final data that is required for each sample that is process.The actual protocols we follow are fairly basic, but the volume of samples prove to be a challenge. This challenge is compounded by lack of communication from management when there has been a change to  daily priorities. The workload changes seasonally and we have a high turn over of employees. Training new employees to meet the demand of the season is also challenging due to all the ISO protocols and USDA regulations that need to be followed along with all of the proper lab protocols to obtain quality results."
"Monsanto",",Up early in the morning for work and you could be done by noon and have the rest of the day off. Good co-workers and mangament. Fast paced and messy enviornment."
"Monsanto",",It's great and I love to work here. They have a very strict safety policy which insures that all Monsanto employees are working safe and productively."

"The Hartford Financial Services",",the most enjoyable part of the job"
"The Hartford Financial Services",",There is no work life balance unless you consider working over 60 hrs per week to be a good work life balance.  "
"The Hartford Financial Services",",Understaffed with metric driven goals.  High turnover rate.  Upper management plays constant games with surveys and bullies their way through issues . HR does not perform consistent exit interviews."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",It has been a long time since i worked at The Hartford. The culture has changed significantly. But when i was there, the HIG had great training and deep SME knowledge amongst its employees. Since then, I've been told that outsourcing has all but eliminated this culture."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",I manage a portfolio of projects for Enterprise Risk Management and identify areas for process improvement.  I am also the lead financial person within our group.  I am a relationship liaison between our Enterprise Risk Management Organization and our business partners."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",A very laid back place to work with a great support staff and management. Compensation is one of the best in San Antonio and there is plenty of room for growth."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",Hartford spent the last few years developing software and system management. At this time they focusing on employee and management development. Hartford has received many aware for quality work environment."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",The Hartford is a great company to work for. Competitive pay and advancement opportunities. Work life balance is excellent. Management does everything they can to accommodate."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",They expected me personally to have a higher amount of claimants I had to work on at one time.  For example instead of working on the average of 250 claims I had 400."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the Hartford Insurance group, both the people I've worked with and the thousands of customers I've served."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",Started my job at 7:00am and worked till 1:00pm liked having the flexible schedule.  Like the different clients I got to talk to everyday.  Built a good repor with my customers"
"The Hartford Financial Services",",Experienced may years of different workplace cultures and enjoyed learning more about the insurance industry. The management used to be great but recently has been through many different changes creating a not so friendly and comfortable work place environment."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",If you are analytical and good at math this is the perfect job for you. I enjoyed working there because I had more personal space to allow for more interaction with agents and policyholders."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that I work with. Many individuals that work here have been at the company for many years. Unfortunately, there is not much opportunity to continue growth. Work/life balance also continues to dissipate."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",I really disliked this job with all my heart. They really did not care about their employees at all. It's very very sad. I'm an scarred for life after working here. They are not family oriented, management is brutal."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",Enjoy my time working with Hartford it was also room to grown in learning new things It was a place were you could grow. Great place to work."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",Currently work in the inbound call center servicing existing automobile policies taking numerous calls daily.  They offer great benefits and paid time off."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",We processed requests as the calls came in. Making the customer happy was the highlight of my day. We all had our lunch in the cafeteria and it was amazing that the staff always knew every employee by name."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",I learned that each person has a specialty and when we cross train, we became stronger as a team."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",The hardest part of the job is to know every aspect of insurance, so we had to have comprehensive notes."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",We decorated a coworker's cubicle in the colors that they like for their birthday. It always looked so nice."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",I loved the pot lucks. We were very diverse culturally so we always had great foods from other countries."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",Great place to work.  Team atmosphere.  Everyone works hard and works together to succeed.  Excellent work life balance.  Good benefits."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",I was with the Hartford for over 10 years and was able to have the experience of working from home so I could take my job anywhere within the United States and this is when I relocated to Houston, TX in 2012."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",It seems like every day we are given more bad news or more of our benefits being taken away. Recently it was overtime being very limited even though it is impossible to complete this job in a 40 hour work week and still produce the numbers they want to see.  Upper management is constantly changing and we aren't going to be receiving bonuses this year.  "
"The Hartford Financial Services",",They keep track of your every move and you are compared against every single person in the company that holds your position. You are also ranked against all of them as well.  It is extremely stressful and not worth the money."
"The Hartford Financial Services",",The Hartford focuses on being a company that strives for growth while at the same time provides a viable work environment."
"Booz Allen Hamilton","Good company with interesting projects.  The opportunities, and clients provide for fascinating and interesting experiences."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Booz Allen is a very professional environment that encourages its workers to learn and grow. The company offers many training to help young employees sharpen their skill sets."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Good work life balance and company is very supportive on letting employees grow into other opportunities. Benefits are good and pay is very competitive."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Good company to work for. Pay isn't that great unless you can haggle when you get hired. If you don't work at a Booz office, then is the same as any other job. However, there is an unwritten expectation for you to attend after-work functions, and volunteer training. Of course you have to make up that time, so work-life balance becomes ""not so well"" in that perspective. Remote work is very, very seldom and hard to find. That carrot, however, is dangled in front of you. "
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Management is excellent, but varies person-to-person. They do want to keep people, will provide you will the tools you need to further your career."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Overall, Booz is an excellent company, but you really need to be proactive."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",The company is big and the levels of leadership can  be a little daunting. I came to the company to be able to stay with my wife as she PCS'd to her new assignment (they did not have the capability to support this option).  Benefits and culture have changed a lot when they went public and some of the features that endeared me to Booz Allen have slowly dropped off year by year.  It is still easier to leave and comeback at a higher level if you are an associate and above."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",There are a lot of important projects that one encounters as  a BAH employee and you meet amazing people. However, the work/life balance is not there."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",To provide excellent customer service through phone, email, etc. in timely and accurate manner.  Serve as a liaison between management and customer to improve the customer experience and business productivity.  "
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Monthly reconciling of pcard and contract to date requests are tedious, because both are due simultaneously as well as maintaining your order productions. "
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Overall the job is not hard, work in a timely fashion, the hardest part I find is knowing when to stop and eat lunch.  Once you begin, time seems to go by fast."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",High compensation for high work amount"
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Cons"
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",As a road warrior I travelled 50 weeks a year for work. The hours on the road are generally over 10 per day,"
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Pros"
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Pay"
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Great place to work. Work place culture is diverse and talent is outstanding.Outstanding benefits. An idea consulting firm to work at  and learn the consulting business."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Good workplace environment. Diversity great in some ways, can improve. Development for entry level employees can vary greatly. Good work-life balance for consulting firms."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",I am with baH for almost 12 years and one thing I have learnt is to not run after  promotion until U are working on a project with your direct manager. Your manager has no clue what u do on your day to day job and thus miss/ignore promoting some good deserving employees and eventually losing them to other companies. Just do your bare min and keep getting your yearly raises as the flwxibity with work life balance is great here."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",The existing employees were used to writing about other companies strengths and weaknesses. "
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",When they inherited a development project from a reviewed company, they had to hire developer and verification engineers quickly. "
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",The management and employees had to determine the standards and protocols associated with software development. Hard lessons were learned well."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Provides employees with training and opportunity to succeed in the government consulting field. Competitive and diverse workplace."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Flexible schedule, great benefits, variety of work assignments and ability to travel and transfer across the organization."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",If you want to understand Booz Allen, read the firm's posted core values.  While at some places the core values are platitudes, at Booz Allen, the core values are real and vibrant.  They guide what we do within the firm, within our teams, and within our client engagements.  "
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Though government consulting is a highly-regulated business, with the pratfalls associated with working with government clients, the caliber of the people at Booz Allen is simply wonderful."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Participated in a volunteer position for InfraGard. Provided leadership to large community of network security professionals and the FBI. Volunteered for three years in the position."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",I loved working for BAH from 2000-2013. The company was awesome until they went Public. After that everything changed and a high percentage of upper management were let go. It became volatile in the government environment and had to start cutting corners."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Booz is a great company especially if you are a self-starter and can get things done."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",I worked with some exceptional people at Booz."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Booz is an excellent company.  There are some excellent people that work there, and I made some good friends while I was there.  Unfortunately, I was there during a particularly turbulent time.  In the roughly 3.5 years that I was there, 4 of my career managers left.  That isn't normal at all....come to think of it, maybe I drove them away?"
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",People in the consulting industry often love talking about the consulting industry.  It's politics. I'm the type of person that works to live....most people at booz aren't."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",Don't bother killing yourself for that raise - you will get the same 2-4% raise as the person that did the bare minimum. There is a HUGE disconnect between leadership and staff. They have no idea what their employees are doing on a day to day basis, as they are too busy trying to secure their next proposal.  The ""check-ins"" are half hearted at best and usually leadership is just going through the motions. It is a check on the box. BAH employees are constantly brought onto teams that don't really need them - and then need to try and make themselves relevant in some way. "
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",It's a great place to work if you want to show up, do as much as required so you don't get yelled at, and go home to your family. DON'T work here if you want to innovate, be rewarded based on performance (versus how long you can wait it out until the next allotted raise period), and feel like more than another number."
"Booz Allen Hamilton",",This is my first job out of college and it was a fantastic experience. Learned a vast amount of knowledge in regards government contracting bid strategy. The management is very respectful and is truly looking out for your best interests. Benefits are industry standard, although the employee stock purchase plan discount can be increased."
"EMD","amazing, scary, emotional, exciting, learning capable; most enjoyable about job was fact of being able to assist someone in time of need despite time and knowledge"
"EMD",",I found the employees of EMD Serono to be people of character and willing to do what it takes to complete any and all work assignments."
"EMD",",I would highly recommend this company."
"EMD",",Excellent culture. No real complaints on my end as an employee. People are nice and generally very competent. It's nice to work for a German company as opposed to Pfizer."
"EMD",",Work was diverse but there was a lot of travel involved, Didn't provide all the tools needed to complete field work. they had good compensation for travel and paid when ever you were driving."
"EMD",",The company is very focused on customer satisfaction, they provide luncheons and try to have fun events throughout the year.  Most of the people who work there are very professional and friendly.  The most enjoyable part of the days was assisting the patients with processing their prescriptions and managing any potential side effects that may occur from using a injectable."
"EMD",",I am an EMD dispatcher. This certificate allows me to give medical instructions over the phone. I am trained to dispatch ambulances and law enforcement to calls appropriately."
"EMD",",EMD Serono is a fantastic company to work for. I enjoyed showing up every day and discussing science with my peers. Although EMD Serono is a large, international company, the management has found a way to make it feel like a small research company."
"EMD",",Great company to work for with great people, good benefits package and promotes giving back to the community with team community service events."
"EMD",",Conservative in new drug R&D fields, low successful rate in late stage development programs in the past few years,  co-development  of antiPDL1 Ab with Pfizer is a good sign of recovery from the past."
"EMD",",Providing quality care of the sick and injured.  Assuring transportation in the most productive care for the patient,  Assigning and managing crews for calls needing transport to hospitals, clinics, doctor, and other medical establishments for continuing care."
"EMD",",Good company, but the management team kept changing. No job security and personal career development."
"EMD",",More concerned about numbers than people, lack of any coherent direction from upper mgt, constantly changing priorities, mgt doesn`t follow the same rules as workers."
"EMD",",Not an AMERICAN owned company, privately owned, no oversight."
"EMD",",I would start my day with discussing the plan of the day or sometimes week with my supervisor and getting to know the priorities of different experiments."
"EMD",",As this was my first adventure in industrial setting the overwhelming part at the starting was the volume or scale of the work which exponentially higher than the academic setting. But at the same time all my colleagues and supervisor helped me to understand and multitask and manage my time efficiently which made the job easy."
"EMD",",The most important part of working in this industry is the satisfaction that at the end I am going to be a small part of making patients life better."
"EMD",",Downsizing, doing more with less..."
"EMD",",Coworkers were generally great.  "
"EMD",",Middle management very reasonable."
"EMD",",I have gained valuable experience with my time at EMD. The company has helped me with the next step in my career"
"EMD",",+ Very fast paced environment.  "
"EMD",",+ Team atmosphere, goal oriented, customer service oriented.  "
"EMD",",+ Comp was good, especially being outside of the city."
"EMD",",+ Systems were not cutting edge, but efforts were on-going to incrementally improve."
"EMD",",+ Reportedly, morale is suffering - largely due to uncertainty with the future."
"EMD",",If you plan on working inside the labs or as a scientist please do consider this company.  Everyone in that sense of the work environment are very nice and wonderful to speak with and learn from. "
"EMD",",However, the management style of some is down right unbelievable and unprofessional.  You are not able to think on your own and are expected to be a robot.  If you have ideas outside of the labs you are not allowed to do anything.  You are micromanaged to the point where it borders on plain insulting.  Also, if you ask for more work it is seen as a weakness due to trying to be better then other people.  "
"EMD",",It is overall a very unhealthy work enviornment for those who have higher aspirations. "
"EMD",",It is a way they control their employees (who are fewer and fewer because they only believe in contractors).  Perm positions are said to be very likely until you start and you realize you would never want to work as a perm employee.  "
"EMD",",They sell a very good game, but once you are in the true colors always come out.  It would be a very interesting place to work for a human study. "
"EMD",",If you choose to still apply best of luck and I hope you make it out unscathed."
"EMD",",EMD Serono/Touchpoint Solutions:Delivering exceptional service to patients, healthcare providers and medical institutions through their committement to fighting the disease of Multiple Sclerosis."
"EMD",",As a co-op student at EMD Serono, guidance from the business intelligence team in the form of helpful and structural teaching provided me with insights on how Agile and Waterfall managed projects get accomplished. I learned the process of retrieiving business user requirements and transforming them into functional and technical specification documents which included technical and use-case diagrams. Also, creating test cases at the conclusion of each project so that the development team and the end user can test each scenario for errors and bugs helped me understand how the team can interpret requirements from the user-customer and produce a finish product that is rolled out to the business and sales teams. Scrum meetings, management guidance, and personal help from each member of the team helped provide me with the understanding of how an Information System's team works in a fast-pace environment with multiple projects being worked on simultaneously."
"EMD",",I worked there as a contract employee so I don't have much information on their pay or benefits package.  It was a pleasant working atmosphere and the people were very nice."
"EMD",",Excellent salary and benefits, very competitive with the biopharmaceutical industry. "
"Pixability","Great people with a quality focus on their people.  Co-workers were hard working and ambitious. Worked with top clients like Reebok and Wayfair."
"Pixability",",Depending on the time of hire, and position you take up at Pixability, it can be a fantastic place to work.  So long as your department isnt currently suffering from employee retention issues.  The team is incredibly motivated, and pushes each other to perform their best.  There really is a feeling of community here.  The company also has wonderfully dedicated management and executives.  They do everything they can to help the company and its employees succeed.  That being said, there seems to be a lack of consistent focus on product development and direction.  Specs change often and you may feel like you are building a different product on Friday than you were Monday.  Once the company can get over those growing pains, the churn rate should drop, especially in engineering, and the future looks very bright"
"HP","Very fast moving company.  Learn alot about HP EVA's and 3par Storage systems along side data migration.  Hard part about the job is being away from family because you are 85% travel.  Best part about the job is your dealing with the cutting-edge gear everyday."
"HP",",Do the production of the day in 8 hours with minimum scrap parts"
"HP",",I learned to do production of the day working with teamwork "
"HP",",The workplace culture was work in cleanroom area free of particles"
"HP",",I was a contractor for the roseville, CA campus and everyone there was bright and happy every day. The campus has everything you need including a gym and basketball courts"
"HP",",HP is a company that is has strong foundation on ethics & diversity. It's been struggling for several years with some poor acquisitions. I'm sure it will get of out these perils."
"HP",",This company using many new tools to enhance your job performance. Offers the opportunity to work with individuals from all over the world."
"HP",",HPE continues to grow. In the 90s the Unix server business was great, after CPQ acquisition x86 growth drove the company. HP continued a successful push into business software."
"HP",",The turn-over is so horrible."
"HP",", You could be the best and still get fired."
"HP",",Your like the assistant to the field rep"
"HP",",have to be very organized for this job"
"HP",",Lots of great, capable people, high burnout rate for managers. Organization structure left many gaps in responsibilities that ended up being filled in on evenings and weekends"
"HP",",This company was great for many decades.  Now they are struggling to understand how to make money in the newest reality.  Their traditional markets are shrinking,  margins are dropping and competition is better than ever.  They are lay people off,  selling units off and outsourcing processes all in the name of the bottom line.  No question the bottom line is critical.  But they still advertise great service and support and it just isn't true.  Culture stopped meaning anything years and years ago.  Still lots of good people who work hard every day."
"HP",",I had fun working for HP, they would really encourage to work as team. If we had a problem we supposed to talk as team and work trough the issue and figure out."

My collaborators will an awesome gathering to work with even thou I prepare all of them.The hardest part of the occupation was getting stuff together for the drills. The charming part of the employment is not having anybody investigating your shoulder."

"HP",",Go in with open eyes.  Job security based on contract success.  Otherwise, a good place to work.  Management cared about its people.  I mostly enjoyed my time with them."
"HP",",Very Disorganized they lack communication very badly they don't communicate anything and are distrustful they say things and don't fall through."
"HP",",NGEN contract doesn't pay very well. Each year more and more jobs are being cut and as a result your work load increases while you compensation stays the same or decreases."
"HP",",Great pay and benefits. Management team isn't necessarily local. In 3 years my management changed 3 times. My co-workers were from around the world which was really great."
"HP",",HP is no longer the company it used to be. The new direction and vision has resulted in a loss of job security, enthusiasm, and loyalty. I wish things wouldve been better."
"HP",",Fun, exciting, awesome!!! Love this company! Hp really focuses on retaining their employees. If you are a good worker they will want to keep you and move you up in the company. Pay is good.

"BNY Mellon","enjoyed learning about finance and investments. opened personal as well as business accounts earning clients money on there returns"
"BNY Mellon",",Very stressful place to work. Everyone is afraid of being laid off.  Reorganization is an on going process."
"BNY Mellon",",Very low employee morale. Management is trying different ways to engage employees but has not much successful."
"BNY Mellon",",Its a large workplace that has 100s of applicants every day.  At any level they know you are replaceable and treat you as such.  It all depends on whether you have a good direct manager, they will make or break your career there."
"BNY Mellon",",Although only a part-timer there was a lot of work and responsibilities. Great place for advancements. Great working there and with co-workers."
"BNY Mellon",",typical day is doing unvested cash and answering the responses."
"BNY Mellon",",distribution day is on the 15th and end of the month.  i have learned how to transfer cash thru various accounts."
"BNY Mellon",",My day is like every other day.  See the movie "" Ground Hogday"" for a better reference.  No bonus, raises and incentives for personal development.  Workplace culture is very clique-like with only the brown-nosers getting advance despite their knowledge or lack of knowledge.  Management only cares about the bottom line, not taking care of its people.  My most enjoyable part of the job and saving grace is the people I work with."
"BNY Mellon",",I enjoyed the work and the people at BNYMellon.  The work was hard to get done because the systems did not always work the way they should.  Since we where on a dead line this made it difficult to get the job done in a timely manner.  Very stressful job"
"BNY Mellon",",There is little to no training at BNY and most of what you learn is how to navigate their ancient systems.  Lower level managers are mostly cool people but there's no oversight on the supervisors beneath them.  Upper management tend to be creeps that won't look at you or say hello when you pass them in the hall.  Your co-workers are usually nice people and everyone is desperately looking for a new job.  The salary is bottom of the barrel and there is likely no end to that in sight.  It's a company that values maximum profit at the lowest cost and shows no concern for the worker bees that help achieve it.  If you need to get your foot in the door it's good for that, otherwise I don't recommend coming to BNY."
"BNY Mellon",",My first job out of college was at BNY Mellon. I have been with the company for over 9 years and have learned and grown in many areas. I would recommend anyone interested to work for BNY Mellon for I think it is a great work culture and a strong and successful company."
"BNY Mellon",",Good place to learn different aspects of your expertise. The culture is very different than other corporations; it takes some time to get accustomed to. Senior management is making good strides on changing the bank as a whole."
"BNY Mellon",",Good place for recent college grads. Tough to move up the ladder. Can be very monotonous. Ok if you like cube farms. basic 9-5 hours"
"BNY Mellon",",Fun environment to work, people are fun to be around and very helpful."
"BNY Mellon",",As an entry level job, you learn a lot. "
"BNY Mellon",",Management is great and always there when you need help."
"BNY Mellon",",The company does try to hold events to bring different teams together. Volunteer opportunities are available. Provides opportunities and trainings to contribute and succeed within our organization."
"BNY Mellon",",I have been given the chance to work in security which I had not done prior. I have access to upper management through presentation and online meetings I set up with Vendors. With so many different facets within security it has been a challenge keeping up with all of them. "
"BNY Mellon",",They would like to hire me full time but there are currently no requisitions open in my group for my particular background. They have extended me twice and will do a third time but I really would like to get out of being a contractor. "
"BNY Mellon",",I enjoy going to work, there is always something new to learn and a new Vendor to deal with."
"BNY Mellon",",BNY is a very bland company from my experience. Though the people are all very nice and helpful, this place should really only be used as a stepping stone or somewhere to end your career. Benefits are decent, pay is very low, and there is essentially no recognition for employees doing a good job. They need more incentives to get people to look forward to coming to work everyday, otherwise it'll stay the way it is with the entire staff complaining day in and day out."
"BNY Mellon",",Loved to work with people. Had a great team. My manager was very good. Overall environment not so great. A lot of politics"
"BNY Mellon",",As a Project Manager, your days vary. One day you maybe  working on an ongoing assignment, then next day you are asked to handle a different assignment. You do have deadlines for specific assignments, others may just pop up and need to be handled immediately. Sometimes there are issues where there is no one available to escalate and you have to make the call. I learned a lot about Risk and Compliance and enjoyed it."
"BNY Mellon",",It was a good experience and a fun workplace to work. They also provide fun perks as well to ensure that their employees don't get bored."
"BNY Mellon",",BNY Mellon is an old bank, like most old banks it has old relationships, who are very wealthy clients. But the employees all seem like they are very cool down to earth people. very fun bunch to work with."
"BNY Mellon",",1. A Typical day is never typical as change is constant"
"BNY Mellon",",2. I learned that in Corporate Recruiting building great relationships is THE MOST IMPORTANT Priority "
"BNY Mellon",",3. I loved most of my Managers"
"BNY Mellon",",4. Hardest part of the job was getting comfortable with not being comfortable. Changes again are constant so you need to be able to have a high capacity of adaptability"
"BNY Mellon",",5. I enjoyed working in the city and being in a diverse environment! I loved the challenges of working with so many different clients under one roof. I loved the work life balance and the companies goals to be one of the industry best, globally."

"Spotify",",I loved temping at spotify, it was the best job I've ever had so far! Unfortunately it was a temporary assignment and I was not able to stay."
"Spotify",",Spotify was such a wonderful place to work! There was an ongoing sense of community between co-workers and departments, a consistent flow of information keeping us updating on the latest digital trends, and the open opportunity to showcase new ideas to peers that could further the overall advancement of the company."
"Spotify",",Put up flyers and send out play-list cards. "
"Spotify",",Learned about marketing and social media marketing."
"Spotify",",The hardest part is to interact with real people and no enough training process."
"Spotify",",The most enjoyable part is that it is a very flexible job."
"Spotify",",Spotify created many wonderful incentives for the Campus Influencers.  However, the management and organization of the position was not done efficiently."
"Spotify",",It's a great place with great culture and perks.  Employees all enjoy hanging out together and are all friends outside of work.  Mostly everyone on the ground are open minded about meeting new people and trying new things which creates a great lunch environment.  (People often eat together during lunch time and sit with different people)"
"Spotify",",However because it's managed by leads in a different country, Sweden, it's often times hard to align interests between the different cultures.  Poor managers are allow to remain in senior positions because there hasn't been enough documented cases to see a trend in the poor management.  Communication about changes in the organization from Sweden to the US is often lacking and unclear."
"Spotify",",Everyone at the company works super hard but that doesn't mean there isn't room to have fun. There was countless video games, ping pong tables, couches, pool tables, snacks and so much more all over the office. I was part of the office management team and we catered to all of the employee needs. It was a wonderful job, and I met some pretty amazing people who do pretty amazing things."
"Spotify",",Learned a lot about marketing and enhanced my future. Learned to properly utilize mouth-to-mouth marketing. Was an interm basis."

"Lyft Corporate","Great side job great people but sadly not enough money to make a full time job.I don't know what else to. Write. I love the people that I drive for they are nice but sitting in the car for long hours sometimes is horrible"
"Lyft Corporate",",Perfect service and very clear information"
"Lyft Corporate",",Great company for extra cash"
"Lyft Corporate",",Call service any time "
"Lyft Corporate",",Help support working all day for you"
"Lyft Corporate",",Not to be considered for full-time employment at all. Take the bonus and run. Do not rent a car. Stay clear AWAY from this company."

"Lyft Corporate",",You may be deactivated any day for any reason. "
"Lyft Corporate",",All it takes is one rider filing a complaint whether true or false.   And this happens all the time.  Just google it for yourself."
"Lyft Corporate",",Lyft is a great company to work for, very flexible schedule and you're able to meet all different types of people while driving all around town. Great"
"Lyft Corporate",",I love it i make as little or as much as I want when I need, payments are on time. Great cars and fun people to meet, also when you get to certain points you get bonuses and other discount prices."
"Lyft Corporate",",i learned more about different cultures and mostly the tourists that come to visit from close by in the states to people out of the country. i would recommend this job to anyone who would love to spend time with their families and work on their own time. also if anyone would just want to make some extra money."
"Lyft Corporate",",the management is poor. Communicating with them is hard.But i learned many routes in orange county and also LA. However, working for this corporate is not beneficial. no benefit included."
"Lyft Corporate",",most of the days or nights i work are extremely wonderful. you get to meet multiple people with lots of differences between them. you get to talk and socialize with a range of people. and people love what we do."
"Lyft Corporate",",I love the freedom of working for lyft. Very flexible & the customers are all very polite. The lyft app is very helpful and syncs with your cell phones navigation making the pairing process a piece of cake."
"Lyft Corporate",",Provide driver service to various customers from different backgrounds, color, and race. All while having conversion pertain to sports, politic, religion, and even their personal affairs. I also offer advice and counsel if they so desires."
"Lyft Corporate",",I can say that this company tries to do things with drivers interact with other drivers and try to do a little fun events to boost morale. They do little incentives to help with pay . "
"Lyft Corporate",",The downside is based on your city there are not enough Riders requesting the service to really make a consistent income off of just driving alone"
"Lyft Corporate",",Recently moved to California from Honolulu and I decided to join Lyft Corporate because what's better to get familiarize with the city than driving and get compensation at the same time. It is not my desire to be full time active and make it as a career because I have other interest in what suits me best. But I find myself doing great with the customer service because I am a peoples people who loves to interact with others which makes it a lot faster for me to adapt into a city that brings diversity comes to culture."
"Lyft Corporate",",The main reason Lyft was a great job opportunity was you really are your own boss in the sense that you could work at any given time to your desire. It's uplifting many times because you're given the experience in interacting with many people around the Chicago land area."
"Lyft Corporate",",I will clarify what the reviewer from Texas said in his review in plain English:"
"Lyft Corporate",",If there is negative feedback from passengers, Lyft will deactivate your driver account with no warning or explanation, EVEN IF YOU HAVE A HIGH RATING. The first reviewer saying ""the rider is 1005% right"" means that the company does not provide any opportunity to defend yourself, by countering any claims. Passengers are at many times drunk and can be belligerent, or perceive situations incorrectly because of their inebriation."
"Lyft Corporate",",Since you are not an employee of the company, they do not care if they are treating you in a fair and balanced process - they simply throw you away and activate the next guy to drive these drunk people."
"Lyft Corporate",",You got no voice at all and anybody can bust you up. Drunks in the morning are hard to go with. Anybody can busted you up. Drunks passenger are 1005 right."
"Lyft Corporate",",Great way to meet different people and to develop social skills. Great way drive around Arizona. Passengers are always great to drive with."
"Lyft Corporate",",Pay can be very good on days with active night life and big events. Able to create your own schedule, but you must possess good interpersonal skills in order to receive tips."
"Lyft Corporate",",Buen trabajo pero las carreras deberían pagarlas con una tarifa más acorde"
"Synchronoss","A day at synchronoss office was just fine , i would go in do my job , help others if they were new and needed help and when my shift was done i would go home . I was well respected because i went into work to do a job and finish it and when my day was up i would go home ."

"Synchronoss",",       -Professional customer service (we had scripts to memorize)"
"Synchronoss",",       -Using 3-4 programs at once while actively listening to customers (multitasking) "
"Synchronoss",",       -How to promote products professionally (commission driven) and successfully. "
"Synchronoss",",*Management did have favoritism, however I was never wronged. The environment was extremely fun. There were raffles, games, prizes, and cheers all day, every day. "
"Synchronoss",",*The hardest part of the job was timing. Our breaks and lunches were in a tight time frame. At times, a customer would keep us over our lunch, because once a customer is on the line, we must finish assisting, and leave the customer satisfied. Also Management would not give time off for holidays, or approve any of my vacation time, or sick days. I suspected it was due to slight favoritism. "
"Synchronoss",",*The most fun part of the job was the friendly games and community... also the great commission. I made over 100,000 for myself in commission alone there. It was great."
"Synchronoss",",Excellent place to work. very supportive people and very good management group.employee benefits also very good. career growth also very good as always more opportunities to explore on different tasks."
"Synchronoss",",It wasn't the most stressful job, but it wasn't very laid back either. A good experience overall, and would recommend to others."
"Synchronoss",",A typical day of work would include being yelled at by customers because we can't give them what they want. We have to schedule installs over a week out, the installs are only in the morning since they last for 6+ hours, and the customers can't place the order over the phone, they have to process it online. All of which causes the customer to be less than reasonable a good portion of the time, and the management doesn't really listen to anything we say when we try to give ideas on how to improve, giving me a less than satisfactory feelings about how the company is run. I have learned how to talk to people the right way to avoid misunderstandings and frustration from either side, and I've learned a lot of how companies work internally. The hardest part of my job would have to be when I can't give a customer what they want, which usually ends up in them asking for my supervisor. In that case I have to carefully de-escalate and explain the entire situation to him/her, and if they still want my supervisor I have to flag one down to have him/her talk to the customer personally and explain everything that I just told them. The best part of the job, I'd say, would be when I finally make a sale. In my department that isn't very often, so when it does happen, its a big deal to the dept. My coworkers are a blessing, they help me get through the day sometimes and are some of my very, very good friends. We work together on repeat calls that come in, giving information and advice on the customer to eachother when needed."
"Synchronoss",",Amazing company who cares for their employees and customers. They value great and hard work and reward accordingly. There really is nothing bad that I can say about them."
"Synchronoss",",Fun atmosphere and great people. Doesn't have the desired growth opportunities I expected and was promised existed. Management and senior staff tend to withhold and guard needed information to perform most duties."
"Synchronoss",",Great place to work, there are many departments allowing multiple opportunists for learning and growth. The employees are fun to work with and very team oriented."
"Synchronoss",",it was the busiest time of the year when I worked there but it was fun and made lots of money. training doesn't really help. your hands on experience once put on floor does"

"Synchronoss",",Synchronoss is a fun place to work due to the different personalities but also the different people you get to speak with all day. "
"Synchronoss",",Management can improve more due to many opportunities. The advancement is backwards. It shows to be more about who you know versus what you know. "
"Synchronoss",",This is ran by a temp agency and due to high call volume in the call center itself the hiring process is weak. A lot of relatives work together and it can be very dramatic. "
"Synchronoss",",The money itself which is the reason everyone comes to work is quick and easy. You are on the phones as agents and customers are calling in to order AT&T service. The sales just pour in versus seeking and working hard for it. "
"Synchronoss",",There is commission monthly and agents are making more money then the individuals who manage them. "
"Synchronoss",",The perception isn't correct and no one is on the same page. This is a communication/technology company and miscommunication happens too frequently. The technology itself should be top of the line but is complete opposite. There are constant system issues that end up causing higher call volume."

Then I was floor manger helping my co-workers and jumping the que to answer phones, email, and chats. I learned to have a group of my peers under me and run a smooth operation. When I first started management was not so great but once I was moved up to be in management I jumped through hoops to have my team happy and working well with each other. I was for sure by the book but I did make things work smoothly. The hardest part was when I was moving up the chain I had a few issues with a few peers. They were upset I was moved up and they were not. The most enjoyable part was when I become the team leader and I was able to have the over head company come from California and congratulate me on my work and that they have had their eye one me since I started. They knew I had big plans for myself."

"Wells Fargo",",Working there wasn't very pleasant they had a huge turn around rate there and I soon realized why. The management that they had there did not want anyone to advance. They feared change and also did not want to help. They were strict on having you follow their policies but non of the management would ever follow the policies.

I began to become frustrated with Wells Fargo when they began to use a script to communicate with customers. Many of my customers had been coming to me for years and wanted to have a normal conversation with me as I did with them.

A typical week will include running experiments as well as making sure lab members will have equipment and materials for their experiments as well as mental support to talk over what went wrong in their experiments. I have learned how to be more independent than ever as well as being there for the team when it is required. Managing resources and being cost effective is a priority and being able to motivate the team is necessary. The workplace culture depends on the people and I was lucky to have motivated individuals to work with as well as friendly neighboring labs to discuss experimental issues. The hardest part of the job is to maintain a calm and approachable personality so that team members can discuss their issues without reproach. The most enjoyable part of this job is to interact heavily with team members and take part in the success of their discoveries in lab."

"Capital One",",Your life has to be scheduled around work because the schedule changes constantly. The lead tellers have napoleon complexes and will try to screw you over when you least expect it. If you're part time, you won't ever have a chance to be full time as a teller, they don' t hire full time tellers anymore. Most of the branches are being converted to service centers soon, so a lot of people will lose their jobs. Don't waste your time."

"Capital One",",I loved my 3 years at capital one.. if you every get the oppurtunity to work there take it.. they are extremly accomadating and family oriented."
"Capital One",",You expect issues from the customers but I learned you can never satisfy either the customers our your managers. Most of managers didn't have any experience on the phones so they would never know what you were going through but were quick to tell you what to do and when they were placed on the phones for a short time they would freeze up, ask you what to do, or even dodge taking calls. The culture is great. The hardest part of the job is not being able to fix a customers issue even though you know you can since it is out of your power. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with and some of the customer or knowing you have scheduled time in your bucket but you can't use it for months because all the time is blocked off and you have an emergency and your job is on the line."

"LabCorp",",I did not work here for long but while I was here it was very pleasant and a great staff. I learned a lot as I should have and loved it. I was offered a position however unfortunately I could not accept due to moving out of state. I was very sad not to be able to accept it."
"LabCorp",",My review is based off my interview. The guy interviewing me made it clear immediately that he hates conducting interviews. I understand its good to have a comfortable conversation but after each answer, HE would talk on and onnn and get off topic. He also was saying how people tend to not listen to most of the rules. He was so unprofessional it made me question if i was willing to work for this guy. I never got a call back anyways, and when i left the recruiter a message to follow up, I never heard back. Never even got an email."
"LabCorp",",If you like stress, great. Fast paced, micromanaged, have to justify every move you make, written up for any errors and then you can't transfer out the department for a year after being written up. You can never get a Monday, Friday or any day around a Holiday off. The job duties itself are not that bad but the management will kill your spirit. You will be treated like garbage and never ever receive a word of praise for doing a great job. I busted my fanny for the first year but after no positive feed back and and then having management on your back all of the time, you start to get a bad attitude. The union does not back it's people as well. Pay is ok, no room for advancement."
"LabCorp",",Managers and co-workers are very likable.  Pay and benefits were great.  As with any place in this day and age, job security is uncertain.  Position was eliminated in order to streamline work to division headquarters."

"LabCorp",",company doesn't care to much for paying its employees. They say the offer competitive wages but they are all lies. If the money could match the work we all do then this company wouldn't be a bad place to work"

"TD Bank","Working at TD Bank reminded me of working at my job before which was The Gap and management pressured us on sales and we each had sales goals, even the Tellers! The customers were alright to say the least, we had our bad eggs but it comes with the territory. Management there often turned the other when it came to favoring customers into doing things that were bank policy but at the end of the day, they were the higher voice and we did whatever I was told to do. A day here very similar, especially because the same faces came in all the time, we would offer financial products to new and current customers that best suited them and some of them took our advice and some did not. I learned how to manage money here, I also learned that a bank is like every other retail store out there."
"TD Bank",",working hard for low pay, wouldn't go back, management sucks, not worth spending the summer working there, stay away $800 for 2 months"
"TD Bank",",Provides excellent customer service by maintaining a current HR and retail leadership education; responsible for store operational standards and provide leadership. Resolve conflict, practice improvement and communication to the teller line.  Educate your team members on identifying sales opportunities and referring customers to appropriate store employees or internal business partners to achieve both store and individual sales revenue goals. Support, mentor and educate team members in their professional growth. Develop and manage team members by recruiting, training and recognizing them, establish and support a cohesive team and advocate a positive work environment."
"TD Bank",",I worked here from April 2016 - January 2017. I would honestly have to say that this job was not all what they made it out to be in the beginning. Very trashy working place covered by false class. "
"TD Bank",",Pros- training schedule "
"TD Bank",",Cons- Unwilling to make schedule changes even with a notice months in advance."
"TD Bank",",Drive for the selling of banking products. "
"TD Bank",",Constant threats to be put on probation/ being fired for not selling enough"
"TD Bank",",Oh and forget that huge bonus that they tell you about you wont get much "
"TD Bank",",Poor management (anyone can get promoted at a place like this) "
"TD Bank",",.............. it just to many cons"
"TD Bank",",This is a great work environment. Love the culture and the people around. You will not only learn the work place, but you will also learn about the customer and self. Once you get those completed you will not go back to the way you were. Also need to be mentally prepared for any challenge because it is a bank and it comes with come challenged. Good Luck!"
"TD Bank",",Overall this is a great company to work for with helpful team oriented co workers and a conservative banking approach. Benefits are good but average for the banking industry.  If you're happy in retail banking and want to be behind the scenes rather than store front I doubt you'll find much better. If you're interested in securities and wealth or looking for something with high income this is not the place for you.  "
"TD Bank",",Biggest issues come down to the following. lagging technology compared to other institutions which really hampers operations when volume is up as well as employee ability to provide best service. Micro management strategies from certain levels of management in certain departments. Inconsistency in management style , approach and policy interpretations(especially around flexibility and PTO). detachment of certain operations that need to be better integrated and transparent."
"TD Bank",",Had great benefits, made some great friends, and learned a lot about banking here. Overall this is great company to work for even though i worked here when it was called commerce bank but i don't doubt they don't have the same culture as then"
"TD Bank",",It is an ok place to work as long as you are in a good location. Some stores have really good managers that wont you to go and the store shows it. others not so much"
"TD Bank",",Great pay, great environment to be in. The management is awesome and care about the employees as much as the customers.Customers are very generous. The people you work with are more like family than any other job that I have experienced."
"TD Bank",",Banks are no longer banks, they are stores.  TD is a retail banker.  They say they are focused on customer satisfaction but they are not.  All they want is sales.  They are nice to their employees when they are hitting their sales goals.  Benefits are expensive, college reimbursement is cheap and they make you jump through hoops to get it, and the hours are terrible.  Customers are rude and so is upper management.  The only way to advance is to keep kissing butts all the way up the ladder.  Knowing how to do your job and giving good customer service is not rewarded.  They only care about SALES."
"TD Bank",",Great place to work."
"TD Bank",",Loved my boss, she truly cared about her team."
"TD Bank",",Hours are not the best, they have changed though."
"TD Bank",",Laid back environment."
"TD Bank",",Management truly cares about employees."
"TD Bank",",TD Bank is a great place to work. They allow and encourage their employees to take ownership of their work. They also challenge their employees to be the best they can be. I have grown a lot in my career with TD Bank."
"TD Bank",",I currently work for TD and absolutely love it. Benefits are great, staff is wonderful, overall is a fantastic place to work. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good career startery or PT job to make some extra cash."
"TD Bank",",-Typical day at work has its ups and downs"
"TD Bank",",-Learning new things everyday to keep yourself up to date with anything new that TD may offer to customers."
"TD Bank",",I worked with TD Bank and it was a great company to work for. The only thing that was a problem to me was the management. I think TD Bank hires anyone to be in management, even if they don't meet the qualifications. I had to deal with horrible managers in my TD career. When you use the ""change of command""  to report them (the regional managers) nothing is done."
"TD Bank",",Typical call center- clean. Worked there for 1 yr"
"TD Bank",",Management act likely care but they're just covering for themselves. "
"TD Bank",",Too many ""cliques"", if you're not very talkative or don't care to make small talk you won't stand out. You have to kiss up to not only your team manager but any other manager in any other department to get recognized. They say they want you to move up...But there's never any room to move up, it's competitive. Also, there are way too many metrics and goals you have to make, unrealistic ones. They want you to 1. Get to know the customer 2. Sell accounts/credit cards 3.Assist the customer (who usually has more than 1 problem) in under a certain amount of minutes. I dont want to disclose the minutes but how long do you think that phone call should take? At least 10 minutes right? The pay is okay-same as most contact/call centers. But far more stressful. The only thing I liked was that you still get pto when you're part-time/30 hrs."
"TD Bank",",I loved the way the employees were treated as far as the higher ups were concerned, but there was a lot of negative energy in my branch. My manager knew I wanted to transfer to be a full time employee closer to where I lived but wouldn't sign the paperwork because he didn't want to have to find another part time teller. This was after the manager hiring specifically asked for me to transfer and I had expressed a need to be a full time employee to pay my bills."
"TD Bank",",Had a amazing time work for this company I love how you can move up in the company overall and get your career started. I also love the fact that the managers know how hard you work for this company."
"TD Bank",",TD bank was a great company to work for location I was in at the time could'nt work for me and i was unable to relocate. Everyone that i worked with was always very nice a pleasant"

For a year prior to being ""laid off in good standing"", I was being told that I could not attend weekly meetings because only mandarin would be spoken.

We won a $1bn project with a large carrier to run their data centers.

"Swift Capital",",This company started off with a great atmosphere. Although there was no training to speak of nor did I ever see my manager the first 2 months. Then they switched to a strict corporate environment, where managers hate all forms of happiness and expect you to look miserable and angry at all times."
"Swift Capital",",Management is not available. They just walk past you without saying anything. "
"Swift Capital",",They have their chosen favorites, and as for advancement. Forget about it."
"Swift Capital",",They don't promote any minority groups. Sales has only hired younger white males, and also promoted only the same."

"Swift Capital",",Definitely didn't feel comfortable. "
"Swift Capital",",Very unfair, Jim Crow type atmosphere."
"Swift Capital",",Dont be fooled by the open atmosphere. Its so they can keep an eye on you. Its actually makes it very stressful and noisy because of this."
"Swift Capital",",I do love my coworkers though, but management frowns up any sign of a pulse."
"Swift Capital",",Many current employees have expressed that they are looking elsewhere for work, due to the switch to concentration camp style environment."
"Swift Capital",",Swift has allowed me to broaden my horizons within the financial world. I enjoy working here very much. The management staff is very understanding and helpful. They acknowledge that life exists outside of work and are very flexible with scheduling. The only reason I am leaving is because my family is moving to Michigan."
"Swift Capital",",Learned about the business loans and advances platform extensively and I was able to maintain my own book of business. Entrepreneurial atmosphere with very little micro managing. The office was small so there was a lot of gossip amongst management and employees."
"Swift Capital",",Company has no job culture whatsoever!!! Management...What management?! Underwriter have no clue how to underwrite for alternative lending, but that's mostly due to the owner and management. They don't treat their employees very good outside of feeding them. Health benefits STINK...PERIOD!!! As far as competitive spirit and going after every sale/deal with potential they sit back and cherry pick deals they can and won't do because they pay too much for their money. They will never be an OnDeck even though they try really hard to model OnDeck's business. No organization, no support from what's supposed to be management and you would think the owner having his wife run HR would be some form of conflict of interest but aye...what do I know?"
"Groupon","Management cares for employees well being. Must be comfortable with constant change. Most outside sales positions are work from home so must be a self starter.

"Groupon",",Work is busy as soon as you log in, and stays busy till you log off. Phone lines close at 8pm CST, and open at 8am. Management review your work on a weekly basis, and discuss areas of improvement and what you are doing exceptional at. Doing this without making you feel belittled. Co-workers are great people to work with."
"Groupon",",Limited growth opportunities in the greater Kansas City area, great perks for products and services offered by merchants. Great customer guarantee on services and products."
"Groupon",",The office is very cool. The people are all very fun and young. The company will also put on some very cool parties. Everything is great except for the job itself. Selling solely over the phone is not for everyone. It is quite repetitive and with a product like this you can often times find yourself getting cussed out by potential clients."
"Groupon",",Groupon is an OK company to work for. Towards the end of my employment I felt as if they were picking with me due to the complications i had during my pregnancy."

"Groupon",",Best job I ever had,had a few days where I had to work several days straight, but it was worth it. Really good people to work with an depend"
"Groupon",",on, had things there to help with."
"Groupon",",Groupon is a fun place to work. It is easy to get to, and an easy place to make friends. People who work in Image Design are typical tech/startup personalities, with active lifestyles, hobbies, and high levels of competence. Image designers have relatively flexible schedules, but are required to meet a certain average productivity level, which is measured on a digital meter, so work sometimes feels like a game to get enough points in. At first, it is hard to get in all the points, but you soon learn how to work quickly and effectively. Groupon has many social groups you can join, as well as athletic activities. There is free coffee, free vitamin water, and sometimes free snacks.There is a game room, a swingset, a crying area, a DJ in the elevator, and a giant cat in a spaceship. Compensation was terrible ($13 hourly) but morale was great. Its a really great gig for recent graduates or people just moving to the city."
"Groupon",",Working at Groupon is by no means terrible. You will have a comfortable job, but most likely few challenges that utilize your education or skills. Most days I did the exact same thing, over and over again, down to the button click. This is why I eventually became bored and had to leave. There is room for advancement, but you have to be able to get through the monotonous entry level jobs before pursuing that, which proved difficult. Management leaves a little to be desired, but it was a very young company when I worked there. Chances are they've improved since then. There are a lot of great pros to working for Groupon too - flex scheduling, relaxed environment, and of course the other amazing staff members."
"Groupon",",Each day is challenging at my position, i am called on to solve issues that are barriers or obstructions to production needs."
"Groupon",",I have learned a great deal about warehousing and it's challenges that change almost daily."
"Groupon",",I have been tasked to guide and mentor many of the management staff due to my diverse career experiences."
"Groupon",",Many of my coworkers are much younger and i have worked to develop good relationships to help the team accomplish production goals."
"Groupon",",The most difficult part of my job has been to manage so many different teams and provide them all the tools needed to be successful at their goals by convincing corporate finance to invest in better tools."
"Groupon",",The most enjoyable part of my job has been when my Team has been successful at accomplishing it's goal and i could see where my involvement and assistance was part of that success."
"Groupon",",It was great in the beginning then it all went south.  Poor work life balance, poor management.  Lots of internal politics."
"Groupon",",You have no job security, and there is never any guarantees that you'll be paid in time or in full on payday. The work is comprehensive and easy. The hours are misleading and you can be forced to work up to 12 hour days for 7+ days or more. Their labor laws are not forced."
"Groupon",",Great potential but have many process changes instituted and changed again before seeing full benefits. Spur of the moment decisions affecting long term goals."

"Frontier Communications",",The company has changed the corporate structure after I left."
"Frontier Communications",",The company is now more centralized and cost efficient in decision making processes.  At one time the company wasted tons of money and time on inefficiencies, redundancies, and a serious lack of communication."
"Frontier Communications",",The tides have changed and the company is now recovering."
"Frontier Communications",",The work atmosphere is one of the best aspects of Frontier, as the people are phenomenal to work with."

"Frontier Communications",",My team and supervisor was the absolute best.  We had fun and was   often rated as the best time in the center by our performance. I learned so much about our products and how to successfully obtain good numbers on this team. Our team members were helpful and we treated each other as family."
"Frontier Communications",",2 of my friends work there.  Office enviroment is ok.  All cubicles.  Company is consolidating departments. Too many contractors."
"Frontier Communications",",This company is a wonderful company to work for. I started in the residential call center and quickly worked my way up. Great benifits, and decent pay. However a word of caution, I would not advise taking a job with them just at this time. I'm honestly confused why they are hiring more people, while they are in the middle of massive layoffs of well over 2,000-2,500 employees...which is no secret. A simple google search will find multiple reports of their layoffs."
"Frontier Communications",",As a former employee I wouldn't tell you to get this job. The job wasn't good at all. You don't get to really choose your schedule. You get a seniority date so when they do shift swaps you get what you get. Preferences don't really give you what you want. The money is good but you will be stressed out. You move around everything 3 months to be on a different team. Management is not the best either.  Don't work here get your education and go else where. This job is not for everyone. Angry customers are not fun but you have to do what you can for them. Don't get sick you will get a write up. Points system sucks. Frontier is disorganized in some ways. Hopefully they change it.  I would say try it out first if you don't like it leave. Every experience is different. Good luck!"
"Frontier Communications",",I had fun working at Frontier the people are talented working with FIOS and VOIP. Unfortunately the company was falling on difficult times and I was caught in a reduction of force."

"Frontier Communications",",Had a great experience working for Frontier Communications.   Frontier offered me job promotions, new experiences, and room for professional growth.  I have nothing but positive to say about Frontier."
"Frontier Communications",",AS frontier was taking over territories from verizon customers prices went up without being told. Also they couldn't get there on demand channels working."
"Frontier Communications",",Frontier was a good company to work for where you had the autonomy to be creative in meeting production goals. As an internet service provider you are constantly having to adapt to a forever changing market along with stiff competition."
"Frontier Communications",",A typical day at work in the Assignment department will always include dealing with a crisis or outage, and reacting to those things that are out of our control. However, it is a fun and exciting place to work because of this. Each day brings new challenges and inspires creative thinking of how to best deal with each scenario."

"Frontier Communications",",This job was just too far for me to travel every day, but I loved it otherwise. I wish it was closer, I would have stayed. Very professional atmosphere, Management was terrific."
"Frontier Communications",",Frontier Communications is a great place to begin a career in telecommunications.  The reason for this is actually bad longterm.  A new account executive, which is a B2B sales position has the opportunity to sell many different types of solutions to a customer. Therefore, an active AE can get significant exposure in mane areas.  However, this is also indicative that Frontier lacks a strategic direction.  Management is strong in some areas and weak in others.  Sales as a whole is still bogged down by unnecessary work--items a salesperson should not be completing."
"Frontier Communications",",A great group of workers"
"Frontier Communications",",Working hours are decided by seniority."
"Frontier Communications",",However they are still very flexible (my favorite perk)"
"Frontier Communications",",Constantly learning new tricks of the trade, always learned something new."
"Frontier Communications",",Will go through a long training period and you will have a test."
"AT&T","Developed professional skills through training and learning new systems of management. I also banked weekly deposits and money counts"
"AT&T",",Was able to handle a large Website with complex server side middle tier with millions of records and millions of hits and millions of customers - using Java, ATG Dynamo Web Application Server (DAS), Oracle Database."
"AT&T",",Great First company"
"AT&T",",great benefits"
"AT&T",",very flexible"
"AT&T",",understand that family comes first"
"AT&T",",enormous pressure to meet sales goals"
"AT&T",",lots of exposure to new technology"
"AT&T",",AT&T is a great company to work when I first started 10 years ago.  AT&T could careless about its employees now.  The union is a joke. They have gone back to  a point system for attendance.  If yiu are sick you get a point.  You now only have 4 points for a whole year.  Once you get 4 points you go on a written. It makes it hard to take care of your children who get sick."
"AT&T",",The people that work there are great but the company is messed up.  They change pay plans every 6 months to a year and want employees to be a General Manager before moving to other positions in the company."
"AT&T",",FOLLOW POLICY AND PROCEDURES!! "
"AT&T",",The Area Mgmt, is great and will assist, floor mgmt... watch your back. It is a great co to work for though, BENEFITS!"
"AT&T",",Meeting new people on daily basis. treating with different nationalities and different ways of thinking."
"AT&T",",building relationship with customers."
"AT&T",",Satisfy the customer and give them all support needed."
"AT&T",",Great company to work for.  They not only provide training before you begin your assignment but during your time on the job.  There is room for advancement.  A really team environment."
"AT&T",",My 30 year service actually says it all. Busy incoming calls all day. You learn to give excellent customer service to all customers of all walks of life. Workplace culture very very diverse to where all employees really enjoy each other and spend time out of the office together. "
"AT&T",",Hardest part of the job was the continued changes and following thru with the new procedures. "
"AT&T",",Enjoyed going to work everyday just to be with my coworkers."
"AT&T",",Great company, good working environment,  Good learning ."
"AT&T",",AT&T keeps on innovating and upgrading their system which is an additional knowledge and challenge for me because i am learning something new"
"AT&T",",I enjoyed my job and my co-workers. I enjoyed building relationships with my customers knowing they could depend on me to help them. I learned a lot and would've retired if I wasn't laid off. Job security is not like it use to be. Management led by reports and didn't always understand the hands on process. With every job there's always room for improvement. The threat of losing your job on a daily basis became overwhelming as well as inconsistent guidelines that some followed and others didn't. In the end, I was blessed to work for a good company."
"AT&T",",A typical day would include  driving to customers locations to restore services, I learned how to deal with customers and diagnosis problems,after 35 years management contact was minimal, the workplace culture was positive, there was not many days that were difficult, I enjoyed working by myself most days"
"AT&T",",Great place to work if you have a good manager. Benefit package is great. Upward mobility can be of some concern if you do not have a sponser."
"AT&T",",Overall a great company to work for."
"AT&T",",same as I wrote about teleperfomance"
"AT&T",",great work environment"
"AT&T",",friendly people"
"AT&T",",good salary"
"AT&T",",hardest is that not easy to take 60 phone calls a day"
"AT&T",",Movement at Trump Speed. Lots of eyes on the job. Pretty political to move along. Some projects were great while others were challenges."
"AT&T",",You start your day at 8 am, the last job window is 4-8. Some days can be very long. But over all it is a good place to work. You have to choose your position wisely, some positions are very hard to advance in."
"AT&T",",Working with the company for 18 years was a great experience for me . It was great. The company was great to me for many years.The managers was great."
"AT&T",",I enjoyed my 10 years with the company. Great leadership. I would rejoin the organization again in the future. Diversity was great, but need more trust and vision for allowing it's employees to work offsite."
"AT&T",",Working in long distance repair involved handling customer calls globally.  It was continuous inbound and outbound testing calls.  I learned about the many methods of repair through the local access carriers.  My manager was good to work with and was an excellent instructor.  I enjoyed talking with customers from all over the world. Sometimes it would take more time for the local telephone company could fix a problem and the customer might become anxious."
"AT&T",",Being a premise technician you have to be able to adapt fast learn on the go, and have patience doing this job you deal with outside elements as well as inside.Meaning hoarders nasty environments you learn how to check and change wires,from coax to pairs. How to install fiber optics as well as satellites you make great money doing it, but it can be physically and mentally exhausting. You get to meet some unique people and learn new things working here"
"AT&T",",good work with great pay, but not a great work life balance. there is a great training program to get you started. the managers have unrealistic demands of job performance."
"Yelp","Yelp has an extremely fun work environment. Management is great and always helpful. I enjoyed the on-going training and meetings."
"Yelp",",Fun place to work. Keeps you on your toes. Learned a lot about sales and good communication. Management is good when you are matched with the right person. The Culture here is relax but fast. Hardest part for me was being on the same page with my manager. She wasn't the right match for me and I tried to change manager but she never signed off on my change. Over all it wouldn't have been so hard if my manager was there to help me. Everyday was something new, the job was a joy of it's own."
"Yelp",",It's a cool place for getting some experience but not somewhere I would start a career. They will hire anyone to fill a spot.  No professionalism at all. From managers to customer service reps. Reasons why customers disliked the service. I wouldn't recommend working here overall."
"Yelp",",Great company with amazing benefits. Perfect for someone fresh out of college. I would for sure recommend this position to a friend or family member."
"Yelp",",Great company culture. Diverse organization striving to promote local business and people. The company has awesome events as well."
"Yelp",",great workplace and great people. however there is not that much room to grow. a lot of the roles offered are just sales and growth within sales. however, the fully stocked kitchen was amazing!"
"Yelp",",Great and fun place to work but the opportunities for advancement are poor at the Chicago location."
"Yelp",",Co-Workers are great and the management team is very fun."
"Yelp",",This is definitely a work hard play hard position so if you don't have that kind of work ethic, this isn't for you. But with the extensive training, fun atmosphere and supportive work environment, it's hard to now work hard."
"Yelp",",Too much time is spent attending to incidents or working around incidents from other teams. Many managers are new/first-time managers and lack the necessary skills to be effective at their jobs while others are handi-capped by the company's culture of super hands off management. Morale is generally poor-whatevs."
"Yelp",",Great company that sells a great product, but there's not many interesting positions to move up from entry-level.  Extensive sales training, and excellent benefits."
"Yelp",",Each day consists of a high volume of cold calls and emails sent out to SMB owners. Management varied, with some managers just one year out of the account executive role. Issues with that were panic when things weren't going well."
"Yelp",",Yelp is a great company. Employees are treated well with a fully stocked kitchen for breakfast and lunch, great health benefits, and great people. The pay is definitely on the lower side. The most negative aspect was the job itself. The day to day is strictly cold calling businesses to sell the advertising program. It can be very monotonous. Also many of the business owners are busy and do not want to speak to you. It's a hard job to find enjoyment in."
"Yelp",",I spent almost 2 years at Yelp. It's a rollercoaster. Full of great colleagues, awesome mentors, and a challenging job (but once you get the hang of it you'll pitch-on-the-fly and feel like a boss)."
"Yelp",",You are responsible for the full sales cycle. From introduction to close. You will have difficult conversations about selling them Yelp ads with SMB prospects. It's challenging, but what you will also have a team, an organization, readily available for you to learn and execute with."
"Yelp",",I owe everything I know about my profession to this opportunity I got here."
"Yelp",",Thanks Yelp! :)"
"Yelp",",Yelp is pretty cool.I would recommend it to someone if there was a job opening they were into."
"Yelp",",Great free snacks. Not so great compared to other companies in the area, but definitely above average. "
"Yelp",",Beer! I've never liked hanging out at an office after hours before. I do that somewhat regularly here."
"Yelp",",Flexible Hours with the option to work from home when necessary."
"Yelp",",Sweet health benefits and they're pretty generous with stock even for us lowly user ops workers."
"Yelp",",Average good-ish time off/sick time"
"Yelp",",Overall company good about providing important updates"
"Yelp",",Unfortunately none of this is enough to make up for the crushing boredom that eventually sets in with moderating content. They tell you straight up when you start not to really expect this to go anywhere. It's kinda sad since we have a lot of talented, intelligent people on the team wasting their smarts. I can feel myself getting dumber from all the terrible punctuation and block paragraphs that I have to read all day long. Go on though, do it a year or two and then move along. It's a great job as one of your first out of college. You don't have to wear real clothes or show up at a specific time and that's all real real nice."
"Yelp",",""Fun"" environment for the most part. Though in our particular department there is a lot of forced fun that really gets irritating for a cynic like me. It's kinda silly since they actually advertise the position as being for introverts. It's a little tone deaf. Like the time they had us spin some Harry Potter sorting hat for assigned seats at lunch. Yep... actual adults arranged that forced"
"Yelp",",  "
"Yelp",", mingling situation with a group full of introverts. They also recently instituted music on Friday afternoons and it is the worst. "
"Yelp",",There are a lot of management things that make the job really stressful. But I think I mostly just get petty and mad because I am so so bored. "
"Yelp",",You'll have fun for a while doing this job probably. But it really does show you a bad side of humanity. There are some awful opinions that I was not used to coming across. That can be tough. But it's nothing awful like if you were moderating beheadings content for that popular video upload website."
"Yelp",",  "
"Yelp",",70+ outbound cold calls daily to SMB's in a assigned territory. Setting 15-20 minute appointments with clients to discuss and pitch the Yelp platform. These BO's already have Yelp pages that most likely have traffic to that listing. Pitch and close the prospects. Get to quota, make some decent cash. "
"Yelp",",However, you must follow the process and be a quick learner. It's easy to fall into habits and not grind it out. Stand up. Take each call with a clean slate, but don't be afraid to mess up and quickly try out a new method again.  "
"Yelp",",Yelp can be a great place for a couple years, but it's a daily grind and not for the weak minded."
"Yelp",",Great company to work for with a startup culture. Interacted with my peer on a daily basis to create a strategy to bring in sales for the online food ordering application."
"Yelp",",Similar to plenty of other reviews I have read, tons of kids fresh out of college who have no idea that there ARE better options out there. They lure you in with all the free food and music and games and stuff but dont tell you about the cold calling and if you dont hit these metrics on the head then you will be shown the door. Managers may ""act"" like they care about you or your home life but at the end of the day you are just a number. training structure is way out of order. They throw you to the wolves the second week on the job and then give you information in a training 2-3 weeks later that would have increased your odds of getting a appointment/sale. Lots of tasks to accomplish on a daily basis but not enough time to complete them all and then you are hit with the no excuses card when you are not pulling your weight. "
"Yelp",",On the flip side, fantastic place to work, free food all day, game rooms and music, lots of stuff nearby."
"Yelp",",Great for younger kids with no responsibilities!!"
"Yelp",",One of my favorite parts about my work day is that each day is unpredictable. I never know who I am going to talk to and as a result, I get to learn about so many unique and interesting businesses, people and meet a lot of entrepreneurs that educate me, too."
"Yelp",",The best perk is definitely the people and culture… and I suppose our brand new office with shuffleboard, ping pong and Rock Band. But truly, I get to work side by side with amazing, talented people every day."
"Yelp",",Yelp is a fun place to work with a youthful environment.  Through a combination of hard work and getting a good territory you have an opportunity to be very successful."
"Yelp",",No one likes cold-calling, but that's what you're going to be doing every day. Yes, you get the freedom to churn the whole sales process from open calling to closing, but managing that while handling objections is a tough sell. Co-workers are friendly, and management could be held to another standard. Hard to differentiate managers as friend or micromanaging sticklers, because people move up quick in this job. It can be very emotionally draining and dry, so mentality is everything in this job."
"Yelp",",I am given tools to be my own boss and impact my own small business. I am also able to change businesses in a positive light. Every work day was an extremely exciting opportunity."
"PerkinElmer","My typical day at Perkin Elmer is fast paced workplace, as soon as i come in I read emails and faxes of information requested from the previous day to process claims and approve denials. information that I dont receive, I have to follow up with health insurance companies so we can meet our deadline."
"PerkinElmer",",Large to Giant biotech company that sells scientific equipment. Generally management is decent with a few bad apples. Little room for growth depending on division you are in and generally speaking the constant management level reorganizations are enough to keep you without a career path."
"PerkinElmer",",Trained assemblers, coordinated work flow, and supervised production team responsible                for electronic and mechanical assembly of Surface Analysis Systems. Performed vacuum                assembly of precision optics in a clean room environment. Met detailed specifications,                    using blueprints and engineering documentation. Worked closely with engineers,                            technicians, and management."
"PerkinElmer",",I started the OneSource program which I now regret, there wasn't support to back it and I was left to figure out how to make it work and be profitable.  Too much emphasis on pharmaceuticals and large contracts while ignoring smaller labs."
"PerkinElmer",",Great environment to work on analytical instrumentation.  Chance to work directly with scientists.  Fascinating work."
"PerkinElmer",",Fun place to work. Close to my house. Co workers very friendly. Great place to work . Bosses are very open. To bad for lay offs."
"PerkinElmer",",Good Company to work for but things have changed in the past 5 years.  Field work with full benefits.  All field positions are worked from home based office."
"PerkinElmer",",I am very happy working for this Co. I have been there 12 years and they are very good to me. This co thinks of there employes and there is chance for advancing within."
"PerkinElmer",",Great Place to work. Good Benefits. Co- workers were easy to get along with and helpful when needed more information to complete the job. Management was responsive when having an issue."
"PerkinElmer",",PerkinElmer has a long history of Innovation with many passionate people around the world who care about their customers."
"PerkinElmer",",Good Work/Life Balance and fair market value in terms of salary.  Big shifts in the culture. Learned a lot 8yrs with the company. The management team is currently going to a great deal of transition so it leaves little guidance to those who report to them.  I would definitely recommend colleagues to apply at Perkin Elmer if there is a job that fits for them"
"PerkinElmer",",I am not happy there, when the co was Caliper Life Sciences I was very happy, my work day is very hard I have learned to run some machines in cleanroom the management is not good they pick there fav!! my co-workers are nice and friendly, the hardest part of the job is the machines break down alot so there are some days you feel like you have not done much."
"PerkinElmer",",It is not the Old PerkinElmer which you may have heard about. That was sold in 1999."
"PerkinElmer",",It is the new PerkinElmer. Keep your back against the wall."
"PerkinElmer",",Take what you can, give nothing back."
"PerkinElmer",",That is how you will be treated."
"PerkinElmer",",If asked anything agree. Your opinion will only get you into trouble."
"PerkinElmer",",They really don't care what you have to say. Just do what they ask."
"PerkinElmer",",I was part of a merger/acquisition and loved my team and the environment. Learned many different parts of the business."
"PerkinElmer",",I'm usually the first one to arrive in our group.  Prior to my arrival I do a quick assessment of things I need to do when I get there.  This may include setting up the laboratory for upcoming experiments, printing/e-mailing any applicable materials to co-workers and customers, and/or analyzing previous data I've obtained through research projects.  I've been with the company for 5 years and have had the same manager since day 1.  I have a lot of respect for him because he is more of a mentor than boss to me.  He has an open door policy that allows me to visit with him and talk about anything (work, life, etc.).  The hardest part of the job is trying to fit everything in an 8 hour work day.  Because of my many responsibilities it can be difficult at times to manage the deliverables I'm asked to complete.  The most enjoyable part of the job is my ability to work on several projects that may or may not be related to one another."
"PerkinElmer",",I enjoyed my work at Perkin Elmer. Management is talented and knowledgeable. Good team-oriented environment. "
"PerkinElmer",",Co-workers are talented and helpful. Good communication and great 'We're all in this together' feel ."
"PerkinElmer",",Very high attrition, event the heads of HR could not take it... they went through 3 heads of HR in the past year, VP of sales left last June, VP of product development in October, VP R&D in December, another 20-30 people at various levels. The informatics leadership got rid of all the Asians from the management last year. Many inappropriate comments. Place is like the Russian aristocracy... Czarina and Rasputin... nasty swatzy politics...and Check out the linkedin profiles of management...Qualifications of top management: zero years technical experience (software or analytics), zero years domain (life science) experience and would have expected at least management training, none of them have it. "
"PerkinElmer",",Most of the managers have no science or technical backgrounds so you will be stuck reporting to folks who have no clue and treat you poorly."
"PerkinElmer",",Good company to work for, management and employees very helpful. But do a lot of temp hiring instead of permanent job offer."
"PerkinElmer",",At Perkin-Elmer I reported to the best day-to-day manager I have ever met. After that experience I was promoted to Corporate Vice President and Division General Manager, and once again reported to a truly superior senior executive. Both the President and the Chairman of the Board of Perkin-Elmer were outstanding managers. I learned much from all of these gentlemen - from understanding the importance of the various management measures to optimum ways to implement strategies to positively effect these measures."
"PerkinElmer",",Excellent company culture. Good procedure flow, many outside activites to help the community Hours are good, advantage for overtime."
"PerkinElmer",",Was hired to do lab support and ended up sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day writing change controls. PE only cares about the client company and not the consultant. Many promises but nothing came to light. Too many chiefs and not enough indians - poor management"
"ExxonMobil","Lovely place to work for especially if you did like to get your hands dirty."
"ExxonMobil",",Both a gas and auto repair company, the accounting and repair aspect made for a fruitful work experience."
"ExxonMobil",",Great place to work. Good pay. The employees, manager and CEO went above and beyond when my husband was dying and were there the day he passed. Good people."
"ExxonMobil",",My experience here was awesome. The 2 gentlemen that owned this particular store were amazing. I met great people. The job is hard because its steady."
"ExxonMobil",",I didn't realize how oppressive it was until I left. I'm paid 3% less now, but I am happier. Great benefits. Golden Handcuffs."
"ExxonMobil",",The place has little structure, little in management or rules. One sick day meant you were fired, and then hired the very next day when they wanted you back in. Suspected of illegal activities."
"ExxonMobil",",I love working forn Exxon. It is a very awesome work place with awesome people. There really isn't an hard part of the job.  The most enjoyable is working with all the different people that come in. The management is great and my boss is the best!"

"ExxonMobil",",The Mobil gas station provides a a safe working zone in which everyone helps each other out. At Mobil you have opportunities to advance in the company. You also have to be able to keep a eye on customers while doing other tasks.  Employees must be able to clean, count money, and help customers get air for their tires and put gas in their vehicles."
"ExxonMobil",",I really liked this job. I love taking charge and running a business. I just love people. Showing customer service at all times is what I love to do."

"ExxonMobil",",Growing the business and acquiring as much knowledge as I could."
"ExxonMobil",",Handling day to day operations,marketing,money management."
"ExxonMobil",",A typical work day was very calm, I learned different technique's and how to use different systems. the management where cool people to work with respectful. the work place culture was little had to get use to at times. The hardest part of the job was leaving and finding work after being robbed at gun point there. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
"ExxonMobil",",ExxonMobil provides very secure opportunity for long-term career. Relocation is common and must be willing to move to advance within certain career areas"
"ExxonMobil",",the boss works around your schedule which is good. friendly coworkers and customers. job is okay. hours are decent but not enough, it was hard to get more. I got paid weekly which is always nice"
"ExxonMobil",",i have already reviewed this company.ExxonMobil, the largest publicly traded international oil and gas company, uses technology and innovation to help meet the world’s growing energy needs. We hold an industry-leading inventory of resources and are one of the world’s largest integrated refiners, marketers of petroleum products and chemical manufacturers."
"ExxonMobil",",It's been very rough, I've had to work 16 hours a day, 5 days a week for little to no pay. I guess if you were an average Cashier member it would be much easier but as the store operators son who was short on workers and money to hire new ones my life has been horrible working here, I greatly wish to find a new job soon."
"ExxonMobil",",always on time always had something to do kept busy made sure coffee was fresh for my customers greta customer service skills were used. always had repeated customers got to know he people"
"ExxonMobil",",Working at he gas station was fun meet a lot of great people but it's also a very dangerous job. A typical day at work would go very smoothly. The stock truck would come around 11am-1pm."

"ExxonMobil",",Very good project, working two DPDSV,s"
"ExxonMobil",",Lots of dive time over a million man hrs with no lost time accidents"
"ExxonMobil",",Being that this particular Exxon is a full service gas station plus garage makes it much more interesting then a regular gas station. It has an old time feeling to it because not many stations are full service and most gas stations do not also have a garage. Everyone that works here is very nice and flexible to help other workers, including the owner."
"ExxonMobil",",It was a decent place to work that offered benefits. Met some famous people that came through the area and stopped by to fuel up, use the restroom, and buy food and drinks."

"Realogy",",Great org that cares about their employees!  Glad to be part of this company.  The people are terrific and the focus on the community, ethics and diversity is wonderful."
"Realogy",",Now that I have a new job in a healthy work environment, I look back and realize that Realogy knows exactly what to say and do to impress everyone except the full time, long term employees. The facade has worked really well with job candidates, the press, college interns, trade associations, and philanthropic organizations. Every single action made is purely for a photo opp and a press release. Managers who foster a hostile work environment are paraded around like heroes to distract from the fact that they're actually really horrible people. Doing good work and producing real results doesn't matter. Management respects people who are overly aggressive, rather than kind-hearted, down to earth professionals who are the best at what they do. Across the board, people are paranoid about losing their jobs and feel the need to prove themselves which is also creating a nasty work environment. The negativity is spreading like wildfire and it's sad to say that most of the good people are leaving as soon as they get another job."

"Realogy",",A typical work day at Realogy I consider to always be a busy day with great working environment. When work day is this busy, I consider it to be a great day because by the time you know it, the day is over already without feeling the time. Realogy taught me a lot when it comes to interacting with end users, working with management from director all the way down to the newest employee since we all get along pretty good. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with angry with angry users since our job is to make them happy by providing the support they need to be happy again."

I loved working at this company because I learned a lot of things, day to day activities are always a challenge for me. I learned how to process agent commission, I learned how to handle a difficult situation, such as releasing agent commission check within 48 hrs.. I learned how to transfer fund using ITMS software (online transfer). I learned how to motivate myself to gain more knowledge through help of REALOGY Holding Corp. They provide a variety of online class for us to take so we learned more or enhanced our knowledge. Just to name a few: Excel, Word, Outlooks, Real Estate, Business Grammar and Writing. Through all of these experiences I gained more self confidence in me on how to talked to people, how to handle a difficult situation, how to overcome a stressful life within work or family,"

"Corning","Great place to work."
"Corning",",In New York City, very interesting place."
"Corning",",Great employees, everyone made you feel welcomed."
"Corning",",Great management."
"Corning",",Can be stressful at times but also can be very quiet.  Sadly this job isn't very steady.  You can either be very slow and the day takes forever.  You can also be crazy busy."
"Corning",",productive and fun workplace. Good work environment. Good team meets. The hardest part is working in the big manufacturing unit."
"Corning",",A typical day consists of solving problems, management was quite good. I enjoyed working on projects which I am interested in."
"Corning",",Good place to wock, basically on production tho, if you like a fast pace environment  this will be a perfect job for you. People there are very friendly"
"Corning",",Typical workload is around 60hrs/week and you are never compensated for that. Management looks down on people. Getting yelled at is ordinary thing in a typical day."
"Corning",",People are generally nice, so that's a plus."
"Corning",",Compensation is below average, and raises are rarely more than 2%."
"Corning",",Location is a problem for me cos it's far away from the city up in upstate NY. If you like nature, hiking etc. it's a good place. If you are a city person, stay away. One positive is monthly expenses are low."
"Corning",",Corning provides employees with an environment where they can easily learn and grow. Employees are encourage to develop new skills outside of their area of expertise. Corning is good to its employees and provides a very comfortable and inclusive work environment."
"Corning",",I spent 15 years working for Corning and when I first started the company culture was all about taking care of its people. And over the course of my career Corning experienced a drastic downturn with its culture in that it no longer could afford to take care of its people. Generic job titles allow HR to underpay their employees is the game there."
"Corning",",I worked at 2 different consumer product plants and eventually at the corporate data center. At the plant level you were given a lot of responsibility and really felt like you were doing something important."
"Corning",",At the corporate level the individuality and productivity were not high on the priority list. You were just there to do a job."
"Corning",",The management staff at Kraft Foods is poor at best with very limit visibility to future proofing the business.  There were many instances where management changed its vision that caused confusion within each year.  Not properly managing resources was another problematic situation which also caused a lot of quality issues.  The lower level workers and mid level managers grew very frustrated with unbalanced work hours and very limited incentives for success milestones."
"Corning",",I liked the professional and stress free environment.  Co-workers are very helpful when we do not understand something."
"Corning",",PeopleSoft Reporting specialist. Contributed to development of software practice and served as key reporting consultant for various engagements.  Designed financial implementation reporting library for CIT Group and led design of General Ledger reporting library for Corning."
"Corning",",Working 12 hr shifts is not for the single person with young children.. Really great people willing to help. Some negativity and envy, but over all, good place to work."
"Corning",",the intership program for my specific plant know as IDM is great, everyone is very nice and super friendly.Each week you learn a different proccess that goes into making a die"
"Corning",",Its a great job but hard to advance without schooling. Great atmosphere. Management is non involved unless a problem arises. Coworkers are great, got along with everyone."
"Corning",",Exciting and innovative environment with opportunities for scientific research. Some good managers, some less so.  Good pay and benefits.  Periodic layoffs hinder job security."
"Corning",",12 hour work shifts made you exhausted. I came in at 7 am and worked harder and harder until 7pm. Management never listened to my complaints and most of the time they could not be found when actually needed. My coworkers found it fun to annoy each other and goof off when they had the chance, making work harder for others. The hardest part of my job was knowing that working hard would not get me further in the business because to move up an employee has to pass a test or be buddy with management. The most enjoyable was when I finally left that place for the last time."
"Corning",",I enjoyed working at Corning. I met many wonderful people and participated in many community events held by the company. I learned from my peers and was given challenging projects."
"Corning",",Great company for a long term career. They want their employees to succeed. The on boarding process is very detailed and they set their sales force up for success."
"Corning",",I worked many positions in Corning as a Union worker. I loved having the opportunity to try new jobs. The pay was great and the benefits were good.  I disliked the rotating shifts."
"Corning",",The job was not difficult once you knew the basic and built upon them. Competitive wage with chances to advance once you had a little seniority. Over all one of the best job I have had. the down fall is work schedule"
"Corning",",corning has changed in past 5 years. not for the better.morale is very low,and people are leaving for different jobs.you do not feel appreciated at all.they are way down in employees, word is, corning has bad reputation on outside.they do not pay well, and you have to run multiple machines. they expect you to do perfect work while running fast pace,and multiple machines.management wont listen,so people aree leaving. used to be a great company, now they are lacking from leadership."
"American Express","Good work culture and training program to develop new financial advisors in the career of financial planning.  Strong focus to process and client satisfaction.  Overall, enjoyed working at this firm."
"American Express",",Technologies division is in the process of transitioning into using the Agile Project Management methodologies. However, they are forcing this into the organization regardless whether or not the methodology Is appropriate for the area, which makes it difficult to meet objectives. Minimal training was provided before being forced into using the methodology."
"American Express",",Company was definitely more interested in its bottom line than employees. Decisions often didn't take employees into consideration. Decisions were often made by people that had never worked in specific areas that their decisions affected"
"American Express",",I love the blue box values, the way they take care of employees personal needs (providing water and time off after natural disasters, tuition reimbursement, training and learning opportunities, etc.), good business practices and human kindness during downsizing. This job taught me more about business and marketing than any other job."
"American Express",",Having said that, not all managers espouse the values and some might take advantage of them."
"American Express",",Innovative work with super cool management and challenging projects. "
"American Express",", typical day at work is optimal is you love what you are doing. Learned a lot of technologies in a span of 1 year."

"American Express",",During employment with American Express it was a great learning experience working with a very Diverse Group of employees as well as the management team. Very clean environment."
"American Express",",working in a call center is tedious and aggrevation...  If you have worked in this feild before and are fine with it, then amex is probably one of the best paying telemarketing jobs out there."
"American Express",",I have worked for American Express for over ten years and gone through a lot of changes.  I feel it has been a great job but I feel that employees get lost because of how large the company is.  I have worked in many capacities with American Express and feel like it is time for a new adventure which is why I decided to go back to school to pursue my Bachelors degree."
"American Express",",American Express used to be a GREAT place to work - but no more.  Company culture - especially within technologies - is shifting rapidly and is becoming very focused on short-term goals at the expense of the employees.  Work-life balance is laughable. Meetings with offshore teams at all hours (10pm, 5am common).  Vacations frequently canceled. Preference to hire from outside rather than promote from within."
"American Express",",robotic, dialer-calling.... scripted conversations required. management was good. Work environment was great. very corporate, not personal. it was not the right job for me"
"American Express",",The problem with Amex is that there is a huge disconnect between Business team & Technology teams."
"American Express",",Its a good place to work with others."
"American Express",",Each day the travelers cheques came in and all balancing, filing, photocopying was processed. It was a paper environment."
"American Express",",As time progressed the paper environment turned to computer submissions more and more."
"American Express",",Management was great."
"American Express",",Going with the flow and learning new and modern processes was awesome and uplifting!!"
"American Express",",The hardest part seemed to be the new processes at first, then it just all fell into place - looking back - how far modern technology had come!!"
"American Express",",Most enjoyable was seeing the transition."
"American Express",",I really like the group I work with in IT Operations. Everyone is highly skilled and knows their job inside and out. Service Owners care about their people but above that level everyone else seems to only care about securing their own future within American Express and are extremely disconnected on what is going on at the ground level. I believe company is what you make of it and we have fun whenever we can but never lose focus on our daily tasks that need to be completed. I have learned so much as I have worked for 6 different managers in my time at AMEX and I've tried to learn something from each one."
"American Express",",A lot to learn and atmoshpere was really good at the place of my work and team which had was really very cooperative. the best place to learn about every thing."
"American Express",",The management lacked professionalism.   My first day the manager told me personal information about another employee and stated her meds were not working.  She is still there."
"American Express",",It was ok while it lasted. Need more professional managers. The environment in which working at the workstation was not clean enough to work. Better managers."
"American Express",",I feel that this company is a great place to work and also has a very desirable amount of people that are always wanting to help with any questions you may have. You learn a lot of different things that have to do with the job and always have different classes you do need to take to become a better and more knowledgeable employee of the company."
"Preqin","Interesting company that could be a good stepping stone for a recent graduate. The job gives you a good understanding of alternatives, and the company promotes employees to go for the CAIA and CFA."

"Capco",",Culture is similar to that of a consulting firm. Office space is very modern, open and allows for a lot of interaction with other teams."
"Capco",",Capco was a good place to work, I liked the four 10 hour days. And having Friday, Saturday and Sundays off and that you could work overtime if you wanted, The supervisors where all great people. And I got along well with my co-workers. the hardest part was getting layed off and having to say good by to everyone. And not knowing when the next contract is going to be."
"Capco",",4 day workweek is only positive about this place. Attitude reflects leadership and is flawed from the owner down thru management. Workers are nice but thats abut all"

"Capco",",Since I have my CCNP, the Networking team gave me access to the network switches so that I can troubleshoot LAN issues. (Configuring ports and VLANs). This company is a very fun place to work at. Once we get the job done, we are allowed to have fun. Capco is proud to be named a 2015 Best Medium Workplace by Great Place to Work® published in Fortune Magazine"
"Capco",",Culture is shot. Work/life balance is great because there's no work to be done. Dripping with politics, back-stabbings, and complete lack of accountability from management. The people running this place are asleep at the wheel and have no respect for the employees."
"Capco",",Some really great people within the organization that will partner with you to become the best you can be.  Awesome benefits, culture and overall environment. "
"Capco",",Would recommend to anyone that has a strong will to succeed and be stretched to their fullest!"

"Capco",",I enjoyed working as and aide for CAPCO. I got to know clients on a very personal level having to work with them in their homes. The job it'self was very satisfying, but there is no management over clients. As an aide, I had to find my own clients to work for. This was the worst part because our job was to help clients regain their independence, and once that happens, you are out of a job. I would have been more satisfied if there had been a list of clients to work for, or some idea of who needed an aide. If you don't know anyone, then you don't get to work."

"American Systems",",Great company to work for. The management is very informative.  Flexible on hours. Also, they recognize employees. No micromanaging.  I have no complaints."
"American Systems",",I would avoid it if you have other options.  I have worked at several different places and have never felt more like a number.  This is really just a company that went out and bought several smaller companies for their current contracts.  There may be a corporate culture and focus but since the groups do not talk to each other I do not know what it is."
"American Systems",",Right now I would their business model  is""Silos of excellence/ignorance""."

"American Systems",",I am responsible for all multimedia work in training, development and marketing. I get to facilitate regularly so I never get bored with my job"
"American Systems",",The teams I have worked with are amazing. The only drawback is the lack of security being at the mercy of the client as a contract worker."
"American Systems",",I enjoyed all my co-workers at American Systems. Since I was a contractor in a government building it was sometimes difficult communicating with management."
"American Systems",",Great place to work! They really take care of their employees! they especially cater to disabled employee needs. I wish they had more contracts!"
"American Systems",",The company and employees are very willing to help when the need arises.  The customer is currently being trained on an advanced aircraft and its systems.  Logistically challenging environment, with a positive attitude to accomplishing short and long term goals."

"American Systems",",I learned all aspects of the management, including training, and continued training. Also lead generation. My co workers were amazing people, the office was no drama, and we all worked well together, it was a real team. The hardest part of the job was letting people go who could not meet the standards of the position. The most enjoyable was just about every day on the job. I can say it was one job I honestly enjoyed going to daily. The management team worked as a team which made it so easy for the whole office to work as a team too."
"American Systems",",I enjoyed the job.  It wasn't the best paying and I didn't get any benefits, but the people were enjoyable and the work wasn't too difficult.  The government contract industry is a rocky one.  The chances of you keeping your job for more than a year aren't favorable."

"American Systems",",To sum it up in a nutshell, American Systems is just okay.  Managers do not micromanage and my job location and work environment is good.  AS benefits have a ways to catchup with the likes of CACI or other large companies.  For instance, AS does not have education\certification reimbursements starting day one. You can receive education reimbursement after a year of service… all in all, AS is okay."

"Collabera",",The management and employees at Collabera are great, and willing to help with any issues that may arise.  They're also great with communication, I'd get answers for any of my concerns in a very timely manner."
"Collabera",",Basically a fake company that tricks you into doing their work for them and lies about culture & compensation. Will  say anything to get you in the door so your recruiter can cash in on you."
"Collabera",",I am overly impressed with Collabera.  They exhibit such professionalism and expertise which makes job searching easy. Ankit, Ashika, Amanpreet are the best! In addition, they continually check on your progress, ask for any concerns, etc.  I have never experienced Valet treatment while job searching.  If you are looking for it? Collabera!"
"Collabera",",The management was good. I got along well with all the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was not having a enough time in the day to get all my work done. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the co-working about diffident thing about the company."

I wanted to move up and got a promotion my first 3 months but after a while, I got sick of a desk job. I like the hustle an bustle of nightlife and want to be involved with marketing, promotions, and sales. Collabera was great management experience but I want more!"
"Collabera",",Company did great with handling issues that arose during contract.  Great staff and very helpful getting me acclimated to the work environment as well as ensuring frequently that all needs were met.  Would recommend this company for any IT contractor."

"Collabera",",Great people to work with. In all it is a really great company to work with.Just please try to help your customers more quickly. Keep up the good work."
"Collabera",",They tell that when your Temp Job ends they will have something else for you, but they don't. I did like the fact that while I was working there I was always able to get in contact with someone if necessary. They were very nice and would call you every so often to ask how everything was going at work."
"Collabera",",With Collabera, I worked at CAT in Denison, TX.  I enjoyed my position while working there because I knew exactly what my job requirements were and had the knowledge to achieve my duties.  I appreciated that the management team gave me direction and tools, and allowed me to come up with my own techniques/processes to complete the task at hand."
"Collabera",",My co-workers and I were very successful at dividing the workload and completing the tasks that were assigned to us.  We actually completed our project 6 months earlier than expected.  This was partially due to the reports that I created to show and changes within the system on a daily basis. This report prevented duplicate efforts since there were several departments working on the same project."
"Collabera",",The hardest part of the job was when a supplier didn't respond at all to a request that was sent to them. To tackle this obstacle, emails were sent with follow up reminders.  If we continued to receive no response, the supplier's lack of response was escalated to the management team for further action."
"Collabera",",I truly enjoyed working with a fun group of people at CAT.  The most enjoyable part of the job was creating a rapport with the suppliers and being able to reach and surpass goal expectations."

"Collabera",",The company treats its contractors very poorly and under pays them. Contractors often complained to me that all of their support came from India and no one seemed to care. Contractors get no support from Collabera once they are placed in a job. "
"Collabera",",Collabera employees do not have it any better. Management is too focused on the competition to focus on their own employees. Many regional managers are under-trained, do not respect their employees, and the turnover is very high. There is no training. The pay is mediocre and the commissions are, too."
"Collabera",",see previous review - Collabera is a very good Contract Agency.  I was able to work at IBM for 5 years without any issues with Collabera.  They are professional and everything was handled in a professional manner."

"Teva Pharmaceuticals",",A typical work day started  with a meeting for jobs assignment (about less than 10mn) than the gowning; right after each operator proceeded to his/her assignment. The culture at the workplace was highly professional, pleasant, and enjoyable. For the most part the environment was like a team well exited and versed in the execution of a task. I really enjoyed each and every day working there, and I truly missed it."
"Teva Pharmaceuticals",",I have been a Sales Specialists with Teva Respiratory for the past nine years.  They have a history of being a fair and balance employer."
"Teva Pharmaceuticals",",When I first started working at Teva, I actually enjoyed coming to work.  The work environment slowly became more and more toxic over the years due to management's lack of involvement when it came to addressing bad apples in the crew.  It seems like all of the good employees come and go while the bad ones, the ones that make coming to work dreadful, hang around.  Management and HR also tend to not be very forthcoming with information to it's employees about the future of the company.  There always seems to be rumors of downsizing and layoffs.  The money is decent but the stress is not.  I left on good terms but it's definitely not a place that I would ever want to work at again."
"Teva Pharmaceuticals",",Great place to work aside from a minimal pipeline and therefore job security is at a all time low.  Great culture with veteran sales force that is respectful and great to work with."
"Teva Pharmaceuticals",",Teva is a really good company. Management make the difference."
"Teva Pharmaceuticals",",Good o Bad..in this case is really bad. No motivation. I'm working with a company for more than 15 years, in Miami. And move here 3 years ago. is a big difference. We had a good management and team work in florida, people here don't know nothing about that."
"Teva Pharmaceuticals",",A typical workday varies it's all about time & territory management.  I've enjoys working with others on my team including management.  The best part of my job is the autonomy to run my own business and being responsible for my own success.  The hardest part of my job is reimbursement for my products."

"Metabolon",",Very relaxed atmosphere.  Management is unaware of everything going on.  Most co-workers are great to work with.  Hardest part of job were the lulls in work.  Great work life balance depending on what department you worked in."

"Time Inc","Wonderful place to work with the opportunity for growth and movement. One definitely has to pay their dues but it can pay off"
"Time Inc",",after a long time working for this company, I noticed the downward spiral. good luck to all my friends still working there."
"Time Inc",",In the past, I would have given Time Inc. 5 stars. Over the past 6 months, the sales and marketing structure has undergone quite a significant transformation that has resulted in chaos, confusion, and terrible company culture. We also don't have defined roles right now, which makes getting the job done and finding joy in the job difficult."

"Time Inc",",While I was there, every day was busy, in a creative way. Work was stimulating and I had a good relationship with immediate management. The team I ran had fantastic camaraderie and, I like to think, worked happily and efficiently. The hardest part of the job was working with systems that were unsuited to the task they had to perform and having to cope with inadequate IT provision. I particularly loved the varied nature of the job - editing, liaising with other depts (ad dept, subscriptions, PRs, advertisers, marketing)."
"Time Inc",",A typical day at work usually includes fixing watches, ringing up sales, faxing invoices and filing, and handling any customer issues. I've learned about the many aspects of watches and working with them with precision. Working in a management position has taught me to deal with customers on a higher level, to build relationships with our host store, to learn how to complete invoices and how to juggle scheduling and direction of employees. I would say the hardest part of this job is is bumping heads with my supervisor, but only rarely. The most enjoyable part of my job is the experience I've gained and the fact that I'm still learning new things."
"Time Inc",",I am able to work for a top company competitively in the publishing arena. The best part of my job is reading content that is stimulating."

"Time Inc",",With round after round of layoffs, the atmosphere has become tense and cut throat. No one takes responsibility for mistakes for fear of losing their jobs. Once a congenial and collegiate place to work, the culture is broken. Upper management seems to  encourage this survival of the fittest. At the very least, they don't discourage it."
"Time Inc",",Time Inc. employs some of the most intelligent and creative people.  Despite their print business slowing down, they continue to provide good benefits to attract the best and brightest."

"2K Games","i am a self starting hard worker who has experience in multiple fields of labor work and knowledgeable in multiple fields of work as well in part to previous experience."
"2K Games",",My typical day would involve getting into work, grabbing some type of liquid energy and taking a seat at my desk. I'd then test various games, review open bugs and find new bugs through out the day. I'd get to chat with some of the people near by and eventually got to sit with my friends and joke around with them. Eventually some of the games would be closed for testing and we'd have to test different games for overtime. Finally when that was complete we'd shuffle off, tired and bored back to our homes."
"2K Games",",I learned to develop my critical eye for error, communication and writing skills and how to think outside of the box. I had to break the game and that meant to play it in odd and strange ways that don't fit my play style."
"2K Games",",Managment felt just right. They weren't over bearing like some companies, but they were always around to help or correct you. They were knowledgeable in their craft and knew how to put you in the right direction."
"2K Games",",The coworkers were fun and energetic. They knew the job itself was boring, so they tried to have fun with it. They would challenge each other on finding bugs or just playing the game. They would joke and make the overall experience fun. They were by far the best reason for going to work. you wanted to catch up and enjoy their company. they were friendly, helpful and supportive."
"2K Games",",The hardest part of the job was staying awake. The games you play were generally boring and made for a younger audiance, however some of the games were actually big hits. Either way you'd play these games for weeks and months on end. It gets boring and you get tired."
"2K Games",",  "
"2K Games",", "
"2K Games",",The best part of the job was the people. Every one there loves video games and wants to see a bright future for games and gamers. It's easy to make friends and connections. Also, at the end of the day, you are playing games. It's not the funnest way to play, but you could be working as a cashier instead."
"2K Games",",  "
"2K Games",",A typical day at work compares to a typical day in the life of a hardcore gamer. This company is really good at providing the best products to their wide fan-base of loyal games. The management team is wonderful and helpful."
"2K Games",",Everyday was different and complexed. Gained a lot of experience in regards to facilities and construction project management. Being on-call 24/7 was tasking and challenging at times. Gained a lot of friends & extended family members."
"2K Games",",I come in grab a build then start play testing on the project that I am working on then find bugs on the area I am in then report and crash to my leads. Then if found any right then up or check if they are not in the system already. I learned that you have to quick and on top of your game in the QA be fast and quick. My management where good people had no problems with them every time I asked a question I get it back quick. Co-workers where enthusiastic, fun, smart, and joyful, love working in that environment."
"2K Games",",Typical day is to play video games and write up reports about bugs found in game."
"2K Games",",Nothing special, night shift, decent team. High turn over rate, it's definitely a temporary type of job."
"2K Games",",2K Games continually stayed current with the trends in technology infrastructure and industry practices. Working for a studio of over 300 on site employees for over four years taught me the skills necessary to work in a fast paced, professional environment with consistently changing needs and requirements. The projects that were required to keep our studio at the cutting edge of business were always changing. A typical day would certainly include tackling dozens of help desk tickets that either halted or impacted the work flow for artists, engineers, marketers and management, setting up hardware for new hires, and working on long term projects such as upgrading our asset tracking system or adding UPS battery backup units to all employees work stations. "
"2K Games",",Since I remained at the company for 2 years and a few months, I witnessed the complete overhaul of upper management and the move from Westlake Village to Northridge. Both facilities were good, but there was a time when they had packed too many testers onto the test floor in the Northridge facility. This led to sharing computers, cramped spaces, and sometimes loss of personal belongings, which led to extremely unhappy testers, and a bad work environment. Testers were told to care more about quantity over quality of bugs, which I believe forced the testers to write up anything they could, clogging the database with useless bugs (dupe, by design, NAB, WNF) and angering the developers. Management was then blinded by bug counts, and this allowed a tester with less skill to move up the rankings quicker than a tester who paid attention to detail."
"2K Games",",I worked in a small division of 2k and I didnt feel it was managed as well as it should have been. However, my experience with the overall organization was good. The division I worked in closed a few months after I left."

"Citi",",I contracted for Apex systems. No benefits, no PTO, and only worked there for a year. Contract was open ended, but ended with no notice exactly a year after I was hired. The pay was mediocre, especially given that there weren't any PTO or benefits included. Work was fine. Good temporary gig."
"Citi",",I had many years with Citi. Worked for and with wonderful people.  Citi strives to be be a company accepting of all people with different interests.  Your opinions are respected and listened to."

"Citi",",It was a good experience overall. However, employees are just a number for corporate and it is a revolving door for the teller position."

"Citi",",The life and work balance was great. Great benefits, culture, and lots of growth before the layoffs started. After the mortgage crisis Citi sold a lot of it pro-folio so everyone is just waiting for their numbr to be called so the moral is low."
"Cisco","I worked at Cisco for many years in many capacities.  I met many wonderful people from all walks of life.  I learned that work was not the only priority at Cisco and in this culture I made great connections.  As a Lobby Ambassador, I was the face of Cisco midtown.  As the Executive Assistant I was the right hand woman of the Operations Director and as the Business Analyst to the sales team, I was an important part of team strategical planning.  The easiest part of the job was the friendships I forged-most difficult was understanding that at the end of the year or quarter the pressure is on and don't take anything personally.  Overall, I learned a lot and wouldn't change the experience for the world."
"Cisco",",This was a great employer, now it's just a good employer. The layoffs every summer have definitely impacted the culture - there's a reluctance to take risks, for fear of failing and being the next one voted off the island."

"Cisco",",Cisco truly cares about there employees. They have great benefits, competitive salaries, and encourage free thinking and innovation."
"Cisco",",It used to be a great place to work with amazing, creative people. Over the years, upper management seems to be focusing more on numbers than visions. Starting out, it could be a good place, but don't stop learning new skills."
"Cisco",",Out of business out of business, no longer in business< why do we have to rate companies that are"
"Cisco",",Out of business this is very stupid; indeed!"

You have plenty of flexibility to create balance between work and life so you can focus on personal items without impacting work too much.  Cisco benefits are some of the best in the industry and opportunity for growth is tremendous."
"Cisco",",Rarely stressful, very happy work environment.  The compensation is very low compared to other Bay Area companies and no matter how hard you work as a consultant, you will never be rewarded with a full time opportunity or more pay.  The story always revolves around the budget.  Be sure you negotiate a high rate before you start because chances are, you will stay at that rate for a while."

"Public Consulting Group",",There was no work/life balance which was not worth the pay. The office environment was very unpleasant at times. It was definitely not well diverse. The systems were antiquated. The office downtown has very high turnover."
"Public Consulting Group",",This company has everything going for them except maturity of processes. Their SaaS product it great but when they need to modify it by the demands of clients - there is a weakness. "
"Public Consulting Group",",They are growing and will figure it out. But at the expense of key personnel and clients. "
"Public Consulting Group",",Work/Life balance is very good but you do have long hours on some releases - but so do other companies. "
"Public Consulting Group",",If you are lucky enough to stay with them - it will be a fun ride."

"Public Consulting Group",",Everyone that works there is very nice, easy to get time off requested, flexible working hours, and supervisor/management shows appreciation. Should be paid better for the complexity of the job requirements and constant changes. Most people stressed and not satisfied with their jobs."
"Public Consulting Group",",Still employed here, and looking for another job to run out of here fast. I knew after the first day, this wasn't the place for me. So I see now a month later, why no one stays. The only GOOD thing I can say about this place is the pay is good, other then that you can forget it. If you have a family, they require a doctor's not even if you're out for one day. They aren't friendly, no ""good morning"", or ""how's everything going"" , and don't really care to get to know you either. They don't talk to you, and have no time for you. Have you ever worked for a company that doesn't give you a paid break every 4 hours, well don't work here. You can be making a phone call and away from your desk for 10 minutes, but you're required to stay extra. The people are nasty, and they play favorites, so don't rub them the wrong way, because you'll be an outkast. To make matters worse there's NO WORK. Yes, your job can be help desk, business analyst, etc, and you will be making outbound calls all day. This is the worst job I have evvvvvvvvvvver had. My advice is to stay as far away as possible. Trust me, the good pay isn't worth everything else that you go through."
"Public Consulting Group",",Was hired for one location which was remote for 2 years. When management needed to fill overhead had to go over an hour to work with no flexibility. Not equal between office workers and remote workers. If there is a slight disagreement with management they will fire you."
"Public Consulting Group",",Office location is lacking in comorodery."
"Public Consulting Group",",Upper management in North Carolina and Boston are available and listen."
"Public Consulting Group",",There is no management support. No time to assist clients and complete work. Here coworkers are like your family and hard-working."
"Public Consulting Group",",I like everyone in the company except the two people who manage me.  The company likes to low-ball people on salaries but you can negotiate with them."
"Public Consulting Group",",lack of communication from management, and totally no direction. The managers are full of illiterate people who does not have any managerial skills. You can only get promoted if you are one of those who takes their boss to breakfast and lunch. totally crazy there! Employees are totally exhausted due to overload of work."
"Public Consulting Group",",Overall a good company as a whole. Progression is very important to allot of employees I like to think the company keeps that in mind"
"Public Consulting Group",",Work was always interesting. Would love to be a permanent employee with this company. Work schedule very flexible. Great people."
"Public Consulting Group",",A typical day you spent talking to people on the phone that are on hard times. They have physical impairments or mental disorders. I learned great computer skills and about disability insurance. Management treats people well, but it is very imbalanced. There are no male supervisors. Co-workers are cool. We have fun. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a caseload and remembering to manage applications, request medical records, mail correspondence, and check up on claimants. The most enjoyable part of the job is the laid back atmosphere. People don't get angry or upset. They train you well."
"Public Consulting Group",",Everything at PCG revolves around revenue per business unit, so zero collaboration, and billable hours.  The later is appropriate a department like accounting, but not a development department.  It leaves zero time to learn new technologies, etc.  This is meant to be done on your own time."
"Public Consulting Group",",I sat in a cube and billed off of an excel report my boss gave me. It was a consulting firm that had to get grants/projects approved so I was only in fear of my job 1x while I was there but there was no where to advance."
"Public Consulting Group",",Management was terrible very unprofessional. There was no one you could go to with concerns without the whole office knowing about it. No privacy and tons of gossip and whispers."
"Public Consulting Group",",Always happy environment, helping clients be safe and insured, always fast at processing claims and get back to customers."
"Public Consulting Group",",Fast paced environment.  Growing pains associated with the success of the company.  Generous company outings.  Difficult work/life balance.  Unable to take advantage of some of the benefits due to time constraints of the job."
"Union Bank","Good working experience,healthy environment ,work-life balanced,superb work-culture,Growth chances maximum,got huge oppurtunites to polish my IT skills here"
"Union Bank",",Typical day would be cash handling, insuring best in customer. Making sure work is all scanned and transmitted. Most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction of meeting new clients and helping them with their problems"
"Union Bank",",I have learned so much in this bank to process and deposit checks to all customer accounts and learned how to work with pressure and deadlines, but it fun because at the end of the day the worked is done."
"Union Bank",",Systems are slow, morale is none existent. This is a bank that seems to be stuck in the 1980's. Even its underwriting guidelines are antiquated. A complete overhaul is needed."
"Union Bank",",felt like there was no chance for advancement. benefits are great. there is to much pressure to meet goals and sales. The pressure of helping a customer and trying to sell them a product is to much."
"Union Bank",",Was a fun place to be they took care of me, i went to take classes about accounting,  reason i let the job was because it was a partime only"
"Union Bank",",Commission on sales weren't that great, management was not helpful in anyway, if you needed assistance you had to ask the person in the cubical next to you."
"Union Bank",",Left this job because Union Bank is a joke of a bank.  It's hilarious that they will tell you that they are competitive with other banks which is a complete joke.  Since I was in a commercial real estate group.  Most of my superiors barely understood what a cap rate was."
"Union Bank",",The same as any other bank. Some good, some bad. As always, the experience is highly driven by who your immediate manager is."
"Union Bank",",Everything was fine and had a good understanding with the co-workers and been such a good place to be. Though it was very cold out there it was thrilling because I haven't seen snow before and was awesome on the whole."
"Union Bank",",UB is shrinking in the NW, I would expect that they close all of their branches in WA and OR in the next year and just remain primarily in California."
"Union Bank",",Immediate management team was strong. The product line up was good at best. The underwriting and company's communication was poor. The bank feels much older than it is and needs to improve with product line and it's ability to make decisions FASTER. Too slow for today's market."
"Union Bank",",Cash handling, customer service, balancing vault, great team work, great benefits. Apply within makes it easy to move up in the company."
"Union Bank",",Fast pace environment, rarely not occupied with customers. Best boss in the world. One of the best branches to work for. Very competitive with the other employees trying to get your sell."
"Union Bank",",Unlike many financial institutions Union Bank has some serious tenure in employees. The company compensates well and provides incredible health benefits. However because of this, upward mobility is difficult and the company is rather bureaucratic in their efforts to promote employees."
"Union Bank",",Overall, a very solid Bank. A little too politically correct for my taste. New HR leadership was good for San Francisco PR but the truth is well managed."
"Union Bank",",No upward mobility as they have eliminated all positions between entry level and supervisor. There is just no way to advance through the company. Entry level now has to do more of the duties from the positions that were removed at a lower rate of pay. This is a horrible business practice."
"Union Bank",",Good, stable environment.  Union Bank takes care of their employees.  Benefits are good.  A lot of long time tenure at the bank."
"Union Bank",",It's a wonderful place to work. Staff is friendly and always trying to meet our customer's needs. Benefits are great! Definitely, Our number one priority is our Customers, Customer Service, Balancing, Policies and Procedures."
"Union Bank",",MUFG Union Bank was a good company to work for with many opportunities to grow. MUFG is currently moving the majority of jobs out of California and losing a lot of talented employees."
"Union Bank",",My typical work is to profile a client and identify the client needs and determines which our products, we offer can meet the identify  need of the clients. This help me to pay a clear attention to the need of the client. Because, it is a win win situation. I must satisfy the client need to earn the client revenue. The management responses are some time exercise excessive pressure on us but that is what marketing is all about which is result. My team are understand because each member knows what the goal is and exhibit attributes of a whole which is better than sum of individuals. The most interesting part of the work is to meet the need of my client. This is Hahahaha moment to me!"
"Department of Mental Health and Hygiene","Supervisor and coworkers are very helpful and friendly. Troubleshooting and resolving user's problems. Learned new ways to deal with software and hardware problems. Hardest part is when something you don't how to resolve a problem. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping other workers."
"Department of Mental Health and Hygiene",",Helping my clients to be the best , and learn new thing. Make their lives are the best. This was my first working in this field and I love it. I have never worked with people that has mental problems but they're just like the rest of us. They are so much fun to work with, their different personality are adventurous."
"Department of Mental Health and Hygiene",",If you want to devote your entire career to civil service, slowly moving up the ranks and owing your life to the city, then this is for you. "
"Department of Mental Health and Hygiene",",The cubicle life and structure of management creates a feeling of captivity. I felt mostly that the strict roles and management got in my way (creatively, constructively) and didn't allow for much autonomy or respect for talent and abilities. The morale is generally low and turnover is high. You will be a cog in the wheel and will be overlooked and underutilized. The benefits are NOT that great. Sub par in-network doctors and 2 weeks vacation earned after 6-12 months probation. "
"Department of Mental Health and Hygiene",",Mostly importantly, do NOT WORK FOR THE CAT TEAM. The team leader is highly inappropriate, unprofessional and sets impossible standards to meet all while over-familiarity acting as a best friend to employees. She speakers negatively and inappropriately about others colleagues and then will smile to their faces. There have been 2 recent terminations in a 3 month period and would have been a 3rd if someone hadn't been transferred. Worse is that the management above supports these practices and doesn't do anything about the common denominator here. This management style severely limited the workers' abilities and undermined their talents. Find an agency where you can be recognized and respected and don't have to deal with permanent civil servants who negatively contribute to the workplace and cannot be removed."
"Department of Mental Health and Hygiene",",The Department of Health is a refreshing place to work. There is not to much pressure and the staff is very family oriented. I enjoyed the activities that is offered such as watching movies during lunch with fellow employees, jump rope, and book club programs all for employees to enjoy while at work. The perks are great as well!"
"Department of Mental Health and Hygiene",",Learning experience. Great staffing as well. Most enjoyable part of working here was being able to use the different software to gain experience and the great staffing."

"Move, Inc.",",Move offered great opportunity of advancement for those who want to overachieve."
"Move, Inc.",",They pay well and had a great training program."
"Move, Inc.",",Move inc was more than a job...it was my home away from home. Managers and follow co workers would probably say the same thing. There was always words of encourangment and someone to assist when needed help. We celebrated every holiday. Our company BBQ was Amazing. Our site director Debbie really cares about us. From random breakfast or gift cards to say thank you or just a simple email to everyone to say have a good weekend. "
"Move, Inc.",",Not up tight work environment u can be yourself and espresso yourself (work appropriate of course) through your outfit your hair or even the way you decorate your desk. :)"

"Move, Inc.",",HR is amazing and very supportive if she can help  she will do just that. Managers very understanding and flexible. Do your job and you'll be just fine. Benefits are great and the pay is good as well good room to advance. Experienced management so they've earned there spot and been where you will start at. "

"Move, Inc.",",Attrition for Account Executives (Sales) is around 90% to 95%. You won't work there long. This is a HARD SELL job. you keep the Realtor on the phone until they hang up."
"Move, Inc.",",This was the most challenging job to me. I have a hard time meeting new people but it brought me out of my shell. This job has helped me more than I could explain."
"Move, Inc.",",love to work hard  moving people to a first floor or 4th floor at the the end of the day u worked hard, Some of the days was hectic because the customer couldnt make up there mind some time you never know what you would walk into to, with the attitudes, then i was a veteran mover i knew how to stack furniture and load it but if you get a person who never done the job before you had to train him it could be a little over whelming but some one had to teach me so thats when patience come into play."
"Move, Inc.",",I really enjoyed doing property preservations / clean outs. Being able to work in the field autonomously provided me with income and relaxation . using many of the skills I have from years of service work made me a great match."
"Move, Inc.",",Very unprofessional work environment.  Lots of yelling, loud woohoo's, sounding like you are calling from a drunk fiesta in the background and intense, stressful place to work.  Don't forget to be ready to be written up weekly with lots of threats to be fired while being told fairy tales that you could make $20,000 a month. By the way, they don't just threaten to fire you, they really do it. 2 slow weeks and you are gone. 4 times not hitting your 125 calls per day in one month you are gone, even if you have high sales. "
"Move, Inc.",",Are there good points? Yes, they did teach some good sales techniques, they did feed us often, and the $35,000 base is comparable to other centers."
"Move, Inc.",",The days started at 5 am every morning. We would meet and discuss the days schedule/goals. The staff was very young and self - motivated. Everyone worked together as a team to accomplish goals. Really enjoyed working here."
"Move, Inc.",",*** take note the only decent reviews ARE NOT SALES IN WESTLAKE OR AZ****"
"Move, Inc.",",Stay away from the sales lure...The management and sales culture are completely sold out to the almighty dollar and do not care about their employees or their customers.  You have to crank out 150 calls per day - work ""mandatory overtime?"" and if you don't you are lambasted and treated even worse...your ""requirements"" change by the month and sometimes by the hour based on the VP sales mood and that trickles down and sucks the life out of any real productivity."
"Move, Inc.",",Consultative sales approach, my foot!  They tell you to lie to the customer."
"Move, Inc.",",The most dark, negative, manipulative and awful place.  Not to mention they do have their ""sell outs"" favorites that they feed the big accounts to.  More of those big accounts are wising up that they are not cared about beyond their credit card."
"Move, Inc.",",The turn over is constant...read the other reviews.  Just saying"
"Move, Inc.",",The salary is great, if they don't give you a lousy book.  If they give you a lousy book, there isn't anything you can do about it.  They have no readily apparent criteria for selecting who gets the most productive books.  It appears if they like you, you get it all; hand fed prequalified leads, big books, time off, etc.  If the phone rings, you better pick it up and if it isn't one of your clients, you better close it anyway and then happily walk your money over to the chosen one who owns the account.  That's right.  Give the money away,  and then you can attend the bonus ceremony where they award the chosen ones with big bonus bucks for closing a lot of business.  Of course, the fact that you and many others closed a lot of business for the chosen ones, doesn't count.  You don't count.  Naturally, most of the inbound calls were for the larger, more productive books, so you can wind up giving away a lot of the business you worked to close.  If you don't do it, you're not a team player.  If it wasn't so insane it might be funny.  I can't believe I subjected myself to this."
"Move, Inc.",",If you're doing new business, good luck with that.  You're just feeding the chosen ones.  Have fun making those 100 dials per day.  You better meet quota for phone time too, or else probation!  Nah, it doesn't matter if you closed a lot of business and met your quota.  If you didn't hit call time or dials, you're on probation.  It was like working in the Twilight Zone for me.   People were always on probation.  Then they come by and beat you with a verbal stick to motivate you to get on the phone and close"
"Move, Inc.",",  "
"Move, Inc.",", more business.  LOL  I've never worked in such a degrading, pressurized, unrewarding environment."
"Move, Inc.",",This place chews people up and spits them out, but the money's great if you can get your hands on a good book.  That will likely not happen."
"Move, Inc.",",  "
"Move, Inc.",",Do not work here! This place has nothing to offer anyone! It looks as if it can fold any day now. This place had its time around 2002 but it is just in the crapper now. Zillow crushes this company and the website sucks anyways."

"Move, Inc.",",good co workers"
"Move, Inc.",",none"
"Move, Inc.",",everyday"
"Move, Inc.",",Management runs this place by fear and only gets minimal results because fo this. Favoritism is a widespread. Unless you are one of the favorites, you are going to have to work a lot harder just to keep your job."
"Move, Inc.",",Management at Move is built on a micro management philosophy which was not always the case. Now people don't feel like they matter as employees and there is favoritism when choosing employees for not only special projects but for advancement and many long time employees have left or are job hunting themselves even some of the better managers have left because felt they could effect change in the overall management in the call center."
"Move, Inc.",",I have learned a lot of soft people skills and to have patients handling disgruntled customers. I really like the people I work with, we work well as a team. The hardest part of my job has to be trying to explain to a customer why a function of a product that they pay for has been broken for the last 9 months and there is no eta on a fix.however,my favorite part is when I can successfully make working their control panels as easy as possible. they start their conversation disheartened and stressed out but by the end of the call they feel satisfied that their product is easier than they had imagined."
"Move, Inc.",",The people I work with on a daily basis are fun to work with and some of the most talented people that I've had the pleasure to work with in my IT career."
"Move, Inc.",",Great company and great culture. The pay is great and I enjoy what I do. Awesome hours and work life balance. The company provides, coffee, tea, water, snacks, and there's a workout facility. If you exceed your goals you will make excellent commission checks and even just meeting your goals pays well. Good training from a very knowledgeable and inspiring trainer."
"Move, Inc.",",One of the best things about Move are the people. The work is challenging and never boring. There are so many opportunities to learn new things."
"Move, Inc.",",The management was disorganized and didn't give adequate guidance to their workers. A typical day was management was late only to set back the whole day and potentially upsetting the customers. My co-workers were good hard working people and they definitely made a difficult day significantly better."
"Move, Inc.",",The company is good if you are willing to put in the work and follow the guidance of the senior employees.  Good pay and good hours."
"Magellan Health Services","A lot of people work from home so it is quiet at the office,  but a good place to work.  The office staff and co-workers are easy to get along with. They have however gotten worse as far as training goes."
"Magellan Health Services",",A wonderful environment and a fantastic management team.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a real career that makes a difference in the lives of others,"
"Magellan Health Services",",Very nice company. Room for advancement. Highly recommend! Worked there  under contract with a recruiting service/Aerotek. They hire mostly from within as well."
"Magellan Health Services",",Working at Magellan health care. I have learned so many different things that are used on a daily basis to assist a patient improved. I also learned that communication and being able to work as a team will ensure a member gets that correct care for their recovery.  My favorite thing about my job is knowing I was able to help someone."
"Magellan Health Services",",Love working with people in need of help but at Magellan when you needed help with something you had to go through loop holes to get it. The workplace morale was low due to management inexperience and desire to help."
"Magellan Health Services",",While my coworkers and immediate supervisor were awesome and really trying to address the many problems, and the location was very nice, overall I hated it and left much worse off than I started, due to their poor management of staffing and plan membership."
"Magellan Health Services",",A very high-pressure hiring process, with no respect for the fact that I was still working my previous job while completing their onboarding on my own time. "
"Magellan Health Services",",Training done by other workers while simultaneously trying to do their own jobs...so if a situation didn't happen to come up for them, I didn't get training on it. The only written guidelines or policies available were vague, confused, and usually VERY outdated. Changes were communicated with scattered emails, so if it was sent before you hired on or somehow missed you, you had no idea until you messed up."
"Magellan Health Services",",""Magellan Cares"" initiative, which the company made a very big deal about as corporate philanthropy, but which was really just asking the employees themselves to donate (and often)."
"Magellan Health Services",",Very call center-oriented; rather ridiculous metrics, lots of pressure to meet them early on, rigid breaks and feeling chained to your desk...and while start time and breaks are rigid, your end time is often much later than scheduled."
"Magellan Health Services",",Being yelled at by members because the plans and provider options were so limited, by provoders about billing codes any payment rates, and facility staff because the processes were so inefficient and/or because they didn't get what they wanted."
"Magellan Health Services",",Technologically WAY behind, clunky and inefficient systems and processes, poor communication, lots of unnecessary"

"Magellan Health Services",",Comfortable working environment, supportive management, better than average benefit package.  Great opportunities for training and advanced learning, including tuition reimbursement."
"Magellan Health Services",",It is a nice place to work with very nice co-workers. The typical day is fast past and much work to complete. New and improving company with daily and weekly changes. Still much room for growth and opportunity."
"Magellan Health Services",",MFLC work is challenging because of the inability to write names or notes, teachers are not always welcoming or appreciative of the work you do, and some of the teachers bully the children.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the smiles on children's faces when they develop self-reliance, a sense of self-worth, and discovery of alternatives in decision-making.  I had great co-workers and we supported each other through difficult situations. I learned that there is much work to do to improve the school system concerning the mental/emotional well-being of children."
"Magellan Health Services",",Good experience and work load. Unfortunately companies health benefits and opportunity for advancement were lacking. People were friendly."

"Magellan Health Services",",The team I supported and the friendships I created."
"Magellan Health Services",",No room for advancement for hard workers, they don't give raise. High turn over with employees and management. Workers with no education and experience move to management. Too much favoritism."
"Magellan Health Services",",Good company to work for.  Upper management was a little distant from employees.  Left this organization for a better opportunity.  I believe he contract has been awarded to another organization in 2017"
"Magellan Health Services",",I've worked here for 1 year and have been happy, I would change the way PTO is put into the systems because of the inaccurate web station."
"Magellan Health Services",",Staff were great. "
"Magellan Health Services",",The type of work that we did for our clients was the most enjoyable part of the job."
"Magellan Health Services",",Typical day was answering phones, schedule appointmentsand dealing with clients that come into the office.  Collecting demographic information for data input."
"Magellan Health Services",",When you start to see all of your higher level managers drop with no notice, you should be worried. Little support at this position. They will tell you helping is your number one job, but in truth they really want you to answer as many calls in as little time possible, and, with any luck, you MAY just help the person on the other line. Good money, but not worth the stress or low morale."
"Magellan Health Services",",Loved working here, nothing negative to say about such a wonderful company. Great benefits and the insurance kicks in upon hire. wonderful work atmosphere"

"Northwell Health",",Greeting patients as they arrive at the Patient Service Center for lab work. Doing vein puncture on adults, elderly, children and infants.  Typing at the computer entering patient information. Preparing lab specimens for transport to main lab for processing.  Management was available via telephone and email if any problems arose.Their were usually two employees and the location. In this position I learned to work alone and still satisfy the patients.  We worked together as a team to make the patients visit a success.  The hardest part of the job was when I had to work alone at times because of staffing issues.  The most enjoyable part of the job was doing a patients vein puncture pain free, especially the children.  That always put a huge smile on my face."
"Northwell Health",",Great place to work, great benefits, challenging.  Difficulty for career growth due to lack of communication with TALEO."
"Northwell Health",",I was an intern in the Office of Community and Public Health where I learned how to fill out the forms for community benefit. Was a lot of clerical work and trying to track down doctors."
"Northwell Health",",I work in a 7 bed acute and chronic hemodialysis unit.  I have the ability to provide hemodialysis independently in acute higher levels of care units.  Our unit works well as a team and has a great positive attitude.  The hardest part of the job is watching your patient of 5-8 years dying or has died.  However, you are able to form a great nurse-patient relationship with them and their families."
"Northwell Health",",Great Place to work, Northwell Health has the Finest Guards. Nothing bad to say about northwell everyone gets along and work as a team."
"Northwell Health",",It depends on the department that you work for. Some places are really good and others are really really bad. Some people tend to forget that were work together and not for each other."
"Northwell Health",",Good place to work, very interesting, I have learned a lot, very productive place.  Everyone is happy.  I have been there for 8 years."
"Northwell Health",",A good place to work, but a little restrictive in that you own a somewhat narrow set of IT responsibilities. A good spot for mature tech's looking to specialize on a particular technology, such as Vmware, SAN or networking."
"Northwell Health",",great place to work. Managers need better training. overall culture of care is great. always putting patients first. room for growth. work and home life is easily balanced."
"Northwell Health",",Northwell health takes great pride in their staff , we have great benefits, our patients is priority over anything else, we are a family at this community base hospital, it helps that everyone is involve in patient care not just the nurses or Pca answer the call bell anyone that's on the unit can attend to the patient, we have so many different cultures in the queens area so we are able to provide translator phone at the bedside of patients who require a translator."
"Northwell Health",",I gained valuable work experience and office skills. I also became proficient in different computer programs and learned more about ICD-10 codes. Management is friendly and my co-workers were great. I felt like I was learning something new each day even though I had a desk job. I liked collaborating with my co-workers and also other Northwell clients via phone calls."
"Northwell Health",",Its very rewarding to be able to help patients feel better. Its always educational learning new things. It helps the patients stay positive when you have someone who cares."
"Northwell Health",",You could not pay me enough to work there!  Miserable place.  No respect for hard working good employees.  Two faced, back stabbing horrible leadership."
"Northwell Health",",A typical day at work for me is walking into a office full of fun and positive co workers and leadership. While working for Northwell I learned leadership, innovation and good work ethics. The hardest part of my job was not being able to completely assist a patient. The most important of my job was making sure the patients were satisfied."
"Northwell Health",",A typical day at work involved getting the schedule for your shift and changing stations around the facility. Management and coworkers were mostly good people who were willing to help you out. Hardest part of the job was getting to know the entire facility and dealing with the visitors. Best part was working with the dept's coworkers."
"Northwell Health",",very stable secure place to work very mixed environment people are nice can be a lot of work at times benefits are pretty good"
"Northwell Health",",Managers including the Human Resources department plays favorites.  They are abusive and cruel to good people.  They talk a good talk but do not walk the walk.  They are hypocritical with their culture of care model.  I've seen too many people leave because of the way they were treated."
"Gap Inc. Corporate","Good place to work. Friendly staff and good management. Great place to get sales experience. It's not to fast of a pace so you can take your time and catch on quickly"
"Gap Inc. Corporate",",A typical work day consists of moving around, and helping customers. I learned communication skills, how to pick up the pace, learn quickly, and work the cash register. The management and co-workers are positive, and helpful. The hardest part of the job is keeping an eye on all the customers when there are not many people on the floor. The most enjoyable part is getting to help different people every time."
"Mainz Brady Group","The recruiter was great to work with and was able to provide a high pay rate.  However, the cost of health insurance was too high, paying for COBRA was cheaper and provided more coverage."
"Mainz Brady Group",",They generally try to talk you into almost any position, you are a product and they treat you like a product. Really they consider the client, themselves, and then you (just enough to hopefully keep you on the hook). Never hear from your recruiter, never know what's going on."
"Mainz Brady Group",",It is a good staffing company and they just send you to the client to work"
"Mainz Brady Group",",I started working for these guys as an administrative assistant in 2009. The have a fun work environment, give you free snacks, and really take good care of their employees. I later moved on to become their SEO specialist and take care of their web needs. They worked with me to create this position and it's been a really great 4 years working for MBG."
"Mainz Brady Group",",A great work environment - they provide outstanding training and then let you do your thing! Since they hire very professional people, this type of management works well for everyone that is motivated and has self-discipline. The compensation is great and so are the benfits"
"Mainz Brady Group",",I've been a technical recruiter for over a decade and I made the switch to MBG about 4 years ago. My quality of life has improved, I can afford to give my children the kind of education I want, and I work with people who care about me as a person. While hard work is expected in this line of work, it feels fun because of the vibe given off by management. The office staff is great and I hope I continue working here for years to come."
"Mainz Brady Group",",The management is just awful. The work environment is unpredictable and hostile most times. The manager curses and yells at his employees and threatens his employees to motivate by fear."
"Mainz Brady Group",",The management team (in Portland as well as in the Bay area) will verbally call you out in front of the team. They will criticize you and tell you you're a failu)re. They have also told the team personal information that I shared in confidence with the entire company, medical information. There are no boundaries for this manager. (Rhymes with Candy Town)."
"Mainz Brady Group",",Overall this company is a hostile place to work and I have never been more miserable. Perhaps some people are able to work in that type of environment but I would say 95% can't or will not stay long. They have really high turnover because of ""the manager"" in the Portland office and they way he treats his people."
"Mainz Brady Group",",All I can say is don't be deceived when you first walk into the office. I know I was. It all looks great. Do your due diligence and check around. Call a few people that have worked there."
"Mainz Brady Group",",We will all tell you the same thing, to run for your life."
"National Renewable Energy Laboratory","This organization has a fabulous mission, a beautiful campus, and relatively good benefits, with a flexible work environment.  NREL hosts thousands of dedicated and talented people, but the executive management team has reduced communication (both channels and information) in the last year following new leadership.  This research engine hosts some of the most sophisticated facilities and capabilities in the world for studying energy efficiency, and if you're a research scientist or engineer, it could be very fun to work here.  However, if you do anything on the business support side of the house, you are held in low esteem.  Project management rigor is virtually nonexistent, resulting in poorly planned and sloppily executed projects.  Business units are now more siloed than ever, and there is little integration between them, resulting in increasing inefficiencies.  Funding is largely from Congress, although there is increasing emphasis on acquiring industrial partnerships."

"National Renewable Energy Laboratory",",Like anywhere, your experience as an employee at NREL depends upon your direct management. I've been lucky enough to have a manager that's alright. With budget cuts over the past few years, things are a bit tight, and some divisions could use a moral boost."
"National Renewable Energy Laboratory",",A very good place to work. They involve you in great projects which you really want specially in early stages of your career."
"National Renewable Energy Laboratory",",NREL mission is superb. Renewable energy has potential to be the way of the future. The downside is that it's funding by the national government could be better. Other than that, the atmosphere is great, and the work-life balance is respected. Benefits are also a plus."
"National Renewable Energy Laboratory",",Inexperienced technical teams - bad solutions result in bad performance. Unwilling or unable to accept criticism or suggestion. Learning as they go - but leave a wake of problems behind as they jump to the next new project."

"National Renewable Energy Laboratory",",You better make sure you are an expert at what you're applying for before you accept the job offer. NREL only hires the best, the flawless, the ultra-intelligent systematic super humans. "
"National Renewable Energy Laboratory",",There is little training and zero to little mentoring for your specific job. You are expected to learn quickly and independently, without much guidance. Most people are willing to help, but your manager will most likely be informed and irritated if you are continuously asking for help (even if it's a new type of task). Don't put your trust in everyone, because if they do not like you or are unsatisfied with what you are doing, they will tell on you like a tattling child. If management decides that you are not performing to their expectations (they are usually so busy, they don't actually know what you are doing half the time and go by what others tell them), or you are not intuitively catching on to the functions of federal government fast enough, or your manager doesn't like your personality (combined with pointing out every flaw and not praising the positives), they will fearlessly terminate you without warning."

"National Renewable Energy Laboratory",",I worked for Autozone for a long time and most of the time i really liked it.  As a store manager the demand from upper management was unrealistic."
"National Renewable Energy Laboratory",",Careen advancement for people without Ph.D. is very limited. Even with Ph.D., opportunity for those with hands-on and evolution instead of revolution mind set is not that great.  Those who can charm others with their fantasy move to the top; those who do the hard work stay at the bottom."
"National Renewable Energy Laboratory",",The National Renewable Energy Laboratory protective Force officer job is the classic situation of it  ""Much to do about nothing."" The basic Patrol function is nothing more than checking and rechecking the same locked doors to the same buildings over the course of an 8 to 12 hour shift.  The emergency preparedness procedures are overly detailed and convoluted. This step by step process for things such as fire alarms medical emergencies and HVAC issues is often used as ammunition against security if the slightest thing goes wrong or someone complains about how it was handled even if handled correctly. The communication and dispatch center for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory often doesn't work due to power issues, making it difficult for security personnel to do their jobs. The worst part of the National Renewable Energy Lab protective Force officer position is the security management and supervision. Security supervision will often hideout for several hours expecting the regular security personnel to do all of the work. Security supervision often will not make on the spot supervisory decisions and leave it up to the regular officer to ""Make the Call""  only to be criticized later for making the decision that they made. Often especially during shift change security supervision will argue and yell and sometimes use profanity at the other officers in front of other employees. These arguments were usually about last minute call offs, schedule changes and disagreements on policy and procedures. Sometimes these arguments escalated and almost became physical confrontations.

All in all I'm grateful for my time and experience provided and on the job training as well as many in house seminars with work place."
"Accenture",",Accenture acquired the company I was working for, which was both good and bad.  The good was that it allowed our company to tap into more resources and we got better employee perks.  The bad was that we went from a small tech company to being a small cog in a behemoth of a international company.  This meant there was a lot of bureaucratic hoops we now had to jump through, slowing down everything and resulting in a significant amount of our small company employees to leave, including myself, but for different reasons.

"Verizon",",From the day I started, I was part of the Verizon family. I was treated with respect. Benefits are really good. management works with you on scheduling and time off. Even the hourly compensation was fair and reasonable. All leadership treated you with respect and truly listened to your opinions and, when appropriate, incorporated employee suggestions."
"Verizon",",Great Pay, Unfulfilling position and very repetitive. Defininetly not a good fit for anyone wanting to learn new things on a consistent basis or move around at all."

"Verizon",",Verizon is a good place to work. The work/life balance is difficult to manage in their retail stores, but they do try and are conscious of the challenge. Field is ever changing, but training is outstanding and ongoing. Advancement is almost exclusively done within the company. Expectations are high and are profit-driven but the rewards are significant and go beyond compensation."

"Bridgepoint Education",",Terrible place to work.  They pitch it like it's education, but you are truly just making 200+ calls per day, qualifying prospective students for Federal grants and loans.  High-pressure, horrible management, and treat you like a child, micromanaging every move you make.  I was not cut out for this, it felt crooked.  I was let go on my birthday.  Best present ever."
"Bridgepoint Education",",A very a high energy job that is very manageable if one has the innate ability to compartmentalize and strategize. Bridgepoint is geared towards creating a culture that is encompassing by all employees as well as their students."
"Bridgepoint Education",",This company treats its employees very poorly and most run for the door once they see there is no upward mobility worth waiting on.  They have a poor retention rate and I would not refer my enemy there."
"Bridgepoint Education",",Bridgepoint Education has been a tremendous opportunity for me to grow both personally and professionally.

"Bridgepoint Education",",Bridgepoint Education offers it's employees some of the best sales training I've received in my 4 years of sales experience. However, because of federal law, they cannot reward you more for higher performance. However, the pressure for the highest level of performance is still in full force. High pressure for the same pay."
"Bridgepoint Education",",Work environment is very production in this company. There are large amounts of resourses for being successful at this company."
"Bridgepoint Education",",Management is cruel. Nit picking stressful.  Treats one like children. HR is always threatening.  One never knows where you stand. Insensitive and show no compassion.  Management only looks at numbers and it is a sweat shop. Most co-worker are great but some are brown noisers  Love the students but they are reduced to numbers. It's all about the numbers."
"Bridgepoint Education",",Denver Pain Management is one of Denver's premiere pain management clinics. The staff is friendly, professional and devoted to helping their patients receive quality healthcare."
"Bridgepoint Education",",There is not a day that goes by at Bridgepoint where I do not feel productive, or that I don't love working with my employees.  My job duties include multi-tasking to the extreme.  Not only am I involved or heading multiple projects, but I am also responsible for a group of employees (10-20 people) and their coaching and development.  It's a fast paced job, where if you are not driven you can become stagnate.  I am naturally a driven person, so starting up projects or finding work come naturally to me."
"Bridgepoint Education",",Bridgepoint is a good company to work for because they do not micro-manage,  Managers allow employees to take on extra responsibility if they choose to."
"Bridgepoint Education",",The company provides multiple training opportunities to improve your skills. Directors and managers are helpful. Goals are not extremely high and attainable if you manage your time well and apply coaching."
"Bridgepoint Education",",There has been a lot of layoffs, the management is not professional and there is no accountability for them. Also, there is a lot of favoritism and no opportunity for growth. They also have a cap on how much you can make, so it does not encourage you to stick around. They do offer some departments flexible schedules, but not everyone. The health care plan and annual raises are declining year by year."
"Bridgepoint Education",",Ashford University has a fast paced, fun work environment. The compensation isn't competitive in this job market, but the great people who work there make up for it. I love my co-workers. The hardest part of my day is working with difficult students, but it's always rewarding when I am able to help them!"
"Bridgepoint Education",",I recently worked at Bridgepoint aka Ashford University as an enrollment advisor. During the interview they stressed to me that I would have ""numbers"" or ""metrics"" I would have to meet monthly, which I am comfortable with due to 4 years of call center experience. I knew that we would also be doing outbound cold type calls to leads given to us. However, whenever I had a potential person of interest to get into school, the ""high pressured sales tactics"" kicked in with management. If a student needed time to think about getting back into school, or they had a huge family crisis they needed to deal with, I would follow up with them in a few weeks to see how things were going. But, management didn't like that and kept telling me to ask ""why later and not now?"" Which would make me look like I had no compassion for what was going on in their life."
"Bridgepoint Education",",If in the interview they stressed the intense sales like need, I would have never taken the job. I did meet some great people who did enroll under me and loved my co workers. It was the poor threatening management team that I could care less for. All we got daily were very open threats that our job was not secure, if we didn't enroll enough students each month and retain them. I don't care for that kind of management tactics and I only stayed 7 months."
"Bridgepoint Education",",A great place to work but the location was less than desirable. They definitely try to take care of their employees but the opportunities for advancement were virtually none existent."
"Bridgepoint Education",",I have nothing bad to say about the company, its a very good company to be a part of, the wonder is will it be around in 5 years from now...."

"Sonos, Inc","There are come incredible and unique things about Sonos that I love - directness and transparency at all levels of the organization, people who are deeply passionate about music and the music-listening experience (and therefore our mission), and a level of caring and ownership about the company that I've never experienced anywhere else.  That said, it's a hard and exciting time for us right now.  There is a lot of foundational work to be done to build a truly long lasting company and not always enough resources to do it.  We've lost some of the ""start-upy"" culture elements that people who've been here a while loved and small pockets of employees are trying to retain that while we also work on the scaling and process work and become more cost-containment focused.  So we are in a stage of a lot of change and evolution - it will be a telling 6-18 months and so far I feel optimistic that we'll be able to keep the fundamental things about us that make us different."
"Sonos, Inc",",Cons:  "
"Sonos, Inc",", -They do not  let employees review their managers, so when people are mismanaged no one ever knows. People quietly disappear often due to not being set up to succeed or they were mismanaged and no one would ever know. I have seen people uproot their life to move to one of the main locations then disappear a few months in. "
"Sonos, Inc",", - Not much upward growth. Its a big company that does not do well working across silos. "
"Sonos, Inc",",- They now have lot of competition. "

"Sonos, Inc",",Advice to Management:"
"Sonos, Inc",",Set people up for success, it is not always the individual contributor that is the problem. You created a culture where managers are never given reviews are not held accountable from the people they manage. Get more people leaders, treat people well not just managers/directors."
"Sonos, Inc",",I scheduled interviews and made sure that all candidates were taken care of during their interview process.  "
"Sonos, Inc",",I learned a lot about the full-time work world and plan to apply all of my knowledge gained into my new roles in the future. "
"Sonos, Inc",",My manager was remote in Boston, which made things rather difficult since he wasn't always there to see what I do day to day or help me in the work place itself. "
"Sonos, Inc",",My co-workers were absolutely amazing and so helpful in everything I did.  "
"Sonos, Inc",",The hardest part of the job was the heavy, high stress workload where I would be juggling 15-20 candidates and all their paperwork at one time and would find myself jumping all over the place. "
"Sonos, Inc",",The most enjoyable part of the job was the constant workflow I had and the environment was amazing as well."

"McKinsey & Company",",The company is a good company as long as you have someone higher up that has your back. If you're in an administrative role there is not much room for advancement.

"McKinsey & Company",",Pros: fast learning curve; working with smart people; exposure to a variety of different topics/industries;good training programs and exit options"
"McKinsey & Company",",Cons: poor life balance"

"McKinsey & Company",",Limited advancement opportunities and professional development."
"McKinsey & Company",",Fun environment where employees become a close knit community and become life long friends.  Employees are highly intelligent and have rock solid values.  The benefits are incredible, and work/life balance is a priority.  The only drawback is that there isn't any growth opportunity for the support staff.  As a non-hierarchical company, employees are all equal, so promotions do not exist.  Unfortunately, the job responsibilities never change, which can eventually create boredom in this position even though the position is very fast paced with a heavy workload."
"McKinsey & Company",",This company has many good qualities preferred skills and knowledge can be implemented in future job replacements to better advance your professional needs."
"McKinsey & Company",",Most management that work under Procurement- GPG- do not have experience in procurement. They are only there because they know someone higher up. It's a great company if you work on the consulting side and starting at the bottom will not get you there. They only hire consultants from top 10% in ivy league schools. If you work as an assistant in procurement, be careful who your managers are. Some will belittle you, yell at you in from of people over the most stupid thing and require you to take a test before being hired which doesn't apply to assistant work at all. Benefits are great if you are a full time employee and they won't let you take time off in the first year. Following year, approach with caution. This place is all about politics and favoritism. If you get on the wrong side of a manager, you won't get a promotion. They are experts are making you believe you will move up and when the time comes they will give you some excuse. They will try to give you the least amount of money and work you like a dog."
"McKinsey & Company",",Only good to put on resume because of the name."
"McKinsey & Company",",The work was pretty boring and kind of a grind but the people here were so nice to work with. Great company to work for, lots good memories here."
"McKinsey & Company",",McKinsey & Company is one of the top companies to work for but beware that this only applies if you have a career as a Consultant, Engagement manager, etc and working on the Client side.  However if you're working in Operations, Reconciliations, Card Service, Purchasing, Procurement... you won't have a life, you will be humiliated, yelled at and you will put in more than 50 hours a week. Yes you'll have great benefits and vacations but you'll work during your vacation or expect a call from your manager.  If you leave on vacation, you'll pay the price when you return.  It's a nightmare.  Some that have been there for several years, are use to this type of treatment and think this is normal. Leaving that place was the best thing I've done!!  The only positive thing was to have McKinsey in my resume which it landed me a great job with great people who actually treat me with respect. I want people to know so they won't go through the same nightmare I went through. If you land an interview, please ask the right questions, make sure this place is for you.  Ask the employees questions about their supervisor, manager, etc, ask them if there happy, ask about work & life balance. Think twice about it if you have a family and kids... because you won't be spending much time with them."

"3M","My experienced of more than a decade of being a volunteer in school, church, and other non-profit organization, and as a parent of three children, allowed me to be a private tutor, through referrals from my friends and family.  I have a consistent excellent successful rate of my students passing the grade and some even excelling with their subjects of concern. "
"3M",",I worked both in varied settings in a business and marketing/sales settings, to served all types of people from different ethnicity, race, religion, culture and different family settings. And I've learned a different technique, of assessing my student's strengths and weaknesses. With more than a decade, I acquired a skill to motivate children, to learn more on the subjects, that they have deficiency at, and some even had excelled beyond their expectation with their academic ability!"
"3M",",had great pay and benefits. downfall was 12 hour shifts rotating nights and days every 2 weeks. didn't know if I was suppose to be sleeping or awake.  only working 3 to 4 days a week gave me a lot of time off."
"3M",",Use to be a good place to work until new management came in and ruined the place. the plant is closing and 3m corp. is being unfair to its workers. They dont have to shutdown they just want to"
"3M",",When I get to work, usually we clock in and go straight to the work stations. Every hour you receive 5 minutes of break, which can be taken at any point throughout the workday, usually. "
"3M",",The work team leaders of 3M are very knowledgeable, and are willing to work with you to show you how to get the job done right, which is a big issue people tend to have is learning bad habits from the start. "
"3M",",I'm glad I did this job for a summer for the experience. "
"3M",",The hardest part of the job is standing there for 8 hours doing something that anyone can do, but you find ways to get through it."
"3M",",The most enjoyable part of the job is the camaraderie you receive between employee"
"3M",",I worked at 3M as a summer temp. The pay was good for a college student. Other positions require 12 hour rotating shifts however mine was a straight day job. The plant is full of great people."
"3M",",Most enjoyable part about my job with 3M is the Job stability. "
"3M",",The hardest part about my job, is the fact that they are phasing out operations at my plant."
"3M",",Rotating shift were not my thing. The job itself was packing and not real rewarding but could be for some. Temporary personnel were treated substandard by full time employees."
"3M",",Productive and good place to work with business users. Taking lead role and coordinating with team and achieving the goals on time. Customer satisfaction is the first at the end of day."
"3M",",Great place to work. Great technology and great team building and internship program.  A little short-sighted in hiring. Need to work on continuous hiring."
"3M",",I liked the 4-crew. Got more days off. I loved the pay and vacation time. Nights could get long but worth it. Many jobs to try."
"3M",",if you are good at being a ""yes"" person, even if you disagree, then you have a good start.  If you don't have a college education, then you have no chance for advancement."
"3M",",Learned alot about the touch systems equipment.. Employers were so good to work with...  My mangers was good at what he did .. and he helped me learn about the Truck field.."
"3M",",I have learned a lot about manufacturing working here.  A typical day is 8 hours long.  Many of the employees help each other out, and there is very little animosity in the workplace. It's a very positive space and very laid back."
"3M",",For the most part, the moral is up, until the end of each quarter when pretty much everyone freaks out because they haven't met their quota yet. Once that starts happening, the stress and competition build. I personally think that this happening forces sales executives to work even harder to meet their goals."
"3M",",The best part of being with 3M is that you get to meet such great people and everyone there is so good at doing their job. We always learn from each other and give each other constructive criticism when needed."
"3M",",It is the best company to work with the greatest salaries compensation and life balance. 3M is a family when you work with them. 3M is a solid company around the world."
"3M",",Very fast pace energetic environment. Most of the time typical day was not typical. Things were changing and you have to get things on fly. Friendly culture with lots of emphasis on accountability, with no micro management. Hardest part and also the most enjoyable part was the ever changing priorities. No two days were similar."
"3M",",Wonderful place to work, pleasant people.  Worked there from 2007 to 2015 as Sr. Administrative Assistant.  Retired in December 2015."
"3M",",During my tenure there, I had two wonderful bosses!"
"3M",",Working for 3m was a great job just working with all types of chemicals a few people including myself got sick some died from Cancer which was not proved it was from the chemical but the job became very scary after people started losing lives at the ages of 33 and 39."
"3M",",I was in charge of developing sales and marketing strategies, make market analysis, coordinate appointments with potential customers and more. My role was essential for the company to ensure successful sales numbers and overall company productivity."
"3M",",Work place is fast paced and an enjoyable job but the pay doesn't fit the physical demand that is required. The people who work there are great humored and easy to work with. There is a mini convince store in the lunch room that is open to all employees. With free coffee creamer and sugar provided for your use. Cups are available if they are not all gone."
"3M",",3M is a great place to work if you like to work different shifts and overtime. It is very difficult on family life. Poor management in certain areas. The pay and benefits are really good, but that's how they get you to stay. Be prepared to work rotating shifts and overtime. Very difficult for raising a family."
"3M",",Good work environment, and 3M is always looking for ways to innovate. Leader in many industries!"
"3M",",If you get the right leadership at 3M you can grow and learn a lot!"

"Facebook",",The food is great, but other than that, this is a tough job, and there is high attrition."

"Facebook",",My management is very supportive, have a friendly behaviour, always encourages the employees at work and fullfills all the needs of the employee."
"Facebook",",My co-workers are very compitative and sportive."
"Facebook",",I was hired with the intention of being trained on what items I was making. With time they continued to say I would be trained at some point but I was generally all by myself everynight with no instruction. My coworkers were pleasant though and they came out with a great product every day."

"Facebook",",i love working for facebook great people great food all the employees are super sweet. everyone is verry caring nice and real there are many perks for working for this company aswell this job will always keep you smilling"
"Facebook",",Is an exciting place to work for. While doing your day - to - day responsibilities you also have time to play and eat. The culture is very relaxing so you can work at your own past."
"Facebook",",The culture really makes this company and its work very enjoyable."
"Facebook",",I am currently at this company for an internship so I wouldn't know what to say about the benefits but from what I hear they are really good."
"Facebook",",facebook is a nice place to work if you like the volunteer part of administration, and only getting paid for what you personally sell of your own items."
"Facebook",",Started working on important projects from week one. There are lot of resources to learn from and great colleagues . Interns are respected  pretty well and part of their culture. "
"Facebook",",Work feels hectic at times and higher expectations will be there from your mentor or management."
"Facebook",",Facebook was an amazing place to intern at. The culture is amazing and the people are amazing as well. It is a high pressure area but you still feel relaxed and able to do the work. I enjoyed every aspect of this job fully. It is such a fast moving environment, if you aren't quick on your feet, you can be left behind."
"Facebook",",Facebook is a great place to work.  The culture of innovation provides opportunities that many companies cannot.  This is especially true for security professionals.  The only downside is the lack of career path development for security professionals in this organization."
"Facebook",",Facebook kind of embodies the American Dream.  Once you're there, anyone can become anything they'd like if they really work at it.  "
"Facebook",",Facebook holds high performance/product expectations, but they take care to provide everything you need to get the job done and more..."

"TAMKO","I would operate the Forklift on a daily basis to achieve my scheduled work deadlines.  I am very knowledgeable of the many mechanical features (boom/scoop, swivel hook, lift beam, grapple, clamps, elevating platform, and trailer hitch) of the Forklift and operate it at all times in a safe manner.  I also maintain/inspect the Forklift regularly to keep it in good working condition."
"TAMKO",",Good working environment, helpful co-workers, good hours and competitive pay. Good health insurance, paid time off. Availability of cross training in different departments."
"TAMKO",",TAMKO is a strong opportunity for smart, talented technicians and leaders offering competitive wages and benefits and a culture that engages employees at all levels in continuous process improvement in its urgent pursuit of perfection."
"TAMKO",",Great staff to work with, great pay,but tough working conditions.This company knows the rules and abides by them, discrimination is not allowed."
"TAMKO",",If you're not in the suck up group better watch your back only way to advance is suck management! Mgt is corrupt can't say it enough! No matter how much overtime you work it's not appreciated!"
"TAMKO",",TAMKO is always in continuous improvement mode trying new management strategies and changing how they do things.  If you want to experience the program of the month...this is the place."
"TAMKO",",Expect not to have a life. Hard work. Work hard and don't stand around for a while. They expect  a lot. Rotating shifts are normal. Don't get on the bad side with any of the guys that are ""hired on"". Most of the time you'll be busy, so no worries. 12 hour shifts most of the time."
"TAMKO",",Great place to work...different challenges daily. Worked 12 hour shift with 3 breaks during day. Had 3 production lines...2 would be producing product while  we performed preventive maintenance on the line that was ""down"". During  my 9 years there it  was an ongoing  learning experience....combining my job in maintenance  and how  it affected and could improve the production process.We worked in four man maintenance crews..I enjoyed the working  with my crew..working  together  and troubleshooting maintenance issues was one of the best parts of the job. Probably the worse part of the job was the production process and product being manufactured resulted in a very dirty work environment...and working  on machine sometimes required laying  in water  and mud....constant dust in the air."
"TAMKO",",Worst job I ever worked at! They hire ###kissers to take mgmt jobs than dont know from stop to go! Beware of working here!!!!!"
"TAMKO",",They dont care about family at all, married to your job"
"TAMKO",",The company pays well. They do not train the rep, they give you a laptop and throw you into the market. Sink or swim, no help."
"TAMKO",",Owned and run by one family. The owner makes all the final decisions at multiple locations around the country. They have some rigid concepts about who they want to hire and how fast they should progress. Owner is a lawyer so, many decisions are risk based. Most Leadership at plant levels change very frequently."
"TAMKO",",Tamko is a fair employer. Management is involved in all aspects of jobs on line. Everybody in plant is a team member and not an I person. Great to be employeed here."
"TAMKO",",The work schedule is very demanding. There are no set guidelines. The health conditions at this plant would not be good for me in the long run.  I breathe in fiberglass daily and I'm not sure what else."
"TAMKO",",Great pay, and pretty good people to work with. It's really hot in the summer and really cold in the winter. Safety is the number one goal all of the time."
"TAMKO",",great  pay and benefits, GREAT PEOPLE ON LINES AND MAINTENANCE,BUT MANAGEMENT IS REVOLVING DOOR"
"TAMKO",",MORAL IS HORRIBLE everybody's worried about getting fired from management,"
"TAMKO",",Loved the work, training was horrible. Co-workers really don't want to to help train. Schedule is rough 4-12hr shifts two days off then 4-12hr nights, so not much of a home life."
"TAMKO",",it was ok the other employes made it fun to work.we talked about ever thing.but theres no smoking on site.and we get free lunch on "
"TAMKO",",holidays"
"TAMKO",",i enjoyed my time working at tamko, it was an excellent experience to learn how making shingles is and how the machinery works."

"TAMKO",",I am very thankful to work for TAMKO. They are a great company, and you cannot help but feel cared for."
"TAMKO",",I was able to perform different jobs as needed on particular days. Jobs I performed included machine operator, loading and unloading railcars and trucks. (more details included in resume)"
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals","This is a great company with smart, hard-working people. The company has never evolved a development plan or path for motivated employees, advancement is often about self-promotion."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",The company has the best benefits for employees. However, there's a lot of room for improvement in management. Without good management, there isn't growth for employees."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Great company culture, great people, everyday is a new day very dynamic and awesome. I like the working environment and people who are always willing you help out whenever."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Very innovative and encouraging group to work with."

"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Mentored junior level canditates on ETL  technical skills."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",It all depends on what department or team you are with, but I had wonderful time working there.  Interned at marketing department for a few month and everyone was nice and they are all more than willing to help you out.  Vertex really does value your work/life balance and I really felt like I was treated as a valuable asset to the company."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Vertex pharmaceuticals has a very welcoming and warm environment. A typical day for me involves many interactions with clients and customers, dealing with on-your-toes situations, working on promotions for our service, organizing BEOs, managing my catering team and making sure our operation runs smoothly and effectively. I have learned many management and communications skills, organizational tactics, and overall business processes and etiquette. My managers are great teachers who set examples for the rest of our staff to follow. A lot of what I have learned is because of their endless efforts to teach me something new every day. Other than my managers, the rest of my co-workers help to create a fun yet productive environment. "
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Usually, the hardest part of my day isn't a single task, but working at a minimum, 11 hour days. This can be tiresome, at times, although necessary. On the contrary, the best part of my job is getting to build relations with our clients on a daily basis."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Great Benefits"
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Innovative company"
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Smart people"
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Nice place"
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",I have learned a lot working at this place. "
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Good coworkers"
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Good people"
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",excellent company to work for, great atmosphere, locality is key.  there is a lot of immature people and who have to be in a group to be happy.."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",I was on a temp to hire assignment there that did not work out.  Vertex treated their temps just as they treated their full time employees, which was really great.  A lot of great perks were offered (fitness center being one of them) that I took advantage of even though I was a temp worker.  I was very interested in becomming a full time employee."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Vertex had two drugs approved during my 7 years there and the stock went from $22 when I started to $143 at one point in 2015. Vertex has fantastic benefits and I met and worked with a lot of wonderful people."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Working at Vertex has been a great experience! The people are all there for the same reason, to help patients with cystic fibrosis and they do every day! I've learned so much, not only from my managers but from my co-workers. Everyone is helpful should you ask questions about what they do or how your position fits into the bigger scheme of the company."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Worked as a contract staff and it was difficult to mingle with the full time staff. Offices moved to Boston from Cambridge making the commute harder."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Vertex is a great company to work for. A fast pace environment The atmospher is great"
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",This was a great place to work. Unfortunately I was finished with my contract here."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",I would not recommend working for Vertex, have been with the organization for over two years and just gets worse, not better- Management is all talk. Do NOT recommend working within the procurement and sourcing group."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",very busy in and out procedure rooms supporting researchers. I have learned that communication, pay close attention to instructions giving is very important. I worked with very open minded individuals where we shared and trained each other on different procedures and techniques to continue with good training. the hardest part is when researchers and scientist schedules last minute things. I get to have close communications with my co-workers, work closely and learn from each other."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Atmosphere was very good, co workers very well liked as well as Management.  Amex is a very good company long term to work for."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Company makes business decisions suddenly, without regard for long-term outlook or their reputation. They pay well but don't promote appropriately.  People are given new titles that don't accurately reflect their job duties, essentially demoting them with no consideration how this will affect their resumes. They pay lip service to ""job/life balance"" but treat people as disposable. Not a happy place to work."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",colleagues appreciated hard-working contributers. Vertex rewarded team for efforts, while keeping patients needs top of mind.  was well respected by healthcare providers, worked with highly competent colleagues"
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a very unstable company, where there is some sort of reorganization several times a year. You may not be performing the work that you were hired to do. They boast about a flexible work schedule; however, they do not practice this. Everything is in favor of upper management (training, time off, work from home, etc.). Overall Vertex does not practice what they preach."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals",",job is great but constant layoffs, firings and fear of job security."
"Retrofit","Think, plan, think, plan & now work--things go well; continue--not so much--think more."
"Retrofit",",Complete the days needs & jump start tomorrow."
"Retrofit",",Hardest part of the job was climbing in the ovens"
"Retrofit",",Was not given proper training or guidence on what was expected of me. the longest 9 hours a day I have ever worked in my life not sure why they didn't want to work with me except they wanted cut my pay and benefits with a new contract that I did not agree with. realized I am not a office type person I've always been in the fiield and like being out working on different types of equipment"
"Morgan Stanley","In 2008, it was a different environment that what I imagine it to be today. It was a wealth management office that was growing its business. I met with a lot of prospective clients and saw some of the challenges of being a financial advisor."

"Morgan Stanley",",I enjoy working for Morgan Stanley in my current capacity. I am grateful for the experience I've gained and the people I've met."
"Morgan Stanley",",I've heard people complain about their workplace and going to work. Not me, I actually loved it. My motto was to my colleagues and clients ""if its not fun, then  its work"".  I had the luxury of going to the gym before I started my shift, sitting at my desk with tea, and checking my emails, as i prioritze my day. Some days were much busier than others, where I couldnt have my tea or sort thru emails. I had to prepare time sensitive new hire packages for our London office. My manager and colleagues were very supportive and were able to assist when available. We backed each other up on several days. I believe the hardest part of the job was leaving."
"Morgan Stanley",",Good culture, good risk control.  Great professionals as colleagues.  Good work life balance with flexible hours and no issues and proper support for daily operations both personally and profesionally"
"Morgan Stanley",",The group that I work for is most populated by career Morgan Stanley  employees that have grown disgruntled with repeated years of low or non-existent raises. To combat decreasing morale leadership has decided to focus on creating a better work life balance via work from home days. The trade off for a young professional is worth while though my peers have stressed that the luster of this short term fix will wear off after a while ."
"Morgan Stanley",",I was an in house temp for Morgan Stanley.  Overall the company was a great company to work for- great facilities, human resources etc.  Once you know the ins and outs of Morgan Stanley's procedures it is a very nice place to work for.  The people I worked for varied- mainly Managing Directors and VPs- in the three years I temped there I only had two bad experiences.  Because I was a temp, I found that I could easily communicate with the human resources/ temping department if something was a bad fit. Typical day at work included booking business travel through their travel office, scheduling meetings, going through emails, doing expense reports and answering phones."
"Morgan Stanley",",Requires dedication and hard work. Commute can be arduous over time."
"Morgan Stanley",",the culture is competitive but the rewards are worth it. "

"Morgan Stanley",",I learn something new each and everyday and I really enjoy doing that, there is always something new to learn, rules and laws change so it keeps me on my toes."
"Morgan Stanley",",I spent much of my earlier career here.  Great environment for learning the business and developing your skill set.  The company is demanding of its people but also rewards accordingly."
"Morgan Stanley",",Morgan Stanley is a productive and fun place. Never a dull moment with the day to day interaction between peers and clients. One objective ""Service""."
"Morgan Stanley",",Financial Advisers were usually appreciative of my client service skills and established long term relationships to make life changes easier for aging clients. Enjoyed collegiality with co-workers.  Was able to learn new systems and to achieve both my Series 7 and Series 66."
"Morgan Stanley",",The hardest part of the job was the constantly changing federal and Finra rules and assuring clients that the additional information was required."
"Morgan Stanley",",The best part of the job was exceeding both the Adviser's and the Client's expectations regarding their financial well being."
"Morgan Stanley",",Poor management, no job security. Good compensation. Lack of support from branch management.____________________"
"Morgan Stanley",",The company is diverse and does have a solid foundation. The turnover rate is high, but I think the current upper management staff is working to keep employees longer."
"Morgan Stanley",",It was a summer job for me in high school. This location is downtown and I loved it and enjoyed working around important people. I was just a receptionist but I talked to actual clients often."
"Morgan Stanley",",Not a good company if you are looking to advance in other professional areas, company is primarily about the advisers and not other employees."
"Morgan Stanley",",Excellent work life balance, ability to learn from a diverse group of experts. Need more advancement opportunities and better management. Workplace culture is good."
"Morgan Stanley",",workplace culture is good, comp outside of front office positions is not strong. ok first position out of school but limited growth."

"DECISIVE ANALYTICS CORPORATION",",The company is a great one to work for.  I enjoy being a part of it."
"DECISIVE ANALYTICS CORPORATION",",Worling for the Company is great. DAC is a sub to CSC on the contract which I work. Many of my co-workers are CSC or other sub contractor employees and not DAC employees."
"DECISIVE ANALYTICS CORPORATION",",It is a really wonderful company that has some really good benefits.  One of the best benefits, is that it is an employee owned company, which really helps make it a great culture.  Perhaps the biggest drawback is that it is a small company, and the contracts that it has is primarily if not exclusively connected to the government, so with all the uncertainty with government budgets, so are the contracts that this company is working on."
"DECISIVE ANALYTICS CORPORATION",",DAC is a great place to work. The day-to-day atmosphere is very open and laid back, everyone's friendly. Benefits are awesome, plenty of vacation. Management is very approachable and open to suggestions. Work-life balance like no other, including telework options and flexible work day schedules."

"DECISIVE ANALYTICS CORPORATION",",All position levels are valued, including internships."
"DECISIVE ANALYTICS CORPORATION",",The most enjoyable part of working at DAC is getting to know your co-workers. DAC provides great opportunities for this through lunches, happy hours, an ultimate frisbee team, etc."
"DECISIVE ANALYTICS CORPORATION",",Great company for new professionals (recent college graduates), or seasoned professionals."
"DECISIVE ANALYTICS CORPORATION",",I really enjoy working at Decisive Analytics Corporation. As a software engineer, my day-to-day involves a lot of sitting in front of a computer, but the lifestyle at DAC makes it all worth it! The fact that we're a small business means better benefits and a fun, relaxed atmosphere. We do regular happy hours, have an annual Christmas party, golf outing, and training meeting, which last year was held in the Bahamas! Also, we get discounted tickets to sporting events usually for front row or club seating."
"Grant Thornton","Great place to launch career and build technical abilities "

"Grant Thornton",",Competitive paying rates"
"Grant Thornton",",Managers offer constructive feedback"
"Grant Thornton",",Great way to get experience in public accounting. The work culture could have been better but there were a lot of learning opportunities within the firm"
"Grant Thornton",",I have been with the firm and I am not happy with the main focus being on utilization. I don't have anything else to say. I would like a work life balance."
"Grant Thornton",",Grant Thornton lacks in opportunity and camaraderie.  Most recently, Human Resources has hired a great number of recent college graduates, but not enough projects to place them on. These individuals are provided leadership roles without much work experience.  They also provide inadequate direction, which is also apparent at the leadership level as well.  Experienced hires a often placed on opportunities that are not compatible with their skill set, and has resulted in a high turn over of knowledgeable professionals."
"Grant Thornton",",The disparity of between experience and inexperience creates an environment that lacks genuine camaraderie, and more often seen as a threatening situation, even observed at the management level.  Grant Thornton's CLEARRLY slogan does not come close to being adapted on the job, in particular the aspect of mutual Respect."
"Grant Thornton",",I like this firm, good culture. I like the ppl here. Everyone support each other. GT provides very good learning opportunity, people here grow very fast."
"Grant Thornton",",Grant Thornton does a very great job at making sure that their interns are getting a full perspective of what it would be like to work there full-time. It is very informative and I learned a lot in just the 8 weeks of my internship."
"Grant Thornton",",Thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Grant Thornton and I could not say more positive things about the people and work environment they provided. I am glad I was able to start my career here and have no regrets choosing GT over a big 4 firm."
"Grant Thornton",",Grant Thornton is a great place to start a career.  The employees are bright and you will gain a lot of diverse experience.  They also provide a lot of opportunities to learn new things."
"Grant Thornton",",Typical day during busy season for an audit associate/senior associate:"
"Grant Thornton",",8:30am - 7:30pm"
"Grant Thornton",",Responsible for carrying out fieldwork and performing audit testing. Responsible for guidance of staff members in completing their work. Responsible for direct communication with client and other engagement team members (Managers, Partners, ect)."
"Grant Thornton",",Co-workers were excellent to work with; young, smart, helpful. Definitely the best part about this job are the people you work with."
"Grant Thornton",",Hardest part of the job was pressure to complete work by deadlines and pressure from management. There is always a ""life or death"" type atmosphere with any assignment. "
"Grant Thornton",",No work life balance - the expectation is to always be available to work, even on weekends, holidays, and vacations."
"Grant Thornton",",Great firm to work for but personally public accounting can be boring work if you don't get on the right clients. I would suggest staying in public for a few years then jumping ship."
"Grant Thornton",",The Accounting Department is an environment different from the other groups at the firm.  I enjoy the work, it is challenging, but the work/ life balance gets challenging during certain peak times.  Advancement in this department is close to non existent, the advancement opportunities are either leave the department or leave the firm.  The talent pool in this department is top notch.  It's a great place to get your feet wet, and then advance in another company."
"Grant Thornton",",It's a good place if you want to be an expert in accounting. Sometimes expectations are so high even you do not know how the job will be done, they will blame you for it."
"Grant Thornton",",As Audit Associate for Grant Thornton our work environment changed on a semi-regular basis. Working at client sites allowed us to directly collaborate with staff and exercise communication skills. My work was directly supervised by a senior associate, however, tracking and recording my progress was entirely my responsibility. This final step taught me how to be thorough in my written communication. "
"Grant Thornton",",  Management accessibility was one of the greatest tools to have as an associate. Learning a new skill involves asking a lot of questions, and my superiors never seemed to tire of training. Working as a close team we developed strong interpersonal skills and became a unit working as one."
"Grant Thornton",",The company overhired its interns. it had to lay off staff to get the new people get into the job. it needs to think twice before it hires so many people."
"Grant Thornton",",The work environment while not travelling was not productive.  There was no cubicles to use for privacy. Excellent co-workers at the office and on the road."
"Grant Thornton",",Only for young people fresh out of college with no children or outside responsibilities. If this does not describe you, do not apply."
"Grant Thornton",",GT is a good company to work for if you want to work in small clients. If you want a more challenging job then join one of the big four."

"Thomson Reuters",",I have been associated with TR since last 5 years and the Business process and the system complexities have made me learn the best processes in the industry."
"Thomson Reuters",",Great place to work.  Learned how to file different reports for multiple states taxes, and IRS forms.  The best part of the job was all the different functions within the tax department."
"Thomson Reuters",",The work environment is supportive, but you are overloaded with work.  It is expected you stay to get your work completed to avoid getting behind. The work/life balance doesn't seem to be a priority, although you do get plenty of vacation time.  You may have to work on days off to catch up on work."
"Thomson Reuters",",It is a lax environment, but it can get stressful with the expectations and upset clients.  I do like the recognition and appreciation because management knows it is a hard job."
"Thomson Reuters",",I don't like all of the junk food everywhere. It doesn't seem like health is much of the culture or priority."
"Thomson Reuters",",An excellent place to work. I wanted to work more in my field of study, that's why I changed careers. Wonderful benefits, opportunities, job environment, and experience."
"Thomson Reuters",",With Tax Software, the person entering an amount on a Line number has to know how that line will calculate the amount they entered. The customers are NOT trained on the software because their company will not take the time out to train them. This puts more pressure on the Product support rep to explain to the client how a line calculates when it should already be understood (This is something that should be done in the software itself but it is not). Therefore, a 10 minute call will be last for 30-45 minutes because the product support rep has to explain to the client how the line calculates - this is in addition to the actual problem that the customer called about.  During busy season, the same customers call 4-6 times a day. This could easily be remedied if there was an icon next to each line that the client could click on and it would explain how the line functions but because the software is outdated, this cannot be done."
"Thomson Reuters",",Over the last 2 - 3 years Thomson has been eliminating staff positions.  "

"Thomson Reuters",",The quality of this company has drastically gone down over the years.  ""Too Big to Fail"" type of company as nothing gets done in a reasonable time and the quality has gone way down."
"Thomson Reuters",",Unfortunately, although this job paid well, the company was unorganized.  The new employees weren't given a logon ID for about the first month.  We had to read about the company and the procedures the entire first month.  This was hard to understand not knowing anything about the job."
"Thomson Reuters",",The management in my department was very family oriented and very fair.  Very willing to work with you on any level needed. My department was ""one big family""."
"Thomson Reuters",",There are companies that care about their employees. This one used to, now it's all about the money. It started 2 years ago with major layoffs, then the conversion of outsourcing began. Employees were either let go, or converted to contractors. Part-time contractors were limited to 35 hours a week, with no vacation or benefits. Those who were fortunate enough to be full-time contractors found their pay reduced, and their heath benefits go up 35%. Would not recommend this company to my worse enemy!"

You get the training needed to do what you are assigned and management is mostly made of people who did the work they manage so they know what it is like to be out there working and are helpful when needed.

Management was incredible never had worry about bosses breathing down your neck unless something is terrible wrong which never happened and raises were always on time.

"Net ESolutions Corporation (NETE)",",- The management is highly unorganized and has no flexibility whatsoever. "
"Net ESolutions Corporation (NETE)",",- They ""ask"" you to come on weekends to help out with work. It is not ""required"" but everyone is worried that it is not a ""good look."" "
"Net ESolutions Corporation (NETE)",",- Stingy and greedy. They only care about making more money as a company and gives no attention to their employees. HR is supposed to be in charge of a lot of these things, but turn-over rate just within HR is crazy. Employees don't know the HR people and HR people don't take the time to know the employees. So, it's very awkward and unproductive."
"Net ESolutions Corporation (NETE)",",- No structure/philosophy/corporate value. Anything and everything that will bring in money, they will do. They don't care about your values/work-life balance."
"Net ESolutions Corporation (NETE)",",- No structured performance review system. This may be good for some people, but for those who are rockstars, there is no motivation. Apparently you have to work your butt off to just get CEO's attention and then you will get promoted...after years."

"Genentech",",Excellent company. GNE provides an ideal work atmosphere, has state of the art facilities, stellar coworkers, & sets you up for success."
"Genentech",",I would only recommend working here if you have no job and are desperate. The whole time through the contact you are expendable and they will get rid of you right away. Contract based so you get no benefits. Free lunches here and there is cool. Job is tedious"
"Genentech",",Has a greater reputation than what it is cut out out to be, too much work place politics. Sales Force software is NOT USER FRIENDLY."

"Genentech",",My experience at Genentech is from before they were purchased by Roche, so things have changed. But back then biotech was the start-up industry and a business darling. Many of the innovations in workplace culture were coming through the high-stress/ high-reward world of recombinant technology: liberal HR policies, nice benefits, good compensation, stock options, subsidized food and plush environment. The people were the best part, stressed but happy science geeks."
"Genentech",",As with any large and growing business the level of change created tension in the workplace, whether it was changes in organizational charts or new buildings replacing your favorite parking lots. Of course the other side of that coin was the ability to take your experience from one area of the company to others both inside and outside your field."

At times management can be very extreme which can be hard to adjust to at first. The hardest part of the job is digesting different behaviors which can be eye opening. The most enjoyable is for the most it is a stress free environment which allows full production from the employee."
"The Aerospace Corporation",",I have been at Aerospace a little over a year now. I really like my position and the job culture.

"The Aerospace Corporation",",Compared to most corporations, a great place to work. The only negative about it for me was the nature of the work. The majority of their work is defense related, and they naturally have to be compatible with the Department of Defense culture. Unfortunately, the DoD has systemic problems that goes back a long way. That is why I retired early."

"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia",",If you enjoy being over worked and under paid this is the place for you. Management treats you as if you are only a number and could not care less about you. They love enforcing their own rules, even though the hospital has difference rules. They use fear tactics to scare their employees into doing things. There is no way to advance as they provide no education. And of course they have their favorites who get away with anything. But the workload is absolutely impossible. And they are constantly covering up serious issues. "
"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia",",As far as coworkers go, they are,  for most part great to work with."
"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia",",A typical day at work is challenging and fun to learn new things on a daily basis. I learn from different employers, patients, and mostly about myself. Learning new concepts is difficult at first. However, once practiced and applied several time, new concepts are mastered and I am eager to learn more. Working at the Children's Hospital  of Philadelphia was well managed by the cardiac rehabilitation supervisor. He ensures everyone's schedule is stable and able to work to the best of all employees ability. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is a diverse workplace with a high magnitude of experience in all areas of concentration. The most difficult part about the job is not knowing what could possible happen with a patient with congenital heart disease.  The most enjoyable part about working at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia  is working with families and supporting them throughout their journey."

"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia",",CHOP is the best of the best. Here you are challenged to work with the sickest of children, but are comforted by the knowledge that they are being cared for by the best physicians and medical team.

"SAS Institute","Overall pretty good company, but sales organization is poor. Sales management is and overall company goals are not aligned."
"SAS Institute",",If you are in to Finance/IT and stability, this is the place for you as a very stable company. Stability is the downside as this proves to  create a not very fast paced work environment and little sense of being fast paced."

"SAS Institute",",SAS Institute is a great place to work. It caters to the individuals who are mid-career and is a great place to finish off a career."
"SAS Institute",",SAS is a great place to work. It is consistently ranked in the top ten best place to work. SAS offers fantastic benefits and amenities, such as having your own office, an on campus day care, several cafeterias and more.

"SAS Institute",",OK for fresh graduates. May not be suitable for experienced professionals looking for challenge and growth. Does not welcome professional views and lacks leadership that you would typically see in a professionally managed Fortune 100 corporation."
"SAS Institute",",I thoroughly enjoyed my 17 years at SAS.  I took an early retirement to spend more time with my teenage kids and my disabled veteran husband.  I was married and financially secure so it seemed like the right thing to do.  It worked well until my kids left home and my husband did too.  I have now returned to the working world and I am looking for a job that I love to do."
"SAS Institute",",Great company to work for - CEO really does care about his employees."
"SAS Institute",",Leadership looks for ways to adapt and advance the company."
"SAS Institute",",I'll take good management over live piano music in the cafeteria. Managers are incompetent to destructive--and are tolerated by upper  management. And there is no hope of advancement or professional development. A culture of fear and frustration exists. Be sure to negotiate an adequate salary and title coming in. They think their M&Ms, underfunded gym, and conveniences make up for their broken corporate culture and below-average salaries."
"SAS Institute",",The company itself is a great place to work.  Benefits are excellent.  Management needs to be more professional, more encouraging and willing to mentor and provide for paths to job improvement."

"SAS Institute",",Working at SAS is THE best! There is a reason why people never leave. The pay is great, the fitness facilities are wonderful as well as the trainers knowledgeable, and all the amenities are fantastic. You just can't beat it! My managers are all very professional, respectable, and encouraging. I only hope to become full-time one day as the availability does not come about often!"
"SAS Institute",",tough managers, good coworkers, aging facilities, good atmosphere, tough evaluations, tough job, travelling tough"
"SAS Institute",",It's a good thing that most employees are in it for the long haul, because they learn no marketable skills at SAS. That is, the tools are non-standard and cumbersome to the point of absurdity, leading to job security. Incompetent, unsupportive managers make the work environment unpleasant and needlessly tedious; there's a culture of fear. Ideas for improvement are given lip service by management, year after year, although employees clearly ask for change. Professional development does not exist, and advancement is a popularity contest not based on merit. Work/life balance depends on the whims of your manager, so it's easy to be unlucky. Unfair hiring, pay, and bonus practices foster resentment. In short, there's something wrong with a work environment that requires years to become productive and which results in low morale."

"PRA Health Sciences",",Although PRA as a whole is a great company to work for.. The site i was located at seemed to be overlooked. The people who are doing the every day work need to be heard. That being said, i would always consider returning, once this site was up and running in a more efficient manner. Data integrity and patient safety must come first... And i believe they are trying to find there way back to this, it will just take time."

The roles at PRA are both challenging and rewarding.  There is strong teamwork within my team as well as cross-functionally.  Joining PRA is like joining a family!"
"PRA Health Sciences",",Limited advancement opportunities once you realize you've been given empty promises of a ladder. PRA hires external candidates often and there are not any internal development programs, so you have to be okay with status quo long-term movement and fighting for your individual success to stand apart from a group."

"PRA Health Sciences",",A typical day at work was long, repetitive and hard. Very stressful and you had to be very hard on yourself and over work yourself to meet the deadlines."
"PRA Health Sciences",",I stayed for the benefits. Management wasn't always clear why some people were given promotions and others weren't. Some leads/managers had been there a long time and didn't want to disturb the status quo. Organization was a bit lacking in some areas...there were mismanagements of time allocations, with some people having a lot of work and others having too little work. They needed more help/organizational system of training new hires. I realized too late that if you want something done right you should do it yourself...and that the people who have the attitudes to be leaders aren't always the ones who should be leading, for whatever reason - in this case, disorganization.Coworkers were great, for the most part. Job was pretty straightforward, though they had too much work for the number of people hired."

Although the management style is different that what I am used or have experienced I don't dis agree with it and it is warranted."
"PRA Health Sciences",",some departments may be bad to work for. Growing pains due to RPS acquisition and due to general growth. Directors (at least in my area) do not know the day to day work and therefore make wrong decisions, without listening to managers. Too much politics. Other than that, good associates, good benefits."
"PRA Health Sciences",",For the person who gave PRA 5 stars, How much did you get paid?? You either just started or you are definitely brown nosing...EVERYONE from Management DIVISION need to be fired! Too many people want to PLAY BOSS and BE BOSS and some of them can't even do the job they were hired to do. Someone in corporate really need to investigate and take a good look at what your paying for.."
"General Motors","A typical day at work was to perform all accounting functions. Being able to multitask in a fast paced environment was required. Interfacing daily with sales associates from several auto dealerships was required in order to discount retail and direct leasing contracts."
"General Motors",",General Motors was the best employer that I have worked for.  I led a team of 58 quality inspectors for the Moraine Assembly Plant. We built sport utility vehicles.  The job was to identify, find a fix, and preventive measures to prevent it from happening again.  I enjoyed the challenge, it was my favorite part of the job."
"General Motors",",everyday was never the same. going into work you never knew what job you would be doing until you checked in with the foreman at the beginning of your shift. i learned a variety of different jobs. some of which included- how to build door latches, install front door and back door check links, back door regulators, front door wire harnesses, front door mirrors, etc. management was never really the same. i was very fortunate to work with very reasonable and great guys. there was never really any culture that i saw."

"General Motors",",General Motors was a wonderful job. I loved the fast pace atmosphere. I learned how important the quality of your work can effect the overall product as a whole. I felt as though management could have done better with communication. The hardest part of the job for me was getting in the rhythm of the jobs and switching jobs so frequently. I absolutely loved staying active and being hands on and having the opportunity to drive forklifts and tuggers,"
"General Motors",",I loved working at my favorite company . I gained valuable experience by working in the department and even though I was not an engineer , I was prepared to become a leader even before I was aware of my own potential. I would definitely recommend students, employers, potential employees to check this company out and give them a chance, it will change your life for the better."
"General Motors",",Every day is a learning experience dealing with people and equipment issues to maintain production requirement. Having supportive leadership is a plus in maintaining a favorable workplace."

"General Motors",",Like d working at General Motors. Great benefits and retirement. Learned many components of factory work. Friendly people and got along with all who I worked with. Met and made many lasting friendships while there."
"General Motors",",I worked here for over a year, and was laid off. There were no opportunities to be hired full-time, only to work as a temporary worker. There is no advancement based on skill or job performance, only seniority. You don't receive the discounts, the pay, profit sharing, or the benefits you always hear GM Workers get, however the pay is great considering the type of work you do. Would work here again if they decide to actually hire, rather than employ temps for a few months."
"General Motors",",The downfall of the place is management they really sucks especially if they are new trying to hard to prove they are worthy and nothing stays the same its always switching up"
"General Motors",",Great job, Great pay, Great union. Auto industry is not always stable. Some of the work is heavy and repetitious. The union is pretty strong and the solidarity between brothers and sisters is great."

"State Street",",Although I only participated in State Street for a summer, I left with many skills. Everyday I had a new assignment and by the end of my shift I had to have my work done.

"State Street",",Culture of fear. Top performers are constantly laid off. People are so overworked that there is no time to foster healthy relationships with colleagues."

"Ipsos",",Culture isn't as great as one would hope, lack of communication across the company. Management is great though, which is helpful.There needs to be a better way of getting things done here."
"Ipsos",",No work life balance with no clear direction from upper management. "
"Ipsos",",New hires were not prepared for the work required of them to perform their duties.  Workload was pushed off to senior people which were already overloaded resulting in poor production."
"Ipsos",",There are a lot of talented people working at the company. Many are stuck in their position because the opportunity to grow is a struggle. The company is very catty and title driven. Many of the  departments are like high school. The separation between friendships and best business practices are not clearly defined."
"Ipsos",",Man of the people are friendly however there those that impossible to work with because of their attitudes."
"Ipsos",",Great first company to work for as you learn very much. Senior people generally very helpful and want to teach you. Endless possibilites if you put in time and effort into the work."
"Ipsos",",Through a combination of hubris, lack of vision, and total ineptitude, this once respected company is now the laughing stock of the industry.  "
"Ipsos",",The culture is absolutely toxic and employee morale is at an all-time low.  Virtually all of the good talent have jumped ship, or are in the process of doing so.  Incompetents stay on, thanks to their connections, while great talents are let go.  Look at the number of open head counts--there's a reason the company can't fill these roles!"
"Ipsos",",Clients are aware of this as well, which makes it even harder for Ipsos.   The revolving door of management has created utter confusion among top clients.  From ""Game Changers,"" to ""Connect,"" to ""Madtech,"" to ""BrandX,"" nobody is quite sure who is doing what.  The only certainty is that the buffoons at the helm seem to think that success will be secured by bringing on more overpriced and incompetent cronies and goons."
"Ipsos",",Think long and hard before accepting an offer here--it's a miserable, miserable place."
"Ipsos",",Legal department was in flexible. Very militant structure. No flexibility with hours. Long hours and hardly and guidance from supervisors. Little to no communication amongst the unit."
"Ipsos",",Hours are not guaranteed, supervisors play favorites, no benefits offered, no overtime allowed, projects are terrible, you are not told of holidays off until 3 days prior, no guaranteed raises, not enough breaks given."
"Ipsos",",No Happy medium.  Extremely slow and no work at times.  When busy they beg for hours.  Supervisors are demoted to lower positions when slow and have limited hours as well.  You are viewed as a number not an employee.  No recognition or rewards, it all about how much they can make.  I enjoy my job when I get to do it."
"Ipsos",",There are a lot of initiatives but sometimes it is hard to get things done.  If you get connected to the correct people, there is a lot to learn.  It's a large global company with many different opportunities.  Work-life balance is definitely a challenge even with work-at-home opportunities."
"Ipsos",",One of the best places iv'e worked just no hours really available.I like the fact that they give you plenty of independence and we can also listen to headphones while we work. overall, working here is great!"

"Ipsos",",I learned the methodology of research and implanting field work studies , sample design , the principle of supervision and quality control of the operation."
"Ipsos",",Ipsos is a good company to work for. The benefits are great, 3 weeks vacation for all full time employees. 50% 401k match for the first 3%."
"Ipsos",",Descent company. HR was great most of the time especially when personal situations occurred. Project manager never really talked to employees unless they were hire ups. Some supervisors had power trips. Work become tideous and repetitive. Good for someone looking for easy work or is in school. Shouldn't have stayed as long as i did because now i have no desire to ever work for a call center company again."
"Ipsos",",Fast paced environment, in Market Research. Dedicated to helping clients with their business needs."
"Ipsos",",It was an honor for me to work with great people and to learn from them. It was great to learn about healthcare industries in the US and to build a strong relationship with Ipsos Russia. Being a liaison between two countries with different mentalities and work style, has taught me a lot about people and business. Presenting at HIV World Conference in Washington D.C. in 2012 was definitely a highlight of my time in Ipsos and it was an incredible experience."
"Ipsos",",Ipsos is a great place to learn and work with team members. The job work/life balance is tough to find consistently."
"Ipsos",",This company was very unorganized from the start. I was supposed to work on election night as an election agent. I completed all training and the only thing left was the rehearsal, which was basically submit data into an app. My 2 year old daughter got very ill and I could not submit the data at the exact time of rehearsal. I was emailed by a number of people saying I could submit anytime. No big deal. I submitted all the data and contacted my regional coordinator who informed me that I was being replaced because I didn't attend the rehearsal after others told me it was fine. "
"Ipsos",", A day later another person from the ""company"" called and said the regional coordinator had no authority to hire or fire anyone and for me not to worry. I was contacted later by another person who said as long as I completed everything I was fine. The next morning I received an email from same person saying I was replaced. I have no idea why because I completed all training and was told I was fine."

The only thing I really did not like was the fact that growth opportunities took a while.  I have a lot of experience in security but needed to be patient in order to grow in the company."
"NVIDIA",",Working is not clearly directed. Direction is being changed every moment. Management has no enough experience to work on the system product and handing the people who from various cultures previously."
"NVIDIA",",Nvidia was a great company to work with. Employees are smart and creative thinker. Company takes care of its employees.You would learn a lot of new technologies here."
"NVIDIA",",Nvidia is one of the best company. I learned lot from my team. People are very cooperative. Sometimes, work load was not manageable but over all I rate 5 out of 5."
"NVIDIA",",Great co-workers, fun, challenging innovative products.  Upper management tends to have unrealistic schedule expectations that leads to long hours, stress and low morale."
"NVIDIA",",Every GPU cycle presents new challenges, features and work. Nvidia constantly pushes the envelopes in all aspects and leads the industry with new technologies."
"NVIDIA",",Most of the time, I am working with multiple teams to bring new chips and features to market. I am constantly learning and am supported by capable leaders and peers."
"NVIDIA",",Constantly working on new features and different teams across the world means I'm working around the clock. Work/life balance is reasonable but at times can be quite challenging over long periods of time. "
"NVIDIA",",Management has good vision and direction. CEO is always thinking years in advance and pivots the company when beneficial to the future. Nvidia is constantly pushing gross margins which can be felt at the engineering level. Intent is good but can be overly restrictive at times (e.g.: lab equipment, computer purchases, etc)."
"NVIDIA",",Was very informative to learn about how conferences work from outside in. Worked from checkin to after party and concluded with take down of the event. Was a great learning experience working along side the Events team at Nvidia."
"NVIDIA",",it is good company and really friendly environment to work with. My daily responsibilities are debugging, troubleshoot and fixing all the RMA devices. Sometime i have to work with software engineer in flashing and making sure the devices have a good and functioning image. I have enjoy and love to work for this company."
"NVIDIA",",As with many big corporations, there's a big game being played on employees..here it was primarily using West Valley Staffing, the in house staffing agency to lure people in with potential jobs at a growing co/dept but in fact, the department has NO requisition/authority to make this contractor a permanent employee, and NO incentive to, because WV pays below market, with almost no benefits, no sick time, no holiday pay unless you've been there 6 mos, etc. Good luck going through years of being underpaid, below market, for the ""hopes"" of becoming a permanent employee.  (stories of people being contractors for 2-5 years abound)"
"NVIDIA",",And the other game is people working cross functionally, with reporting/performance/pay managed by one manager, but actual work and projects with multiple managers who don't communicate, so no one really knows everything you're being asked to do, or should be paid to do."
"NVIDIA",",One thing to remember before starting a job at NVIDIA that is, you are responsible for your work. Super Cool people and super smart minds. Your every word has weight. So when you say something to management or peers you better get it done because your word stands for your commitment. You will get all the help you need but you gotta ask for it. Nobody is going to do spoon feeding for you. The best part about it is you will learn a lot in the process and you feel confident. That's my best take away from NVIDIA."
"NVIDIA",",fair place to work, the culture is not so good in my team, but some team is better, pretty much depend on the style of the manager"
"NVIDIA",",Management is off hand which provides personal growth "
"NVIDIA",",There is a lot of room for creativity. Work here to work in a environment that promotes growth."
"NVIDIA",",Nvidia is a great company to work for.   It is well known for GPU products using in gaming and High Performance Computing.  It is growing in Visual Computing  and Virtual Reality"
"NVIDIA",",This was a volunteer experience in which I setup monitors, booths, posters, and tables for the GTC conference. In addition I help setup lan cables in each room to provide everyone with a connection to the internet. This is one of the most memorable and enjoyable volunteer work I have ever done. Talking to the executives during the conference and learning about IT and how important it is before a day of a big event opens my eyes about the men and women of the IT industry."
"NVIDIA",",The company is run by  business savvy engineers which is quite rare for a company of this size.  The primary focus in the mobile products is always on delivery of a quality product."
"NVIDIA",",The CEO has demonstrated the ability to make strategic investments without bending to shareholder fickleness.  Sometimes these investments work out, other times they do not.  This is extremely important for companies long term health."
"NVIDIA",",The company focuses hiring on top talent across the industry.  This results in a diverse workforce that may be overwhelmed but is generally quite technically competent."
"NVIDIA",",This company has no regard for you or your family.  As long as you perform you will be OK...but if you are not a culture fit.  Good bye.    It is micromanaged by a megalomanic.  And frankly there is not much upside in their product line.  Intel will eventually eat their lunch."
"NVIDIA",",highly talented people"
"NVIDIA",",good management"
"NVIDIA",",good base package"
"NVIDIA",",co-workers support is very good"
"NVIDIA",",good work-life balance"
"NVIDIA",",Company always tries to come up with good products and has courage to enter new markets."
"NVIDIA",",Nvidia is a great place to work, but it's lacking when it comes to having a conducive environment for younger or start-upy kinds of employees. It's a very classic style of doing business, and many of the middle people (who've been there for less than 10 years) will tell you that you could do worse in many places, but you could also easily do a lot better."
"NVIDIA",",Management is pretty hands off, certain ones will micromanage, but in general the structure of power is accessible from the lower rungs. The hardest part of my position was being one of the very few people who represented the target market/audience, and so many of the people making these products wouldn't ever consume them, and that dissonance was aggravating to be around."
"OUTFRONT media","Changing signs in the NYC subway system. Days were spent sorting through work, standing on train platforms, carrying over 50 lbs of advertisements. Most of the time spent on my feet. My supervisor was a nice guy, occasionally came around to check up on workers. The summers can be brutally hot; dirty atmosphere. I enjoyed working in the train yards and above ground stations. I had many different co-workers throughout the years but mostly solo work. Nice people, no complaints."
"OUTFRONT media",",its  hard work with good benefits. the people are nice. the pay is ok "
"OUTFRONT media",",they give you personal days. you can dress comfy on Fridays. you get out early be for holidays"
"OUTFRONT media",",called on many business for the company.  Did a very good job, Outfront bought CBS outdoor 6 months after I started and replaced our General manager."
"OUTFRONT media",",Outfront Media is a nice place to work. They encourage work place interactions. There are chances to advance. "
"OUTFRONT media",",Typical day at work depends on the department you work in. Sitting at a computer using 2 screens."
"OUTFRONT media",",I worked for CBS Outdoor (now Outfront Media) for 25 years.  Being born and raised in New York City I was knowledgeable about the subway system and commuter rail system.  This knowledge proved valuable as I was able to help optimize the sales of the advertising space on both."
"OUTFRONT media",",I worked for Outfront (formerly CBS Outdoor) for 25 years.  I wouldn't call it work because I LOVED every minute of it.  I loved the industry I was in and the people I worked with."
"OUTFRONT media",",There is no like work balance.  You were expected to be in the office at 8:30 then they will check again at 5:30.  You are also expected to attend many company/client events on nights and weekends."
"OUTFRONT media",",The company went through  5 name changes during my employment.  The last two years -   what is now called Outfront Media the management and the structure of the company and the ""New Direction"" was what perpetrated my departure."
"OUTFRONT media",",Working at Outfront Media was a positive experience in my life, from the skill set I obtained and quality work I was able to achieve in my time there."
"OUTFRONT media",",Co-Workers were diverse in all aspects but most people kept to themselves."
"OUTFRONT media",",Day at work would consist of researching issues with invoices that didn't match contracts, working with billing and sales to obtain revised contracts, calling agencies regarding delinquent and past due invoices, creating detailed and summary excel agings for management and clients."
"OUTFRONT media",",If you get a decent account list and keep in constant contact with your clients and prospects, you will be alright. There are some major barriers to making a really good living that are mostly beyond your control."
"OUTFRONT media",",I worked for this company for less than a year and with as many changes within the company as you can imagine put a lot of stress within the office. If you don't mind the Office Manager talking behind your back or lying to your face go for it. I was always walking on egg shells while working for this company."
"OUTFRONT media",",High paced, must be able to learn quickly, has its own culture, family-like environment, must show continuous effort to move up"
"OUTFRONT media",",Fun place to work.  Each day offered new learning experiences.  Enjoyed with overseas contacts. Coworkers were fun!  Great management too!"
"OUTFRONT media",",Great coworkers- Too much pressure from management to reach their unreachable goals. Sales people need more support from marketing and consistent recognition for their efforts."
"OUTFRONT media",",Preparing proposal and dealing with artwork to make sure it's as the customer wants it. Meeting deadlines of get the outdoor advertising out and in place.  Coworkers worked together to get the job done, the hardest part of the job was mapping."
"OUTFRONT media",",Enjoyed the people I worked with."
"OUTFRONT media",",Even though the company is starting fresh with new independence and brands, no one knows what their doing and no one respects their job titles. "
"OUTFRONT media",",Management sells dreams like they sell their ads."
"OUTFRONT media",",Management and employees work well together, hand in hand, to create an enjoyable environment with dedicated hard workers."
"OUTFRONT media",",Great media company and great people. Highly motivated staff and highly qualified accounting and finance team. Learnt a lot on the job."
"OUTFRONT media",",Great managers! Great working environment wonder work life balance. The benefits are good!! Very enjoyable to work with too bad the market crashed and they pulled back advertising $$ or I would still be there!"
"OUTFRONT media",",Implement HR and general company policies, enforce disciplinary actions, coordinate employee vacations, handle employee personnel files, prepare legal memos for internal communications, manage employee drug tests and ex-employee COBRA notifications.

Participate in the negotiation of tax closing agreements (Sales & Use Tax and Volume of Business Declarations)."
"OUTFRONT media",",I really enjoyed the autonomy and independence that I worked in. I learned a lot and I felt like I was growing. I interacted with a lot of the customers and I felt that I was helping them."
"CBRE","Fast pace work environment"
"CBRE",",Great collegues"
"CBRE",",Productive workplace"
"CBRE",",CBRE has invested a lot of effort in improving the lives of their employees.  Unfortunately, it is an uphill battle given the nature of their business.  Kudos to the CEO for realizing that the non-brokers help drive the organization, too, and are important to the organization's success."
"CBRE",",CBRE was a great company to work for.  HR was a bit detached from employee but all other areas of this company proved to be top notch,"
"CBRE",",I am very happy working for CBRE. The company is well organized and constantly growing. CBRE provides a challenging and team type work environment for their employees."
"CBRE",",Lots to learn at CBRE, an exceptional workplace environment where you can develop the education and skills needed for the land management, property leasing and development markets."
"CBRE",",This is an absolutely awful place to work. They only care about making as much money as possible and don't care about their employees at all. They give everyone the same training no matter their position, which is useless because accounting training does you absolutely no good if you work in IT. The culture is similar to that of a high school. People will be artificially nice to you in front of others, but are awful to you when you are alone. If you are not one of the ""popular crowd"", then you can forget about ever advancing in the company no matter how hard you work. The management does not care about you (unless you are one of the ""popular crowd"") and will demean you and make you question your self-worth. A typical day at work consisted of constantly having managers and other people complain about all of their problems and when you solved their problems, telling you that it wasn't the solution they wanted.  Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this company. Working here will cost your your happiness and sanity."
"CBRE",",No real thrills or personality. Everyone comes to work outs their heads down and barely socialize. If you are an introvert this may still be a little too dead for you but they pay okay and it's stable"
"CBRE",",I am happy at CBRE. There is room for advancement and people are supportive. Sometimes it gets very busy so its hard to balance work and life, but bosses seem understanding and want you to be happy."
"CBRE",",I have enjoyed my 6 year experience of working at CBRE. They have treated me very good. Great benefits and great values. Management backed me and allowed me to excel at my job."
"CBRE",",The company offers excellent pay and benefits.  However, the job can be very stressful and tedious.  Like any job, the stress level is greatly impacted by your supervisor.  I have had 3 different managers at this company - one was helpful and empathetic with vast knowledge, one was aloof and gave little/no guidance, but was kind, and the other was a micro-manager with little compassion who saw all things in black and white.  My stress level and quality of professional life was best when I had a supervisor who tried to understand me and offered assistance when I felt overwhelmed.  The worst situation was feeling micro-managed when I am such a hard worker and do not need to be babysat."
"CBRE",",- Entrepreneurial Corporate Culture"
"CBRE",",- Very hard working dedicated employees"
"CBRE",", -Strategic forward thinking Executive Leadership Team"
"CBRE",",I worked as a temp on a special GSA contract. Work was primarily administrative, little to no training, great company culture."
"CBRE",",The place is nice to work at. Great atmosphere. but the CBRE Management Staff is lacking in skill.I would not recommend anyone wanting to work with these 3 individuals. Some other so called management Staff will probably be better inclined to not have favoritism."
"CBRE",",Overall good business culture, but management not receptive to rank-and-file needs or manpower required to properly serve clients."
"CBRE",",Growing very large. Perhaps too large."
"CBRE",",Great people to work with in Orlando. "
"CBRE",",Great resources and top notch platform. "
"CBRE",",We provide Best in Class service."
"CBRE",",Over all not a bad job , a lot of travel time and was misled on duties and at the time they where having problems getting the repair parts to me and causing a back log of work orders and return trips to remote job sites which wasted time."
"CBRE",",CBRE has many different lines of business and working in shared services provides a glimpse into the various aspects of CBRE's business.  Working in shared services can be quite demanding but also rewarding when completing tasks that can benefit the entire US workforce."
"CBRE",",Hard working and demanding environment with tight deadlines. However, department staff are great to work with. CBRE provides multiple opportunities for training and industry education and hosts entertaining, quarterly networking opportunities for management teams and vendors to get to know each other."
"CBRE",",The best part of the job are the people you work with and getting to know the service providers that help you with your properties."
"CBRE",",The hardest part of the job is not having enough hours in the day to complete tasks, and having insufficient admin support on many occasions. It takes a long time for anyone to promote."
"CBRE",",CBRE is decent organization to work for and employees are the key to the success. Senior Management in Real Estate Division is only interested in profit on service contracts. Support at many levels is indifferent to resource needs and are not readily available to support"
"CBRE",",A very professional and profitable company.  High standards and policies and procedures led to job satisfaction.  Great people and a warm culture filled with respect and appreciation for hard work."
"CBRE",",Great atmosphere, with respectable colleagues. Always willing to help and further extend your education and knowledge of any field."
"Prime Therapeutics","The training was very extensive which made it easy to learn and catch on. Could have done better job following up with newer employees with the status of  their job performance."
"Prime Therapeutics",",A good place to work. I would recommend Prime Therapeutics to others as they have a good life/work balance.  Management is very open to hearing the individual."
"Prime Therapeutics",",I spent my years at Prime Therapeutics in the Inventory department.I was given projects and that required use of my experience in Purchasing and Inventory. I learned every day and expanded my knowledge of  project management as well as maintaining different system types over the years.The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to be turned loose on a project, complete the project and see results after completion."
"Prime Therapeutics",",I really enjoyed at Prime Therapeutics.  I learned to work in a fast-paced environment with expert attention to detail and accuracy.  I worked for two great supervisors and very nice co-workers."
"Prime Therapeutics",",Work at prime was a really good experience for me. The daily flow of work had a steady pace, the on the job training was very helpful especially the processing of multiple software. The was I worked with were very understanding and universal. The most useful parts of the days were the team meetings, they gave everyone an opportunity to share ideas on ways to help others improve."
"Prime Therapeutics",",I learned a lot about Medicare Part D and drug coverage related to insurance. The company itself requires a lot of the temp employees and the training sessions are short, so you don't learn all you need to know before going live."
"Prime Therapeutics",",The pay and benefits are great but there is way too much overtime. The work is monotonous and not very challenging.  Not a lot of opportunity for projects or variety of tasks."
"Prime Therapeutics",",People are respectful and there is room for growth if you work hard. I don't love how much they rely on contract work and I feel like there are a lot of growing pains right now. Mostly, its very good."
"Prime Therapeutics",",Prime Therapeutics made work life balance very easy. Management was always available to speak with whenever I had any question or concerns."
"Prime Therapeutics",",Prime the company has a whole is great. But in the Orlando office it's not about your work ethics or performance it's about who you know and who likes you. The management in the Orlando office is horrible! They take positions away without giving you a notice and reason onto why. You can be the hardest most dedicated worker and it will go unnoticed if your not apart of their like squad. If Prime cleans house from the top down this would be the ideal company. The benefits is great, they do a lot with the employees as far as activities. But they also work you like a dog the phones never stop ringing. Orlando Management walks around with walkie talkies and treat you like a child. Their leads never want to take an escalated call. If your a PCC but another dept. screws up you will take the fall. I think for this company to continue to grow in Orlando they need to hire passionate management staff."
"Prime Therapeutics",",They were very under staffed int eh department I worked at and I would work through my lunch with ultimately was my down fall.  I had wonderful team members.  Management changed a lot and didnt really offer a lot of support"
"Prime Therapeutics",",Great training from day 1.  Good place to work independently and through teamwork.  Always positive solutions throughout every each working method daily."
"Prime Therapeutics",",Prime is a good company to work. Prime is a growins PBM company in Minnesota. Helping people feel better and live well extends beyond managing pharmacy benefits. Through Prime’s corporate giving program, PrimeCares, employees can give back to one of our five charity partners by volunteering, participating in local events or donating."
"Prime Therapeutics",",Benefits are really good. Bonuses every quarter. Open door policy. Very helpful with making things work. Fun work environment, good coworkers. Easy to move up to other positions. Pay raise every year."
"Prime Therapeutics",",Good company with good benefits.  Wonderful coworkers!  The company is growing at fast pace, as well as any PBM in the current market."
"Prime Therapeutics",",Work/life balance is good here. The management is friendly. There are monthly meetings about progress and positive reinforcement."
"Prime Therapeutics",",Prime was a great place to work.  Prime has afforded the ability to enhance my skill set and utilize those skills in a different capacity and role in the future."
"Prime Therapeutics",",Long hours, a lot of OT, if unable to do OT you must make it up."
"Prime Therapeutics",",Good benefits, good pay, yearly bonuses."
"Prime Therapeutics",",Constant change."
"Prime Therapeutics",",A lot of micromanaging"
"Prime Therapeutics",",Employees allowed to be creative.  EPMO  Management was very supportive of the Project Managers - providing guidance and training in all areas of project management practice.  The management team helped PMs navigate through rough times where different strong personalities were involved."
"Prime Therapeutics",",great work environment. great team of peaople. great salary. open door policy. equal opportunity employers.flexible schedules and opportunity to grow within the company"
"Prime Therapeutics",",Prime Therapeutics was a great place to work. It had please work environment and company give high important to work life balance, Management is very approachable and are easy to work with."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory","As a Scientific Data Analyst my job was to report on detailed information downloaded from the Topex sattlite after each rotation."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",  Due to security reason I can not go into any further detail concerning my detail work other than to say it was working with a sattlite and reporting on information from that sattlite in a Real Time environment."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",    I performed backups and recoveries for the multi sattlite workstations environment.  I also performed shutdowns and startups."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",  I helped troubleshoot printer and copiers hardware problems."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Work life balance is great, more like a college campus than a corporate business feel. You can make more money at other companies but you cannot beat the overall culture at JPL."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Collaborated directly with various suppliers in making sure the smooth delivery of the manufactured/ purchased products. Some of the products range from machined, sheet metal formed parts and foam packaging assemblies."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",The best company ever to work at and if you can work there, you are a very lucky person."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",You will work with some of the best and brightest ever."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",The training is on-going and your co-workers are very supportive."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",love working here. Training is always new and improved. Personal opinions are taken into account for future training. Everyone is treated with respect"
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",A wonderful workplace to build collaboration with brilliant researchers. A lot of seminars in different fields and resources for training. Nice mentors and colleagues."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",JPL is a great place to work. The people who work there are great. However, there is little opportunity to move up in the company."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",JPL has been around for over 50 years and is well known for being the stewards of our solar system and beyond. They are the people who sent rovers to Mars."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Compensation is competitive to aerospace, raises are small. No equity at all. The cost of benefits go up every year. The retirement benefit is GREAT and makes up a little for both of those shortfalls!"
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",The job security is high. Layoffs rarely happen. It can be difficult to advance as the hierarchy is very manager heavy."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",The work/life balance is difficult. They encourage lots of overtime with little compensation. If you don't work the extra time your balance can be flexible, but your advancement will likely suffer."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",The culture sits between academic, aerospace and entrepreneurial. It can probably be anything you want it to be. Otherwise, JPL is risk adverse."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Interesting and informative work place. research & development was the best part of employment. unique projects made work fun and challenging."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",JPL is a NASA facility in Pasadena, CA. It's like a small city in the mountains with a Bank, ATMs, Restaurants, Stores and transportation to/from parking lot to workstation. Management is not the best but it's ok. The work experience is the best."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Great workplace, enjoyed the challenging work environment. Worked with celebrities of the academic world. Inspired to improve my capabilities to perfection."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Fun & interesting company to work for.  I enjoyed supporting the Safety Department."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",I especially enjoyed working on the different projects.  There is so much to do & see at JPL!"
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Very flexible work hours. Remote from home."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Laid back environment."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Minimal stress."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Very exciting, cutting-edge projects but my group was unorganized."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Very flexible schedule, hard do collaborate or learn from the others. You learn from your progress or mistakes. From human point of view is a very sad place to work! You can not make real friends."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",I have had opportunities to work on various assignments and projects."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Great people and learning experience. I would recommend it for anyone."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Great Place to work. There are a lot of interesting projects being conducted all around you. It is a large laboratory with a lot of possible walking between buildings. The employees are very helpful and wanting to accomplish their goals but there is some red tape and funding issues sometimes that changes peoples plans for projects as well."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",I love this place, you couldn't has for a better job.  There aren't that many places that you can work on outer planet exploration.  This place thrives on people thinking outside the box."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",This place is truly one of the most hyped up, over-rated places to work."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",It is filled with dull, drab, boring people who have perfected ground-hog day both on a daily basis and on a project basis.  "
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Most people are simply here to ride the wave to retirement by working on projects that are almost identical from start to finish.  Each project is a legacy of another and very little innovation (perhaps except for some science based stuff) is accomplished.  "
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Hence, if you truly want your skills to  be obsolete in a few years, work here.  I've lost count how many engineers I've worked with who admit to not being able to do anything else if they leave this place.  They are left with little to no new skills and outside industry is so far ahead in almost every aspect it's sad."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Not to mention the entire culture of the lab has changed.  The place has become very paranoid and corporate.  They have engaged in unscrupulous hiring and firing behaviors and are engaged in some serious lawsuits with individuals over unlawful termination, age discrimination, and security issues.  They are spending millions of tax payer dollars on high priced lawyers so they can save a few dollars and their terrible reputation from the public."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",It's a really poor place to work these days...uninspiring, boring, and the whole ""rocket engineering"" nonsense is just that...nonsense."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",Ever changing environment surrounded by some of the greatest minds in the world, filled with innovation and possibilities."
"Jet Propulsion Laboratory",",I first started working at JPL in 2001 which gave me the opportunity to see a lot of missions over a ten year period."

"Vantiv","fast paced, challenging environment with exceptional support staff // minimal opportunities for advancement within Sales, RM and Business Partner groups"
"Vantiv",",Good company and fun work culture, but compensation is not enough in todays economy. assignment was temporary through temporary service."
"Vantiv",",My everyday task was receiving calls from customer that wanted to pay their credit card or helping them with something wrong with it, and assist with they issue."
"Vantiv",",The different programs used for customer service were easy to learn and work with, however different programs were constantly crashing."
"Vantiv",",The job is remote your provided with all resources need to perform your job.  Full Autonomy granted to make your sales goals.  Management is very understanding to real life issues."
"Vantiv",",This company has a lot of potential and can be a great employer, depending on your department.  Operations and sales feel like a completely different company when considered along with other parts of the organization. I worked on cross-functional teams and I was always amazed at the lattitude that other departments experienced on a daily basis. If you are considering a role in operations, don't do it! You'll find yourself in a silo with no room to advance. Other parts of the company function well as a team; in Operations leadership is only concerned in covering their own tails. There were no development programs or feedback mechanisms. Offering solutions often leads to reprimand.  There's a reason why people frequently leave here.  It's a great place for the culture in the short term, but I don't anticipate retiring from here."
"Vantiv",",Job was not difficult very repetitive and extremely boring but the company did offer great benifits including 401k immediate paid time off and plenty of overtime. The environment itself was laid back and pretty comfortable."
"Vantiv",",Growing company slowly improving and now more full integrated with all the acquisitions in last 5 years; Organized now more like a real Fortune 1000 company"
"Vantiv",",Okay place to work.  Recently changed to an agile work environment so planning your workday is pretty simple.  Co-workers are helpful when time allows."
"Vantiv",",The company overall is good as it's adapting with latest methodologies, organizational structure and up to date tools/softwares through migration often. Throughout Vantiv I had to work in Agile fashion which was both hectic and enjoyable. Had worked in multiple roles, played in highly technical shoes sometimes. Gave workshops and presentations for Vantiv's big clients/customers who are within US that are Banks and Merchants, answered their technical and critical questions."
"Vantiv",",Direct reports lacks industry and basic Payment knowledge. Lots of politics and unproductive behaviors. Think long and hard before entertaining this organization. Management unaccountable for their actions."
"Vantiv",",Great company loves there employees the companie always offering extra was to make money and will reward your good work. Fun clean work environment. Training is amazing so you will never feel lost and will always have a great team to help with any questions are concerns."
"Vantiv",",This was a great company to work for! They clearly cared about their employees doing well and supported you to be at your best performance. Really excelled in my sales experience and enjoyed working for this company!"
"Vantiv",",My typical day at work is interacting, leading and developing the call center staff.  I operate on a monthly budget to ensure the company is protected and the staff Is happy and engaged."
"Vantiv",",Vantiv was a great company to work for. There was decent opportunity to make good money and management was always willing to assist in any way the sales representatives needed."
"Vantiv",",Management treats employees as slaves. No respect to employees. Makes false promises and breaks them at will. Work Life balance is horrible, even management asks employees to work overtime and not pay them."
"Vantiv",",Very little structure, management style very laid back. Very little accountability. There were so many opportunities to improve the business structure"
"Vantiv",",Nice people, good management. The pay was decent for how easy the work was. It seemed like the management actually cared about everyone."

I learned how to communicate better with the elderly actively listen for small clues, and management and co workers were cool compensation was great.

"Allianz Worldwide Partners","Workload is easy with only few easy obstacles, the job has taught me to be a bit more confident and direct which is great for customer service associates. Working with Management can be difficult, too many employees and not enough managers. Customer satisfaction is one of the hardest parts since the work is client driven, not every customer is happy or willing to work with you. What I enjoy the most aside from leaving everyday is the great people I work with. Once you find the right group of colleagues to surround yourself with the office and job becomes a better experience."
"Allianz Worldwide Partners",",If you want a home work life balance this is not the place. If your life interferes with your scheduled time to work prepare to get a write up. The accumulation of points is very easy as they charge you with 1/3 of a point if you are 6 or more minutes late to work. Be advised to leave home early as Richmond traffic at certain times of the day can be an issue. As many know working a Customer Service position is already the equivalent of working in H.S. and there is no difference here. I apparently had a disagreement with a co-worker of which I knew nothing about and he made up a ludicrous story to tell our manager to feel better about his bruised ego. And of course the usual no upward mobility as again this is a call center. But if you want decent pay this could be a good second job."
"Allianz Worldwide Partners",",Absolutely love the core values of the company.  It is a company that has the most positive work environment.  Everyone works together as a team and everyone thrives on providing superior customer service."
"Allianz Worldwide Partners",",A culture where your contributions are recognized & rewarded--at all job levels. Advancement is possible--many coworkers have left the call center to move to jobs in other divisions. It's busy, but there are great coworkers and friends, opportunities to interact in relaxed/social events, lots of great benefits and amenities in the building. The hardest thing--juggling priorities of many projects."
"Allianz Worldwide Partners",",Management should actually adhere to all the values that are stated for the company, such as work/life balance and reward for skill & hard work.  The career opportunities are only for people who hire in at the manager level or higher.  Anyone who works in ANY of the call centers; travel, bank card, or claims, will not get promoted within this company.  You may move laterally from one department to another, but not upward to a higher position."
"Allianz Worldwide Partners",",The management staff and the upper levels are HORRIBLE to the employees.  They cannot keep Managers.  They have a life of approximately 1 year.  They do not care about quality staff which can be frustrating.  The upper management team is very clique-ish.  They will block you from moving to other areas of the company as well.  The management staff are not educated in most cases.  The HR staff is bullied by the upper management instead of functioning in the best interest of the company/people.  They do not know how to run companies because they are pushed up through the company because they are friends and not qualifications.  Do yourself a favor and apply to another company as that is what I am in the process of doing now."

"ARGUS",",Come in Monday through Friday 7 am to already be late due to time clock set 6 min faster to standard time. (taking 15 min off your time if you are 1 min late automatically making you 14 min late). Must inquire about door entry code because they wont tell you. Work required is easy to accomplish. Must have common sense and the ability to be self motivated. Quick learning is also a must.  Lack of organized training makes the job challenging. Many coworkers lack motivation and enthusiasm for job therefore you might find yourself doing more work than is required for your direct position. but the more you know the more valuable you are. Management sells that they are open door but seem cold. most employees seemed scared for their jobs because he has a quick to fire mentality. I would say the most enjoyable part of the day is when the work load is heavy it makes the day go by quicker, i mean the work is easy you just got to apply yourself."

"Cox Automotive",",one of the biggest mistakes in my career was leaving this place.  It's great.  The people, the benefits and the salary was decent.  My boss was difficult as a black woman, she ad two chips on her shoulder."
"Cox Automotive",",Cox automotive was overall a good company to work for. since they were the parent company of autotrader, being part of autotrader meant I had access to all the available resources of a Cox employee."
"Cox Automotive",",Little work life balance despite the communication strategy to promote it.  Poor leadership in constant change and flux.  Ongoing talk with poor implementation follow through creates nothing getting done.  Great owners who want to do good things and yet those great things get poorly implemented."

"Cox Automotive",",Over all this is a great place to work. The people who make the company & keep things going are incredible and passionate. Great team building environment and fellowship within the company is certainly a positive. The only negative I can say about the company is if management tells you there is an open door policy they are lying. Most managers are robots with no emotion or care of the employees that work for them. I have noticed every time the company does a company wide survey, that the only complaint is management. Not pay, not benefits, not culture, not product etc.."
"Cox Automotive",",The company continues to moves managers within the company just to put them in new departments until eventually they run out of places to move them. The company tries to model all software division companies they own like vAuto. Which is positive and negative. The negative is the metrics they base your performance off of is almost impossible to obtain, because some software markets don't change daily like vAuto does. Combine that with a huge account load isn't healthy either. So that is the negative."
"Cox Automotive",",Back to the positive, even though having a huge account load is a burden, you are well compensated based off performance. Training has improved substantially over the last coupe years as well."
"Cox Automotive",",Hands down, the culture and people are the best thing about the company."

"University of California - San Francisco",",Staff is typically expected to accommodate a variety of different tasks. This can make the job challenging and fast-paced. However, this also means that there is a grey area as to what is your job and what is not. UCSF bureacracy often makes simple tasks such as reimbursements and ordering supplies difficult and time-consuming."
"University of California - San Francisco",",UCSF employees share a passion of conducting innovative and mission-driven research, which is perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the job. Staff contributions are often overlooked since their work is often behind-the-scenes. Faculty are not well-trained in managing people so considerations for promotions and career advancement are often on the back-burner of priorities."

"
"University of California - San Francisco",",Work on a daily basis was on average relaxed with only a few tasks to be done (or more generally a single larger project with loose deadline to be worked on). There were maybe a handful of ongoing tasks that had to be done involving the collecting and processing of patient data. Hardest part of the job was learning to do things that I hadn't done before because they were usually technical and others didn't have a good idea of how to do them (hence asking me). But I kind of enjoyed self-teaching so it wasn't that bad."

"University of California - San Francisco",",Egoism and power trips are the normal way handling disputes/fair treatment from the higher ups and HR is toothless and ineffectual. Despite the liberal nature of the constituents of the this massive bay area machine, it is quite clear that even the nobility of the scientific endeavor can be muddled for the benefit of the few. As staff we are left to observe this quietly and if we speak out you may as well count on being relegated to cleaning the -80C as your primary duty, and say goodby to your potential ""authorship."" I have worked in 4 labs, only one is noble and genuinely good to their staff and students. One! And in that one lab my most beloved superior ever (a Harvard organic chemist and MD), left to go kaiser, stating ""UC is going don the tubes."" I believe him now and I am looking for my chance to move on to something better in industry. That being said, it would suck to have to accept horrible wages just for good benefits. UC, you can do much better for us but you choose to keep staff just above water financially in this city-not cool for people wanting to and in some cases changing the world."
"University of California - San Francisco",",I suppose its a good start for recent grads and maybe for a year or two, but don't get your hopes up. The UC moniker may make you starry eyed but measure your expectations before accepting your offer letter. "

"Target","The managers always tried to show who held more power instead of trying to complete the various task we had to complete. Target pays well"
"Target",",The work is fun considering those I work for and with are all people you can reall associate with. However, one must train the mind to find the fun in working, this job may otherwise get boring."
"Target",",I liked working there.  The managers were fair and supportive.  Provided constructive guidance rather than critical.  Nice!"
"Target",",I am a current employee, I hate it! For the most part, the people I wok with are cool. But the hours are horrible!!! hours have dropped drastically. I haven't made 20 hours in one week in about two months. If you want something part time, this would be the perfect job for you. However, if you have real bills to pay and it would be your only form of income, I don't suggest it. Oh, and management does NOT care about the employees. All they care about is you showing up for your shift."
"Target",",They didn't provide much training, and the pay was lousy. Most employees I worked with had negative attitudes, probably because they are paid very little."
"Target",",A good company to gain experience. The culture is ""fast, fun and friendly."" The people are positive and work well together."
"Target",",It was an okay job. I made a lot of money working for them as I was able to open or close. The benefits were wonderful, I got a discount card, flexible job hours, and they were heavily into the volunteer community. The work was sometimes overwhelming as they had very high expectations, which I didn't mind and would have gladly learned to adjust to if the management wasn't so poor. Every shift was a toss-up of who was managing that day. They had wild requests of someone who just started and whatever I did, they didn't want me to do. It was impossible to work independently as they wanted because when one manager gave me a task to complete, another manager would change it, and then another manager would change that task. I was always confused as nothing was said to me directly, I would have to hunt down a manager to find out what my task change was. I would have stayed with them for the money and benefits, but I ended up moving before my seniority date. Aside from the management, the coworkers were nice, the pay was good, they were very accepting of the LGBTQ+ community, they defended basic human rights that many companies would not."
"Target",",When hired seasonally I was offered a full time position, which I accepted. When it come time to transfer over to full time after the season, I was told I wasn't ever offered that position. Although management was decent and everyone was friendly, I was disappointed in their unorganization."
"Target",",Be prepared to have hours cut, 3 different managers telling you to do 3 different things. A lot of work for one person on shift, happens a lot. "
"Target",",The break schedule was great and managers enforced this. "
"Target",",Great coworkers, a decent discount on merchandise."

"Target",",Target well great environmental job that allowed awesome comfortably. A wonderful company that allow you to develop grow with in the company."
"Target",",Working at Target makes you feel like you belong to a family. Great cooperation between management and associates. Everyone just feels like in the right place doing the right job"
"Target",",Target has great benefits.  But does not pay well unless you are in management and is very hard to get into management.  But it is a fun place to work."
"Target",",It was a very positive environment to work in. The only downside is that I received very little training and schedules were consistently incorrect. I worked at the cash register the first day by myself. Very quickly I moved up to Guest Service to handle complicated returns and corrections."
"Target",",The best part of working at Target are the people you work along side. They are always very helpful, and it's like a small community with an inside joke. The worst part is the pay."
"Target",",The people were nice but the actual tasks were mind numbing. Sometimes managers would over dramatize events for good and bad. The little meeting were a nice way to figure out what the rest of the store was up to."
"Target",",I was a Sales Associate. I worked 15-24 hours a week because I was a minor."
"Target",",Pros:"
"Target",",  - friendly supervisors, never many long lines bc of many employees "
"Target",",Cons:"
"Target",",  - machines break down every now and then, may be pressured to sell red cards"

"Starbucks",",Clientele is always stong"
"Starbucks",",The easiest part is connecting with the customers and making them feel welcome."
"Starbucks",",The hardest part of the job would be time management, being able to do a large amount of tasks in a small amount of time."
"Starbucks",",A great place to work at, 9/10. Only downside is the pay, they provide you with free food daily, free coffee weekly, are flexible with your schedule, and always willing to help."
"Starbucks",",This is by far the best company I have ever worked for! This company takes great care of partners (employees) and always goes above and beyond to accommodate customer needs!"
"Starbucks",",I loved working for Starbucks. They are passionate about their products and the company as a whole. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the company and the people i worked with became life long friends."
"Starbucks",",Learning how to make people's coffee is an enjoyment to help them. The management is great with the flexibility of school."
"Starbucks",",Indulge your senses in this magnificent place. We melted rich flavorful tastes with mocha espresso greatness. If you have any questions please contact me."
"Starbucks",",It was a great place to work, but the store manager where I was working was horrible. Everything had to be done on her time and she didn't care much to hear feedback from employees."
"Starbucks",",Work with great people, flexible hours, and an awesome experience. I learned to work as a team. One of the hardest things working here was opening, the location I worked at opened at 4am so I had to be there at 3:30. I also enjoyed the morning rush, always kept me on my toes and definitely kept me awake during my shift. Also coming home after every shift because the smell of coffee."
"Starbucks",",I love working for Starbucks and making connections on a daily basis. I like seeing the business grow and how my leadership inspires others."
"Starbucks",",From the perspective of partner-customer relations, Starbucks is great at fostering a guest welcoming atmosphere and making great drinks. One cup at a time."
"Starbucks",",Starbucks was a very reliable company to work for. Willing to promote form within. System is clear and easy to learn. Thoughtful employees and team environment."

"Starbucks",",I enjoyed being able to meet goals and metrics. I was able to increase sales and performance due to management trainings and encouragement"
"Starbucks",",It was very fun working for a major company that valued its employees and customers deeply. I was also able to open up more to customer service."
"Starbucks",",Pretty standard for retail/food industry.  Fast paced work when busy, hours are flexible, but they vary depending on your fellow employees schedules, and your manager's whims."
"Starbucks",",Starbucks became family to me, coworkers and management was always there for you. Job was a little stressful with high volume of customers. Also, had days when customers were rude. But, overall Starbucks takes care of their employees, part time benefits and yearly stock earnings."
"Starbucks",",The benefits are amazing but when you have to come in during a blizzard or you get in trouble then you really start questioning their values"
"Starbucks",",GREAT team work, fun, customer involved, appropriate breaks, casual, flexible about hours and schedules, works well if you need time off due to an emergency, energetic environment"
"Starbucks",",A typical day at Starbucks was always fast paced, which I loved. I was always dealing with customers, making sure they were satisfied and happy and willing to always come back into our store. I worked with a team to make sure the store was up to code always. We considered eachother partners rather than coworkers which created an amazing work culture. I would say the hardest part of the job sometimes was keeping up with the large rushes of customers, but as a team we always got it done!"

"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield","The overall cultural has changed over the years. Benefits are good but people are more concerned about themselves and not working as a team"
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",Typical day at this job. Login at 7:45 am and start entering in insurance claim applications. Hardest part at that job was taking order from the staff that was permanent. Senior staff felt their jobs were being taken away because the hired new people."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",Management does believe in developing there talent. I don't feel all management is like this, however the majority does invest time in their employees."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",Average office environment."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",Learned a lot in reference to credentialing"
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",Management style is micro-management"
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",Love my co-workers"
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",The hardest part of the job is dealing management decisions"
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",The most enjoyable part of my job is close friendship with co-workers"
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",I really like my job there, I just wish I made more money. But management in this department is great, and I really like he people I work with. I don't plan to leave anytime soon!"
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",A typical day of working at CareFirst BCBS was very intensive with the calls that came in on a daily basis.  I was given the minimal amount of training to do the job of a full service Customer Service Rep. but most of my training experience came from on the job training and with the little help of my Lead Rep when she was available.  My co-workers loved my spirit and were helpful when they could be, but most of the time, I learned things on my own.  Sometimes finding the right answer to a customer's inquiry may have taken a bit to find, but the satisfaction of helping a customer resolve their reason for calling, from beginning to end, was a pleasure for me.  Again, this may be a good company to work for, but it was not a job that was meant for me to be there on a long term basis."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",Awesome working environment, looking for something better. Good coordination with with my co workers as well as they are very much supportive. Management is also very much helpful."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",Good Company to work. Enjoyed working with everyone across different teams and projects. Good benefits, Great and convenient location good cafeteria. Good people to work with."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",CareFirst as a company provides nice items/discounts for their employees, but the management is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!Management can make or break a place."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",in.The employers were quite helpful in some of the departments and provided positive insight for the field that your were placed in."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",I worked at the Owings Mills location in finance.  Starting pay is very low for the unexperienced.  Corporate culture can tend to be poor with individuals employed for long periods of time who never were checked for their attitudes and ways of doing things.  Some upper level management have very poor ways of communicating and putting forth objectives.  It is very difficult to get a promotion and pay only slightly increases.  The experience I gained was the most valuable part of my time there."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",The good thing about CareFirst was the coworkers, the ability to work from home when needed, benefits and reimbursement. "
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",It's a very stressful environment due to unreasonable job performance expectations. Recommendations and improvements have been suggested by multiple employees to management but are often disregarded or snubbed. It is a stagnant position where you are unable to advance due to common, unfavorable performance reviews."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",Working at BCBS was an excellent experience.  I got to know new things and learned lot of new technology related things from my Tech lead and Project Manager."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",People stay there for years.  Not a challenge as most people have been there for 30 days and have been doing the same job for 30 years."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",Carefirst is a great company to work for although the management is not always fair and sometimes show favoritism. I would recommend this job for anyone who is not looking for advancement. The job is critical and you deal with a lot of irate customers. I love my co-workers, there are many perks and rewards to working for Carefirst."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",The management team loves to micro-manage yet none of them actually have the time to do so. In many cases I had to babysit my boss and beg her to approve things. I was in an area where things needed to be approved fast because the subject matter was kind of blink-and-you'll-miss-it."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",I've never been more stressed at a job. I've never received less appreciation at a job. The higher-up's are sketchy and do terrible things to their employees who have given up their lives to make them look good."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",Basically if you're cool with losing your soul and tirelessly working to appease a group of people who will never be happy - because they're not happy in their personal lives - then you'll do great here. If you're an actual human being... RUN FOR THE HILLS."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",Typical day I am adjusting claims, supporting customer service representatives. Answering phones when the representatives need help. Directing inquires to Dental Directors as needed."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",I had a very tough working boss who also found time to make jokes. He taught me so very much in my years there. By far my favorite job!"
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",I am extremely lucky in that, in the Federal Employee Program, I am blessed with great upper management. They are fully invested in the total development of their staff and work tirelessly to retain their best people. However, in recent months there has been a push to blend three offices into one and in the ensuing transition, there has been a massive exodus of representatives due to the overwhelming work that the Owings Mills office was burdened with while the DC and Cascii offices went through training. I enjoy working with providers and members but the volume of work can be daunting at times, as much as 300 calls/cases in a week which leaves little time for the investigational side of claims case work. The clinical/insurance/medical side of the job is second nature to me but it can be difficult dealing with the emotional side of members when they have issues. I very much enjoy case work and correspondence and work to solve every issue as if its my own, each like its own little mystery."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",I am a full time intern here and CareFirst has been a wonderful experience.  My team is very helpful in my professional development and has taught me many skills such as Microsoft Office and Research.  The mist enjoyable part of my job is working on multiple different projects to expand my knowledge and the hardest part of my job is making assumptions based on data and research that I have compiled."
"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield",",After thousands of interviews and recruiters calling to give feedback, the reality is that CareFirst has me on a do not hire list that once companies ask for the last numbers of your SS#, the Company interests goes cold...Frozen Solid.  They have ruined my career life as I am unemployable to work in my career. A 25+ yr seasoned professional in pursuit of Master's and PMP, and I can't get a job in my profession because of CareFirst BCBS. Attorney's are afraid to take the case... I won my EEOC case but with no compensation. By the time I realized the damage they have...it was too late.  My faith keeps me alive though I have thought of ending it all. Thanks CareFirst and its slave existence mentality. What's the point of investing further in my career if I am blacklisted across the country?  Management there has cast an Iron Curtain. Go at your own risk. You may walk in but you will be wheeled out to go 6ft under."

"Teradata",",A teamwork-oriented environment in a company that empowers employees to create and take initiatives."
"Teradata",",A job that my skills are utilized to the maximum and allows me to grow within the organization."
"Teradata",",I interned in Teradata during this summer and I felt very happy when I worked there because I got many nice colleagues and my manager and mentor are really nice."
"Teradata",",Teradata pays well and allows growth for their employees however Teradata is a company that has been around a long time and is not adapting well to change."
"Teradata",",Very fast pace company. generous with vacation days. Learned how to managed stress and to prioritize workload.  Good opportunities for advancement within the company.  Some departments need to some management to take management class to learn how to manage people."
"Teradata",",Worked on a newer cloud product and Management has zero vision.  Avoid if you want to save your sanity.  They have no visibility into cloud vs on-premise and are still, completely reliant on large physical hardware."
"Teradata",",Good job as a big data consultant. Work with other companies as clients and perform data analytics and data science. Work with teams of other data scientists"
"Teradata",",Good oprotunities to work in different industries with international teams. The best of breed product, the best technology, and so on"
"Teradata",",The company is good if you are okay to take challenges."
"Teradata",",Management Good."
"Teradata",",Co Workers Good"
"Teradata",",Typical Day at work - Good"
"Teradata",",Good Good Good Good Good Good Good"
"Teradata",",My co-workers were always extremely competent and knowledge.  Teradata always encourages the consultants to maintain their skillsets and encourages great performance."
"Teradata",",Horrible company.  Ran like the old NCR company.  In real financial trouble.  Find work elsewhere.  Management is out of touch with the changes in the industry.  Very old school company."
"Teradata",",Teradata is a good company to work for. With the pre-sale announcement that they were going to sell off their marketing applications divisions, many sales motions came to a halt. Hopefully, the new owners will take the old Aprimo products in a good direction."
"Teradata",",There was a nice laid back IT officevibe. If you did your work well and showed up to work on time, there was a decent amount of flexibility. The company recently has experienced a reduction in force with lots of uncertainty ahead. Top level execs have received multimillion dollar bonuses/pay outs meanwhile throngs of low level employees even with years of service will receive paltry in comparison severance packages. I wouldn't recommend pursuing a position here during this transitionary time."
"Teradata",",Need upward mobility for senior security architects.  Co-workers are close knit team willing to share experience and problem solving."
"Teradata",",Teradata is wonderful place to work with appropriate Job Work and life balance."
"Teradata",",overall job culture is best in industry"
"Teradata",",I had a great experience working over there and people over there are very friendly and polite,the working atmosphere was awesome"
"Teradata",",Great work life balance; Managers are very accommodating. need more diversity. The most enjoyable part is travelling to different states of the country."
"Teradata",",Engaging work with lots of opportunities to learn new skills. Employees are friendly and easy to work with. Enjoyable atmosphere."
"Teradata",",I was lucky.  At the right place at the right time.  My experience at Teradata was nothing shot of a great American story.  My experience demonstrates what can happen when a company looks at an individuals skills from a personal prespective and evaluates what that person could accomplish when given the proper opportunites."
"Teradata",",Enjoyed the people I worked for and with.  Typical business with good and not so good situations you deal with over 25 years."
"Teradata",",Most of the employees at Teradata did not have the appropriate computer educations to be working for this company.  It seemed as if they hired MBAs and tried to turn them into Technical Consultants or Watchdogs;  Upper management seemed OK, middle management was unprofessional to say the least and in my opinion a great reason for the downfall of this company.  There was ZERO logical reason for this downfall other than recruiting people with appropriate educational backgrounds and getting rid of DEAD WOOD long ago."
"Teradata",",It was an honor to work for this company.  Unfortunately, the place is ridden with unqualified employees who know nothing about computers and do not have any genuine interest in Teradatas products.  Managers were more like just money/recruiter people."
"Boecore","Great company to work for! Boecore provides educational options such as a mentor program so employees in one field have the option to expand their knowledge or learn about other fields, a transition program to help place an employee either when the current contract is up or if needing/wanting to relocate. I find Boecore concerned with their employees; the entire corporate staff shows they care for their employees and are quick to respond. The company clearly recognizes the gains of a great employer leads great employees."
"Boecore",",Great Company to work for.  They look out for all those that work for them. Corporate is involved all the time.  They meet for bagels once a month and immediate supervisor was very productive even though we did not work in the same area."
"Boecore",",The company is the best place I have ever worked. The entire company is constanly looking out after its employees."
"Boecore",",Plenty of projects that need to be worked on with expected timelines."
"Boecore",",The workers and techs are best people to work."
"Boecore",",The hardest part of the job is getting through the sustainment review process."
"Boecore",",I have been very lucky to have been employed by Boecore for 7 years. Unfortunately, the contract I was assigned to has been cut and I have been laid off."
"Boecore",",Excellent overview of all company achievements, accomplishments, employee recongition, benifet changes and current oppertunities"
"Boecore",",Boecore is a great people oriented company. They really take care of their employees and make us feel like we are important."
"Boecore",",Someplace I would enjoy working again. Corporate office is great with employees and professional. Co-workers are helpful and provide a positive working environment."
"Northrop Grumman","Northrop Grumman is an enjoyable company to work for. like any large company you do have your challenges with co-workers and management but all in all Northrop Grumman is a decent company to work for. The hardest part of the job is to become stagnate."
"Northrop Grumman",",Best job in the world. Working with African Army's was exciting and rewarding."
"Northrop Grumman",",Got to travel and visit other cultures."
"Northrop Grumman",",African's were so appreciative of what we did for them."
"Northrop Grumman",",Great place to work for 33 years where I learned various job functions.  I traveled world wide as a Quality Inspector. I traveled state side as a technical liaison"
"Northrop Grumman",",Overall, Northrop is a great place to work. They have excellent benefits. However, too many office politics, bonuses do not exist if you are not at the top 10% of best employees, and moving on to a different position or getting a promotion is a joke."
"Northrop Grumman",",My personal opinion, the management can be improve to help.  I have learned and improved a lot with the company. The hardest part of the job is when everyone are not corporate to solve the issues."
"Northrop Grumman",",The work flow is steady. There isn't much room for advancement even if you have higher education. All of the people are nice and easy to get along with. Some of the managers are incompetent and don't seem to care about doing a good job or employee opinions."
"Northrop Grumman",",great place to work for, management is very friendly and supportive. they go above and beyond to help. Best place to work"
"Northrop Grumman",",It is interesting, to say the least, how some of the managers at this company got to where they are. It's a good ol' boy system and if you know the right people and can talk sports and hot air, you've got a chance at promotion. But, if you do the right thing, know your job well and try to help others, you just might find your clearance being threatened because the manager is intimidated by you. Then, instead of Human Resources removing the manager(s) that cause the problems, they take dedicated and hard working employees and move them to places where they'll either be miserable and quit, or to a proposal which may not be won, so they can ""justifiably"" be laid off in the future."
"Northrop Grumman",",The life of a HR Generalist / Recruiter is filled with opportunities and challenges. Every decision presents the opportunity to support and drive the company brand. As the HR Generalist, I deal with employee relations by implementing organizational laws and regulations. As the corporate recruiter, I have the honor of selecting the talent and character of potential employees that would carry the brand of the organization / company. The most exciting thing about the position of HR Generalist / Recruiter is when presented with challenges are keeping the company brand at the forefront of all decisions, popular or unpopular. I except both opportunities and challenges the are inherent with the position of HR Generalist / Recruiter."
"Northrop Grumman",",Northrop has some of the highest standards of excellence I've ever encountered. It's daunting at first, you worry about living up to the expectations set forth. However, I can say that the work environment puts excellence within your grasp. State of the art equipment, paired with the best and the brightest individuals in their fields make a recipe for success. If you, like me, always felt like the smartest person in the room, get ready for a slice of humble pie, because the folks at Northrop will surprise you."
"Northrop Grumman",",Great place to work, great benefits, nice location.  This a an ideal place for students just finishing up their degrees."
"Northrop Grumman",",Great management, benefits, etc. Employees at three small offices handling the majority of the geospatial work were laid-off. Contracts weren't renewed."
"Northrop Grumman",",Northrop was a great company to work for. Things were interesting all the time. Everyone worked as a team, and the management was great. The hardest part of my job was that it was contractual and once the contracts ended you were not always able to find another contract to pick you up."
"Northrop Grumman",",Northrop Grumman continues to improve to be one of the top aircraft companies in the USA and takes pride in what they do everyday. The company is an all round experience in their field and has proven over and over that they can compete with the best of all the Aircraft Companies in this country that they can produce a quality Aircraft,"
"Northrop Grumman",",Great company. I learned so much and gained knowledge of things I couldn't have even imagined. I supported tooling for the f-18, f-35, NUCAS, Global hawk, and B-2 bomber. It was exciting every single day."
"Northrop Grumman",",I have been working here since i was a sophomore in college. I enjoy my coworkers and the experiences I have gained. Not only that but they have showed what it is like to work in an environment that shows all aspects of business involving technology"
"Northrop Grumman",",We were informed of any changes that were coming about int he company of mergers or acquisitions and if they would impact our sections.  Monthly meeting with all the staff in one location with free food was a good thing.  Enjoyable and personnel got to see other persons that the work with, but located in different buildings."
"Northrop Grumman",",Overall NGC isn't a bad company, the management staff in the southern California region is poor, they lack diversity and outwardly refuse to promote qualified women of color.  The majority white male management is not educated or business savvy to run the Unmanned program while keeping it on schedule and under/on budget.  Other competitors that are interested in the unmanned area go for it."
"Northrop Grumman",",This is a good place to work and opportunity to move places and the manager are nice to you. I have learned a lot from this place."
"Northrop Grumman",",Job security is good and opportunities to move around, within the company, in some sectors but the work/life balance isn't that great depending upon your program."
"Northrop Grumman",",Most people I've worked with or talked to are very friendly and helpful. Managers that I've had have been very flexible in the work arrangements (There's less flexibility with higher clearance jobs)."
"Northrop Grumman",",Because most of the jobs require higher clearances it's hard to get another position if you don't already have a high one."
"Wright Medical","conducive environment to work that requires extreme attention to detail. Light industrial tech department work involving quality and inventory control."
"Wright Medical",",Politic cultured, Good few people, and most will portray as a friend but only to get what they need. Unable to create drive in their employees by the lack of management to utilize each potential. Management will make the necessary adjustment even if they have to bend the rules. Will approve for negative time off but only for certain individuals. DC are always sidetrack. Some co-workers makes the unnecessary remarks in a daily basis and management in DC are very unprofessional with the lack of knowledge of the business."
"Wright Medical",",A typical day begins with greetings among staff members and quickly dispersing to individual work stations. A staff meeting is generally scheduled once per week but if there is something new to share with staff members, management does so at this time. Absences are discussed so that cross-trained staff know their roles and responsibilities. And the day begins! I have received a wealth of knowledge and gained so much experience working at Wright Medical. The management is a ""Mom & Pop"" style; yet, determined to produce quality durable medical equipment and services for the community. My coworkers are respectful and diligent workers. The hardest part of my job is that there seems to never be enough time in the day to do all that I am committed to do. The most enjoyable part of the job presently is the knowledge that I am assisting this company in weathering the storm of Medicare audits and cuts! It is appalling what is happening to the DME industry."
"Wright Medical",",Too many people that do not know anything about how to treat people, espically a co-worker, someone that is in trench with or for them."
"Wright Medical",",The wrong people were high up in management only because they had been there for awhile/politics. They were not receptive to good ideas to improve business function, efficiency, cost reduction, or general process improvement."
"Wright Medical",",This is a wonderful company to work for.  We are able to make a difference in peoples lives on a daily basis.  The company is a big family and even the CEO is approachable and willing to listen to any employee."
"Wright Medical",",i been employee at Wright before and i was really comfortable i would love to work there again. in the future. i believe in Wright"
"Wright Medical",",Extremely tense work environment "
"Wright Medical",",Great Co-workers"

"Wright Medical",",Wright Medical was great company to work for.. I supported over 900 users on a daily basis. Providing Desktop Support with a team of 4 Members. I learned how to work with different personalities, races, and time management. The hardest part of the job was dealing Lenovo Products due to the fact of bad computer hardware being shipped from the Manufacturer. We constantly had to call the company to honor repairs with defected keyboards and LCDs regarding lenovo Laptops.. "
"Wright Medical",",The most enjoyable part of the job was providing excellent customer service to the user to ensure that their daily task were completed on a consistent basis."
"Wright Medical",",A good company to work for but in the Hub area there is a lack of training"
"Wright Medical",",A typical day at Wright Medical Inc., was hectic but manageable. I learned many things about customer service and customer service. Account management and interpersonal relationship skill with their customer."
"Wright Medical",",The typical day at work consisted of helping clients as they walked through the door for DME. My duties were to greet the customer upon  entrance, set appointments, create/fax/download documents, and running errands for the office. Co-workers had great attitudes about the job which made the job easier altogether."
"Wright Medical",",Good job, good people. Not much training so you have to learn quickly as you go, but the staff is always available to answer any questions."
"Wright Medical",",I appreciate the interaction with my peers, as well as with the consumers that request durable medical equipment and related services; other professionals, such as doctors and specialists; vendors, insurance companies, and hospitals. Daily interaction with different entities lead to the satisfaction of assisting others in their quest to accomplish daily living skills. I have learned to be more compassionate towards others seeking services in this dimension of healthcare as well as how to serve them with respect. My coworkers are diligent and steadfast in their service to this community which makes me proud to be a member of this team. The hardest part of my job is the inability to provide services as required for those who clearly need these services. The most enjoyable part of the job is the opposite; the ability to assist those in need to realize their mobility capabilities with the assistance of the devices that are available in this area of healthcare."
"Wright Medical",",A typical day at work was productive and stress free with co-workers with good teamwork.The hardest part of the job was working 2nd shift not seeing my son. I enjoyed working with positive friendly people."

"Ohio State University",",I liked the environment and the level of profession. I worked with some talented math students in some early graduated computation courses. Enjoyed it!"
"Ohio State University",",Overall I worked with some of the most awesome nurses and aides.  We worked as a team and made work fun.  There are some arrogant doctors there and some managers do not stick up for their nursing staffs."
"Ohio State University",",I am a graduate student in Biochemistry division of Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. As a graduate teaching assistant, the insurance coverage is quite well. The department also is very warm--the chair and staffs are all caring. There are some fun activities through the year. Work load for teaching depends on the class/professor. The campus is nice ans so is the city."
"Ohio State University",",The school has many resources to offer students but it also has amazingly dedicated and passionate professors who push students to do their best at all steps of the process."
"Ohio State University",",Healthy work/life balance and good benefits. Compensation is poor compared to the private sector. A Masters in Science may only earn you $14 to $15/hr at OSU, which is embarrassingly low. "
"Ohio State University",",Job security is not that good if you are hired as a term employee. It would be easier to invest yourself fully in the job if you didn't have to think about possibly being out of a job in a year or two. It also appears that term employees are less valued by the university. The department I worked for gave me a 1% raise after two years of work because I was a term employee (full-time employees received 2%)."
"Ohio State University",",If you have a good supervisor it can be a great place to work. If your supervisor is a good scientist and not a good people manager (as can often be the case), then you might have a somewhat dysfunctional and not very enjoyable work experience."
"Ohio State University",",Parking is expensive. As someone holding a Masters degree and earning $16/hr I found the annual parking pass of nearly $900 prohibitively expensive."
"Ohio State University",",During my work experience with Ohio State I have been able to make great connections with people. I have also gotten the opportunity to learn different skill sets and about myself. "
"Ohio State University",",Everyone I worked with was willing to help me learn the skill sets that were necessary for day to day activities. The hardest part of the jobs I worked was how unpredictable the days could be. Some days were really busy, while others were slow. There always seemed to be different jobs that had to be completed on a daily basis. It was always fun to learn new skills though and grow as a person."
"Ohio State University",",Some departments at Ohio State are wonderful to work for. Others are very disorganized with their leadership. They also do not treat term workers well."
"Ohio State University",",Working at OSU is a mixed bag.  You have the great atmosphere of being at OSU, and having a great culture for student success and professional accomplishments.  Then you also have the political side of it being OSU, and a state run facility.  I know people that have had great bosses, and some that have had ones that play the game.  But, it's OSU so what can you say?!"
"Ohio State University",",World leaders in several areas of research.  Enjoyed working there.  Large variety of classes and jobs.  It was a very fascinating place to work."
"Ohio State University",",This job was great to network with people around campus, around campus, and the Big Ten. Co-workers are great to work with because you feel part of a team. Also, the leadership backs you up with things when you need it."
"Ohio State University",",Best place to work on campus. Fun energetic staff, upbeat co-workers, and an exciting place to interact with patrons. More words are needed."
"Ohio State University",",I didn't mind working as a graduate research assistant, although the work was very time-consuming. The size of The Ohio State University can create a tremendous sense of anomie, however, and it can be kind of unnerving if you're not very well connected, or aren't a traditional student."
"Ohio State University",",I'm a graduate student. We are expected to work independently with minimal supervision. It really depends on your advisor and your department."
"Ohio State University",",The most enjoyable part is the diversity of tasks on a daily basis there is no boring routine I just loved working there "
"Ohio State University",",Co-workers as well as my supervisor were great"
"Ohio State University",",I like  it and enjoy it a lot. I'm able to do my work and also work on my school work. I learned to pay close attentions to details and always ready to write down people's problem."
"Ohio State University",",The work atmosphere is great, people are friendly. A little difficult to move up the ladder especially in research areas.Management wise excellent. enjoy working here"
"Progressive","I was there many years ago, and loved my time there until things changed.  The company suffered a rash of layoffs in the region where I was, changed locations, and the manager was a vindictive person who purposefully went after certain people to make their working life awful to push them from the company.  I found out many years later that he ended up being terminated.  "
"Progressive",",Management is not good. You always feel like you have a target on your back. Look out for yourself and don't trust anyone. They promote fear in senior leaders. They say they have an open door policy, but behind the scenes they frown upon it. Its all a show."
"Progressive",",If you are looking to get into insurance, this company will train you very well. "
"Progressive",",It's unlikely that you will stay here though."
"Progressive",",Good people. Work your way up culture. Typical day for me is 9am-6pm. Between taking inbound calls, placing outbound calls, meeting with customers, completing liability investigations, documenting files, ordering and reviewing police reports, taking recorded statements from people after accidents, and participating in meetings,your day will definitely be full.  It's not hard work, there's just a lot of it.  The volume will keep you on your toes."
"Progressive",",The nature of an insurance company is to cut costs and maximize its shareholder interests. Progressive is very good at ripping off customers and employee salaries and resources. Don't work here. Stress and anxiety fueled company."
"Progressive",",Some companies rarely show their employees they are appreciated. Yet Progressive takes the time to always reward and acknowledge their employees. "
"Progressive",",Like most companies you may run into a few issues here and there. However the open door policy at Progressive is very comforting during times of conflict. They provide several classes addressing the different ways you can address any issue. Always looking for a way to make the company a place of happiness."
"Progressive",",Depending on the area you work in the job may be more demanding at different times of years. In slow times of the departments employees are encouraged to ""loan-out"" to other departments and learn more about other business areas. "
"Progressive",",I've never worked for a company that offer several learning classes and courses to help their employees grow in their skills."
"Progressive",",Progressive can be a great place to work if you have the right personality for the corporate environment and culture that existed when I worked there.   I do not miss it."
"Progressive",",Typical day included interactions with project team, sponsors, and key stakeholders in support of project, program, or portfolio assignments.  Learned how centralized Enterprise Project Management Office (EPMO) functions can serve needs across a broad spectrum of organizational business areas."
"Progressive",",Culture was diverse, and encouraged risk taking in pursuit of solution building.  Although leadership was strong, support for those positioned as change agents remained critical to personal success."
"Progressive",",Most challenging element of the job was assignments where support was inconsistent or inadequate to satisfy the goals of the project or program.  "
"Progressive",",Most enjoyable part of the job was delivering IT outcomes that impacted the bottom line in substantial ways, and strengthened the company's pursuit of becoming the number 1 national insurer."
"Progressive",",Progressive is an excellent company to work for, so long as the supervisor or managing person is ""properly"" trained to handle the volume of it's employees under that person's supervision and coaching, etc. The training and furtherance of education is readily available and free, so the problem is hiring and training the persons in charge, so that the employees can work to their full potential!"
"Progressive",",•	Served as liaison between customer and manager to resolve customer complaints"
"Progressive",",•	Handled complex, escalated issues independently"
"Progressive",",The claims world is never easy. The people you work with at Progressive make it a fun environment if there aren't any toxic employees. There is a political game but I suppose that's everywhere you go. ""They say"" tenure doesn't matter, but that's contrary to what I've seen.  Usually, you'll work more than the allotted 8 hours and that really affects work/life balance. If you can't manage the work within those 8 hours and ask for help from managers, you're placed on an action plan which counts against your performance evaluation which in turn affects your salary. So, if you're like me, you'll work more than 40+ hours a week. Upsides are being able to help customers everyday and be a positive light when they've just experienced a terrible accident. It makes you feel good doing the work for good people. The negatives are dealing with terrible people and getting surveyed by them, which in turn, affects your raise at the end of the year."
"Progressive",",Unprofessional VP of sales who writes disparaging emails to supervisors about the representatives. Unprofessional management team. Unrealistic and irrelevant practices by management. "
"Progressive",",Fun place to work and interact with customers and co-workers."
"Progressive",",I worked here during recession, compensation was an issue. the only reason I left was to increase my income. A career worthy company."
"Progressive",",Great concept the only issue I have is you have to use pro in order to take off. if you don't have any you get what they call an occurrence. Mangement could also be more informed."
"Progressive",",From the interview process, to training, to academy, to team participation. It is a very open and self sustaining environment, everyone is friendly and willing to go the extra mile to help each other and make the customers want a business relationship for a lifetime"
"Progressive",",Great Company! Local leadership lacks serious motivation ability. Leadership does not support tor encourage upward mobility within the state."
"Progressive",",I think it's a wonderful company.  It gives me a chance to help people get the help they need when they need it.  I have met some very nice people and they always appreciate me being there."
"Progressive",",A typical day at work would involve managing incoming claims, phone calls, and investigating into coverages. "
"Progressive",",The management is always willing to help give direction for managing working loads by providing effective feedback from their own experiences in the position."
"Progressive",",Company allows a lot of employee input.  Company has good benefits and genuinely tries to take of it's employees for the most part"
"Progressive",",Management was inept and lack claims knowledge to correctly handle claims. Extremely busy work environment. Extremely micromanaged making job hard to complete efficiently and productively. Enjoyed opportunity to meet or exceed expectations of customers,"
"Progressive",",Slow start mondays and tuesdays. Very busy every other day of the week , very productive , good hours , good pay .great management, rise after hire with in the company , on the job training"
"Scientific Research Corporation","A typical contract job under the government. The contract goes for a year up to a year and a half. The pace varies on the amount of load needed to be completed."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",Good place to work but come there with job knowledge. A typical day last 8 to 9 hours. Management styles vary by group and function."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",This company speaks out of two side of their mouth. They say they are committed to their employees, but they don't really mean it."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",Travel to Ross Island Antarctica to setup, maintain and repair three different runways per season.  I would have to leave in August and return in March."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",I have had the opportunity to work with exceptional coworkers for multiple different and exciting projects. My benefits are real hard to beat. A Very Technical Environment that will test your knowledge and skills."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",General clerical duties and lots of meetings."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",I learned to be more efficient and patient."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",My management treated me well."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",My co workers were helpful."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",The job was not hard at all. "
"Scientific Research Corporation",",Every month Scientific Research Corp, sponsored a luncheon for the employees."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",It was fun, it was cold, there were penguins, everyone is an alcoholic."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",Indeed keeps telling me to write more for the review, if you haven't spent 6 months on the ice, you should try it. Unless you don't want to."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",SRC is a great company.  They have excellent compensation and benefits.  Unfortunately, since it is a small company, when a contract ends they may have difficulty reabsorbing you into another program.  Top notch employees made it a pleasure to come to work everyday.  Management is hesitant to act on many business opportunities.  Not the most aggressive business development team out there."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",I enjoyed the management and the people I worked with.  Challenging and I also enjoyed the R&D.  I enjoyed coming up with new ideas for new products."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",Poor management, they do not care about employees only contract fulfillment. Routine 50-70 hour weeks for salaried employees."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",Can be a great place to build a career and grow as long as you're passionate about what you do and get noticed for it. Not for the lazy or easily discouraged"
"Scientific Research Corporation",",It has been a very rewarding experience to work at SRC. Team members are always willing to step out of the box and up to new challenges. They are also willing to help train and advise whenever needed."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",Worked in a team environment on a specific contract.  Management, analysts, and support staff worked together for the success of the project.  Hardest part of the job was the short timelines; but everyone worked together and helped each other out to get to the goal we intended to achieve."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",A typical day at work is challenging and rewarding."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",I have learned a great deal from all the engineers I've worked with over the years."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",I was once the production supervisor prior to work getting slow.  Then I accepted the Field Service Engineer position."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",Great group of people to work with."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",The hardest part of the job is all the travel."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",The most enjoyable part of the job is the challenge of whatever I'm working on then the success when it's completed."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",Flexible, working locations.  Teleworking.  Benefits.  Training and career advancements.  Leadership and Management were great to work for."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",A typical day at SRC would begin with a review of deliverables of our program plan and coordinating team meetings with the managers and associated resources.  The hardest part of the job was the fluctuations on program requirements and coordination between the company and the customer.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to learn and grow within the company in a place that felt like home."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",The job itself is very satisfying and beneficial to the military. Unfortunately, the management at SRC is quite poor. Management lies to the customer (SPAWAR) to meet goals and lies to the employee to string them along for as long as they can before they force the employee to leave the program."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",A great place to learn the trade if one is lucky enough to find a mentor to learn how to be a good tech. There is no, ""Program"" or teaching facility. One just has to learn by watching the more experienced technicians. There is also no quality assurance program. So, more experienced personnel are forced to fix the problems. Thus adding to the pressure of meeting a given deadline."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",There were many moral events where multiple codes could connect.  Many reliable and knowledgeable persons onboard.  Friendly atmosphere.  OSHA standards strictly followed."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",This job has been a great experience by being to live and work in one of the most remote places on earth. Deploying to Antarctica is something that the average person cannot say. The work can be tiring but it is worth it because not many people can keep up with the work pace and the ever changing environment. The scenery is beautiful and being in 24 hour daylight is mind blowing."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",A typical day can go from one end of the spectrum to another because of the weather conditions. But usually you would do all of the equipment checks and document everything to keep accurate records. You would also travel to remote locations to perform preventive maintenance on weather equipment. Travel is also necessary to the South Pole to do equipment checks there also another unique experience."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",The management is laid back and let you perform the tasks on your own once you have proven yourself to be competent and reliable."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",They also are very knowledgeable on all of the equipment. I've filled in for the Runway Supervisor and that was a good experience but very busy because I would always be on call if anything came up after hours."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",There is usually a constant rotation of new hires, but mainly prior service individuals that are used to long deployments, Everyone gets along for the most part but like any deployment you sometimes tire of seeing the same people everyday. Some people get cabin fever but it is normal with being such a remote place."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",Some really great people to work with which made the job much more enjoyable."
"Scientific Research Corporation",",Very diverse tasking allows for increasing skill set and gaining a wide range of engineering experience"
"ASG Renaissance","Just like any company there are pros and cons, but overall it's a good company. Apply and talk to one of the recruiters to see if it is the right place for you."
"ASG Renaissance",",Small but fun company to work for. Always busy but with great co-workers it makes the day go by quickly. Lots of research required and beneficial to know how to use burrelles and excel."
"ASG Renaissance",",Enjoyed contract work at Ford Motor Company, Alternative Fuel Vehicles the best. Did a lot of fun things including travel to conferences."
"ASG Renaissance",",ASG had a family like atmosphere and was overall a pleasant place to work."
"ASG Renaissance",",I learned a lot about Alternative Fuel vehicles."
"ASG Renaissance",",I had various Managers over the 19 years I worked for them. "
"ASG Renaissance",",They were good Managers. "
"ASG Renaissance",",I met a lot of very nice people working at ASG and Ford Motor Company as a contract person. "
"ASG Renaissance",",The hardest part of the job was doing ISO Audits and Internal Audits, I found that kind of stressful. My Manager said I did a great job with it though. "
"ASG Renaissance",",I enjoyed planning events."
"ASG Renaissance",",Very nice people and managerment. Co-workers are fun to work with teaming up"
"T3 Trading Group LLC","The fees will eat into your PnL. There is no compensation. Whatever you make is what you take minus the firms cut. Monthly trading fees. You pay for all the exams. This place is a sweat shop. High turnover."
"T3 Trading Group LLC",",The other 5 star reviews are obviously fake. Look at the down votes."
"T3 Trading Group LLC",",Advice for company: need to firm up on the hiring process and not hire anyone that applies. Play a base salary for those starting out in the first year."
"T3 Trading Group LLC",",After speaking with the recruiter I decided not to go through with the hiring process. They said that I have to fund my own account and pay an expensive price for a vigorous day trading training program. The recruiters push you to spend money on their job resources otherwise you won't advance. This really isn't even a career it's not even a job either. They're an expensive stock brokerage in disguise and they just want to suck money out of you."
"T3 Trading Group LLC",",Amazing atmosphere. Management and resources are off the charts. I would recommend T3 to any prop trader"
"T3 Trading Group LLC",",A Fun company to work for. the Trading floor is an exciting atmosphere and it is a great place to start off a career in stock trading."
"T3 Trading Group LLC",",Productive great place to learn and trade equities. The management was excellent."
"Mattel, Inc.","Management is open-minded."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Bubbly, up-tempo work culture."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Learned to open/ close out point-of-sales systems."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Loads of cash handling."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Strong teamwork ethic."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Hardest part was leaving (Summer job)"
"Mattel, Inc.",",Fast paced environment, must be flexible to change as the company has reorgs every 6 months and layoffs every year. Biggest perk about the company is that every Friday is half day work day."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Company continues to work on a turnaround and while there are some positive signs (e.g. new CEO, new CBO from prominent organizations) there is still much to be done internally to make Mattel a great company.  "
"Mattel, Inc.",",Company holiday and vacation policies are among the very best available.  Compensation is good, not great, but that tends to be the case among ""fun"" industries. Bonuses and raises have been either  meager or non-existent due to the company's continuing struggle to meet financial goals."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Work/life balance is entirely dependent on your team.  Mattel is a matrix-style organization with many small, highly-specialized teams that each have their own subcultures.  "
"Mattel, Inc.",",Company leadership is not a strong suit.  Mattel is a very, very top-heavy culture so expect that your voice won't be heard until you're at least a Sr. Manager or a Director level.  Leadership relies on a trickle-down communication style which, frankly, doesn't work.  Due to this style, important information like strategy, business priorities, etc. aren't communicated to lower levels, which makes doing your day-to-day work difficult.  "
"Mattel, Inc.",",For better or for worse, Mattel promotions work like clockwork, occurring approx. every two years.  It's quite easy to come in, work for a few years to get your title, and then move on."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Working for this company, I felt like I was part of a family and always had a over all good time. Christmas time could be stressful due to the costumer demand."
"Mattel, Inc.",",awesome awesome awesome jobe everyone is suoer nice if I could I would stay here full time but unfortantally no growth to grow but management was pretty great it was like a family"
"Mattel, Inc.",",Spent most of my time in the receiving department. Finding and auditing the lost parts and raw materials was the most enjoyable and the hardest on most days. You learned what materials were molded parts, which parts were received from vendors or other facilities. Keeping track of 2500+ individual items in a 1.6 million square foot facility and 80+ storage trailers is a challenge."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Good work life balance. "
"Mattel, Inc.",",Starting with a clean slate and having no reference was a challenge. However, I hit the ground running because I have experience in management and administration."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Great work from home employer, receive store hours and create my own schedule to visit several retailers and service their toy department and build endcaps for new products and help customers with new products and selling features."
"Mattel, Inc.",",There is nothing negative to write about this company or position. Great company to work for and amazing perks and benefits.It can be a little stressful and overwhelming at times but the outcome is always worth it"
"Mattel, Inc.",",They are really trying to improve employee satisfaction through fun activities, casual atmosphere and emphasis on collaboration; unfortunately it's a bit too slow to advance for most."
"Mattel, Inc.",",This place is not enough money. And I feel that the company treats us different vs the people that is in the corporate office. Also they do not pay us enough money for the work we do."
"Mattel, Inc.",",My typical day at work would be clocking in, reading what sections are assigned to me, then moving at an extremely rapid pace to restock missing items and also to pull larger items from the back for cash wrap clerks. I also at times have to play the sales person, even though there are assigned sales people. So, at times it feels like I'm doing everything at once while a few at times sham knowing that I'm going to cover behind them. Other than that, it's a lovely place to work as far as a part time job. Hearing the excitement of the customers somehow make me a bit happy."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Awesome for creative people, bad for those looking for job security.  Lots of holidays, lots of fun activities, day care, gym, laundry shop, free evaluation toys"
"Mattel, Inc.",",Come in get your work order, count you product, get your line set up before the employees come in.  Once employees come in you start you line up until completion.  As a line Leader yours constantly walking and talking with the employees to make sure that they know how to put the displays together also ask the employees who are putting the toys on the display how many toys go on the display."
"Mattel, Inc.",",My experience with Mattel has been great!"
"Mattel, Inc.",",They always have analytical projects to complete."
"Mattel, Inc.",",The environment is totally awesome!"
"Mattel, Inc.",",I worked seasonal and the key is team work and great training. I wish I was still there but moved away from them.  "
"Mattel, Inc.",",Seasonal is varied and moves at a fast pace"
"Mattel, Inc.",",-Great culture"
"Mattel, Inc.",",-Passionate people"
"Mattel, Inc.",",-Great schedule, especially for retail"
"Mattel, Inc.",",-connecting with the young customer and their families was definitely enjoyable"
"Mattel, Inc.",",Loved working for Mattel Toys, however my position was seasonal temporary.  Mattel was genuinely interested in customer feed back, as well as customer service."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Excellent company to work for. "
"Mattel, Inc.",",Found a lot of creative and fun people to work with."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Learn a lot from long time vested coworkers."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Also a very professional environment."
"Mattel, Inc.",",worst experience in my whole life of work in restaurants they just didn't pay you at all tips because it was all on credit card but the company pays every 2 weeks and they wont pay you if theres a problem with your check and that was my case to the point i was running out of the job on my break to look for jobs and once i got late the manager was the fattest woman ive ever seen but the meanest woman ive ever met she went off saying i was irresponsible that i was making her look bad etc etc but the company didnt pay me for whole 2 weeks not even tips for the train was a nightmare and i was irresponsible? i explain to her i got illegally locked out of my room because i didn't pay the rent on time and i was going to court and sleeping on McDonalds so she said you're homeless? and said she was going to tell the gen manager because they cant have homeless working there so i cried and left when i was leaving they called security to escort me out ..got back to get my check but wasn't there ...only after 2 weeks i left then i got it was like around 400 for the 2 weeks i worked there..."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Great Benefits. With the right manager work life balance is good. Co-workers are pretty decent, but environment was terribly adversarial between departments."
"Mattel, Inc.",",The company culture is one of fear and woe. Layoff fear paralyzes the company between January and March every year."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Lots of higher management are extremely unsuited to their roles, and have no right working for a toy company."
"Mattel, Inc.",",Hard work is not rewarded, but the ineptitude of management is. Very unfair."
"Lucid Software","This was a great job with outstanding benefits including a bangin work life balance.  They are constantly feeding you while providing you with a gym membership to the nicest gym in Utah.  Great workplace. 12/10 stars"
"MediaMath","Dynamic working environment, lots of communication. Good work-life balance. Free pantry, table tennis. Good place to get involved in online advertising industry."
"MediaMath",",When I worked at MediaMath the place was going through many changes therefore it was very disorganized to the point it was not clear who I was reporting to."
"MediaMath",",Very relaxed work environment, enjoyable, all colleagues are extremely friendly, one has the ability to work on many interesting projects!"
"MediaMath",",I was attracted to work at MediaMath because it had a fantastic reputation in its industry and the unique challenges that the company is taking on. I was pleasantly surprised and thrilled, however, to find that it is also an extremely friendly and fun place to work- your co-workers are brilliant, quirky people who come from all sorts of backgrounds (my colleagues worked previously as fashion designers, animators, non-profit workers...so there is always an interesting story). Most importantly, these brilliant people are excited and happy because they feel trusted by management to try new things and work in the manner in which the will be most successful. All in, I feel at home on my team and valued by everyone I interact with."
"MediaMath",",Management and leadership are not great, they are extremely disorganized and not proactive"
"MediaMath",",My experience at MediaMath has been good, and I have experienced a good amount of growth from a professional stand-point. As is the case for most start-ups, the environment and structure is constantly changing, which for me has been the hardest part of the job. I have had 4 managers and been a part of 3 teams. That instability has caused me to want to seek out other opportunities that may fit my needs a little better. "
"MediaMath",",Dynamic team - "
"MediaMath",",Great offering -"
"MediaMath",",Fantastic culture - "
"MediaMath",",Empowering leaders - "
"MediaMath",",Busy working environment; MediaMath is a pioneer in digital media., you can learn a lot of digital advertising industry. People are smart and energetic ."
"MediaMath",",Generally speaking good people. Most part work is clear. Management could use some training."
"MediaMath",",co-workers are very helpful. I learned a lot about the complex product that they have and various features of it."
"Roush Enterprises","Enjoy working here management and co-workers great to work with . Wasn't a job we couldn't get done . Learned a lot and had the privilege to work with numerous customers and gain knowledge from them as well."
"Roush Enterprises",",Advanced technology company that is growing quickly to react to market needs and opportunities.  Diversified opportunities in many manufacturing, engineering and development positions."
"Roush Enterprises",",i loved working there , everything fits for me , the work hours , location, payment and very important , good people ( employers ) but bad luck got laid off"
"Roush Enterprises",",Punch in, report to meeting area for assignment, collect proper paperwork for job, inventory parts rack and request any missing parts, install all parts and torque all fasteners, fill out required paperwork for jobs completed and record times and notes on the computer."
"Roush Enterprises",",Learned something new on a regular basis with concept and prototype vehicles."
"Roush Enterprises",",Worked along side with line leads and area leads to finish all requested jobs."
"Roush Enterprises",",Got along with all co-workers and helped them along in procedures for individual jobs."
"Roush Enterprises",",Hardest part of my job is the hour changes from day to day."
"Roush Enterprises",",I like learning and working on multiple types and style of vehicles."
"Roush Enterprises",",At first it was all very exciting and made me proud to work for the company then as time went on I learned how expendable everyone but the direct hires are. I still enjoyed my work and working on new prototype builds and repair jobs. The highlight of roush is all the overtime you can get, which can take what would be a $26,800 annually job to $36,000 a year job. But you need to prepare for layoffs whenever ford slows down."
"Roush Enterprises",",We would go into work and get put into our groups. We would then get our keys and meet up with everyone in our group after doing a pre-drive inspection of the car. We would then drive on designated routes until the end of the night. We drive about 300-400 miles a night. I find driving very relaxing and meeting everyone for lunch or breaks was always fun."
"Roush Enterprises",",I found this company to be totally micromanaged and does not allow employees to move forward with new ideas."
"Roush Enterprises",",They do not pay the majority of their workforce very well and work them 24/7."
"Roush Enterprises",",There is no interest in your success."
"Roush Enterprises",",Great place to work for.  I learned a lot about accounting and managing jobs and materials."
"Roush Enterprises",",Roush is a great company to work for, depending on what you're looking for in a job.  They offer great experience, but lack in compensation.  Their health benefits are very good, though."
"Roush Enterprises",",Like any work place, there are politics at play and it's hard to advance in some departments."
"Roush Enterprises",",they want you to work a lot of hours and pays not that good.there leadership is lousy that don't seem to be that organized this is just based on bldg 9"
"Sealed Air","Great working environment. Friendly co-workers and atmosphere. Position ended due to the recovery of the individual I was hired to fill in for."
"Sealed Air",",The company is going through a restructure and they have auditors that follow us every day. Working on the machines is like most companies. I like the work schedule and they are on top of training."
"Sealed Air",",I was happy with my job until it relocated to Charlotte, taking my job with it.  The 6 years I was there was not too bad, pay was ok.  Did not like how you had to help train new employees but not compensated for it and covering for teammates was difficult to do."
"Sealed Air",",I really enjoy working in sealed air. I am very comfortable with this place and I like how its very fast paste and I do a lot of things at once."
"Sealed Air",",Good workplace but a lot of changes have happened over the last year such as a new head quarters. The company is growing mainly oversees"
"Sealed Air",",Production lines that consist of high output with different types of sizes and lengths. The training of 10 to 15 lines that had to be obtained to move up in levels with the pay scale."
"Sealed Air",",The place is ok the company uses its employees. Is a great place to work at but not many people get hired and the  one who are hired get treated different."
"Sealed Air",",Learned integral strategies to find information through JD Edwards and input the information into the SAP ERP system. Multiple pricing, location, supplier orders to input."

"Sealed Air",",Great place to show what you are made of. Be the best at what you do and you will be rewarded at the end. Definitely give you the opportunity to learn."
"Sealed Air",",I enjoyed working with engineers and other co-workers on helping  design and build new equipment. The jobs that they had me to complete were challenging. If I had any questions there was always someone I could get the information that I needed. They made sure you had the right tools to work with or they would buy them. I really enjoyed working for this company."
"Sealed Air",",The company is overall a great place to work but more of the corporate functions are being outsourced here than any other place I've worked before. So it's great until they can fulfill your role someone where that's lower cost. It's not only the manufacturing jobs leaving the country."
"Sealed Air",",This company is pretty good and has a lot going for it in the years to come. The location I am at has a lot of interesting dynamics as it has been bought out by Sealed Air in the past few years. I like working here, but the processes for get work accomplished can be confusing and the direction the local management team wants to go is not always evident."
"Sealed Air",",self managed, manager is overworked, forced to be safety and maintenance manager and too busy to schedule work for maintenance. The employees are mostly very nice. The benefits are pretty good. Get your pre-hire agreement in writing. Mine was changed after I was hired b/c I did not have it in writing."
"Sealed Air",",I worked at Sealed Air as a contract employee and was made to feel that I was one of the team not just a contractor. It was a great experience."
"Sealed Air",",The company has excellent benefits.  The work environment was generally positive with very talented employees who cared about what they did."

"Sealed Air",",just typing 150 characters because that's what indeed is making me do, just so I can upload a new version of my resume. That's pretty ridiculous if you ask me."
"Sealed Air",",I worked in two offices for Sealed Air for over 12 years. I enjoyed meeting people from all over the world and work for great Senior management."
"Sandia National Laboratories","TRIRIGA IWMS application configuration. Worked with multiple clients and traveled extensively. Was responsible for application design and meeting face-to-face with clients."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",My typical day can sometimes be hectic but I think this is often the nature of software development. For years, Sandia has been a place where mobility has been encouraged, but over the last several years this has been less so. I have benefited greatly from the ability to move around and work outside my degree, but current leadership has made this more difficult with many on the higher echelons focused too firmly on degree status. "
"Sandia National Laboratories",",While there is a great deal to like about Sandia; management and culture is oftentimes dysfunctional. Many of the staff are great to work with but there are elements of favoritism and personalities that make getting the job done more difficult. In addition, their focus on degrees and GPAs creates an elite environment where people constantly feel the need to prove themselves and will go to great lengths to do so.  I find these facets the hardest part of working there."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",The most enjoyable part of the job is there are a lot of great and innovative people who want to achieve great things."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",Sandia National Laboratories is a well respected institution within the nuclear weapon complex as well as in the general science and engineering community. The laboratory is committed to recruiting the best and brightest individuals to carry out its mission and committed to creating solutions to the world's technical problems."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",Good place to work.  A typical day at work consists of meeting with technical experts to consult on projects of interest. My role is to provide expert statistical consulting."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",Since I'm from Albuquerque, I felt at home at SNL. I've been on the base since I was a kid and enjoyed finally being apart of the SNL family as an intern."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",Was a great place to develop research experience. Cultivated growth of employees and collaboration of ideas to move projects forward. All employees, management, staff and technicians were approachable with asking for help to solve problems."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",recommend for just about any job description whether engineering or not. onsite cafeterias, gym and auto maintenance. weather is not too hot or too cold."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",Sandia National Laboratories is a fine company to work for.  They have wonderful people and staff to work for.  The work life balance is key to being employed there."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",Sandia is a fantastic place to work.  While acclimating to the bureaucracy inherent to working in a government entity is somewhat challenging, everyone is invested in helping you succeed."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",For lower level types, it is a great place to work. However, its main reason for being (modernizing and refurbishing the nuclear weapons stockpile) is going to cease in the near future, no matter how many new projects are dreamed up to delay that and keep the money flowing. Sandia is doing its best to expand into other areas of technology, but the looming loss of the weapons is causing a huge amount of stress at the Labs, I believe."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",Great place to work for anyone."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",Management takes good care of their employees."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",Employees are given the ability to grow and gain new skills."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",Interesting place to work with many opportunities to learn. Employees are friendly. My work was a mix of CAD/FEA and hands-on fabrication."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",The people I worked with were very nice and my supervisor was wonderful.  I enjoyed the work very much, but it doesn't matter how well you do your job, if you are a contractor, their policy is that you have to leave after 3 years. The policy needs to be done away with."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",There is actually a ping pong table in the lunch room (given as an example for the review).  Sandia National Laboratories has many positives.  The work/life balance is great with healthy vacation and the 9/80 schedule where you can get every other Friday off.  There is also some incredible science that occurs.  They struggle to stay with trends, but that is related to the business and the need for stringent security.  Albuquerque is a very reasonable place to live, so your dollar will go far.  The job culture depends on the group and does vary considerably.  The hardest part may be the trend towards compliance structure (not directly tied with safety) which may or may not be conducive to research.  Historically the benefits have made up for other short comings, but the newer trend to tie benefits with a market based model has diminished some of the better attributes of working there."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",I am currently working full time at Sandia and love the job.  The problem is that the contract is running out and I have to find other employment."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",Company has great benefits and offers all the training you will need. Strict deadlines, many levels of management, and average communication. Not a bad company to work for if you don't have much of an outside life. Co-workers are good."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",This was my first project I managed and I had a lot of support and positive feedback from the engineers I worked with."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",This allowed me to implement by version and vision of project management. I had worked with other people that did not have a project management style and that caused a lot of problems."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",SNL is a great place to work.  Lots of different things to work on.  The hardest part is the security levels you have to be mindful of."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",As a student intern, I appreciate being able to make my own schedule. I appreciate how supportive they are with school. I truly believe this is the ideal job for students."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",Drive out to the remote site and make coffee, then start prepping for the job at hand.  I learned tons here...Antennas, RCS, Testing techniques and ""why"".  Management was driven by customer's needs and funding...they did a great job.  Co-workers couldn't be beat.  They were like family...and not just the few at the range, but the whole department.  Scientists with Bachelors, Masters and PhD's were the best Mentors I ever had.  The hardest part of the job was in moving all the radar absorber every week or two to set up for the next configuration...but the most enjoyable part was knowing we had all worked as a team, had fun, and got the job done, with good data going out to the customer.  This was a place where they assigned you a task, and then let you accomplish it on your own without ""Micro-Management""."
"Sandia National Laboratories",",Hardest yet most rewarding job! Challenged everyday with new projects and new ideas. SNL pushes you to your limit. You discover things in yourself you didn't know you are capable of. Overwhelming at times and empowering at other times. Must be dedicated, but will be well worth it. Perfect place to professionally grow and strengthen yourself."
"University of Virginia Health System","Fun place to work very nice people you will meet and where I work we have a good team and I enjoy coming to work I discharge  and admit people , answer phone , filing and faxing . Management is okay the hardest thing is the turnover of the patients at time the most is enjoyable part of my is meeting people and helping people."
"University of Virginia Health System",",If you want to work at a place that has the laziest managers - get a job there.  If you want to work at a place that promotes people who do terrible immoral things - get a job there.  Place is a joke.  Manager left at 3:30 on a day they KNEW night shift nurses were gonna have 9 patients a piece.  Nice!"
"University of Virginia Health System",",A typical day at work is fast paced, requiring effective communication, collaboration, and skill. Advancing your nursing education is overwhelmingly supported by CNO.  With timely notice, managers do what they can to offer flexibility with work schedules."
"University of Virginia Health System",",Coworkers are supportive. Work environment is healthy."
"University of Virginia Health System",",The hardest part of the job is actually waking up early to park your vehicle in order to get to the work site on time. Then needing to walk or be transported to the parking site after working 12 hr. shifts to go home."
"University of Virginia Health System",",Typical day consists of communicating with surgeons and other support staff as to what equipment will be needed for the surgery."
"University of Virginia Health System",",Once the that is achieved the surgery can begin. During surgery I communicate with surgeon about different aspects of what is going on. After surgery I clean and prepare equipment for sterilization according to nation healthcare regulations."
"University of Virginia Health System",",I open the department at 6:45 am . I register patients for there procedures , clinic , make the procedure packages , collect Co pays , send out return letters , do daily attendance , schedule appointments and etc.."
"University of Virginia Health System",",Slower unit, 2-6 admissions daily. Good co-workers, strong teaching environment, Salaried position in ""closed"" unit. Chief and senior residents strong advocates for nursing."
"University of Virginia Health System",",I loved my patience loved new skills.  Team work was not good, management did not help the decking situation.    For me it was a choice between home life or work."
"University of Virginia Health System",",I honestly would not recommend this job to anyone. The OR was disgusting. I saw a cockroach and killed a fly.There was always blood and tissue in the hallways. That don't have EVS so it would stay there for days. The supervisor isn't even certified, although he claims to be and he literally sits on his tail all day, even when they are short staffed, which is always.. It's a very hostile work environment. Had one girl leave because another girl was bullying her. Hours aren't flexible at all. This job was a joke."
"University of Virginia Health System",",The UVA Health System offers a stimulating work environment and constantly challenges employees to continue learning."
"University of Virginia Health System",",Performed various routine and non-routine cleaning tasks by following prescribed cleaning frequencies to insure proper building sanitation.  I got along well with co-workers and supervisors."

"University of Virginia Health System",",UVA is a great place to work because of all the different types of examinations you encounter. Working here has absolutely made me a better technologist."
"University of Virginia Health System",",At UVA my current position is Revenue Cycle Coordinator in the Pre-Arrival Unit.  We are a small group that verifies, demographics, insurance, out of pocket estimates, and auth/referrals prior to a patient having and MRI or Ultrasound.  "

"University of Virginia Health System",",  If you had a good supervisor such I have had a few times, The job,and the coworkers were great people.  The job site was very safe,and many places close by for lunch."
"University of Virginia Health System",",Unqualified management/supervisors; negative and stressful atmosphere; unappreciative; poor teamwork."
"University of Virginia Health System",",A typical day would be come in on Thursdays in three weeks apart and let 3rd year medical students learn and practice doing ultrasounds with a medical doctor present and teaching them."
"University of Virginia Health System",",Fast Paced, sometimes hectic, but overall good place to work. Gets overwhelming at times. The hardest part of the job is patients attitudes and the way they talk to you. The most enjoyable part is knowing your doing your best and that you actually like what you do. I have learned over the years to stay focused and do your job the best way you can and know how."

"University of Virginia Health System",",most day are filled with basic problems from user that can be fixed. other days are user call ing about software or hardware that we did not know we suported."
"University of Virginia Health System",",I have really enjoyed working at UVA. I was given a chance when no other place would hire me because of no experience. I came from a nursing home setting and the manger gave me a chance. I have been hear almost five years and have advanced in my skills."
"University of Virginia Health System",",I worked at UVA fulltime for one month and left due to the many patient safety issues I witnessed.  The staff training new hires were inexperienced themselves.  I never had a meeting with nursing education. On paper,  the ideas UVA says they are implementing are fantastic but in reality they are only words.  No one at the bedside has the resources to implement any of the  ideals that they preach to you in orientation. My entire experience at UVA was very disheartening.  Even when I went to the ombudsman with my concerns nothing was done."
"Adobe","Everyone is super friendly and willing to help. People are down to earth and the work was hard but manageable."
"Adobe",",Everyone is reliable."
"Adobe",",I worked at Adobe as a software development intern between June 2016 and August 2016. People here were vert nice and helpful, especially my manager. I would recommend people to apply for Adobe."

"Adobe",",I really enjoy working for Adobe, however with two small children at home I want to be in there lives more than I am due to the amount of traveling I must do in my current role."
"Adobe",",At Adobe, we create digital experiences that change the world. How? We help people bring ideas to life by creating content that makes life more fun and work more impactful. We give businesses and organizations the power to truly engage their customers. We're the ones behind the gorgeously designed content that streams across your laptop, TV, phone, and tablet every day—and we’re the ones who harness the massive power of big data to help companies find and reach the people who crave that content."
"Adobe",",Adobe has a strong culture, leadership and product suites that target Marketing Executives and core developers.  I learned a great deal from my Management and peers."
"Adobe",",Adobe is the Shangri-La of software development companies. They have excellent benefits, awesome perks, beautiful campuses, amazing people, and some very cool products. They're so good, in fact, that nobody ever leaves. This leads to pretty much the only problem: Since people typically stay their till retirement, no one ever really moves up the chain of advancement till someone retires (or, very rarely, leaves). So if you want to advance your career, you might have to leave (and might not be able to come back till someone else leaves)."
"Adobe",",I have amazing colleagues in Adobe, they are helpful and diligent. I learned first set of skills on my career path and get involved with state of art technologies. Work & life balance here is fantastic, our work is usually well scheduled that most of us find comfortable working here."
"Adobe",",Great work space and awesome co-workers"
"Adobe",",Worked with Adobe Elements"
"Adobe",",Management was great, let you do your own thing"
"Adobe",",Great Co-workers still associate with them today"
"Adobe",",Never experience anything hard about my job, if I had to say anything it was trying to get things out on time"
"Adobe",",Loved that I had my own office and never over worked"
"Adobe",",Great experience for the resume but little opportunity for career growth. The annual reorganizations confuse corporate strategy and are very disruptive to productivity."
"Adobe",",Your peers will help the best they can, but management doesn't spend any time onboarding the knowledge you need for your position. Management also doesn't spend any resources furthering your knowledge with Adobe Solutions or the industry. Their is a wiki, but it is poorly managed. Good luck finding the tools you need to actiquitedly do your job."
"Adobe",",This company micro managed. Told all day that cameras are watching. Hours were cut because I wouldn't drive bus which wasn't what I was hired for."
"Adobe",",Fun and Innovative place to work with great benefits including high quality cafeteria and gym."
"Adobe",",Everyone there is willing to take time to meet with you."
"Adobe",",Efficiency in sales, multi-tasking, and endurance is a must. The environment, management, and flexible hours for education are amazing. This job is not for the light of heart. Retention is low due to excessive stress and mental capacity required of the representative."
"Adobe",",I have experience as a graphic desinger and writer, including report, strategy and technical writing, website content, blog articles, book production, magazine articles, copy editing and marketing communications."

"Adobe",",Adobe is a great company to work for. It not only offers good benefits but also has a wonderful culture. "
"Adobe",",I was given a real project with real responsibility and was able to sink my teeth into the day-to-day life of this career. The pay was great, the benefits are great and everyone I worked with, from interns to senior executives, were lovely. A great place to work."
"Adobe",",Receiving calls and taking care of customers.  Multitudes of different computer programs to assist and complete customers requests.  The management is lacking in this business not very professional as to say the least.  Co-workers are the balance between management and daily duties.  They are what makes working for a company worthwhile and what making comes to work satisfying.  The hardest part of the job is to have to listen to people yelling, using profanity and being expected to take it as part of the job.  Not being able to interrupt and let the other person know you are here to help and to try and assist to the best of your ability.  The most enjoyable part is when a customer compliments you on a good job and making certain they have the best experience necessary to have them return to your company and the company acknowledging how wonderful you are doing with the company.  It's not always easy but colleagues as well as those wonderful customers makes it a joy to go to work and do the best that you can possibly do and go home at the end of the day with a smile on your face and a song in your heart for a job well done."
"Blue State Digital","A great home for people looking for more from their digital, marketing, political, or non-profit job. More comes in the form of a client mix unlike anywhere else. And at a company that is ultimately trying to do what's best for its people by providing a great place to work with great people and trying to do some good in the world at the same time. There are normal bumps that come with a growing company but everything is on the table for improvement. Having worked at other PR and marketing agencies the challenges and struggles at BSD are way better than at those other places."
"Blue State Digital",",Blue State Digital is a pretty unique place in my experience. 80% of the clients are either advocacy organizations or non-profits. The company does a great deal of pro-bono work and, while of course there are challenges, the focus on mission is consistent. "
"Blue State Digital",",This is a people first organization - both for the employees and the clients. The benefits are great and the culture is one of support and tolerance. People who work here are passionate about cause based work and the impact they have in the world. "
"Blue State Digital",",There are things that could be improved and sometimes the focus on non-profits means that choices have to be made about where to invest, but overall a good place to work with super talented people."
"Blue State Digital",",In any given week, you might be working on an advocacy app for a big environmental nonprofit, a community service platform for a socially-conscious Fortune 500 company, a new website for a major university, or one of BSD's own software products like QuickDonate or the BSD Tools. The mix of work and clients, plus the opportunity to work on a new or established software product, is pretty amazing."
"Blue State Digital",",Given that, BSD hires smart, creative, mission-driven people who really care about clients and their success. It's not ""just a job"" - people here are passionate about the work and often go above and beyond to find the right solution."
"Blue State Digital",",Great job environment, lack of benefits, tries not to give too much in terms of security and perks, but gives a lot to other full-time workers."
"Blue State Digital",",A young and vibrant office with bagels on Mondays, beers on Fridays, and plenty of action and interactions throughout the week. Doing good work for good organizations."
"Arena","The YMCA is a great place to work but anyone will tell you that working for a non-profit means a lot of hours for not much pay.  That other directors and CEO are great to work with.  This is one of the best environment to work in.  The down side is the hours and the time spent away from the family."

"Zillow",",Amazing perks and benefits. "
"Zillow",",Really easy to get laid off. "

"Zillow",",This company gets good reviews for good reason. Great place to work at and you truly feel like you are part of something big. There is catering on Fridays, company meetings involving inspirational speakers, they even have their own brew of beer! Although I was only there for a brief contract, it was a great and fun time."
"Zillow",",It is very much comfortable work culture and good productive company. I lent full knowledge of iOS platform and it is most enjoyable work culture."
"Zillow",",Dial for dollars is their motto, relationships and consultative selling is not their style. Ridiculous quotas set on each sales person with bullies in the back ground managing by fear and intimidation."
"Zillow",",They do not care about the workers or the real estate agents they are selling too. The turnover rate is very high. When a sell is made they celebrate while the real estate agent is still on the phone by blowing whistles and shaking party hand clappers. The managers have zero experience is managing and have no idea of what they are doing."
"Zillow",",Amazing company to work for. Great hours with a fantastic work/ life balance. The people are amazing, everyone is friendly and actually happy to be at work."
"Zillow",",Trulia/Zillow was an amazing startup, with a great culture at first.As Zillow bought it and changed the dynamic, the culture started to resemble a corporate entity more."
"Zillow",",If you like competitive enviornments, sell or be fired, this company is for you. Jump in, and be ready for a cut-throat, dog eat dog world. The CEO is awesome!"
"Zillow",",Benefits are amazing, but there is not a lot of room to grow. Management does not try and help your personal growth and development."
"Zillow",",Zillow is a great environment and company to work for. The CEO is always involved making it more personable and excited to work."
"Zillow",",Zillow is a great place to call home. I worked for two years for this company as they kept buying the companies I was working for."
"Zillow",",Great culture and would encourage anyone to apply."
"Zillow",",If this is absolutely your last option take it.  Terrible managment, training and culture.  You'll see plenty of cool aid drinkers who review Zillow but frankly don't know any better. Do yourself a favor and keep looking."
"Zillow",",Many employees unhappy and made for a non positive atmosphere.  The benefits were by far the best of any company I have worked for."
"Zillow",",A Non-Sales Viewpoint:"
"Zillow",",ZIllow has a great culture and is full of amazing and intelligent people.  If you want to work in a tech job with great work/life balance, amazing  benefits, while surrounded by smart people, you should work at Zillow."
"Zillow",",Hardest Part:  The technical challenges.  I think this should be the hardest part, because you aren't learning anything otherwise."
"Zillow",",Most Enjoyable:  Free lunches, co-workers, solving challenging problems."
"Zillow",",ps- The CEO is awesome, everyone loves him!!"

"Zillow",",Move fast, make a lot of calls, culture is good, talented managment team,"
"Zillow",",The job exposes you to a great company and bright co-workers and management. I do feel it is a bit of a treadmill type job. It's an open floor environment with heavy sales pressure. Its long days."
"Zillow",",It teaches and requires strong work ethic and thick skin."
"Zillow",",Job does have a high turn over and Zillow is OK with that because they are looking for the top 10% in sales. Any day could be your last. No big sense of job security."
"Zillow",",However, I do like the cheering and support from co-workers and the ability to learn from talented co-workers."
"Zillow",",This a perfect job for out of college but not necessarily a good long term job in inside sales. Burnout without a year."
"Zillow",",Pushes you to your daily limit. It's telemarketing and a stepping stone for something better."

"EMC Insurance",",My main job was Transcribing for the Claims Insurance Dept in Charlotte, NC. Although I did much more than that. Besides Transcribing Letters, Statements, Legal Documents, and other correspondence for about 8-9 Claims Adjusters, and Supervisor, I also performed Data Entry, Filing, Mass Copying for law suits, Mail, assisted with Accounts Receivable/Payable s when coworker was absent. I helped other coworkers with other task as needed when time permitted. I love staying busy."

"EMC Insurance",",No kidding.  I have worked at a couple of other companies, including another major insurance company, and EMC is at the top in all categories.  What a relief and refreshing change to look forward to going to work at a place where the management actually cares about you, not only as an employee, but as a person.  This includes all the managers and support people in the Home Office."
"EMC Insurance",",Insurance business is a valuable thing to learn. Many things in life you learn working close with good co-workers versus with the other. Loved working with my co-workers learning a lot from the 10 underwriters I worked with."

"EMC Insurance",",90% of files involved litigation.  Received and review transfer files when suit was filed.  Most of the time, my job involved working with local management and home office management.  Completed large loss reports and evaluated exposure(s) in order to set appropriate reserves.  Worked with defense counsel and attended mediations which involved a lot of traveling. Even though I did not work directly with my co-workers, it was a very friendly environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to travel."
"EMC Insurance",",EMC was a great place to work.  They promoted education and team work so that everyone, regardless of what department, worked together for the end result."
"EMC Insurance",",quantity of work was above average but varied greatly between inside and outside department staffs which were kept separated rather than joined. When working away from office meeting customers and clients was most joyful part of the job but was reduced due to adjustments directed by management."
"EMC Insurance",",Quality benefits was second to none."
"EMC Insurance",",Prioritizing workload with constant demands for everything on your desk to be completed that day. Underwriters were eager to teach their knowledge of things."
"EMC Insurance",",I have really enjoyed working at EMC. People are friendly and employees are treated well. My boss is very flexible to the needs of the employees within our department, making it easy to have a good work/life balance. "
"EMC Insurance",",Management was discriminating, demanding.  The company itself, based out of Des Moines, is a solid company, but the new VP gradually changed the enviroment in a negative way."
"EMC Insurance",",The corporate culture is changing at this company. It appears that the home office in Des Moines, Iowa is dictating the terms of employment and job requirements. The claims mgmt has given automy to its claims personnel until recently. Home office and the district superintendents seemed to be dictating the investigation and settlement authority. This is resulting in longer hours at work and more stress. The coworkers are great to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was the variety of cases. From munincipal/school law claims, to asbestos/prodiucts liaiblity claims to large litigated file cases involving auto/ liability claims. The hardest part of the job was wearing too many hats that involved public relations with broker/agents and meeting thoses entities expectations, and not receiving the support of management."
"EMC Insurance",",Company is small so hard to promote. Fun place to be and good atmosphere"
"EMC Insurance",",Well oiled company that provides its employees ample opportunities to grow and develop. Management is fair and easy to communicate with. The most challenging part of this job is trying to implement various changes throughout all departments. On the other hand the most enjoyable part of this job is definitely your co-workers."
"Tumblr","Tumblr was honestly an amazing place to start working because it set the standards high for all my future work environments. My managers were supportive and effective and my coworkers were friendly. "
"Tumblr",",The company fostered a really open work environment were people were encouraged to mingle with other departments and understand how other people's work affected them. I think the free food and casual atmosphere helped people take breaks and socialize when they needed to and to get more work done without burning out."
"Tumblr",",Most importantly, my job taught me how tech and social media companies work and how intellectual property laws affect them. It was a fascinating look into the way site policies were informed and reformed as well."
"Tumblr",",Tumblr has recently announced that they will start paying bloggers, however this is to come in the future. For now you need to seek third party businesses in order to monetize your site. Depending on your traffic, it is good passive income."
"Tumblr",",Great culture and growing company. Fun place to work and think on your feet. Have the ability to make an impact on the company and bottom line."
"Tumblr",",I joined Tumblr blogging web site in 2012, to share and contribute my love of the hit cable series, The Walking Dead.  The site is nicely outlined and formatted for experienced bloggers and writers to compose stories, fiction, media footage, quotes, and photos.  Many bloggers have thousands of followers, others have several hundred. Presently, Tumblr is the only media blog site I know of that is solely dedicated to Entertainment.  It also is a terrific avenue for newbies to practice and perfect their writing, designing, and blogging skills."
"Tumblr",",Tumblr has trained me for this social media frenzy of a world we live in and has taught me the essentials. Trend-forecasting and fashion history research played a major part as well."
"Polaris Industries","Polaris is a leader in the power sports industry.  The fast response to its customers and the customer loyalty is key to our success.  The environment is very fast past.  A typical day at work could be running a requirement gathering meeting, or spending an entire day transition documentation into templates.  We could have an all day/Week Testing with a project team, or a 4 hr conference call to our Asia team on training of the new software.  Creating communications to learning how to query, there is no typical day at Polaris.  The culture encourages this.  You are not a project manager, engineer, or buyer, you are a Polaris employee.  The most enjoyable part of the job is you will never get bored.  There are always a challenge."
"Polaris Industries",",location was not family oriented and hours shifted too much. no room for advancement. Pay scale was not all that well. Shifts were all over the place not very organized."
"Polaris Industries",",Fun place to work. If you enjoy talking about four wheeling in the out doors or riding motorcycles, this is the place for you. Theres  a culture. It's interesting to hear about peoples adventures."
"Polaris Industries",",My only problem really with Polaris is the pay. There are plenty of people working with the company that are definitely overqualified and don't make enough to provide for their family."
"Polaris Industries",",I learned a lot about manufacturing, partly due to to good training and partly due to onsite college courses.  Compensation was great but the job could get pretty hectic."
"Polaris Industries",",I have worked for this company for 10 years and then they said they were closing so I went to school in hopes to utilize that experience and hoping a degree in business management would help me obtain another job in either manufacturing or in a business office that I could learn and grow with all my experiences. I worked as an assembler for several years and then was in materials until I went to school. I worked in an office for three months before returning to Polaris for another two years of work. Basically I have done general labor with assembly and done shipping, receiving, parts delivery to the assembly lines, picked the parts, unloaded trailers and loaded trailers.  The company was still under part of the restructure with personnel and leadership when I decided to leave and try an office job as I was not feeling that there was much chance for advancement even with all the experience and a degree due to all the changes the company was still going through."
"Polaris Industries",",I helped start the new plant in Huntsville and it was a horrible experience. They are trying to use lean manufacturing principles but none of the management really believes in them so it's just very confusing in what's going on."
"Polaris Industries",",Its cool being able to work with power sports products and learn how they are made they supply all tools and process know how in order to have a successful productive day."
"Polaris Industries",",It's your typical production job. Nothing really exciting about it. Unfortunately lack of planning and terrible decision making by higher ups leads to a lot of ""mandatory overtime"". And mandatory means mandatory. So if you have any other commitments that are hard to handle working 6 days a week (up to 12 hours a day, with two 10min. Breaks and one unpaid 30 minute break) with the possibility of 7 days a week and holidays. then you wouldn't last long at Polaris."
"Polaris Industries",",Used to work at Polaris in Spirit Lake, Iowa. Overall the facility was nice and up to date. But, if you work on the wrong line it could be rough. Arrogant and cocky supervisors and production managers. Line Engineers who feel like they own you and place all blame on you if issues arise. Get whipped for hours in 2 months. Then everything goes stale rest of year for hours and fighting unemployment office just to get enough money for food and gas to survive. A true paycheck to paycheck job."
"Polaris Industries",",Health insurance is sky high. $1200.00 deductable per year for a single person with a 49.00 bi weekly premium and have to pay full out of pocket to go to doctor all year. "
"Polaris Industries",",Raise issues to management and they will scoff at you and push it aside. Engineers will tell you to ""figure it out yourself"" reguarding safety concerns on vehicles. And they wonder why everything is catching on fire now."
"Polaris Industries",",Only good thing is the profit sharing and nice breakrooms with catered food. Other than that nothing else. Hard to advance up the ladder unless your a woman who sleeps with the leads or flirts with them. Or your buddies with management. "
"Polaris Industries",",Line techs can be real jerks and will write you up any chance they get. They will sneak up on you at times even. If you miss one checkback. They will take a picture and make you sign a paper. Some operators down the line will sabotage you and wipe your checkback off with towels to get you in trouble."
"Polaris Industries",",Too many layoffs such as this current 2 month layoff over the holidays no less. "
"Polaris Industries",",Most co-workers here are hardcore biker type and rude. "
"Polaris Industries",",All management cares"
"Polaris Industries",",  "
"Polaris Industries",", about is their stock prices and bottom line."
"Polaris Industries",",  "
"Polaris Industries",",In my opinion, Polaris is a good place to work. I have learned about teamwork and how to interact with others. The management at Polaris is decent and they know how to get the job done. The hardest part about working at Polaris is the unset work hours. We could have a ten hour workday or an eight hour workday. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is the people I work with."
"Polaris Industries",",HR plays games with hiring qualified people. Wants to keep it local but the small town environment doesn't have the experience in manufacturing to compliment the workforce.."
"Polaris Industries",",Our processes and tools are years behind and we are are trying to play catch up."
"Polaris Industries",",Great people to work with."
"Polaris Industries",",Fast pace environment."
"Polaris Industries",",Below base salaries but huge bonuses (profit sharing) and free vehicles."
"Polaris Industries",",Co-workers for the most part were hard working and easy to get along with."
"Polaris Industries",",Could communicate openly with management. Management encouraged suggestions for making processes more efficient."
"Polaris Industries",",Expect to get work butt worked with very little appreciation, seniority means nothing! Majority of coworkers are friendly other than the negative attitudes because they are burnt out and very tired from being run ragged! A lot of people don't last long there because it is very fast pasted and they can't handle that. Most jobs on the assembly lines are either very overwhelming or to simple the jobs are not very well balanced."
"Polaris Industries",",They awesome benefits and it's a great work environment. The only downside was that the management was having trouble keeping a constant work load."
"Polaris Industries",",Be aware they have a high turn around here. They lay you off seasonally and even when you do a great job they dont call you back. They also dont do call backs. If you have had an injury on the job with them. They are great if you can get full time but if you are in the right plant that is."
"Polaris Industries",",-Hours are not flexible. Resource MFG who hires temps for Polaris  back up Polaris in the practice of giving little notice to overtime changes with little to plan for family needs or personal medical appointments. "
"Polaris Industries",", "
"Polaris Industries",",-I learned several processes to build and test motorcycle engines. "
"Polaris Industries",",-Management is not cohesive in with workers needs, e.g. if there is a bad design on the line, the worker is to blame and not the design, so workers are put into overtime and workers do a last minute shuffle with managing their personal lives on their own time like taking care of day care issues and not  being able to go to personal medical appointments.   "
"Polaris Industries",",-My co-workers are great except one, but there might always be one in any group of people."
"Polaris Industries",",-The hardest part of my job was dealing with the inflexibility of management and being isolated when I raised concerns"
"Polaris Industries",",-For the most part, my co-workers were the reason why I kept going back to work every day."
"Polaris Industries",",Great place to work, Benefits were great, Then the company decided to move to Mexico. They came back. Whish I would or could have stayed."
"Polaris Industries",",Polaris has a long way to go. Giving the benefit of a doubt they are a start up company but they are very un-organized in everything they attempt to do. Management does not have a clue and does not get in a hurry for anything. The wages are descent but the benefits are terrible so they cancel each other out."
"Polaris Industries",",A very fast paced environment. I feel that the benefits and pay are not to Alabama standards. Also that experience should count for something. The hours are also off structure for the area."

"Blue Apron",",Working at blue apron was fun.  Its easy to meet new people and gain experience in multiple areas. However at the time i was employed the management could have been way better and more professional. The environment is what cause me to quit. Great people that have bad habits and bring them to work with them. Smoking and drinking during breaks,lunch before and after work. Just not a good environment for someone trying to stay on the right path."
"Blue Apron",",I worked at Blue Apron for less than 3 months. I never ever worked in an unprofessional hood place in my life. I do not recommend working at jersey city location. Impossible to speck with management or hr if you're doing the overnight shift like i did. I will never ever work there again.

I enjoyed this job because it was challenging and allowed me to grow as a superintendent."
"USM",",Easy going environment, customer service oriented and open to ideas from employees. Friendly leadership, willing to inquire about what is going on in."
"USM",",What I didn't like about us and was then when they lost their contract and they lost the company didn't even tell us that they were going to have no more jobs so when the other company took over they didn't want us in their company they wanted to start off with new people but the only thing that they did was they wanted us to train the other people reserving it take over for they can know what we were doing for the retail store first two years company so USM never told us that we were not working we just pretty much figure it out then we weren't working anymore it didn't have no benefits no nothing I can pretty much say anything good about USM"
"USM",",Fast paced environment, people are friendly.  Worked with clients and vendors via 3rd party system. Utilize Excel mainly. Benefits are poor."
"USM",",USM, Inc and its parent company Emcor are working hard to make USM a more complete Facility Maintenance provider to Commercial Retail Clients.  "
"USM",",My experience at USM has been a positive one that I am looking to take on to my next position to expend upon and grow my knowledge even further."
"USM",",The company overall was average or just below average. My department, procurement, was better than most, but quite understaffed & underpaid. I enjoy a very fast paced challenging work environment, so I liked a lot of overtime & a lot of demands on my time."
"USM",",All I really did here was sit in a art gallery and count the people that came in. It was a different experience for me and it was fun at the same ti,e."
"USM",",Great team of people to work with. The company encouraged teamwork, integrating innovative solutions to complex problems, and being part of something bigger than a company."
"USM",",This company is now on it's third owners in 9 years.  The new owners are concentrating on reducing the janitorial service division and moving snow operations to their Phoenix, AZ office."
"USM",",USM is fair and supportive. The atmosphere is relaxed yet professional. There is a rewarding feeling working at the university because there are diverse groups of people and it is a learning environment."
"USM",",work days are steady.i learned many new skills. reading drawings,painting,fabricating,managing jobs,expenses,co-workers are easy to work with. the most enjoyable part is finishing a project and the customer was happy with the finished project."
"USM",",Produce positive results in dealing with irate customers throughout the day with keeping up with the quality control of work for pre/post confirming service."
"USM",",I adored this job and the people I worked with. The days were really busy, but there was always something to be completed."
"USM",",This company terminated me after a major auto accident and hospitalization/surgery.  Without contact or warning. I would not recommend anyone to work for this company."
"USM",",decent place to work. Although we experienced numerous layoffs and attrition rates upwards of 60%. Management was resistant to fresh ideas. Definitely a ""boys club"" culture. Bottom line, it gets you procurement experience for better jobs. Not the most sophisticated procurement minds leading."
"USM",",Worked on vendor management side of janitorial. Traveled western Michigan and Western Wisconsin inspecting national account. Maintaining contractual scope of work with vendor"
"USM",",This was the biggest learning experience for me. There was ample opportunity for someone to do more work. The work was demanding and failure was not an option."
"USM",",The job is your basic call center job.  The work can get very mundane.  It's a nice starting job, but not really for a lasting career. The co-workers are the best part of the job.  Some are very helpful and make the job experience more enjoyable."
"UPMC","Many different fields available.  Reasonable pay scale, some benefits are good, some not so good.  "
"UPMC",",Dignity and respect is a big part of the rhetoric.  Regular staff members work well together.  Middle managers relate fairly well with employees under them as far as I've seen.  Upper management is distant from the regular staff."
"UPMC",",I worked in a grant funded program for a number of years. I hate that I stayed as long as I did. It was a terrible environment and culture. The director did not have adequate experience for the role. The whole program suffered from gross lack of skill  and experience on many levels. The work was wonderful, but the environment was so awful I had to leave. The salaries are much lower in the system as well.  Do not expect to stay market competitive if you stay in the system long. They do not promote equity, despite being a very profitable organization. They claim non-profit but continue to grow and expand, but fail to pay all employees equitably.  I don't respect UPMCs wage practices, but I do feel there are redeeming qualities, like good PTO and insurance.  At the end of the day, I did choose to stay with the system after leaving the grant program. So far I am happy I remained with UPMC, but I remain cautious as well.  If you are choosing a position at UPMC, be careful. Ask a lot of questions. Get to know the manager or leadership as much as possible before hiring. Ask about their background and experience leading teams (before their current position).  Talk with real, frontline staff. Ask about turnover.  Pick a healthy culture."
"UPMC",",The job is ok. They lie to you about how long the position is. Everything else is good though. Nice place to work with the right management"
"UPMC",",Flexible work schedules a plus!"
"UPMC",",Excellent benefit package"
"UPMC",",401k and savings plan"
"UPMC",",Dignity and Respect are a value of the employee experience and are a part of your employee performance review."
"UPMC",",Great employer, good benefits. You have opportunities to advance if you work hard and put forth your best effort at work."
"UPMC",",Work was given on a schedule and most times there was time to complete it. Any questions I had were anwered ... most times very timely."
"UPMC",",typical work day was fast pace. Different manager all the time. Met a lot of nice people. Enjoyed working on a team. Learned a lot about leading a team. Hardest part was parking and the ride up  to the hospital."
"UPMC",",I was an intern at UPMC in 2013 and it was a great first clinical experience. Most of my time was spent at Children's Hospital on the hematology/oncology floor. While it was a emotionally trying environment, everyone that worked on the floor and in the whole building tried their best to make clients feel welcome and important. I would recommend others to apply for a position at UPMC."
"UPMC",",I was just an intern for 3 months. I relocated to Pittsburgh for that time just to complete my rotations. All of the employees are wonderful and I really learned a lot."
"UPMC",",busy I have been a nurse for many years like the field work well with others cant complain too much think nurses in pa do not make enough money for how hard it is"
"UPMC",",Good Workplace & Great Benefits"
"UPMC",",Average Management, Could be better overall"
"UPMC",",Enjoyable part was working with great people and meeting patients"
"UPMC",",Management don't have a clue of what they are doing. Waste of time on guess work and wasted effort. They are covering their backs with each other's  pretending they know their system but what they really are is lying to their teeth by hiding their weakness to get paid pretending others to perform their work."
"UPMC",",umpc is a good and growing company, but in my time there I encountered a lot of racism and very poor manegment. I am currently a flex full time worker so I usually never see a whole 40 hours a week. so for that reason I wish to leave this company"
"UPMC",",Nice working day and nice.Did patient care and safety and vital signs and patient moniting, patient advocacy and support. Participartes in   charting, ording and receiving supplies."
"UPMC",",Fill the beds and cut the staff is UPMC's bottom line. Expect a patient load of 7+ with no ancillary help. Breaks are not an option either. Hopefully you can hold your bladder 12 hours!"
"UPMC",",The management at UPMC could use serious improvement. Micromanagement is one word I would best describe my current experience.  Although I have been at my current position for a couple years, after transferring to another department I feel that none of my skills are valued here."
"UPMC",",I have learned a lot about the medical field, claims, and medical insurance in a friendly environment with very helpful superiors."
"UPMC",",Amazing benefit options! Fairly flexible work schedule. Great management! Many opportunities for advancement! Amazing staff and learning opportunities."
"UPMC",",Great place to work.  Largest employer in Western Pennsylvania, thus ample opportunity for lateral and vertical movement.  Would highly recommend to anyone interested in working at UPMC."
"UPMC",",UPMC has a great culture and is a great company to work in overall. Depending on the department I've heard mixed things, but anyone working in IT is going to be under paid and working a lot of overtime I'll tell you that much."
"UPMC",",Petty drama filled gossipy filled workers.HR non compliment with sign on bonus.Fair scheduling. Patients taken care of regardless. If you have a low tolerance for drama I wouldn't recommend herritage."
"Newsela","Nobody at Newsela has a j-o-b. Everyone is in it for the mission, which is spreading literacy. But it isn't a slow-moving non-profit. It is a tech startup with a real heart. The work is ever-changing and challenging but the thing that keeps most people going is the constant feedback we get from our users who are all teachers and students. They're vocal about what they love and that's what fires us up. "
"Newsela",",Everyone in the company has a passion for either reading, language or education and its ultimate promise. It's what bonds us together because we're otherwise quite a diverse group of people with very different skills and backgrounds (teaching, programming, journalism, etc.). "
"Newsela",",The management is human-oriented. They give people ownership over their own work and are very understanding. There's a culture of humor and a fun rivalry between the East Coast and West Coast offices. Everyone generally cares about one another and looks after one another. "
"Newsela",",Hardest part of the job is trying to fulfill all that is asked of us from users while we're still a startup and relatively small in terms of staff, but that's also what gives everyone the chance to wear several hats and take a hand in many different parts of the company. The general sense of growth is thrilling."
"Newsela",",I have great coworkers and feel like a very valued member of a team that does amazing work for K-12 students. The team at Newsela is small, but mighty, especially the team that runs its site content. Every employee brings their own set of skills, learning experience and creative ideas to the company."
"Newsela",",Management is run in a way that strongly values what all of our team members think and no ones voice falls on deaf ears."
"Hancock Holding Company","Hancock Holding Company is a very stable company with good leading management.  However, like most companies there are few middle managers who are too self adsorbed and more interested in advancing their career than taking care of their direct reports."
"Hancock Holding Company",",Hancook its a good temporary job, you learn different skills from there to some of the jobs be hard but its not nothing bad or nothing I couldn't handle"

"Hancock Holding Company",",answered phones and greeted customer coming in for appointments or questions.  Processed legal documents for recording and then shipped loans to lender that purchased the loan."
"Hancock Holding Company",",Thoroughly enjoyed my venture into banking with this company.  I discovered very quickly that the lending industry is one of the most competitive and stressful in the financial sector, and that I was not quite prepared for that level of expectation at this stage in my life."
"Hancock Holding Company",",The pay and benefits are excellent for the position I qualified for, however company restructuring along with FinTech advancements could quickly alter the lending products and services distribution system.  Be prepared for the necessary changes!"
"Hancock Holding Company",",The working environment is fast paced. It also challenges you in productivity and learning procedures for scanning documents into the database."
"Hancock Holding Company",",I worked for this company for almost a year. I was 1 day short of working the first quarter of the year when I left.  They denied me my incentive pay because I was 1 day short!!! 1 day!!! They owed me over $500 and pretty much stole it from me... Just because I guess they can!  This company only cares about the money they can make themselves not at all about the employees! The employees are only numbers not people! I have been in banking for years and this is the worst bank I have ever worked for! Please save yourself the heartache and loss and look elsewhere for employment."
"Hancock Holding Company",",Benefits good. Managers are rude no knowledge of their job. Always drama with management. Very dysfunctional! By far the worst department! High turn over rate. No one listen. Some managers acts bias and racists! Facts!!!!"
"Hancock Holding Company",",This was my first job out of the NAVY.  Everyone in the staff was very cordial and able to train me and answer questions.  Management was always available to help, correct any errors and guide me.  "
"Hancock Holding Company",",I learned a lot about customer service, telephone etiquette, patience and prioritize the work load."
"Hancock Holding Company",",At this job you are always learning new ways to save money and to place money in more suitable accounts that best fit customer's lifestyle as well as yours. A typical day at the bank is fast pace and being a busy bee. The co-workers act as a team and once you show them you are dependable they make you feel part of the team."
"Hancock Holding Company",",If it weren't for my husband's job causing us to move back to Texas I would have stayed with them indefinitely! I especially liked the core values that were vital to the management and foundation of the company."
"Hancock Holding Company",",Relaxed place to work / What you would think of working in the South / Stable job outlook. Bank will not grow unless it buys another (smaller) bank. Not very many young people in the organization."
"Hancock Holding Company",",At this financial establishment I learned an exceptional amount of financial education that I took with me to other places of employment. Hancock bank was a stepping stone. I enjoyed working for this financial institution."
"Hancock Holding Company",",This is a call center, so if you are not used to being yelled at all day by strangers who overdraw their accounts and don't know how a debit card works then this may not be the place for you. Most of the people who work here are not college educated so expect to be amongst a certain ""class"" of individuals. The pay isn't all that great and you will have to work until 7pm and every Saturday until 2pm when you start. If you have a family, this schedule will be quite inconvenient. They write you up for having your mobile phone on your desk. They want you to be ""customer focused"". But you barely get a chance to breathe because the calls come in back to back from the time you log into the phone until the time you log off. You have the opportunity to get a bonus if you meet your quality assurance goals. However, the quality advisors who listen to calls find every reason to give you a low score on your calls. So don't expect to get the bonus often. If you can't find anything and you just need some money coming in (which was the situation in my case) this will get you by. You may end up on anti-depressants and begin to hate people, but hey, it's a job."
"Hancock Holding Company",",I worked as a teller helping customers with their banking needs such as deposits, check cashing, & making payments. Also helped them over the phone."
"Hancock Holding Company",",Hancock Holding company has great pay and benefits.  Also, great opportunity for advancement in career choices.  Facilities are outstanding."
"Hancock Holding Company",",Collecting on the phones for risk management of overdrawn checking accounts, past due loans. I learned how not to manage employees. Most of my coworkers just did enough to get by. Dealing with the abuse of management and the different rules that were enforced by different supervisors in the same department. The steady pay and time off."
"Ind-US Target LLC","It is a great place to learn and grow into the role that you like to pursue. The management is very helpful and flexible with ideas and new business improvements."
"Ind-US Target LLC",",I like the fact that from the time I get into work till the time a leave (which I normally stretch over working hours), I am on my toes and loaded with productive work to do. I like my co-workers and in smaller companies it is important to glue into the workforce and help each other out, which is exactly what happens at Ind-US Target."
"Ind-US Target LLC",",The most enjoyable part of my job is when I land a new client and we make our first join. At Ind-US Target we get appreciated for our efforts and the incentive scheme is off the roof."

"TIAA",",I wish I never step foot there."
"TIAA",",Excellent company to work for as they provide opportunity to make change.  Diversified company that is looking for next opportunity for growth in the market."
"TIAA",",People are terrific and the benefits are excellent.  Long work hours required for the job make work life balance hard.  Management does not  listen when advice is given regarding improving the work flow."
"TIAA",",The environment there was great, especially dealing with your peers which is always helpful. Management was up and down. Overtime was available. There was a lot of training."
"TIAA",",A typical work day: "

"TIAA",",I'm grateful for the 4 1/2 years I worked at TIAA. I worked from home for over half the duration of my contract. I wasn't working for the company directly, but was a contract worker through a staffing agency. I gained a lot of experience doing web content management: building and editing web pages in Fatwire. I also performed a lot of admin/clerical work for the team as well. I'd say that my experience with the company was a great one. They are very successful and are continuing to grow."
"TIAA",",They tell you that you need to have series 7 & 63 licenses and insurance licenses to help clients with their investment needs."

"TIAA",",You are tied to a phone all day an MICRO MANAGED."
"TIAA",",Once you make it through their poor training program, they are always looking for ways to terminate you."
"TIAA",",The only people at TIAA-CREF that have job security are the trainers, because 25% of the new hires don't make it through training, 50% of the people who do make it through quit the job in 6 months, and the other 20% are forced out by managers who put the blame on their poor performance on you, to save their own jobs."

"TIAA",",Overall I appreciate the opportunity to work at TIAA (Operations Department) serious issues between Management and Employees,  constant change in procedure, long work hours sometimes, competitive pay, great benefits with multiple options."
"TIAA",",TIAA was a great place to work for.  I always enjoyed being able to learn and the opportunities.  It started to change when the company believed it needed to make changes by laying off and not offering job security.  It was believed if someone was there longer than 5 years it was bad.  If you get a job there try to stay with the business that is client facing.  Client facing groups have the best training and upper management values the input and work of everyone."
"TIAA",",Good company to work for. If you work in CO, or NC there are more opportunities to grown with in the company. nothing more ......................................................................"
"TIAA",",Management is amazing and the work culture is second to none.  Everyone is on the same path for greatness and strives to make the company better.  Worked part time during the school year (minimum 20 hours)  and full time during the summer."
"TIAA",",Constant change and re-organization.  Middle management is very confused.  They hire and fire at random with no thought. Most are trying to climb the corporate ladder and only care about themselves.  They gave no idea about teams.  Lot's of politics!  Lot's of drama!  Be careful when you see someone smiling at you, your demise will follow shortly.  Not many happy people working here.  ""When's the next firing""?  There is no trust of the company and their managers."
"TIAA",",Management was unorganized and didn't know how to manage work or how to assign correct people to support which components.  "
"TIAA",",It was not understood sometimes the flow of Single Sign On and which component was needing support."
"TIAA",",Excellent understanding of various types of Rules like Product rules, Correspondence rules, Integration rules, Rule set management and associated tools such as export & import tools."

"TIAA",",Was a good working environment with work from home options. The managers were good and a lot of opportunity to grow. The jobs are demanding and we have to get used to it ourselves."
"TIAA",",TIAA is a great place to work as long as you're not in operations. Operations is treated with less respect and zero chance of advancement, unless you stay in operations. The whole company views operations less than equal business partners. The managers are the absolute worse and are bitter themselves due to the treatment. The goals are unrealistic and provide little hope of ever achieving them. Morale is at an all time low due to the goals and poor leadership. Other areas in TIAA treat their teams with gratitude and appreciation. This shows in their pay and extremely attractive bonuses. Just stay completely away from operations at all cost."
"TIAA",",I loved my supervisors and my team. Very welcoming and helpful on my journey. Sad the job is just a contact position I wish it could have been longer!"
"TIAA",",it was a pleasure working with Tiaa in a  good environment with such a good co-operating management and a good coordination with team mates and colleagues."

"Big Fish","As a server and this higher end restaurant I learned to multi-task in a high stress environment.  I thoroughly enjoyed my co-workers and management while employed here.  The hardest part of this position was at times the work load became more than one person can handle.  Example, when we got extremely busy and were short staffed.  During these times I did the best I could to get everything done in an efficient and timely manner while displaying excellent customer service.  During my employment here I worked my way up to be a certified trainer for new employees."
"Big Fish",",Tough company to work for. Very little thought to the staff. All that mattered was the job. Everybody was replaceable at the drop of the hat."
"Big Fish",",Big Fish is a solid start up with fun products and services to work with. "
"Big Fish",",The benefits are great (gym in the building, bus pass, 401(k) with matching, medical/dental, stock options), and your colleagues will probably become dear friends of yours. The CEO has solid vision for the company."
"Big Fish",",The downsides are evident, though: management gets juggled around quite a bit and new managers are sometimes less qualified than the people they're managing. The rate of turnover has risen recently because of this."
"Big Fish",",If you do what you're told and do it beyond expectation, then you will thrive here."
"Big Fish",",The company feels like it outgrew itself, and people are seeing the result of it now. Too many people in middle management, and not enough of those people are effective at encouraging change, and instead seem content to do their jobs as long as it ""works"". "
"Big Fish",",Nearly everyone I work with is friendly, however, and there isn't a lot of catty personal drama here. Though it exists, just like anywhere else. "
"Big Fish",",If you can get hired on, this is a good place to learn new skills, and then take them elsewhere, as you will likely reach a point within a few years where your pay no longer matches your work load."
"Big Fish",",we work from Monday to Saturday the management is good my co worker are fun to be with"
"Oracle","Great place to work, if you like corporate life. Really great upper management, but like any large company, communication seems to take forever. Since we got hacked it’s been a customer service nightmare. I think Oracle bought Micros because they had a plan in mind but whatever that plan was, it’s slowly falling apart."
"Oracle",",Oracle is very professional and laid back company. The hours are long and can sometimes be a bit much but at the end of the week it's always worth it."
"Oracle",",I loved working here.  Daily there would be something new to challenge me, a new acquisition, new policy, new process, new contract, new negotiation.  "
"Oracle",",I loved the people, who are still some of my favorite people and friends.  I had fun working at Oracle, because of the people and the enthusiasm that my colleagues and I had over what we were doing. "
"Oracle",",There were always challenges, good and bad.  I regret leaving there."
"Oracle",",Oracle have no regard for their employees. when they have lay offs they keep everything quite until the day, then you're called into the office and that's it, done. You get 3.5 weeks vacation max, then they make you take a week Christmas, and tell you they are doing you a favor.  If you get a 1.3% pay raise you are lucky, then come open enrollment, they up your payments by 1.4%. By far the worst compeny I have ever worked for."
"Oracle",",If you're a recent college grad this is a good job to start building your resume career - especially for a career within sales. However, change is extremely constant which could get stressful. 2 year position max."
"Oracle",",The place was nice to work because of the people around are very professional, knowledgeable and friendlly. Management are very helpful. The only setback was Oracle US based employees works long hours because of job reduction here in the US."
"Oracle",",Good Professional Services company with lot of challenging consulting engagements that requires lot of travel across America and good pay and benefits however limited scope for advancement."
"Oracle",",Management just hasn't figured out how to structure the company efficiently. For sales reps it's sink or swim. Also, no correlation to pay. You could do nothing and make a lot of money, and you could work hard and make nothing."
"Oracle",",Typically, I would answer between 5 to 10 calls per day dealing with a variety of issues dealing with a software under the acquired company Micros, which services the food and beverage/hospitality industry."
"Oracle",",I learned many troubleshooting/IT skills, organizational and productivity skills, time management, attention to detail, problem solving, etc."
"Oracle",",Management is constantly monitoring your metrics (how long you took to answer the call, how long you were on the call, etc.)"
"Oracle",",On days that are less busy, such as a Saturday, many employees would be found surfing the internet and social media."
"Oracle",",The hardest part about the job is receiving adequate training using real scenarios. I don't think there has been a day where I haven't had to ask for help on something. Had I received training on all of the facets of the product I supported, resolving issues would be a lot easier."
"Oracle",",The easiest part of the job comes when there aren't any calls coming in. This gives you time to work on other cases, personal endeavors, etc."
"Oracle",",Oracle is a fun place to work with. Job work/ Life balance is the best thing I like in Oracle. The most enjoyable part of the job is working on the cutting edge technologies;"

Trend there is: one real person work will be tied to minimum of 4-5 levels/layers of different other folks related or not before it goes to some little use. In simple words of summary ""sincere and hardworking folks continue to be poor(all aspects), political, influenced and tribal nature folks continue to be rich(all aspects) irrespective of tech skills or talent"
"Oracle",",Oracle has its up and downs. The typical day depends on what your doing and it is more based on a sales role. For me it was talking to customers and fixing problems that goes along in their environment. It depends what you want to do."

"PAREXEL",",Changing goalposts come review time, inconsistent and contradictory demands made on my time by the various managers. Very Hierarchical structure with little chance of promotion and very poor wages."
"PAREXEL",",Middle and upper management have absolutely no respect for non-management, and the culture is such that their subordinates are deliberately demoralised to ""keep them in line"" and is probably why now after years at the company I don't feel confident enough to leave and find another job."
"PAREXEL",",Workers are expected to put in long unpaid additional hours."
"PAREXEL",",The company cuts corners and employees are forced to cover-up for these when dealing with customers."
"PAREXEL",",The on-site food is good, and generally the other non-management employees are good humoured in a sort of ""all in the same boat - without a paddle"" kind of way."
"PAREXEL",",Management lies to get people to accept a position. Then HR defends them. Just an unethical company with people who have low to no morals. Additionally, they expect you to work, work, work and if you need to take some time for yourself for a doctor appointment or such they want you to make up the time when you are working well over 60+ hours a week. Horrible culture from the top down!"
"PAREXEL",",Fast passed, leading edge global company with a diverse talent pool."

I enjoyed working with sites and co-workers to help get a protocol started in a timely manner.  We worked at a fast pace and always willing to help each to make the project successful."
"PAREXEL",",The people at the company are great.  co-workers are very supportive. Management is bad. Productivity is measured by numbers which is fine except management keeps changing what is important and defining goals that are loaded with buzzwords but are fundamentally useless on a day to day basis.  Learning is OJT which is fine. there is always a budget crisis.  But the people are really great and the sense of humor at non management levels is enjoyable."
"PAREXEL",",Company is growing rapidly and hiring many new employees. Great co-workers! Work life balance is not a priority for management."

Teach ceramics class, weekly chess class, monitor and run basketball leagues.  Customer service for membership cards and always be aware of safety."
"City and County of Denver",",If you are friends with your supervisor then you can have a peaceful work environment. If you are not a Black person you will have a peaceful work environment. Not a great department to work for, Public Works Transportation and Mobility is not for you if you are Black. You will not get trained correctly, you will not get spoken to, you will not get treated equally. Very unorganized department. All the supervisors need to be trained on how to be a supervisor. If you are smarter than most people in the department they will make feel uncomfortable. They only Black in the department is the HR rep. Warning stay away this department will never be ran correctly as long as the same people are in this department. They lack customer service, they are rude to citizens that have to call in."

"City and County of Denver",",While there is great job security and the compensation was fair, the government moves too slowly and employees are not motivated. An enjoyable position that gave me plenty of experience working with different personalities. Doesn't appear to be much development or advancement. Slow moving."

"City and County of Denver",",as long as you're popular you do not need to know anything, as a matter of fact the less you know the better because they want to teach you how to be a plumber. the weeks leading up to and after holidays are nightmares, there is dog do on the bathroom floors from travelers companion dogs, and you spend your day unclogging toilets. about half the workers are trying to do a good job but its run by seniority, you can start a project and when someone who has been there a day longer than you comes along, you have to do it his way until someone else comes along that has more seniority then the last guy and then you have to change and do it allover, managers have abdicated all responsibility and your coworkers rate you for merit, not the supervisors and not the public, so if you like to play suck up than this is the place for you. the most enjoyable part was helping travelers and thinking you were making a positive impact on the public's travels."

In my job I spent a significant amount of time in the offices of other companies and I have to say that I always felt very lucky to work for Denver when comparing office comfort.  The office areas are very modern and well kept, the management has always been very good about providing good quality office furniture, the security in the building includes staff and metal detectors.  While the pay at the City of Denver is only in the mid-range of the pay scale for professionals such as myself, the benefits are good, the working conditions are great, and they are located at the Webb Building in upper downtown Denver and has very nice views from the 10th floor of the mountain range, the Civic Center Park, and is one block from the pedestrian mall with all the amenities of a big downtown locale."

"City and County of Denver",",Working for a Govt Agency as a professional Tax Auditor can be very stressful as you are in a negative relationship with everyone you contact, and you are also answerable to the City to meet fairly rigorous efficiency and quantitative expectations.

"City and County of Denver",",I worked seasonal but my body could not so the work load, great manager, pay and people to work with. You get easy work and hard work. early morning shift."
"City and County of Denver",",A typical day at work means you don't know what's coming your way.  You deal with everyday people AND government officials, so you have to be prepared for anything.  They often set up the lobby area with tv news reporters interviewing government officials, and heads of departments, so you could be walking past them at any given time to walk to another department on that floor.  You may attend meetings with officials or employees of theirs.  The building has security, so be prepared to walk through metal detectors, just like the airports.  It's easy to network here.  It's a nice place to work.  They post job openings, so if you're looking for job advancement and you have the skills for a higher level job, it's not hard to apply.  If you network with the right people, ask for a personal reference from them, you could land a GREAT job. The best part is the benefits.  When you get a government job, you CAN'T get laid off.  Raises may be hard earned though.  The economy isn't that great.  There are 13? holidays on the calendar.  You get most of them off - paid."
"City and County of Denver",",Required long working hours, with lack of management recognition of what was actually required to do the job.  Issues with co-workers, such as hostility in the workplace, were not addressed proactively.  Also,  uneven workloads - those who are most productive carry too much of the workload.  Management support was not always there when it was needed.   Many dedicated co-workers and ability to work interdisciplinary projects a plus."
"City and County of Denver",",I had twenty four years with the City of Denver, and unfortunately I was dismissed without rational or viable justification. I am so appreciative that I was vested and had a stable job so it wasn't in vain, I was vested and currently drawing my pension. I won't complain or be negative just thankful for the time and experience I gained during my employment with the City of Denver."

"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Learned a lot. This was fun at work. Pay was not competitive. The job was hard with the long hours. Loved my staff, they sold well. Went the restaurant as outing once a week. Paid for lunches at all out events. Met lots of famous people when flown out the beach vacations with the CEO."
"Massachusetts Institute of Technology",",Depending on where you work at MIT depends upon your experience. Overall the community is made up of extremely kind and impressive people. However retention of current employees is not a priority combined with illegal human resources practices I would carefully ask questions of your supervisor and get everything in writing. The policies that are listed on the website are not necessarily institute wide. Also there is a huge difference in benefits for salary and non salary employees. I believe MIT was a great employer at one time, however I can say my experience and several other individuals was poor. The vacation and benefits are excellent. Work life balance is difficult. Culturally it is a very unique place to work which I loved. My biggest complaint is human resources and they have one of the largest departments and are easily the least helpful."
"Massachusetts Institute of Technology",",I enjoy my work at MIT for its work place culture. People respect each other and we all work our best to make everyday tasks go through smoothly. The hardest part of my job it to resolve conflicts between lab members; however, it does not happen often."

"Allstate Insurance","Agency Owner is an awesome person and the staff us very friendly and they are very helpful. A lot of room for growth and a lot of potential to make a lot of money. Definitely a company worth working at."
"Allstate Insurance",",very document driven environment and management micro managing your work. old working style of employees who's been there for a life time."
"Allstate Insurance",",Good place to work if you enjoy helping/assisting others with issues, concerns, and situations. There were job benefit package. Job could be stressful at times and really didn't have a lot of opportunity for growth once you reach lead/manger status, other than getting insurance license and becoming an insurance agent of claim adjustor"
"Allstate Insurance",",A typical workday for me consists of making phone calls to potential clients and establishing relationships with centers of influence. With Allstate I am able to use ALL of my insurance licenses, to be of better service to my clients. Allstate stands by the philosophy that the customer should be in good hands and it definitely feels that way since working for the company."
"Allstate Insurance",",Not too stressful of a job except it's getting hard to make sales with new eligibility rules. Very flexible with my schedule and comfortable work culture"
"Allstate Insurance",",I really enjoy working at allstate. But, big changes in the auto claims process may eliminate the my field claims adjuster job. I am being proactive and searching for other potential options."
"Allstate Insurance",",A typical day of work was answering calls and selling insurance."
"Allstate Insurance",",It was a great job, but management was not the best, some managers are not looking to improve their employees..."
"Allstate Insurance",",The environment provides fun experience that condones togetherness to achieve a common goal. Management provides  an opportunity to learn and grow within the company."
"Allstate Insurance",",Fast paced and busy. A competitive work environment. Sometimes busy to the point that it is hard to get to take a break or a lunch. Other than that I enjoyed talking with people on the phone and helping them to select benefits for themselves and their family."
"Allstate Insurance",",At Allstate Insurance I sold Insurance to customers who were not insured with Allstate Insurance; who I offered a quote to.  I enjoyed the customers, and being able to save them money on  what they needed to insure."
"Allstate Insurance",",Good management, lots of nice co-workers, fairly easy work. Hardest part was trying to find someone to help another person in rural areas. I learned better phone etiquette and also to be more precise with information, more to the point. I enjoyed the easy going customer and turning a angry customers situation into a positive one by getting them the help they needed. Sometimes I had to clean up another reps mistakes or service providers, but as long as the customer received their service I did my job correctly."
"Allstate Insurance",",Not knowing that allstate is an individually owned company there were alot of questions that were not answered while I was there. Pay was great at first but was changed."
"Allstate Insurance",",Demanding job, however, lots of perks and opportunities for career advancement.  Good work/life balance, company holidays, PTO and other benefits to employees."
"Allstate Insurance",",Was told on the initial interview that there was plenty of room for growth after coming in at the entry level position. After several years of working in the same department and several interviews later no advancement had happened. Low pay/hard work and production goals to meet."
"Allstate Insurance",",Allstate product is competitive and offers some very enticing coverage options.  Make sure you work in an established office opposed to a new agency.  The only issue I have come across is lack of focus and direction with many new owners."
"Allstate Insurance",",Business model for financial services is a good one; however, management commitment to its implementation is sorely lacking.  As a result, opportunities for meaningful partnerships with more established agencies are slim."
"Allstate Insurance",",I learned a lot working for All State insurance company. The hours were long but I still liked the job. I think I could have stayed there but I was only temporary."
"Allstate Insurance",",Allstate is a great company to work for. They do care about their employees a lot and the environment is very supportive. I would recommend working here!"
"Allstate Insurance",",Great work atmosphere and culture. Everyday is structured with the same schedule but many fun activities and team bonding experience are incorporated as much as possible. Management is very understanding and resourceful with assisting in daily work."
"Allstate Insurance",",When I was there, I enjoyed the employee appreciation days where they held little activities and also the performance bonuses yearly. The benefits were good the flexibility with sick time and time off were okay as well, I did not though agree with their ever changing metrics, and updates to the employee money. Such as the sales or cross selling opportunities they were capped when before they were not and motivated the employees to definitely strive to become better then themselves."
"Allstate Insurance",",Hard company to work for. Management has NO clue on the work load, how to handle there employees and only cares about numbers. There is zero room for advancement.  The office is run by a bunch of young kids who have no knowledge of how to get things done! Over the years it has been like a revolving door.  If you can't keep up with the work load they fire you or employees just quit.   There are no teaching moments.I truly have nothing positive to say  and that is sad!!"
"CSX","Great pay but questionable practices.  Safety important but efficiency overshadows safety."
"CSX",",at csx you are required to be on call 27/7, work many different jobs, and dont know if you will be laid off from week to week,but pay is great and they offer the best insurance i have ever had."
"CSX",",There is continued change. Seniority fluctuates. Very difficult to have a structured family life. Great pay and benefits. A typical yard day is from 8 to 12 hrs long. Switching cars and building outbound trains."
"CSX",",A great place to work. Benefits are second to none. A company where you can stay 30 years and be proud to work for. Great place if you like to live in different locations."
"CSX",",This carrer allowed me to grow as a person and as a profectional it was gratifying knowing i help move the country and entrusted with such a large task"
"CSX",",Great job with great pay, but absolutely no security. Management could not care less about our job and the company constantly cut or relocated jobs for no reason. The company always preached safety but would expect you to break rules in order to get the job done faster."
"CSX",",Strong Union environment and many day to day obstacles. Great company to retire from for benefits and rail road retirement benefits."
"CSX",",●	Responsible for knowing and complying with yard and road characteristics of qualified territory including , local and line of road customers "
"CSX",",●	Safely performed engineering duties by operating OTE to inspect, repair or replace track when needed "
"CSX",",●	Played a role in rehabbing 4.6 miles of main line in June 1992 while mitigating customer impact.  "
"CSX",",●	Engaged customers on a daily basis by providing switching services as requested"
"CSX",",Great job, great co-workers but a big turn around in management. Hard to get used to a good boss before they transfer or leave the company."
"CSX",",Work day may consist of any where from 8 to 16 hour workdays. I learned a great deal of loading procedures and operating front loaders for containers. Management was ok but only worried about the job and not the employees. The hardest part of the job was the long hours that was demanding and the most enjoyable part was working with others to accomplish the goals for the day."
"CSX",",Switching out freight cars to build outgoing trains"
"CSX",",Learned the importance of safety and working as a team"
"CSX",",Hardest thing to deal with was the weather and being outside in all the elements."
"CSX",",Management is very strict on how the job has to be done."
"CSX",",Even though being outside in rain or shine I enjoyed doing it."
"CSX",",Great benefits, good retirement. Can be seriously dangerous if you arent alert and safety conscious. A lot of nepotism among higher management.  An insurance policy known as ""run-off "" insurance is a must. Everyone that works as union labor has been run-off at least once. Many rules are arbitrary and pointless. Many managers are nothing more than rule enforcing evaluators with no job experience. A lot of managers have a quota of discipline. In Jacksonville Division, a manager was required to have 60 test failures per month. Most resulting in days off without pay. The other engineers and conductors were great comrades and friends, trying to do the job safely and remain injury free. All while locked in an adversarial relation with managers who were expected and pressured to fire them. Money was good. Stress terrible."
"CSX",",Csx is a very rewarding company to work for as a carman. There is routine but something different every day. Hard work, but you are rewarded for it. Great benefits, medical, retirement, holidays etc."
"CSX",",This job is very rewarding. Each day you go in, you're assigned a route for the day, or days. Typically you stay in a hotel for the night of your trip, or at least in my experience as a conductor. They pay is very well for not having a college degree. Although you are not guaranteed holidays or weekends, that's told upon interview. You're on a 24/7 call schedule, with rotating guaranteed off days. I would say the hardest part of this job is that there is a possibility of missing important events with family and friends. The most enjoyable part this job is being able to travel, and support yourself and family very well financially. Overall, this is a great trade to get into."
"CSX",",CSX is not what it used to be. The environment is tense and employees are on edge. More than 4,500 people have been furloughed or laid off over the last 18 months or so. Work-life balance is non-existent and you are expected to be available 24/7. There is no security at the company and I would strongly urge anyone interested in this company to think twice before joining. The pay is good, but definitely not worth all the stress and headache. The company is very military-style culturally and new ideas and ways of thinking are not tolerated. The mission statement says the company is ""progressive"" but it is far from that. "
"CSX",",If you enjoy being micro-managed or don't have a family, friends or hobbies - then this is the company for you."
"CSX",",This is a great job for the individual who never wants a wife or a family. Once hired you will be expected to work on your rest the rest of your life, spending more time in motels than your own bed."
"CSX",",Delivery of freight based on customer satisfaction is usually fact based, however the hours are long and the schedule drastically changes without much of a warning. More time is spent at work than home by far."
"CSX",",Safety is the number one goal. To move products across the country take a lot of people that are dedicated to getting a job done in the safest manner."
"CSX",",Quality of life is Questionable. Hire you to fire you. Spend more time in a hotel than at home. Great benefits, though. Labor contracts are not worth the paper they are written on. Pay averages out to about $12 per hour."
"CSX",",Coming in the door it could be a lot to learn and very hard work. This job is for people who are ok with working outside. It didn't take long for me to work my way up to a jockey driver considering i have my CDL and knew a little about the container business. Management is very fair to those that come to work and not to play around. The hardest part of the job is being the ground man & coming in the door that will be your first position. The most enjoyable part about the job is working from the jockey truck. You still have to work hard & be productive but talking to co workers over the radio makes time go by or if you're the quiet type you can just stay to your self"
"CSX",",My job title at CSX Transportation was Clerk. ..I had my  own vehicle and I answered calls from the YardMasters to swap out crews or to go pick up crews off of train...that's what my job entailed 90% of the time and the other 10% was clerical work.  I maintained the Crew Room Train printers...delivering orders to crews and running Rosters to fill jobs for next shift. I  never knew if I was going to work 8 hrs or 16 hrs. ..If they told me to stay then I had to stay and that was one of the down sides to the job. My job terms were different than the Conductor's and Engineer's...they are under a totally different agreement and have to deal with so much more than the Clerk's. CSX bought out the clerk jobs so I was out of a job that I thought I would retire from...no one expected it or seen it coming and I feel like the company could have done things different! I'm a hard worker and a loyal employee...the experience just made me want to rise above and to be the best that I can be for the next career that I  choose to embark on!"
"Indeed","Indeed is a great place to start a career. Sales at this company is fun and teaches an individual team work.

"Indeed",",Also, the company is focused on their goal: WE HELP PEOPLE GET JOBS!"
"Indeed",",Indeed is an amazing company to work at!! I started in in early 2016 and have been so happy here. "
"Indeed",",Before Indeed I worked at a very corporate company (I had to wear a suit daily) with little office culture, opportunity to create friendships, and extra curricular activities. "
"Indeed",",Indeed has brought new friendships into my life, I carpool weekly to the office, I play tennis with colleagues from different orgs within the company, I have volunteered at Beach Clean Ups, donated items to children and women in need during our various drives at the office, and have become a much happier employee than ever before. "
"Indeed",",My manager at Indeed in San Mateo is second to none. She's everything you'd want in a manager. A good listener, gives powerful feedback, and truly wants the best for my career. "
"Indeed",",Most importantly, my day to day work impacts businesses and their hiring goals. It's a great feeling knowing my actions are helping businesses grow and job seekers find their next step in their career."

"Indeed",",From the people, to the management, to the culture, Indeed is amazing! The culture is fun and fosters learning and growth. Management is in tune with what employees need and are always there to teach you and guide you. Unlimited PTO, great benefits, and great pay. Couldn't be more happy to come into work everyday!"
"Indeed",",I've been working at Indeed for almost a year  now and I absolutely love it. The people, culture, management, and work/life balance are all incredible! Not to mention, the work we do here -- helping people get jobs-- is THE most rewarding work I've ever done. I'm constantly challenged by the work, which has helped me learn and grow so quickly. Management also makes you feel like your opinion and input actually matters, and WILL put it into practice. Growth opportunities here are immense, and management is always willing to help work with you to help achieve your career goals."
"Indeed",",Indeed is a creative company focused on the singular mission of helping people get jobs. This makes the work very rewarding as you know that you are trying to solve problems that will impact someone else's life significantly. "
"Indeed",",Given the broad nature of the company and the many teams working within Indeed, you can spend a lot of time trying to track down information related to what other teams are doing."
"Indeed",",Management at Indeed is very open to new ideas and is constantly experimenting with ways to improve the Jobseeker experience. This can be good and bad; you need to be ready for new products to roll out on a regular basis, but there is also the opportunity to have your ideas become the next new experiment at Indeed."
"Indeed",",By far the best job I've had in my career of more than 11 years. The company cares about its employees and goes above and beyond to create a positive work environment. Lots of room for advancement and growth within the company. Bi-weekly happy hours, weekly company lunches provided, flex hours available, work from home available, and super casual atmosphere."
"Indeed",",Indeed is the best company I have ever worked for. They value their employees & do whatever it takes to keep the culture a family vibe. The compensation is amazing, and there is plenty of opportunity for growth. The only reason I would leave Indeed is to move to a different area."
"Indeed",",Great work/life balance. Excellent benefits and perks. Open atmosphere and work environment. Busy work schedule on a daily basis."
"Indeed",",Fun place to work with lots of flexibility. Unlimited paid time off, with unlimited food. Lots of different games to place. You get to work from home as well!"

"Indeed",",best internship, hands down. A lot of employee perks which is great. a lot of young people. very competitive. high stress"
"Indeed",",As a contract recruiter the entire HR & Talent Attraction team treated me with respect & made me feel like a true member of their team. Indeed is a great company & I truly enjoyed selling their story to candidates during the interview process. The NYC HR & TA teams are comprised of some truly righteous people who work hard & enjoy their jobs."
"Indeed",",Indeed is a life changing work environment!  The employees and management team are very genuine and supportive!  The culture is very positive and it is a fun environment.  New ideas are encouraged and implemented.  Indeed, is a great employer with amazing perks. Complementary breakfast, lunches, beverages and snacks to keep the teams happy. Open PTO seals the deal!  Thanks Indeed!"
"Indeed",",This company is great. I love my managers and my team. They have a direct interest in my well being with the company."
"Indeed",",I also love the office setup and vibe. Everyone is super helpful and attentive."
"Indeed",",Selling to staffing companies at Indeed is not for the faint of heart. For new sales people considering, recruiters are experts in sales and can sniff out a rehearsed pitch in 10 seconds and are filled with objections.  For experienced sales people, this vertical is micro managed to an extreme which means if you don't fall in line it is difficult to move your career past a call center. To make things more difficult for Staffing AEs there are minimum sizes to the deals which you can close. Your minimums are double what your counterparts on the direct employer side can close. So not only are the clients more difficult to close, your budgets are also twice as limiting as your colleagues. This means deals are more difficult to come by and less commission dollars. There is no monetary compensation for your restrictions, only pride that you're working in the most difficult vertical."
"Indeed",",When done properly there is a higher retention rate however this takes time to learn and in sales time is money.  Middle management is fantastic, the AEs in staffing are incredible unique individuals. The culture is great. This is a great vertical to learn about sales but the most difficult to excel in."

"Siemens AG",",Excellent company to work for.  The culture is a bit dated as you can imagine from a large company.  They are no startup with a driven culture so there is some dead weight.  Overall, lots of great people working there."

"Siemens AG",",Great place to work if you have 10 - 15 years for real world experience.  People are generally to themselves but helpful. Most of the people here were generally the baby boomers but we're open to adopting to cutting edge technology."
"Siemens AG",",Siemens is  a Good company to work for providing secure employment, a competitive pay, and above average benefits as well as a willingness to consider flexible working arrangements to accommodate employees demonstrating the dedication, responsibility and trustworthiness to handle such privilege without taking undo advantage of it.  Upper management does take the time to get to know their employees along with their successes and contributions to the company.  Hard work and diligence will be recognized and rewarded during performance reviews."
"Siemens AG",",Tteam members with different backgroud would have lots of diversied opinions and experience on the projects and proposals. This would definitely benefit to the organization in the different levels. The worlplace may have some overtime on the closing but it would be very enjoyable for us to have a the fexible schedule at the other time. It has a very good vacation benefit by combining the vacation, sick, and flowing dates. Over all, it was a sometime hard working workplace with cultured, fexible, friendly, and diversified environment ."

"Avendra",",Great small company feel. Great culture and team feel. Unfortunately high impact roles are limited as decision making is centralized in a select few."
"Avendra",",I actually loved working for this company. I was there from the very beginning when they first started Avendra, and transitioned from Marriott International. However I was disappointed because I worked for them for 5 years and was trying to advance which they had said they try to promote from ""within"" the company. Needless to say, not only did they hire from outside the company....I found out about it from running into an HR person outside the office and they never notificed me I didn't get the job, I found out from her. I thought it was so awful how it was handled. I dedicated a lot to this company. I loved my co-workers and it was a great balance of everything."
"Avendra",",Perfect job, perfect location just wish it wasn't a temporary position."
"Avendra",",Independent work environment. 40-50% travel required. Ample on the job training."
"NICE Systems","You worked hard but you played as well with this company.  They appreciated their employees and made sure they were rewarded nearly on a weekly basis with either surprise snacks or lunches.  I would gladly go back and work here."
"NICE Systems",",I had a great time when I first started. internal politics and egos made the job frustrating as the company grew. The technology was interesting and the product was stable once it was configured correctly."
"NICE Systems",",It was an entry level position where I did Admin work for the IT department.  It was a good experience as I got to work up front with the remedy ticketing software and learn its particulars."
"NICE Systems",",* Company culture very strange (non US)"

"NICE Systems",",* Worst Knowledge base and software documentation on the planet."
"NICE Systems",",Status reporting, resolving client issues, communicating with developers and business clients, analysis requirements, project documentation, and reviewing plans.  Translating business requirements into functional and technical specification; organizing resources and software engineers in executing project functions; reviewing project process and assessing progress to manage project schedules.    "
"NICE Systems",",Understanding the software project features, clarifying misunderstandings; analyzing client transaction data and resolving issues.  Clients will make demands often expect results within short time periods.  Adequate communication becomes imperative to managing expectation and avoiding project delays and derailments."
"NICE Systems",",The hardest part is delivering bad news to a client when errors were made or project is delayed; balancing client expectations and technology commitment when the software product requires customization to meet client requirements outside product capabilities.  The most enjoyable is reaching the client's satisfaction when the product finally delivers expected results."
"NICE Systems",",I worked as a Tier 2 Support Engineer for 4 years and then as a Project Manager for 2 years.  The first 3 years were very busy and I often worked 60-70 hours a week BUT so did my coworkers.  And the environment and our team made it an awesome place to work.  Then came the first management change and as things started to become less of a great team environment and more micro managed I transitioned into the role of Project Manager. In the new position there were wonderful challenges and a good environment until less than 6 months into that position there was another MAJOR management change.  Things went downhill from there and the third CEO level management change was catastrophic for the atmosphere.  "
"NICE Systems",",If you didn't answer emails, texts, or calls at any hour of the day you weren't giving 100%.   Being an Israeli based company that meant that if emails came in at 3am MST you were still expected to answer immediately.  "

"NICE Systems",",They way teache the employer ,and they understand each order .they always give a good bus ,any defect you call and they give you a other bus ,any problem you call common center to fix it."
"NICE Systems",",Employees are overloaded with work; Structure of company needs overhaul. Work/life balance needs overhaul. Need better training of job responsibilities and skills. If you work hard, you are expected to work even harder. No accountability fairness when measuring peers."
"NICE Systems",",The current work environment is not conducive for ambitious, progressive, intellectually advanced professionals.  There is plenty of room for improvement with a change in management, culture and vision."

"NICE Systems",",good company to work for however there is not career path for the long term which is why its only good to work there for 2 years"
"NICE Systems",",Company is fast growing. Different culture (non-American). Management is rough around the edges, doesn't care about the lower levels. A lot of secrets, no promotions, all based on politics. No raises."
"NICE Systems",",good environment, nice people and good management. The company is a leader in industry with clear targets and dynamic environment."
"NICE Systems",",I love this company.  Customer Service oriented and Team work based."
"NICE Systems",",The office is NICE and friendly.  "
"NICE Systems",",The company takes great care of their employees though benefits and everyday appreciation."
"NICE Systems",",A typical day starts off with a plan on what sites to work on and within an hour, a system blows up. I would then spend half my day working on a system I had no plans to work on. The sites I planned to work on get pushed back to a different day."
"NICE Systems",",My coworkers are hard workers who, like myself, are just trying to keep up. Since working at Nice, I have learned a great deal about databases, specifically MYSQL and MSSQL."
"NICE Systems",",My favorite part is performing some procedure I've never seen before and watching it correct the issue I'm working on."
"NICE Systems",",My least favorite part is watching the software not behave the way our advanced engineers and R&D team advise it should."
"NICE Systems",",NICE is a good place to work.  The benefits and pay are very attractive. The only complaint is the seating structure out in the ""bullpen""."
"NICE Systems",",Consistently busy with customers.  Management is very micro-managed.  Must meet specific numbers and maintain good communications with customers.  The hardest part of the job is staying on top of all of the service requests that come in.  Average number of tickets per Engineer is 30 - 35.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the peers you work with in the call center.  A typical day is having a couple of hours on the High/Critical Shift where you take those types of tickets and work them.  Sometimes the tickets can take over your day and all the other priorities get pushed off to the side.  As soon as you get behind, you will never catch up as customers call and want you to work on their tickets exclusively and you continue to get overwhelmed by the ticketing processes.  Things I have learned is to cope with a HIGH Stress Environment.  Management is always looking over your shoulder.  You do not get praised on a good jobs but Management calls you out in front of your peers on issues that go bad or you have no control over."
"NICE Systems",",Since I joined the company it seems that it is on the decline. There is not much communication between the different branches and it is hard to have an overall vision of the group."
"NICE Systems",",The environment and coworkers at Nice are what keep me going. The product we sell is enterprise level and very sophisticated. Work life balance is hard due to the high volume of work during our companies transition into cheaper support methods. Being able to assist clients resolve their issues and and being recognized for my hard work is the best part of the day. The hardest part about working for Nice is being unable to provide customers with the level of service they deserve due to work load and staffing."
"NICE Systems",",Spend a great deal of time in training.  The application is Java Centered, and dealing with Java issues were time consuming."
"NICE Systems",",No matter what company you work for, the customer/client is important, but NICE Systems created an environment that fosters the attitude of ""make sure your employees are satisfied with their work environment"". It was great working there."
"American Family Insurance","The job overrall was great and the customers were too! Looked forward to expanding there but the agency it's self wasn't great ! ""Lots of un kept promises and things not handled properly"

"American Family Insurance",",Management was very driven."
"American Family Insurance",",Workplace culture was very business oriented."
"American Family Insurance",",The hardest part of the job was slowing down."
"American Family Insurance",",The most enjoyable part of the job was that days flew by."
"American Family Insurance",",A typical day at work included Administrative Support duties as follows:  answering a multi-line phone system screening & transferring incoming calls to the appropriate personnel; processing Personal Property & Casualty Applications; Agent/Producer assistance; delinquent notice follow-ups; verbal & written correspondence to customer inquiries, completing personal insurance client reviews; processing reports; and customer payment processing."
"American Family Insurance",",I learned to be very flexible during my seven year tenure with American Family.  I obtained my Property, Casualty prior to joining American Family Insurance and obtained my Life Insurance License during my tenure with American Family.  I learned how to managed multiple system applications to service American Family existing & prospect clients.  I learned how to Manage & organize my workload with proficiency in a timely manner and with the utmost privacy & care."
"American Family Insurance",",The workplace culture was very well organized, managed and team oriented with excellent systems & tools in place.  The workplace provided excellent time management & training."
"American Family Insurance",",The hardest part of the job was the ability to adapt to a different way of management for each of the nine different Agent's I worked under in my seven year tenure with American Family Insurance.  Change is difficult sometimes, however I proved my loyalty to the American family by learning to adapt to each situation."
"American Family Insurance",",The most enjoyable part of my job was being recognized by the company for my hard work & dedication.  I am also very grateful for the loyalty my district manager showed me by always finding"

"American Family Insurance",",The company has a high emphasis on helping external customers."
"American Family Insurance",",I enjoyed working at American Family Insurance also Cause it was an challenge to assist the customer under company policy. and every time I was able to go accomplish going beyond to make sure the customer were an 100% satisfied. was the best feeling every."
"American Family Insurance",",Having worked both in the field and at corporate, I can attest that this company is ""in it"" for the right reasons. I have found that they greatly reward integrity and work ethic in the field, while also remaining transparent and highly supportive from a corporate level. I have heard from more tenured employees/agents that they wish they would have found Amercan Family Insurance earlier in their careers. I couldn't agree more and am grateful I found them as early as I did. This is my retirement plan!"
"American Family Insurance",",The company has a great family oriented environment. My coworkers are awesome and the management team works to make sure that we continue to grow as a company by abiding to the company's mission statement. Overall a good company to work for."
"American Family Insurance",",A nice place for pre-retirement,  No job security it. Nice life balance.  Take time for delvierable and change all the time.  A good place for slow down and take break."
"American Family Insurance",",One of my first jobs, it was easy to learn and a great way for me to earn money while I was still in high school. They care about their employees. I didn't have full benefits as I was only part time."
"American Family Insurance",",Again I do not care for insurance. I was proving a point to myself that I could do it and I did. I prefer bookkeeping over insurance."
"American Family Insurance",",American Family is a perfect name for American Family as my co-workers are just like family! In my 10 years at American Family I have had almost all great managers and have been promoted 3 times! The benefits are parallel to none that I've heard of in this area!"
"American Family Insurance",",They focus on selling home, auto, and life insurance.  Its a never ending grind, corporate expects certain production levels each month.  They are a credit based insurance company, if your prospect doesn't have great credit, probably not going to save them any money.  Older agents are helpful and always willing to share what's made them successful.  Its hard to beat State Farm in their home state and the dozens of other fly by night insurance companies in Chicagoland area."
"American Family Insurance",",it was like working in a small office. Everyone got to know one another very well. The office was a little disorganized, it needs some structure, and there was a lot of work to do it was a bit overwhelming at times, but was a great feeling when things came together."
"American Family Insurance",",overworked, nights and weekends required just to keep up w/ workload 11 months out of the year. Poor engagement of claim employees due to being overworked w/ no management support."
"American Family Insurance",",A typical day at work consisted of answering inbound calls and assisting the customer to the best of our ability; if the situation was unable to be managed there were always other avenues."
"American Family Insurance",",I enjoyed working here for the most part but felt that the way things were ran could have most certainly been improved upon. Overall tho it was a pleasant experience up until the last few months."
"American Family Insurance",",This is a great workplace to be at. There is a strong balance between home and work life. Flexible hours & friendly people to work with. I would highly recommend this company to anyone."
"American Family Insurance",",Usually the same thing everyday. Didn't come in to any surprises, knew what to expect for the day. Management was nice and there to help with any questions."
"American Family Insurance",",Fast paced environment with opportunities of growth. Engaging staff that provide a clean, safe, and respectable work space. This also company improved my customer service skills."
"American Family Insurance",",Still a pretty good place to work. Although advancing in the company is difficult. The manager is still a great guy too, really helpful when it comes to learning the job."
"American Family Insurance",",People are extremely nice and thoughtful. The day-to-day work can be busy and hectic, but it is not complicated work most of the time. High-volume and fast-paced. The culture, unfortunately, is at times a little bit toxic. This is because of the drastic differences in treatment between ""employees"" and ""temps"". Temporary workers, while it is understandable that they will not receive the same benefits as full employees, are treated as second-class individuals overall. They are not given the same consideration as fellow employees for important office events and announcements, including those that would affect their jobs."
"UC San Diego","Job is good but management is terrible. They do a lot of promoting within but that doesn't mean they are good for management. To much do what I say or else even though some jobs are union base."
"UC San Diego",",Worked here on temp assignment as a contractor, observed tenured management as behind the times with new technology changes, out of touch with reality, out of date information systems, many of the staff employees have tenured and are not receptive to changes. Very frustrating workplace culture, people assigned roles with authority of which they are not qualified, many hired to boost diversity, inclusion and equality quotas, not hired for positions because of their background or work experience, not a happy place to work, too much negative energy and nervous managers who play the blame game on others."
"UC San Diego",",Terrible, terrible micromanagement (too much, and decisions that are made for you are terrible!) The waste of money is blinding, and yet staff haven't seen a raise in years. Department and Manager both have terrible reputations -- ask any staff that has left. No job security,  No HR support."
"UC San Diego",",Not sure about UCSD as a whole, but the ICT Team (Information and Communication Technology Team) is horribly managed! They offer competitive pay and benefits, but there's lots of ""office politics"" with little room for advancement. Most of the employees are unhappy, but they stay there for the benefits. Not a very positive environment."
"UC San Diego",",There are lots of opportunities to conduct research in different areas. You meet many interesting people, scientific environment is extremely fulfilling."
"UC San Diego",",I have spent my entire professional career working at UCSD in various positions in Information Technology. "
"UC San Diego",",UCSD is a diverse environment that treats its workers with respect. The learning environment extends to employees as well as students. Work/life balance is good."
"UC San Diego",",UCSD is a good research institute overall. You meet lots of interesting people, and do research in the fast changing areas of science and engineering."
"UC San Diego",",No room for growth. Management does whatever they want and treats employees horribly. Be careful what department you are in. Only good thing is the benefits."
"UC San Diego",",I loved my time working at UC San Diego. There was always something innovative and new to work on. My coworkers were kind and professional."
"UC San Diego",",I love patient care experience. Staff very friendly and having union at UCSD protects our job. Being a float made me obtain experience in every department available at University of California, San Diego"

"UC San Diego",",everyone work as a team."
"UC San Diego",",patients always come first"
"UC San Diego",",UCSD is a huge place with many jobs. The benefits are unusually good in these times, but have changed for recent hires from what I have - there is still defined pension plan but it is less than it used to be."
"UC San Diego",",I find the work fulfilling and interesting, and I enjoy the company of my coworkers.  Typical day can involve writing papers for a conference, conducting experiments, or building prototypes.  Our manager is just and rewards hard work.  Everyday I learn something new."
"UC San Diego",",Working at UCSD has been a great experience.  It is a good place to learn how its like being in the real-world at a miniature level, which is a good stepping stone towards working in the industry."
"UC San Diego",",The benefits are GREAT, but management is awful.  They need to train more or hire people with experience."
"UC San Diego",",My co workers were great people to work with but the management was awful."
"UC San Diego",",I loved working with people and the people who came into put department were students and parents. They were great."
"UC San Diego",",UCSD is a great place to work. The typical day starts with a walk from the bus stop to the lab and I love seeing other enthusiastic people walking along. Multitasking is on my mind while I am walking thinking about what I have to do. I have learnt new techniques, made friends and developed as a person. Everyone at UCSD is very helpful. Ocean is very near to UCSD campus and can be easily reached by bus! There are many good scientific talks and symposiums at UCSD."
"UC San Diego",",naked juice great place great coworkers good pay enjoyed working there cool boss flexible schedule. sea world met a lot of good people good pay liked my bosses some times flexible schedule. dinos soda bar was my first job close to home in school learned a lot pay was good enjoyed it for the short time i was there"
"UC San Diego",",I loved working at UCSD and most of my co-workers. I had an amazing supervisor and I worked with incredible physicians. I would love to go back!"
"UC San Diego",",It's an institution that moves at a glacial pace.  Politics run rapid and it really depends on who you know here.  The students are usually the only reason why you would want to come and work here.  They keep you young and at the same time make you feel old.  So much energy and also so much entitlement.  The focus is really on what the Jacob's want to pay money for.  Not much else.  It's their school."
"UC San Diego",",Great work place for permanent positions. There are multiple opportunities for professional growth. The environment at the UC San Diego is nurturing for student and young faculty."

"CDPHP","Overall positive place to work. Great staff, good pay and benefits. Not many opportunities for growth. Could improve on their training as well. Need to invest more in their employees."
"CDPHP",",Great company, great compensation with benefits, great core values. Worked as ICC in Inpatient Programs over 6 years. Management and Supervision atrocious. Micro managed & scutinized highly professional, skilled, proficient nurses and rewarded employees who were less stellar with poor work ethic. Management did NOT foster teamwork or innovative ideas to improve the daily work flow of its department. If you expressed your opinion with ideas for improvement- you would later get called into office and be excused of being unhappy with your job duties and be given a performance plan for improvement.  20+ years as a professional RN have I never made to feel as incompetent or questioned why I continued to work for CDPHP. Why- because I believed in the the Company, its values and its members!  I now work for a National Company that truely values it's employees, their multifaceted experience and promotes teamwork as well as work/life balance.  I have never been more happier as a professional nurse to work for a company that appreciates my talents. CDPHP should consider micro managing the management staff of the departments with high turnovers of excellent employees."
"CDPHP",",Typical day during HEDIS season, hectic training followed by micro-managing  ""peer"" orientation. This was the hardest part of the job, I have never before or since experienced the kind of scrutiny that I experienced as a minority (as what I experienced at CDPHP)."
"CDPHP",",The pay: less than what other area Health plans paid for similar positions and without benefits."
"CDPHP",",What I learned, the company wanted to apply IRS rules for expenses of office workers versus the IRS rules for seasonal work from home workers. Eventually, what that meant was that I ""ate"" the travel costs for their business purposes."
"CDPHP",",The company environment, nice corporate offices with gym and cafeteria( higher prices for temps vs permanent employees) great  if you had time to use them."
"CDPHP",",Permanent non-seasonal employees wouldn't even acknowledge temporary employees with common courtesy like opening or holding a door for someone who badge accessed the building and held the door for themselves simultaneously while bringing in or taking out materials/equipment for company use.  "
"CDPHP",",Would I ever go back, not to their quality dept. I have since learned that this dept is to be avoided because of the micromanagement and high exit rate of permanent employees who move speedily to other local quality depts at other insurers."
"CDPHP",",Embarrassed being micromanaged and spoken down to. Management ignores employee morale and allows abuse of power within ""teams"". Rewards repeat offending employees that exhibit conduct unbecoming and turning a blind eye to rude behavior."
"CDPHP",",Interesting project and good growth opportunities. I liked the fact that managers were helpful and believed in team work."
"CDPHP",",The work environement is good , work pressure is high. Flexible timings.Work from home option should be there. Other amenities such as gym is there."
"CDPHP",",I really had a good time working for CDPHP. It's a great opportunity to work for them. I really liked the work environment. I had my personal desk with multi windows to perform my testing which I liked also. We all worked as team and also helped each other for our work needs to accomplish our goals. Also we offer our clients higher priority if there's need to be any changes while making the application. Over all i would say I love to work for a big company like ""Capital District Physician Health Plan"" and it was one of my good experience working for them."
"CDPHP",",Great place to work. Nice environment.  I loved my job but was released due to department restructure. Wonderful co-workers."
"CDPHP",",Although this was a remote position, the management and my coworkers were very professional and helpful.  We had daily meetings and was given the opportunity to ask questions and give our opinion on the work processes."
"CDPHP",",I worked in the phone unit where I was logged into the phones all day.  It was a production environment with little flexibility for hours or time off.  The company is very well run, all of the upper management are doctors, so the company is run by brilliant people.  my co-workers were fun people to be around but I hardly got to interact with them due to the high call volume.  Overall the job was not very challenging and the training program is terrific. The hardest part of the job for me was juggling a family life with the inflexibility of scheduling.  It was next to impossible to call in if I had a sick child at home and you only get one break per shift and it is a scheduled break which is sometimes scheduled an hour and fifteen minutes after the start of your shift.  The best part of the job was the pay and benefits.  Very competitive wages and the benefits are great, it is a health insurance company after all.  There is a minimal cost of living raise every year, although due to changes in tax rates and insurance premiums my take home went down two consecutive years.  Opportunity for advancement and overtime availability.  Hours of operation are 6:30am to 7:00 pm M-F.  All first shift weekday hours which was great."
"CDPHP",",The environment  was really nice & it was fun to working in this company."
"CDPHP",",Capital District Physicians Health Plan is a healthcare provider for group, individual and government health plans to dental and vision, along with health savings plan. At CDPHP, the project is creation of Impact pro reports (graph and table) for getting full history of member data and integrating it with claims and related needs. The application also facilitates batch messages, real-time member data processing and generating the claim information."
"CDPHP",",High volume call center, Learned much about medical insurance. Management and co-workers very nice to work with. Loved being able to help people with their coverage concerns"
"CDPHP",",CDPHP is an excellent employer and does so much for its employees. compensation is great. Management is outstanding."
"CDPHP",",I loved working there because I actually enjoyed the job. Never minded going in or staying late, working through lunch, etc."
"CDPHP",",I never felt respected by my supervisors or management though, but the members made my day, as well as the other employees, all professional and dedicated people."
"CDPHP",",I would have stayed there forever but lo and behold, one day out of the blue came a call down to HR...I was terminated. No incident happened, no reason given."
"CDPHP",",I cried in the parking lot for hours."
"CDPHP",",Even after that, I would still love to work there again."
"CDPHP",",always had last min info."
"CDPHP",",stressful."
"CDPHP",",only talked to you when you did something wrong"
"CDPHP",",i would review 15 claims a week per adjudicator or adjuster for financial and clerical accuracy. I'm proficient in processing claims with facets and macess."
"CDPHP",",This company is awesome. Great training from the day you walk into the building. Very supportive management team and encouragement to succeed. Encouragement to do a good job and rewards and incentives for all employees"
"CDPHP",",Working at CDPHP was a great experience. The management was very supportive and the work environment was heads above any other i have encountered. My co-worker great and made the job fun."
"CDPHP",",Cdphp is a wonderful company to work for. Helping the members was a good feeling."
"CDK Global","CDK became a company  that did not value it's  employees. s They moved our branch for tax break advantages to another city 10 hours away form our branch location.  I worked endless hour, holidays, and weekends.  I completed several courses for leaderships programs and was never given the opportunity to advance my career.  I am looking for a company that has great leadership and values it employees."
"CDK Global",",Whether it be between teammates or with management, I have never been more satisfied with a work environment than when I was with the CDK Helpdesk. More than adequate compensation for work that could prove challenging when dealing with an issue outside one of several commonplace incidents."
"CDK Global",",A loyal employee with a strong work ethic, attention to detail, excellent interpersonal communication skills, and an orientation toward quality. I am committed to our clients’ needs, and am a valuable player on my sales team. Proficient at planning, organizing, and setting priorities."
"CDK Global",",I have been employed at CDK  for a year and I can say that the work life balance it amazing. The culture on the floor is also wonderful and enjoyable."
"CDK Global",",CDK has a great life/work balance. They do offer in my position to work remotely. The people are great to work with and they are redesigning many of their products which is much needed."
"CDK Global",",My position required that I give primary support to the CMO and secondary support to the marketing VPs and team as a whole. I supported and even lead several marketing projects in conjunction with my daily tasks as an assistant. Some other tasks included tracking invoices, submitting invoices, onboarding new hires, promotional item research, and internal promotional catalog development."
"CDK Global",",During my time at CDK there were immense transitional developments across the company. From the beginning, my role and tasks were continually changing and it required that I remain flexible and positive throughout. I am confident in saying that at all times I achieved this and any of those I directly managed and worked with would say the same."
"CDK Global",",I worked at CDK Global for a little over a year. I worked with one of their products, PartsVoice. This was a product that car dealerships used to buy and sell idle inventory. Management was great and training was thorough."
"CDK Global",",Management needs to be trained on well being managers. A lot of favortism and unprofessional comments are made. There is no real advancment at the office in which I work."
"CDK Global",",Excellent people to work with everyone is very nice."
"CDK Global",",Lots of work everyday changes to occur once one in a while."
"CDK Global",",We go out on outings as a big team9"
"CDK Global",",I enjoyed the culture of the company. However, management does not support staff to help with growth and support. Sales team is great to work with and helps reach goals."
"CDK Global",",I loved working for this company.  I'm leaving on good terms.  They are relocating and I can't move to the new location.  They place an emphasis on continuing education.  I believe they are truly working to be the best business they can be."
"CDK Global",",Exciting employment, with plenty of opportunity to see the country and meet new people. Although long days and lots of travel, 80% of my career was on the road. Management can be is very demanding but sales oriented. Provided plenty of training and automated sales tools."
"CDK Global",",Growth opportunities provided to favorites not people who actually work. There are limited positions open for promotion, they hardly promote from within the company in the Detroit office. You have to pay for parking and parking fees are only increasing in Detroit.The office in Seattle receives better treatment than the Detroit office. One example is the Seattle Office receives more work from home days."
"CDK Global",",CDK is a tech company trying to emulate big companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc..., but they aren't even close to getting it right. Clients are the unhappiest. It takes employees months to get their pay checks on time. Lots of micro-management. Parking is a nightmare. There is high turn-over. You can't get an answer through HR because they tell you to call a service line (like a 1-800 customer service #) and they call center associates never know the answer and takes a ticket number but never fix the issue! This list goes on and on. This was the worst placed I've ever worked."
"CDK Global",",people are very friendly and extremely helpful."
"CDK Global",",You get to learn many new technologies. allow you to experiment. "
"CDK Global",",There is a ping pong table to refreshing yourself."
"CDK Global",",Busy workplace, enabling me to expand my tech support skills. Great benefits start on the first day of employment."
"CDK Global",",Some of my colleagues are not very open-minded."
"CDK Global",",Micro managed environment."
"CDK Global",",The DMV portion of my responsibilities can often be very challenging."
"CDK Global",",I love the tech support applications etc."
"CDK Global",",While the pay is generally good and the coworkers are good people, the company is being managed extremely poorly. Employee morale is low, layoffs are rampant, and frontline employees are the ones who suffer to help the company meet its bottom line."
"CDK Global",",CDK is evolving the automotive industry through technology with 27,000+ clients across 100+ countries and 9,000+ employees worldwide."
"CDK Global",",Great place to work with a great benefits package. Awesome and friendly work environment with a supportive management staff! Casual dress code with a easy office schedule."
"CDK Global",",CDK were good to work for when they were know as ADP, but since the company spun off of it's parent company it hasn't been the same. benefits have gotten worst, they took away are tenure after the spin off which they said they wouldn't do (which effects retirement benefits). They send us to other territories to cover issues that requires an hotel stay (sometimes requiring weeks at a time) when we were originally hired just to cover our own territories so we can be home at night. They make merit raises as a competition between other peers then they split the percentages of the merit raise. Overall not that great of a company to work for. They also let a lot of people go to make there overhead look good so they can be picked up and bought out by another company."
"CDK Global",",While change is a part of any job, CDK seems to be changing more than the norm.  There is great pressure on average speed of answer on chats and calls and sometimes it is very stressful to manage your workload while giving quality service."
"OGSystems","company works in the National Intelligence arena, supporting various government intelligence agencies.  Co-workers were great, work hours are a bit flexible."
"OGSystems",",Payroll and timekeeping administrator. I enjoy getting to work with our employees on a daily basis and show why OGSystems is a game changer in the IC community."
"OGSystems",",A small company that offers some of the great benefits that go with that, great compensation, good benefits, ect.  The downside of working for a small business is the lack of job security.  Overall a highly dedicated group of individuals working to provide great customer satisfaction"
"Spencer Ogden","Worked nights with a  great group of people. Learned a lot about tack welding supports in place. The management at night was not really there. the hardest part of the job was trying to understand our boss at night he was from the islands."
"Spencer Ogden",",You will be promised the world - but only if you are able to devote your entire life to Spencer Ogden. You will have no work-life balance, constantly conflicting assignments from different managers (of which you will have about 6). The back office and HR is an absolute unorganized nightmare."
"Spencer Ogden",",the job was fast paced and full of projects"
"Spencer Ogden",",increased my knowledge on my profession "
"Spencer Ogden",",the management was great, very helpful"
"Spencer Ogden",",the company had a strong team everyone worked together to meet deadlines and finish projects."
"Spencer Ogden",",Great company to work for, they care about your concerns and put you first when assigning you a position. Communication was great with weekly check in's to check on your well being."
"Spencer Ogden",",Worked as a Process technician then was promoted to Process Coordinator.In charge of lock out tagout ,training new operators and lining up projects such as loading catalyst."
"Spencer Ogden",",Got hired on, worked a few jobs, then never heard from them again.  I have seen job postings from the company, but never been contacted for more work."
"Spencer Ogden",",I have been working with this company for over a year now and have always had 100% completion of everything that they said they would do. The payments are on time and actually early on my account. The manager of my account contacts me at least once a month to follow up on how I am doing and if I need anything. In addition, I have been invited to company functions and get updated when ever there is a change in the office affecting my account."
"Spencer Ogden",",Management and infrastructure is BAD. They promise you the world and will not deliver on their promises. You sit in an office all day with management breathing down your neck while they are not keeping the promises such as healthcare and pay."
"Gallup","it is a great place to work. i liked the flexibility of hours. i would still be working there if my job wasnt being lost to online surveys"
"Gallup",",Great place to work that values its employees and encourages development. Over college tuition reimbursement program. Make your own schedule and work with limited supervision."
"Gallup",",Gallup is an exciting learning company in theory, but the managers have a hard time practicing what the company preaches. All the science behind their practices is in vain when it comes to internal engagement. Good company to work with, bad company to work for."
"Gallup",",The best thing I liked about this job was that I was able to create my own pay based on the amount of interviews I had. I liked being able to set my own schedule, and work as much as I wanted. The only thing I didn't like about this job was that some of the employees seemed to be ""Debbie downers"" and had a negative attitude. Other than that it was a great job."
"Gallup",",For my first job right when I turned 16 making two dollars over minimum wage; I was ecstatic about this job.  We made our own work schedule with breaks whenever we decided. I learned how to time managed and it taught me what being accountable for yourself is about."
"Gallup",",I worked at Gallup for a very short period of time. This was because I had been ill and just recently found out I was pregnant. They have a minimal 20 hours you must meet weekly, but with being ill and doctors appointments, I was unable to meet that requirement and was terminated. Truthfully, my medical absents should have been excused, but clearly was not. I was working as a telephone interviewer, and by outbound calls, spoke to various people about taking a survey. Many said no, due to the fact we were always calling around their dinner times, and I was often cursed at, yelled at, or hung up on. Although these statements are true, my experience at Gallup was not entirely miserable. During my employment there, I learned how to professionally handle complicated situations over the phone and how to maintain an understanding of people's time schedules. The management and other employees were very nice, especially during the training period of this journey. It seemed there was always something going on in the office, other than working. They had games set up that you could earn a spot to, and each hour team were able to win prizes."
"Gallup",",I got to do the StrengthsFinder and found out that my strengths are- Competition, Strategic, Achiever, Activator and Woo"
"Gallup",",Worked part and full time through college earning tuition reimbursement while a full time college athlete and part time employee at Strike Zone and at the Gateway."
"Gallup",",Gallup has an amazing culture, which allows for a material amount of autonomy in execution.  Their only requirement of employees is the completion of time sheets.  This enables the teams to develop ways to complete work that fits the individual or small team needs very well."
"Gallup",",It's a fairly straight forward job; you know what is expected of you, you come in and get your work done and leave. The work environment is incredibly positive and encouraging, and there is plenty of room to advance in that career. The cold calling can be difficult at times, and dealing with difficult customers on the phone can be challenging, but in the end, you know what you're doing is going towards something bigger than yourself."
"Gallup",",You'll love this job if you like struggling to meet quota and talking to rude people all day. The pay is good when you can actually meet quota which is rare unless you're a chick. Nobody wants to pick up their phone and participate in a stupid Gallup poll. The questions are very personal and repetitive. If I got called by Gallup I'd tell them to f*%# off"
"Gallup",",I loved Gallup & the people who worked there, had there been a chance for FT, benefits etc, I'd have stayed there until I retired."
"Gallup",",You make your own schedule but Gallup doesn't open until 3pm. The training takes three to four weeks. During the training period you get a guaranteed $10.00 an hour.  Once off the training team you can start on banks if youre good enough. Your days consist of mainly taking surveys. You get a half hour break time that wont affect your dial time, any longer than that and you lose some."
"Gallup",",good flexibility and good pay if you can handle the work.  I had no problems when I had 2 best friends there but one left and one got fired.  same thing day after day week after week really gets the best of you after about a year."
"Gallup",",Gallup tends to lure most of their applicants in at the beginning: promising you lots of benefits such as health insurance, job security and easy relocation/reestablishment past the contract period, tuition reimbursement, and a high base pay. They also continue when you arrive for training: you are a prestigious member of their company and practically irreplaceable, etc. (their ""group interviews"" and the first night of training is basically sitting through a long propaganda lecture about how great Gallup is). What they neglect to tell you is that is purely a commissions based position (after the training period) and you may struggle to earn minimum wage a lot of the time. "
"Gallup",",They have a lot of confusing methods you have to learn through a brief classroom training period and also as to how you can ""progress"" at this company. I asked the manager about it at the group interview and he pretty much admitted this is basically a dead-end job; the only real way to ""progress"" is by adding more hours on your schedule, but this definitely isn't a career to carry you through life (unless you're impeccably charismatic and persuasive on the phone, in which case you'd be better off being a used car salesman or a real estate agent where the pay is more promising). Obviously with these kinds of jobs there is a high turnover rate, and the kick to that is that they are constantly dealing with the new people and dealing with space decreases as you desperately try and find a place to work everyday (unless you manage to earn a desk, which can be done in 4 weeks at the very SOONEST). You won't be"
"Gallup",",  "
"Gallup",", very appreciated, either in this environment or society in general, because you'll be doing cold calling all over the country at the weirdest hours that disturb people - you're basically a telemarketer in their eyes. Be prepared to deal with that. "
"Gallup",",The props I can give are the mostly flexible hours. As long as you work 20 hours/week when you start, you can work anytime as long as you work a full shift on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Note that your hours here aren't necessarily calculated in time but production units. So yeah, you can begin work at 3pm, maybe not complete as many surveys as anticipated (yeah there's a quota for each survey project), clock out at 11pm and maybe you've only earned less than promised pay. Because if you're not on the dialer, you many as well be slacking off in their minds. "
"Gallup",",If you need some extras and you don't mind struggling through a job, this is good for you. If you prefer stability, a stable work environment, more appreciation, then I'd look elsewhere."
"Gallup",",  "
"Gallup",",The work environment and people were awesome and the spirit and everyone  was so positive i enjoyed my time working there."
"Gallup",",i currently work here at Gallup and its a great job but only a great student job or part time job. If youre living on your own taking care of bills and things like that its not the best job. Only reason i say this is because you wont have a set pay itll vary depending on your surveys. Besides that its an okay job i guess."
"Gallup",",A typical day at work involves greeting my co workers, calling clients and gathering opinions about various topics. I enjoy working with all my coworkers and managers. The hardest thing about my job is making sure I spend adequate time with my respondents and making sure that I stay on task. The best part about my job is the opportunity to speak with a wide variety of people."
"Gallup",",call and place surveys for the company, nice co-workers, clean environment, flexible with those who are in school. I would not recommend the job to a friend though."
"Gallup",",I enjoyed my experience with Gallup. I learned and developed customer service skills via telephone while working inside their company."
"Gallup",",A typical day at Gallup was a blessing or a curse. You never knew how the people you were calling were going to be that day. The hardest part of the job was having to stay on the phone while being cussed out by a complete stranger."
"Gallup",",Typical is sitting in a small cubicle with an auto dialer . Calling and asking people questions. Management is okay people who work there very nice. Job is extremely boring.  Everything must be read verbatim. Best part is its flexible hours worst part is pay."
"GlaxoSmithKline","Great company with great people. Fast moving and committed to excel in the industry. Offered a wealth of training and opportunity to learn if you have the passion to drive it."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",At GSK I learned Business Acumen and Customer Engagement, which are two important elements to have effective calls with my customers.  Also, I learned to be more than a sales representative, a facilitator for my customers.  "
"GlaxoSmithKline",",GSK is a real facilitator and represent a workplace full of respect to others."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",Good center of job. Have too much beneficent for the employer.This company no have comparison for other.Have a good cafeteria with very good food and low price. Have medical services ."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",Very good company values and vision, but consistently struggling to deliver.  The share price over the last 5-8 years shows it.   A solid , top tier IT Infrastructure department.  CIO is extremely cost conscious.  As very talented people have driven costs down through lean practices and automation, labor arbitrage is now the practice to find even more savings.  Very hard to see IT career advancement opportunities in the US."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",I marketed 17 specialty products to Endocrinology, Cardiology, Urology, Rheumatology, Orthopedics, Men’s and Women’s Health, Internal Medicine, Primary Care, and Pharmacy in southwestern WI. I was blessed with great co-workers, great managers, and great customers."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",Great company to work for they actually care about their employees. You are treated equal and they are very flexible.  Great environment and great people."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",I loved my co workers and most of my customers. This job was super easy and enjoyable for me.There was always room to learn something new. My boss in AR was amazing."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",A great place to work and great compensation. Work life balance is great. there is room for development and room for growth. The staffers are friendly and always willing to help. Great team work."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",GSK is a great company to work for if you are one of the few lucky employees that can keep your job.  The mission and direction is in constant change and you never know when they are going to outsource, close out, move operations to the UK-overseas,  or sell off a line of business. Everyone seems to always be ""in the pool of applicants"" interviewing for the same job you have been working for many years.    It can be extremely difficult to develop into another role because if you don't have the experience, it's hard to change departments into the R&D, clinical areas.   I applied for many jobs over the years and never got one interview. Major cuts for many years in training budget with no paid travel expenses for  educational conferences, or continuing education in my department, while management took lavish business trips. Many people at GSK make unreasonably high salaries, while others beg for a raise or perks. "
"GlaxoSmithKline",", Bottom line is it  really depends who your manager/ department is at GSK"
"GlaxoSmithKline",",It is not a hard job physically, yet mentally it is draining. The repetitive tasks you have to perform provide a lot of thinking time which is not always a good thing. 1st shift is much better than 2nd or 3rd which is a given. Pay-wise it is about the best you can do in the immediate area especially without a college degree."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",Great benefits and people  and facilities.  People have great ideas to move the company forward, but too much top level mangment holding back the progression."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",Good Place to work. There are a lot of experience people  in their respective roles. Big company which gives you a chance to grow within."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",Great Company to work for. You get to work with a close-knit team. Flexible, ability to work from home. Work and life travel balance. Unlimited opportunities."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",I first came to Glaxo they were working a 3 day 12 hour shift. this is the best shift I have ever worked. I was chosen to deliver a speech at the beginning of the year to the whole plant and it was a very great experience. It was a great experience for me."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",Performed: Programming, production jobs control support, Software Validations, Documentations"
"GlaxoSmithKline",",Highly professional."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",Nice Environment."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",Hardest part: Long drive to and from"
"GlaxoSmithKline",",GSK is a lean and fast paced environment.  Main campuses are PA and NC.  The company provides yearly 70/20/10 development planning to advance your career, and benefits."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",I have no interest in being published. It is an ethical company run by people who really care about the patient. But they have adopted a system that makes it nearly impossible to succeed at the sales level."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",in my last position with GSK, the then CEO had decided that the company would no longer bonus the representatives based on sales.  The new model was to see how well employees took tests that we were not given the info on what we scored at the end."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",Good company with good products. Have good research efforts and attempting to develop good Rx products. Great benefits for all employees."
"GlaxoSmithKline",",Work Hard, Great atmosphere, Good management and working relationships with team, Family first atmosphere, Good pay, Great territories, good products that physicians believe in"

"Eaton",",not a hard place to work but very boring at times"
"Eaton",",a lot of management changes"
"Eaton",",The department I worked in the employees were like high school kids with a lot of drama. They promised overtime when I was hired and within a month it was stopped in my department."
"Eaton",",Very good benefits and pay. Sometimes management doesn't seem entirely in sync. The overtime is the hardest part of the job its sometimes up to seven days a week."
"Eaton",",In 40 years of working, Eaton is the worst, grimmest and bunch of people I've ever met.  Great job if you want to be a robot and smile when they disrespect you and set you up to fire you!"
"Eaton",",love working with my co-workers,It was more like working with family specially around the holidays and birthdays. also love the fitness center and the way they do help the community."
"Eaton",",I think it is a wonderful place to work.. People are very good at what they do.excellent in training, and working together as a team.."
"Eaton",",Eaton is a good company. The pay and benefits are good, but not as much as my old job. Overall it's still a good company. Unfortunately they are about to do a major layoff."
"Eaton",",Constant management changes over the years resulting in little growth and development. Lack of managerial courage. Comparable benefits. Good chemistry amongst employees."
"Eaton",",Employed at Eaton since May 2002. Eaton is a premiere diversified energy management corporation headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio with 97,000+ employees worldwide."
"Eaton",",I don't have any bad felling about the company was very nice work in the place the co-worker was very friendly and the supervisor very good person ..."
"Eaton",",So sorry this company moved away from where I lived, I had chance to go with on the move, but chose to stay behind. Wish I had gone along and kept working for great company and people."
"Eaton",",The position was very fast paced and could be difficult for some the people for the most part were friendly but at times I did not feel that we were treated equally."
"Eaton",",Eaton was a great company to work for overall. They are very open to make sure you have a good work/life balance. Most of the people that I came into contact with were good people. As of late I think things started to go down hill. Everything became more about the bottom line and less about the people. There were/are to many restructuring changes on going. This made it difficult to be productive and have advancement opportunities as management was always changing. I would say that salary was on par with other places. Benefits used to be very good. But a lot of them were taken away during the various organizational changes."
"Eaton",",The Eaton facility in Americus, GA is very resourceful. They teach you basic skills and show you how to perform those skills with proficiency. They teach you how to read the BOM and use the information you obtained to build a fully functional light fixture."
"Eaton",",My Eaton Sandbox was full of the daily pressures of being ""Great"" and/or my ""identity"".. I soon learned to embrace my job and set my 4 pillars into action e.g. (Patents, White Papers)"
"Eaton",",The hardest part of the job was the management maturity model in advanced engineeirng. "
"Eaton",",The most enjoyable part of the job was designing, building, and testing prototypes e.g.( PPAP)"
"Eaton",",A typical day at work; ""you will get pushed out if you don't build small ""castles"" in your sand box""!"
"Eaton",",Eaton is a great company to work for and I would consider returning for the right position, location and pay. I enjoyed the work environment and most of the people were great to work with."

"Eaton",",Would not refer others to Eaton"
"Eaton",",Insensitive company"
"Eaton",",EATON is a fast paced environment with an emphasis on employee advancement and safety in an comfortable work space.  I would recommend them as an employer for those interested in a long term full time employment opportunity especially with reference to electrical engineering."
"Eaton",",Work Culture: Fast paced, work centered on quality, high productivity and safety. Must be flexible and ready to assist in all areas of the business. "
"Eaton",",A typical day at work: Retrieving orders from Vista & Mapics data base, Processing & Scheduling orders to submit to manufacturing lines. Daily contact with Shipping department, Manufacturing leads, Supervisors and employees, Customer Service and Project managers concerning orders (expedites, cancelations, order adjustments). Prepare Sales Report weekly, prepare part shortages reports daily. Assist the Engineering department entering, processing and approving Engineering Change Notices and routing the notices to the proper Commodity managers, Senior Buyers and planners. Attend Meetings (Sales, Departmental & New Product Implementation - weekly)."
"Eaton",",A new CEO in place could change the dynamics, but currently it is very much a ""Good Ole Boy"" network.  This hurts in the ability to move up and expand in broader areas."
"Meetup","Meetup's mission is to create local community and there are few communities as strong as the one within the office itself. Everyone is super supportive and, for the most part, very approachable. It is fairly easy to get face time with management and express your concerns. They are constantly working out better ways to get employee feedback. However, the company has moved slowly in the 12 years that it's been around and has had to play catchup in order to get modern. There's a lot of technical debt and a lot of obvious features that are missing. There was an unusual amount of shifts in management during my time at Meetup. As a result, it was unclear what direction the company was moving in or what the roadmap looked like. That made it frustrating from a product development perspective, especially when everyone feels so invested in this wonderful tool they're helping to create."
"Electronic Arts","Manage and drive revenue while simultaneously bringing brands to life within EA games across multiple platforms. "
"Electronic Arts",",Strategically meet with brands and digital agencies in aim to meet goals & objectives."
"Electronic Arts",",Very happy with the work/life balance as well as management styles. Hardest part would be knowledge transfer from previous employees and maintaining that."
"Electronic Arts",",I love working at EA. Everything about the culture and people here create a great work environment. I've always been a fan of our games, so working here was a dream come true!"
"Electronic Arts",",Enjoyable work environment.  Very easygoing.  Management is genuinely interested in their employees.  Work time is generally flexible and allows for time away or vacations."
"Electronic Arts",",I really appreciate my time at EA. Working at EA allowed me the opportunity to learn the industry, while also growing in the industry. only being a part time gamer prior to joining EA, I learned the skill of bug finding, and the whole QA process. Good managers take their time to teach, and co-workers, make it feel like a family."
"Electronic Arts",",EA is a great place to work. The people are passionate about games and creating the best experience for their players. Everyone strives to help one another and keep the environment fun. If you are a gamer and enjoy helping others, customer support is a great way to get in the door. It is a contact center, however, so player contacts can be stressful and your work schedule is primarily dictated by what the company needs. Take every opportunity to develop yourself (game design, quality assurance, project management, etc) and remember to let customer support is a path towards your true goals."
"Electronic Arts",",Few places come close to the atmosphere present at Electronic Arts. Everywhere you look, you are constantly reminded where you work and why."
"Electronic Arts",",Really just not very good.  No room to move up and poor choices on the part of management.  Really more of a glorified babysitter."
"Electronic Arts",",During my time at Electronic Arts I implemented multiple training programs and agent assistance training. I created and led multiple customer satisfaction improvement projects as well. While Electronic Arts is relatively new it the customer support industry, the lack of room for advancement was a hinderance."
"Electronic Arts",",While I knew I couldn't work there for much longer than the summer because I am a full time student at LSU, it was a great experience working with colleagues to work hard and figure out the bugs in the builds. I learned how to manage my time, where to look for bugs, how to use TestRail and JIRA, tracking in X-Code, and communicating with my team and the developers."
"Electronic Arts",",Provides good work/life balance. Competitive salary and benefits. Provides employees with multiple concierge services on campus."

"Electronic Arts",",Big company with so much potential that is realized through large, well organized teams committed to making the best games they can."
"Electronic Arts",",Prominent franchises are given time to develop with the backing of intelligence that explains where the industry is going."
"Electronic Arts",",Working for Electronic Arts opened my eyes to the gaming community and I was able to talk to fellow players and help them with their jobs. Getting excited for up coming games and enjoying the atmosphere and fellow employees and team. "
"Electronic Arts",",With training that was provided helped me get my foot in the door, well done!"
"Electronic Arts",",The company moves very fast so you need to be okay with change and lot's of different ;challenges.  The people are amazing to work with and talented. Always fun but intense at the same time.  It's truly a relationship focused company.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun challenging environment to work in."
"Electronic Arts",",Very enjoyable and productive day to day job envirroment, management is very people oriented co workers are very nice as well, they support your PMO deliveries."
"Electronic Arts",",Not only do they create entertainment for millions of people, they took care of the people who help create games for those millions of people."
"Electronic Arts",",This is not a job where you go in and play video games all day.  that is not your job!  Your job is to do things over and over again trying different things to try and make the game do something unexpected. If its to cause a crash, a soft lock, or a graphical glitch."
"Electronic Arts",",Background designs were done daily. Loved the pace and challenge of the production and the people were great."
"Electronic Arts",",I thought this was an amazing experience. I was given all the props of a great employee and really enjoyed it. Most people love it so this is not uncommon."
"USAA","When working for website support, safe and encouraging management and staff. Continue training for work and personal classes. Flexible work hours. Fun to work."
"USAA",",I liked working the management, work culture and day to day responsibilities. I would encourage anybody to apply for this company. The most enjoyable part of the job was hanging and taking to my team. I learned so much from them. Highly encourage potential job seekers to go check out the USAA  campus."
"USAA",",Work itself was good and flexible.  Pay in San Antonio is lower than in Austin by about one third.  Facility is very large, about 1 mile long with several cafeteria and restaurants on site."
"USAA",",Poor management everyone was new so noone really knew what to the blind leading the blind hard work didnt matter association did......................"

"USAA",",Every department has to sell products.  It can be difficult to ask someone about life insurance or a teen bank account when they are calling to report a auto accident."
"USAA",",USAA offers competitive salaries, quality benefits, and a stable work culture.  The workload can add up as some parts of the company are understaffed , but overall USAA is a quality empolyer."
"USAA",",Core values are good and training for position is good. Everything is metric based. They micro manage and the if the managers don't like you personally then they find all kinds of faults to terminate you."
"USAA",",Awesome place to work, despite the wages as a contractual employee. Other then that awesome management, dress code, and culture!"
"USAA",",USAA is a great company. I always know what is expected of me and I have the tools I need to do my job.  Furthermore, the company is always finding new ways to show how much they appreciate employees."
"USAA",",Great environment and benefits. Obtained my insurance license and continue to learn more everyday. The culture is lively and supportive."

Insureds depended on us to help explain coverages and what would work best for their insurance needs.  The managers were supportive and encouraging.  The workplace environment was comfortable.  Excellent training was provided and management encouraged ongoing education that also included incentives for completion.  I would probably still be there had I not met my husband and moved to Oregon."

You deal with different nationalities, work with different bosses, different people, different culture. You have to be strong willed to be able to last long. Follow rules and regulations as much as possible and never, ever do something stupid! Working in a sea-based job has its own up and down. Its good you can travel for free, have your own place, eat free food. But you have to be far from your homeland and family for a specific period of time. Loneliness are one of the things you have to deal with aside the work you had that sometimes it is so difficult there's pressure, lack of sleep, you get sick and sometimes get into accident.

"New York Institute of Technology",",It is an ongoing project, the nature of which posed many interesting and challenging engineering problems during the period in which I was involved.  Due to the limited availability of information regarding the behavior of the ink droplets while taking trajectories they were not intended to take, great difficulties were encountered when attempting to determine their exact position at any given instant in time.

This was the part of the job which I enjoyed the most, as it required much problem-solving through assembly design, machining and 3-D printing."

"Veterans Medical Research Foundation",",This organization does not value its employees. They micromanage to a point of insanity. There is no room for advancement or career growth. They do not invest in their employees or their employees' development. The monitor professional-level staff's time like they were minimum wage workers at a McDonalds. Constantly looking to place blame rather the being constructive or supportive.  Management is highly unprofessional and talks poorly about their employees to other employees behind their backs. Extreme opposition to any change to bring their systems, polices, and procedures into modern times or to make operations more efficient. You have to take a shuttle bus from a park and ride way out on Miramar road to and from the VA it adds over 40 minutes to your community daily, and they are extremely inflexible about scheduling to accommodate this huge inconvenience. They do not allow any schedule flexibility and make you feel like a criminal for taking a day off. Truly the worst place I have ever worked."

"Asurion",",working in a production environment, with room for growth in the company. they have an open door policy for communications with your management. good set of core values."
"Asurion",",They micromanage you to the point where it's ridiculous. This probably depends on your supervisor and operations manager on the level. They only care about one thing. Stats so they can get their bonus. They don't care about actually resolving the customers issues. If you're good with that, the place pays well for what it is."
"Asurion",",I utilized multiple screens and handle the issue that the Customer was having. I enjoyed working with my co-workers but the lack of organization is why I am seeking new employment."
"Asurion",",Asurion made their facilities fun. Employees could play ping pong, and bag toss on breaks and lunches. The cubicles are very open and put employees within feet of each other. This allows for better morale, but can cause difficulties with environment while employees are on the phones with customers."
"Asurion",",The integrity of the company and the many ways they should they cared about us the employees was great. It complimented the working experience greatly."

"TEKsystems",",TEKsystems is a IT temp agency that places people into contract or contract to hire positions around the U.S. I didn't have much experience in the work force. With TEKsystems i was able to join in a lot of different projects and receive a few contracts that lasted a reasonable amount of time that i was able to gain the knowledge and experiences to excel in the I.T workforce."
"TEKsystems",",The best part of the day is meeting the customer and the new employee as well as the challenge of the new job.  In all honesty the hardest part of the job is the management who you have to call and try and make happy, after the customer already is and now management is frustrating the customer and your in the middle."
"TEKsystems",",you will learn a lot and the people there are great. You will also work a ton! Great experience, you should go for it! Its a lot of hard work and can get frustrating but the support system is great"
"TEKsystems",",It was an ok work enviroment, nothing special. They promise a lot and that's about it. The staff at the job sites are not friendly, a lot of racism."
"TEKsystems",",Great company to work for, wish they paid a little more and provide benefits but they worked with me to find a job and coach me on what to say during the interviews"
"TEKsystems",",Helpful staff."
"TEKsystems",",Career improving company."
"TEKsystems",",Tek has helped many people that I know."
"TEKsystems",",Fun to keep in touch and do lunch."
"TEKsystems",",All your recruiting needs."
"TEKsystems",",TEKsystems is a good company to get your foot in the door and network. Other than that it's not a place for long term. The pay isn't enough."
"TEKsystems",",Most opportunities will be less than 40 hours a week and work is never guaranteed. Recruiters are friendly and willing to do a lot of work to find you a contract, however, do expect to find much work after each contract. Job security is minimal due to the nature of contracting. Pay will be exactly what you need if they have something for you, but the benefits they offer are not really great for healthcare. If you need something fast and you are not too strapped for cash, this would be a great place to start."
"TEKsystems",",I've taken contracts with TEK Systems several times over my career.  Some staff are far better than others.  Recruiters are hit or miss.  Everyone else has always been wonderful.  They could stand to work on their communication all around.  Only had one major incident with them over a contract."
"TEKsystems",",Tek Systems has done a very good job of finding me another contract when one was completed."
"TEKsystems",",I enjoy working with them as they are very personable and helpful during the transition periods."
"TEKsystems",",I loved working with Teksystems. I've worked with the best of the best in the industry and i got the chance to learn so much during my time with Teksystems"

"TEKsystems",",Support for large Warehouse with 200+ Computers and Printers, fun environment with person to person contact repairing Printers and computers for employees"
"TEKsystems",",Great management and I overall can't complain about the work. It was easy work just replacing printers, hand scanners, logic units, and debit card readers at various walmarts around Indiana."
"TEKsystems",",This was a very good. I was pleased with this position. I spent a large share of my time working on Y2K.  The company did a great job locating new projects for me."
"TEKsystems",",Good contract with good crew. Pay was average. No benefits to start with and length of contract. Placement going into another contract is not immediate."
"TEKsystems",",The company ran us through a test period to establish expected metrics. After establishing those metrics, the company brought in an entire team of new hires residing in Costa Rica. The Costa Rica team was added to our team to allow them several months of training and experience. Once the managers felt the Costa Rica team was ready, the managers terminated our jobs."
"TEKsystems",",Great recruiting company.  They really are there to aid you with any questions that you have.  Very friendly company.  Always checked on their contractors at least once a month. Took us to lunch and scheduled events.  I enjoyed working with Teksystems."

"Pitney Bowes","At Pitney Bowes, I worked as a Mailroom Associate at Pitney Bowes. I handle both incoming and outgoing mail, and responsible for sending out package items for USPS, FedEx, UPS, DHL, Etc. I deliver mail and packages to the AMEX clients and other departments. Lifted heavy packages up to 55 pounds and refill copy rooms with boxes of printer paper. Picked up clients packages from offices or their cubicles. The benefits were great and the manager but unfortunately the hours were only four a day and the schedule wasn't that flexible. I feel this job is beneficial for students and people with less responsibility."
"Pitney Bowes",",Company has been going through system changes which is causing many issues in processes. These issues were the reason the job of speaking with clients is so difficult and stressful. Company is very behind in work and does not have enough staff to do the back office work that the front line callers have to do deal with."
"Pitney Bowes",",They were friendly to me but as I've said everyone is not going to be pleased per person. Mangers are willing to help if needed but not all as in any job."
"Pitney Bowes",",Pitney Bowes is going through huge change. It is trying its best to take its people with it but the pace of change means that some will get left behind. As the market gets more competitive and the company tries new products, life gets tougher and targets get more challenging. That said, there is great cooperative spirit in the company and everyone wants to do their best."
"Pitney Bowes",",The hardest part of the job are the long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the administrative team"
"Pitney Bowes",",The hardest part of the job is getting there especially if you work the 1st shift. This job is very fast paced and requires you to have a lot of energy and be able to multi-task and move quickly."
"Pitney Bowes",",It is enjoyable working with high speed equipment. My coworkers are exceptionally good people to work with. However there is a high turnover rate and it can be difficult to continually work with new people that require constant training."
"Pitney Bowes",",The people make the company and the people here are great. Plenty of room for advancement. Started as an entry level customer service agent and progressed to management"
"Pitney Bowes",",I worked for Pitney Bowes for close to 33 years before getting laid-off in late 2016.  I enjoyed the people I worked with, as well as the working environment. I am looking forward to the next chapter in my life, teaming up to work for another great company."
"Pitney Bowes",",A typical call center but with great managers and excellent bonuses. High pressure sales but with a strong and structured support system that will help guide you to success if you are the right fit."
"Pitney Bowes",",Not much cohesion with this company too many change over, keep changing strategy and sales"
"Pitney Bowes",",The leadership team makes decision without support of the staff.  Changes every year due to sales issues, does not give a chance for strategy to take hold then changes again."
"Pitney Bowes",",Work alone on a lot of machines at one time.  "
"Pitney Bowes",",Learned a lot about electrical mechanical machines"

"Pitney Bowes",",The environment was very friendly and family oriented."
"Pitney Bowes",",I will miss you job of 24 years."
"Pitney Bowes",",Not saying that overall Pitney Bowes is a horrible company to work for but I can say that the Indianapolis Presort facility gives this company a bad reputation.  Advancement opportunities are not based on experience and education but if you're liked by management.  New hires for positions of leadership start off making more than senior staff.  That's their way of being competitive in the job market.  Wouldn't discourage anyone from applying at any locations because Pitney Bowes is a well established company internationally."
"Pitney Bowes",",Very tough work environment with little to no support.  The people are great and committed to doing the right things for customers and the business, however, the overall culture and  work environment is challenging."
"Pitney Bowes",",Pitney Bowes was a great company. Great benefits and they really cared about there employees. It was a friendly environment and I really enjoyed that you kept busy and learning new things everyday. There is really nothing hard about a job if you put your mind to it. I enjoy people and learning new things I am more than ready to get out in the work field and more motivated than ever."
"Pitney Bowes",",Some of the managers were not that good.   Lots of work but not back breaking.  The employees were cool.  Dealing with Anthrax scanned mail should have paid more money to the employees."
"Pitney Bowes",",It was actually fun we had one of our fellow employees as the manager so we all felt like family and I would say that we had a great time working together as a department."
"Birchbox","A typical day while interning at Birchbox included working with the content team to help brainstorm ideas for future online magazine articles as well as future video concepts. I also attended various team meetings and created props for upcoming monthly video shoots. On shoot days, I would attend and assist on set with any tasks. I absolutely adored every single co-worker and they were all a pleasure to work with. Everyone is friendly and outgoing. The hardest part of the job was mastering the Birchbox voice through my writing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the office in itself, which is an upbeat environment filled with treats and surprises everyday. I really enjoyed being there everyday."
"Birchbox",",When I first got hired, they made Birchbox SoHo (before it even opened) out to be an AMAZING environment with a great teamwork ethic and a place for advancement....HAHA!"
"Birchbox",",Management was very bad, and the only good ones they had they fired due to them not having the ""looks"" Birchbox wanted (aka discriminated against their body types, etc). Management also chose favorites and conducted things as if it was a middle school cafeteria lunch table... only certain people got praise and perks, whereas others who worked even harder got treated horrible."
"Birchbox",",This place needs to get their act together. Stop making employees who are NOT PAID COMMISSION get in trouble for not having met ridiculous and unreasonable sales goals. There is no need to make them compete against each other if it is not commission-based"
"Birchbox",",A lot of different events and things for employees to look forward to"
"Birchbox",",I learned a lot of different ways to do things "
"Birchbox",",Co workers are hard working and very knowledgable"

I was a administrative supervisor for the director of patient services. I learned what it takes to run the operations of a health services organization. Customer service, employ satisfaction, management objectives, union employees, customer improvement processes. committees are just a few of the skills that I learned as an employee at Montefiore. The culture was a team atmosphere customer satisfaction regarding quality care.

"Montefiore Medical Center",",Great organization with very limited room for professional growth when working in the individual departments. Management can improve in the area of interacting with associates, and focus more on how to guide employee to work and improve their productivity level  in a more positive way for employees self motivation."
"Montefiore Medical Center",",Stressful but rewarding work environment. Each level of staff can definitely be over worked and underpaid. Management recognizes talent and does try to encourage growth within the company. However, company standards result in underpayment of staff on occasion."
"Montefiore Medical Center",",It's a good place to work.  Opportunity for advancement is available. You're exposed to patients and staff from different ethnicity and cultures.  Management is supportive."
"Montefiore Medical Center",",I like the people I work with in my department. Management has gotten better but they lack to promote from within, they'd rather hire someone from the outside."
"Montefiore Medical Center",",Montefiore is great company for advancement and personal growth for all employees with an emphasis on patient safety. All persons are attempted to be treated equally."
"Montefiore Medical Center",",Montefiore is one of the biggest hospitals in the Bronx and prides themselves on hiring with the community. My biggest problem is the lack of community between campus. I worked in Yonkers and they never encouraged campus unity.  "
"Montefiore Medical Center",",Management did their best to support their staff and my co-workers were awesome."
"Montefiore Medical Center",",Great, Outstanding and Loyal to a fault. Hidden talents that you never know you have until the challenge is presented. My works speaks for itself.  I am a hard worker and love a challenge."
"Montefiore Medical Center",",I liked working for Monte but, it was a lot of work and I feel like people who were favored by the Union get away with slot. Such as some people felt as if they were untouchable because they were in the Union and could do whatever they want."
"Montefiore Medical Center",",flexible work hours and convenient to home.  director is very to easy to work for.  co-workers are mixed nationality and easy to work with,  best part of job is we travel and get to meet new people."
"Montefiore Medical Center",",When I was employed at Montefiore, I enjoyed coming to work and learning so much everyday.  I was very young at the time but it was a great start in Healthcare.  It thought me discipline and accountability."
"Montefiore Medical Center",",Positive environment. Great staff. Strong focus in learning and continuing education. Several trainings and opportunities for growth."
"ThriveHive","My leaving had little to do with the company as much as it did with me. I had a great time there and was able to get some good work done but ultimately I decided coaching wasn't for me and that'd prefer to be implementing marketing strategies than coaching them. Otherwise, they're undergoing a lot of changes right now with a recent buyout so if you're looking for a true startup culture then they may not be it."
"ThriveHive",",Being a part of ThriveHive has been an incredibly positive experience in my life. We have built an outstanding team of people, all of whom bring so much to the table that it's easy to feel intimidated. Because it's a startup, there is rarely and ""typical day"", but the unpredictability means that you are always on your toes and always learning. The work we do is extremely rewarding, and hearing the success stories of our customers makes everyones chests swell with pride."
"Merck","I enjoyed the opportunity to use my creativity to build strong relationships with my customer base and their staff through consistent and effective territory management.  I would take technical information and convey it into practical education for HCPs and their staff.  I managed my territory as a small business and I practiced corporate stewardship in conducting discussions during lunches or dinner.  "
"Merck",",As primary touch points, my team and I worked to collaborate and coordinate our efforts and resources to exhibit a streamlined approach to our activities.  Our customers appreciated our coordinated approach and we were viewed as valuable assets during our scientific interactions.  "
"Merck",",My most memorable and enjoyable moments were during lunches or joint appointments with my team.  We would play off of each other’s discussion.  Often we would begin with a patient profile that was common to each product being marketed and though it seemed rehearsed we conducted credible discussions and there was a natural flow, utilizing a customer-focused approach."
"Merck",",I found it challenging when HCPs had dedicated time slots and often times could not be seen because of their patient load.  Although, I have relationships with the HCPs but due to the volume of patients - choices have to be made on the physician's part in order to meet his/her patients needs.  "
"Merck",",I implemented a work around to this issue by trying every possible way to keep my product top of mind.  Upon meeting with the HCPs during subsequent meetings, I mentioned their dedication to their patients. Often times they drive the dialogue"
"Merck",",  "
"Merck",", by sharing patient cases and I in turn ask questions based on their responses.  We come to some kind of action that resonates their patient concerns and requires a change in their Rxing behavior, which occurs over the course of several interactions.  "

"Merck",",Overall a good place to work prior to their restructuring and layoffs (quite a few). Casual environment, great pay and benefits, nice perks and location"
"Merck",",Merck is a great competitive company to work at. One of the best places to work in the North East.

I've learned how to run a Distributed Control System, learned boiling points of solvents, how to use tank jacket services efficiently, and even learned how to troubleshoot computer signal problems from CSE personnel. As a control room operator, I get to communicate with the outside operators. Informing them when it's time to charge a solvent or solids into a tank. Training a new operator is a joy for me. It allows me to show and explain to them all that I have learned about chemical processing. Aside from the outside operators, I communicated daily with supervisors, lab technicians, computer system engineers, and engineering group."

"U.S. Bank",",Dishonest upper management. 2 AVP's charged with theft and corruption in my 2 years working there."
"U.S. Bank",",US Bank can be a great employer, however this varies greatly from department to department. US Bank is the 2nd largest employer in my city. The department I worked in was very high stress with a lack of management and support. I know employees in other departments who are very happy with their jobs."
"U.S. Bank",",This company treats there emplyees with respect at all times.  It is very client based and all staff are trained to treat everyone as if they are the 1st and only client.  Management is very active with all staff from the 1st levels all the way up to the CEO."
"U.S. Bank",",Its a great place but my supervise showed favoritism with certain workers. But upper management is so great and the overall jobs and other people was so helpful. Outside of my first supervisor my co worker and my second supervise was great ."
"U.S. Bank",",There was a lot of multi-tasking at this job, which could become stressful.  Being assigned sales quotas for company products also created a lot of stress each quarters.  Working in a small town branch, I did feel like I was helping to serve my community.  Still, the job did have a lot of stress."
"U.S. Bank",",US Bank has an amazing environment, for employees and for clients alike. They treat their teams fairly and the sales goals are realistic.  The training that US Bank provides for employees is top notch and respected much within the industry."
"U.S. Bank",",Was very easy to sell and hit goals. But the workers are very lazy and very short staffed. You can hit all your goals and win a great award but your payout will be terrible . You will have to learn on your own management is worried about themselves or audits . Very shady . But its a good job to start with because it will make you want to work herder to find a better one ."
"United Airlines","A typical day at United Airlines can range from orderly and smooth, to chaotic in the matter of a few small storms. I have to adapt to the needs of the company as well as the very specific needs of the customer. Working with various guests and their individual needs in a time sensitive industry is a norm. Federal regulations govern our operations therefore there is constant communication with management in regards to proper execution of daily processes. Union rules govern interaction and execution of daily processes with management and customers respectively. I work with people from all nationalities and backgrounds; and together we make the best out of every situation, while working together building a strong community across the globe.The hardest part of my job is not being able to meet every customer's needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can create a memorable experience that invites return flyers; an experience that reinforces the company's brand, and challenges me to obtain excellence of service in the airline industry."

"United Airlines",",Worked long hours but did not mind because I really enjoyed the work"
"United Airlines",",Culture was great - I used to hang out with co-workers outside of work all the time"
"United Airlines",",Volatile industry. When things were going well we got nice pay increases and bonuses. When things were going poorly there were pay cuts and job cuts"
"United Airlines",",United Airlines was a great place to work at. But the compensation was low for us. Especially for me. I lived in Vallejo and had to pay gas and toll to drive to the airport. No job security because you were just a number. This I mentioned because although I was a good worker. I was furloughed due to 9/11, instead of kept. Due to lack of seniority."
"United Airlines",",The typical day starts at 4am, all overnight aircrafts have to be secured, paperwork for the day has to be ready for all flights as they come. There are times where you'll be working one flight or 2 or 3 flights at the same time. There's a rush and you're busy the entire time and don't even notice the time go by. Between communicating via radios with the pilots, the ramp, and passenger service and also communicating via phones with the towers, you'll forget you've been there since 4am. Shift end at 4pm. "
"United Airlines",",In my position I deal with everyone except the passengers. I am in constant communication with the county, the managers and supervisors, FAA, NOC, planners, schedulers, and the pilots. It's a job that requires a lot of multi tasking and attention to detail."
"United Airlines",",The most difficult part of the job is being able to determine which calls or flights have the most priority. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the multi tasking required from working several flights all at once. The rush of working a flight with a mechanical or a medical, while waiting for the next flight to arrive. There's a rush on the pressure that makes it worth while and exciting."
"United Airlines",",On a typical day I unload trucks, stock products and rotate food products. Management and the work place was very productive and comprehensible. The company fed the workers breakfast, lunch and dinner. There was nothing hard about the job, it was a fun work area with great co-workers."
"United Airlines",",It was with United I was at my best. I was qualified to taxi and accomplish high power runs. My supervisor was incredible. Developed a strong bond with many employees"
"United Airlines",",Culture is not good. They constantly compare themselves to benchmarks Delta has set, and always fall short. Morale is very low, since layoffs still happen yearly due to ""synergies"". If you like traveling a lot the flight benefits are great. There still seems to be a lot of ""us vs. them"" mentality among people who were there before the merger."

"University of Maryland, Baltimore",",Management at the Cancer Center often provides unclear guidance and is non-communicative in their expectations. If you are on the wrong track or doing something sub-par, they will not work with you (or even let you know) to rectify the situation until they have decided you have failed at your job, in which case, they still do not create or discuss action plans. "
"University of Maryland, Baltimore",",Coworkers are wonderful and the staff wants to do excellent work but the center suffers from low morale due to the disconnect between management and subordinate staff."

I got a long with the staff very well. They even notice how much the children loved me. It taught me a lot about myself. I found out I wanted to be a social worker more than anything. These children go through so much at home and they always need someone to talk to and I was there for them. I managed five to six children at once. The hardest part was working with children who had behavioral problems for the first time was tough. Once you get to know them it becomes easier."
"Rutgers University",",Loved working here staff was amazing. Helped me with really understanding what I wanted to do for a future career option, staff kept up with me after internship ended."
"Rutgers University",",Rutgers is a good school where you can excel in many areas to help further your future career.

"Rutgers University",",I'm teaching the introduction to experiments that is required for all science and engineering major. Usually I just prepared the set up of the experiments and write up the blackboard. Our course coordinator are easy going since whenever I have a question. He is willing to answer and solve for me. During teaching, I learned how to speak more comfortable in public and how to demonstrate and show what I know to students. Also I learnt the problem solving skills since all kinds of accidents might rise during a lab. The hardest part is to learn how to teach a basic chemistry concept to the student clearly and how to communicate with them. But the part I like most is to talk to the students and help them with the lab. Since it's the best way to practice my oral skills and making more connections to others."

"Rutgers University",",I am having a great time at Rutgers. The staff is very caring and is ready to provide assistance at any time of the day. But since Rutgers is a state funded university, it pays less."
"Rutgers University",",The staff at the computer labs is awesome, lots of information to take on but training is excellent. Work life balance is great."

"Rutgers University",",Worked with some very highly qualified instructors and students who helped with understanding the job and made great instructors and friends."
"Rutgers University",",Great place to work, enjoy working with students and socializing them into the field. Great support and felt like a part of the team. I have had difficulty getting a teaching job but I have been a Field Instructor and Field Liaison. I would love the opportunity to teach here"
"Rutgers University",",Worked here for a short period of time . Surprised by little guidance and poor overall communication across departments and department itself. Most days were spend doing paperwork or seeing clients back to back. No time for breaks. Little opportunity to better integrate or get to know any of colleagues as everyone worked alone in their office behind closed doors. Staff appeared skillfull and knowledgeable but overscheduled and spread thin. Little contact with upper management. Suggestions or questions/ concerns were discouraged and reprimanded. Supervision focused on administrative matters and less on clinical issues. Direct supervisor seemed burned out and overcritical. Overall, disappointed and unhappy about my experience. It seemed like it would be a great job opportunity except in my experience I saw that everyone kept their head down, opinions to self and kept working until a better opportunity came along. On a"
"Rutgers University",",positive note, I enjoyed working with clients and sought out a better fit."

"KEMET Electronics Corporation","Good benefits. Had to do some travel to Mexico. Was laid off so job isn't what I would consider a good risk. I was salaried. Did have sick days."
"KEMET Electronics Corporation",",Great company sad that foreign competitors dictate material prices that forced the closing spend 19 years in one place really planned on retirement from Kemet"
"KEMET Electronics Corporation",",The hardest part of the job was getting laid off due to market fluctuations. Immediate supervisors and management were superb and supportive of upward movement of employees. I miss the team aspect of working there."
"KEMET Electronics Corporation",",The company is very volatile and undergoes change routinely.  It is a great place to learn as you are constantly challenged to do more with less and wear many hats."
"KEMET Electronics Corporation",",I don't know of many people who actually looked forward to going to work every day, but I can truthfully say that of my time at Kemet.  Although there were times where I was frustrated and overextended, I was able to work well in the Kemet system to achieve the company's goals while at the same time realizing my personal goals."
"KEMET Electronics Corporation",",Kemet Electronics is a multinational company with many talented engineers and scientists from all over the world.  It was my interactions with these people that made working at Kemet such a joy.  Every day was a new challenge and working with people from all across the globe to solve complex technical issues was part of my every day routine.  I learned how to work with different cultures from many different educational backgrounds and successfully complete our project goals."
"KEMET Electronics Corporation",",Managed all aspects of a customer's accounts from setting it up to applying cash, issuing credit notes, etc. Supported AR teams from other KEMET affiliates.

"Vencore","I worked from home so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the corporate stuff. However, there was no room to grow and we lost our contract very soon after I was hired on."
"Vencore",",It was a good place to work at and be with good people and with some learning opportunities depending on status at the company: contractor or employee."
"Vencore",",Has extensive background in Army market, however the corporate management does not have the same experience. How to grow in market still evades the company in DoD market."
"Vencore",",Company leadership is in a constant state of change. The operations onsite manager is overworked and does not have the staff to support facilities, contract bids, and the corporate processes are very cumbersome to get anything done in a timely manner. A lot of layers of overhead but leadership keeps downsizing at the on-site operations level vice looking at corporate support. Eventually, you give up on corporate to provide the support needed or guidance to meet the process intent. Overall, all the field onsite employees work fairly well together and get things done."
"Vencore",",After spending many years in the military, this job is a good start to easing the transition into the civilian work force."
"Vencore",",Typical day is checking your e-mails, attending meeting and following up with action items. The management communicates well with the employees and keep everyone aware of upper management decisions."
"Vencore",",There is zero leadership, you will not have a good experience at this company for as long as an equity firm owns it. Over 2500 people fired, laid off or left due to the trajectory of the company."
"Vencore",",This company has been sold and no longer exists.  It was a division of QinetiQ Inc., out of Europe.  QinetiQ of Europe still exists and would be an enjoyable place to work."
"Vencore",",initial onboarding was a bit rough but over all the benefits are pretty good. Management is helpful and understanding."
"Vencore",",I like working at Vencore. The people there are professional and smart. they have a very flexible schedule.They have lots of fun there."
"Vencore",",Pros"
"Vencore",",The company is comprised of good people and very smart engineers who are dedicated to their customers and the mission. If you want to learn how to be a top-notch systems engineer, this is a good place to start your career. The work life balance is good and the work is important to keeping the nation safe."
"Vencore",",Cons"
"Vencore",",The company has gone through a period of significant change doubling in size over the last two years. The new management is starting to find their footing but have made some mistakes along the way. Unfortunately the mistakes have resulted in the loss of good talent and the drive to boost profits to position the company for sale has reduced the benefits leaving a morale issue in it's wake."
"Vencore",",Advice to Management"
"Vencore",",Make your employees feel like they are an important asset to the business and show respect for the vast experience and knowledge of the long timers. They are the ones that can make a difference in attracting, training and retaining top talent."
"Vencore",",Helpful (3)"
"Vencore",",Flag as Inappropriate Flag as Inappropriate"
"Vencore",",Classy company to work for.  i enjoyed it.  very executive like!  Engineering Services company.  well balanced benefits package"
"Vencore",",The people and atmosphere are great. I enjoy what I do and I'm given the tools to be successful. The only issue I have is the instability of contract work."
"Vencore",",A typical day at work was not so much what you had hoped for because for some you are assigned the hardest patients and most of the time you feel sick to your stomach when it gets time to to work. I did quite a few things .the co workers are not when you need them. Hardest part of the job was when we are short of employees The most enjoyable part of the job is the fulfillment that you are making a difference in some one's life."
"Vencore",",The onboarding process is a joke. No one knows what they are doing and nothing is processed correctly. If Vencore isn't the prime on a contract, run away. Direct supervisors tend to be useless and want to be everyone's friend. No one has your back. If this is the path you choose, good luck."
"Vencore",",Just not sure how stable the company is any longer. There are so many changes occurring and not all of them are for the good."
"Vencore",",Provides expertise as the Senior Information Assurance Engineer on the CHCO (Chief Human Capital Office) project team, for the I2S contract."
"Vencore",",Good Company to work for on a day to day basis. Have good training programs for employees, Not a lot of advancement and management lets customer dictate business practices."
"Vencore",",Typical office job with likable and knowledgeable coworkers (engineers)."
"Vencore",",Can interact with first/second line managers, but basically no contact with corporate."
"Vencore",",Performance reviews were a standardized rubric that was applied to all employees - some categories made no sense when applied to engineers. Even though sick leave is offered, you are punished for taking it."
"Vencore",",Organization is very top heavy leaving little room for advancement for early career employees."
"Vencore",",Most enjoyable part of the job was working with other engineers. Hardest part of the job was getting started since there is no formal training."
"Vencore",",Learned a lot about modeling and simulating communication systems as well as giving technical presentations to a diverse audience."
"Vencore",",Hardest  part of the job is climbing into a M1 Tank to get a photo of the odometer. The best part of the job is working with the Soldiers if you were in the military you would understand."
"Vencore",",I enjoyed my longevity with the company. Learned many skills over the years. Built many professional and personal relationships."
"Domino's","Good part time job for college students trying to get some extra money. People working here are also friendly. I would recommend working part time."
"Domino's",",flexible hour, rotating schedule, Tips, overall wasn't really a bad place to work. General Managers are very understanding on drivers scheduling and weather affecting delivery times"
"Domino's",",I loved working for dominos. I worked their for 3 years. My favorite part was making pizzas and just having fun with it. The hardest part was when it became rush time and some days your okay and some you just cant handle it. It was still my favorite place to work for!"
"Domino's",",Everyone at Domino's had a fun personality. Folding boxes is what drivers call idle work, when you have nothing else to do, fold boxes. The job is easy and enjoyable, you get to use your own car, you get to deal with people, although some people are more enjoyable to deal with. You're a tip wage earner, so some days you'll make a great amount of tips, and others you'll wonder why you even showed up. All in all, it's still my favorite job."
"Domino's",",Had the worst experience ever! Started as a csr and rose to assistant manager working 40-50 hours a week while being a single parent higher management was very rude and not understanding had an issue with general manager called district management and they did nothing"
"Domino's",",I was constantly kept past my scheduled hours, workspace was cramped during busy hours, and some management people chose to push their work onto other workers."
"Domino's",",However, free food."
"Domino's",",Enjoyed driving company cars and interacting with customers ."
"Domino's",",The owners a know it all but pretty decent guy. The other employees are mostly slacker types. Often too many drivers can make the wait to get a run frustrating. The atmosphere is pretty friendly."
"Domino's",",Domino's Pizza is a well managed and efficient company. The district level management is unparalleled in the amount of devotion they have to the company and effectiveness with which they carry out their jobs. For the most part, the people I worked with on a daily basis were friendly and helpful. I can honestly say I liked working at Domino's."
"Domino's",",well im not really sure of what to say about this job. I started this job while it was my senior year in high school . I don't have anything bad to say about this job it was a great start for a first job"
"Domino's",",It a great place to be at all the other coworkers and manager's are great to be around it long shift but you will in jooy your self have team meat so every one can be on the same page and is a very clean place also u can meet a lot of good people there ."
"Domino's",",They are flexible with you schedule and very understanding. "
"Domino's",",They are respectful and really believe in customer service! They're awesome!"
"Domino's",",Take orders from customers on phone and in person. Do inventory, clean the store, do the scheduling, make food, tell people what to do."
"Domino's",",It is an ok place to work for. Better for kids starting in the work force, instead of someone trying to feed a family. The area that i work in doesn't receive many tips as it is one of the counties that doesn't have many jobs that pay out high amounts."
"Domino's",",Working here at dominoes had some good qualities to it and some not so good qualities to it. The managers here were not hands on and they didn't treat there employees with any type of respect. I did however enjoy the experience I have had working with the general public."
"Domino's",",Dominos was very flexible with weekly scheduling. However, managment overall was unsatisfactory and unprofessional. No benefits were offered and it was not a career consideration for me. It was a temporary way to eran money while attending college full-time."
"Domino's",",I had to work late nights as a college student. We wasn't allowed breaks at all. They took advantage of college students because they knew we needed money."
"Domino's",",I think this is a great start up job for young employees. Exposes you to a lot of different experiences that can be used later in a professional career."
"Domino's",",Managers get pushed into lowing hours, so your hours are unsteady. I did not feel financially secure working here because some weeks I would have hours and some weeks, I was not able to get hours. It is extremely hard to get a raise, they set a goal that is impossible for you to reach in exchange for a raise."
"Domino's",",I really enjoyed working at dominos. You learn alot while working there and tend to build a relationsship with the everyday customers"
"Domino's",",Good people to work for. Long hours and hard work. Team driving, usually the guys that dont work hard dont make it. Work three days a week but you may end up working 22 hours a day."
"Domino's",",Working for the company was fun. I learned a lot about customer service and delivery. The most enjoyable part about the job was meeting new people and the positive feedback I got from customers and coworkers."

"Kamehameha Schools",",I learned a lot about how to effectively teach a young child and how to be a positive role model in their life.  Being that we are the first educators they experience, I tried to make learning fun and memorable.  Kamehameha Schools really takes care of their employees."
"Kamehameha Schools",",I spent my time shelving books and organizing the section I was assigned to. I also retrieved special references for faculty, staff and students."
"Kamehameha Schools",",I enjoyed working with my co-workers.  The work also kept me busy and I learned a lot about the education side of the company.  The office was growing and trying to incorporate all different divisions into one was hard at first but it got better"
"Kamehameha Schools",",School year begins in early August and ends in late May. Campus is located in Keaau area. Uses common core standards and offers a selection of elective at the high school level"
"Kamehameha Schools",",Long, thankless days.  Snotty and snooty upper management. (corporate at Kawaiaha'o Plaza.  Yes, them!  They have no clue what a servant leader does or how to work with human beings.  Dee Jay, Sylvia, Lauren...we miss you so much!!!!  Now, it's just about the numbers and selfie pats on their own backs.  They even hand out little stars for us to put on their goals.  Who do they think got them to reaching those goals anyway?  Not them!  The most enjoyable part of the job is the camaraderie among the other worker bees like me.  I'm outta' there.  Enough is enough."
"Kamehameha Schools",",I worked for the Summer with children that ranged from the ages 4-5.  A typical day at work would be supervising the children playing in the morning, then I would take them to pool and help them swim for 40 minutes at a time.  I learned to have a lot of patience during this job.  We would rotate the children throughout the day between the different activities. The management I worked for was amazing and very energetic. My coworkers were other students that either graduated from Kamehameha or currently in school.  Everyone I worked with were great and were very helpful.  The hardest part of the job was trying to gain the trust of the non experience swimmers.  I would usually have the group that didn't really know how to swim.  This was also the most enjoyable part of the job.  It was a great feelings to see them progress, learn and even jump towards me with full confidence.  I enjoyed helping the children learn the basics of swimming and it was great to see their excitement grow throughout the summer."
"Kamehameha Schools",",Typical day included resolving staff IT issues (Hardware, software, network) creating tickets when work needed to be sent to higher tier."
"Kamehameha Schools",",Large Private Education Institution that provided generous opportunities to  keep the education of the students in the limelight.  We had Boarding students from the outer Islands and that  added to the wholesome atmosphere of the campus.  "
"Kamehameha Schools",",In the Tennis Camp experience, I grew tremendously from having the opportunity to be part of the management of a boarding summer camp working with a staff of fifty people and young college students."
"Kamehameha Schools",",I retired from the Navy, two years active and 28 years in thereserves and rose to the rate of Master Chief.  This opportunity eposed me the the many facets of the military and civilian community."
"Kamehameha Schools",",I especially enjoyed helping the students become succesful in their required curriculum and working with very qualifed staff"
"Kamehameha Schools",",Typical day included setting up laptops for the students to use throughout the day and helping students with laptop usage.  The end of the day was dedicated to making sure that the students were on their buses on time back to their places of residence.  I learned a great deal of patients and persistence as I continued to help the students."
"Kamehameha Schools",",A typical day for me is teaching Hawaiian choral music to students in grades 9-12. The staff prepares the students for an annual song contest competition that usually takes place in March. The students have two months or so to memorize their music. I also help out with any office tasks that the music director may need for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing what you love. I absolutely love being able to teach and share with the students the importance of knowing who they are and where they come from as Hawaiians. It's fun to see the students face light up when they make that connection."
"Kamehameha Schools",",The organization maintains a long-term vision with strategic goals."
"Kamehameha Schools",",Working as a Lifeguard for Kamehameha Schools can be a very rewarding experience. Some days you get to accompany groups of students of all ages to various locations around the island. Most days are spent at the Olympic size swimming pool located on the campus where students K-12 supervised by teachers come and swim. The management and co-workers for the most part are very friendly and helpful, you can come to them with any questions or concerns."
"Kamehameha Schools",",Employees who work hard and dedicate themselves to the school, suffer criticism, are considered an outcast, and soon sent to the door. "
"Kamehameha Schools",",Princess Pauahi Bishop would be, and maybe is saddened, that her good deed turned into a monopoly over power and money. There is no genuine care for employees, much of whom are under-paid, those who spend time gossiping and wasting company monies are honored. Students are not receiving the highest level of education for a private school. Don't be fooled. It is not the same. Have you seen Kamehameha students from the Hawaii campus? Disgraceful."
"Kamehameha Schools",",Nothing changed through the reorganization 20 years ago. There is absolutely no fairness and even aloha for employees. Employees run that school into a disgrace. "
"Kamehameha Schools",",Gossiping is very bad and the way you can be targeted if they don't like you. Take a look at the high rate of vacancies the schools have in Keaau. Very political. I would not recommend anyone to work there or even send your kids there. You will be sadly disappointed. Working here is like living in prison. Don't let the fake smiles fool you, because those are the ones gaining all the rewards. The real workers, educated workers, are bullied and picked on constantly."
"Kamehameha Schools",",There is no teaching of Hawaiian values and morals. Why? Because the adults there can't even do it. You would think an organization like this would be different. Full of love and not tolerate idle gossip. It is, instead filled with people who maneuvered their way into a job who care nothing for the Hawaiian people. "
"Kamehameha Schools",",Think twice before deciding to work in this environment,"
"Kamehameha Schools",",  "
"Kamehameha Schools",",  or subject your child to such torture of no support, no extra help, made fun of in front of others, and the list goes on."
"Kamehameha Schools",",I don't think this school can recover. If you see the highest decrease in enrollment and continuous vacancies....think why this is. It is not a place of love, christianity, and nurturing......."
"Kamehameha Schools",",We Hawaiians did better without this fake school."
"Kamehameha Schools",",  "
"Kamehameha Schools",",Days are long but yet interesting.  As an employee, you always learn something new.  Sometimes its from the kids and other times its from your own co-worker.  Time management is key and important because you always want to keep the kids focused but yet educate them.  The hardest part the job is to make sure you go at a pace that the entire class is learning."

"Rover.com","I love working for Rover because it makes me feel safe, insured, and  works with my schedule. I am a full time college student so being able to set my own schedule, prices, and deny a customer if I don't feel they are a right fit is great. The only problem that I have is Rover takes 20% of your earnings. I set my prices to be affordable for my customers, so the extra 20% taken away kind of hurts."
"Rover.com",",as a rover it gave me a chance to move from post to post around the complex which was a promotion. this gave me a chance to move up in the company and explore other positions within the company"
"Rover.com",",A typical day is mostly having fun with the pups and making sure they are well fed and get plenty of exercise. "

"Rover.com",",You make  great friends and repeated clients depending how good you take care of there dogs."
"Rover.com",",I have been a dog sitter on Rover.com since Spring 2013. Its a great side job for dog lovers and keeps life interesting!  I board dogs in my home and also offer traveling services. Many local dog owners contact me year round to inquire about my services, and every stay that was booked has been great. It takes hard work and dedication but I've met a lot of awesome people and dogs along the way."
"Rover.com",",Rover was great and I wish I could do it again in this town. It works with whatever your schedule is and is a great way to make money and if you love dogs you'll love rover"
"Rover.com",",I really enjoy working for rover, but there are a few downsides. They dont take taxes out and they do take 15% of what you earn, while also charging your clients fees on top of that. They do have great customer service and I have never had a problem with rover while trying to figure something out with them."
"Rover.com",",A typical day at work was about 7 hours long with a lunch break. I learned many things about dentistry and healthcare including how instruments are cleaned as well as tooth and mouth care. The hardest part of my job was making sure that everything was cleaned thoroughly and in the manner that they were supposed to be cleaned."
"Rover.com",",Rover is the best! You can make your own schedule, work whenever you want and simply put your profile into away mode when you are busy. Everything is customizable, so you get to set your price, choose what kinds of pets you'd like to either sit or walk, whether you also do grooming, what size dog you would be open to watching. However, you are taking on the responsibility of someone;s family member, so that is something to keep in mind."
"Rover.com",",I love working with Rover.com it has opened my job experience with animals! Its a great place to meet new people with just as much passion of animals! I havent had one problem with my customers since working with this company!  Payment is rated very well! Love it thank you rover.com"

"Rover.com",",While I am in school, Rover is a great thing to do and im glad I was able to have so much success with it. I am a full time student and dont have time for a fulltime job so working this part time around my schedule is easy and fun! I absolutely love working as a dog sitter/walker and its been a great year so far!"
"Rover.com",",As a dog sitter in the retirement area of Sun City West, AZ, I am very pleased with the relationship my wife and I have with Rover. We sincerely enjoy the dogs we watch and have a story to tell about each and every one. We had to put our little blind dog to sleep about three months ago so this does a great job of filling that gap. We have decided to love other people's doggies rather than adopting another. We have had little ones, big ones, puppies and older dogs. Of course we have some favorites, but we love them one and all."
"Rover.com",",Rover is a great way to connect people who love animals. They thoroughly vet their dog sitters to take the worry off the owners. It's easy for them to find me. I love that the mobile app lets you do dog walk cards, so the owner is always up to date."
"Rover.com",",I first heard of rover through a coworker at my full time job. She explained being very content with the services provided by the company which is where my interest in the company began. After having looked further and researching, I loved everything the company stands for. Being a past dog owner and knowing how important the services offered by rover are to dog owners it made me want to join the team to offer the same quality service that I would wis to receive. I was also looking for a flexible way to make extra money but at the same time doing something I enjoyed and rover fit all those categories. In addition, the team at rover is super supportive and has always answered all my questions. They are also easy to reach and have great availability. Overall, I love the company. Essentially you can you make your schedule and you sit the price so it is a win win."
"Rover.com",",We love Rover! It's flexible and has been a great source of extra income for our family. I'm a stay at mom and this helps make sure I can continue to be home with my daughter. It has been a lot of fun having new furry friends to come play at our house and Zeus loves it too!"
"Rover.com",",My fiance and I joines since we are looking to get a dig but didnt have time ti fully commit with travel schedule prior to wedding.  Rover gave us a chance to fill the companionship void when we are in town, while helping the owners"
"Rover.com",",Rover provides a unique opportunity for a fun and active side job as well as meeting both pups and people in your area! I started Rover upon moving to a new city and it has been an excellent chance to hang out with some dogs, make some extra cash, meet some new people and explore different areas of the city through housesitting. Rover helps you connect with dog owners you would never meet otherwise and has kept me quite busy as a dog and house sitter. "
"Rover.com",",With the opportunity for meet and greets and complete control over your own schedule and bookings, it's a very safe platform. I highly recommend Rover to anyone with some extra dog love and care to give!"
"Rover.com",",I love dog sitting for Rover. I get a lot of requests from dog owners and everyone I have met is very nice and willing to work with my school schedule. It's a great and fun way to earn some extra money! I love how I can choose my own rates too."
"Red Ventures","High paced lots of excitement, change and free food. The company truly invests in its employees and pushes them to overcome personal and professional hesitations to succeed to your utmost capacity."
"Red Ventures",",It's a typical on the phone sales job. The management doesn't care about the employees, but only for themselves and how big their checks can be. They will train you one way and tell you what to say to the customer to make the sale, but will then turn around and penalize you for doing exactly what they told you do. "
"Red Ventures",", It's almost impossible to use your earned/given PTO; you have to darn near beg to get days off even if you request it months or weeks in advance."
"Red Ventures",",The only thing that's decent is the commission check at the end of the month IF you're willing to work like crazy for the extra cash."
"Red Ventures",",This was my dream job.  It was the best place I have ever worked.  Great culture, smart people, great food and very transparent company.  You can make a lot of money in the sales field."
"Red Ventures",",You have a very high pressured sales environment with a compensation that doesn't match its intensity. It can be fun at times but one slip on compliance/qa and your out the door."
"Red Ventures",",Red Ventures is ideal for someone fresh out and ready to make a good amount of money quick. The money wasnt bad but the constant micro-managment of the company gets pretty exhausting. Terrible work schedule starting out my schedule was (4pm-1am), which totally threw my sleeping pattern off. The company has alot of incentives and bounuses however they use those to cover up the extremely long and tiring hours. Management will call you into training for the smallest things. Overall company culture is nosy and invading, office is always pretty loud and messy."
"Red Ventures",",Is an excellent place to work but very stressful, you must follow very carefully the sales process and not say anything that is not within the requirements of the agency because you can fall into disciplinary plans and even lose the job"
"Red Ventures",",They care about quantity more than quality.  Some management is not very coordinated since its a fairly new company. Good cafeteria but short lunch breaks."
"Red Ventures",",As a sales agent you will get drained being on the phone constantly and stressing over how successful you are. Compensation is based on a number of factors not just sales like most think, and some of the factors are ""uncontrollable"" which can be frustration. When you first start the schedule will probably be around 3pm-12am. Managers just see you as a number and not a person. When you are not actually working everything else is great(facility, pay, benefits)."
"Red Ventures",",Roles are very diverse at Red Ventures, which include Sales, Management, Marketing, IT, Web Development, Security and even Culinary positions. As a Sales Representative your day consists of logging into a web based system that tracks everything you do (I mean everything. i.e. unproductive times, open availability, bathroom breaks, lunch breaks, etc.) while you receive an abundance of inbound call volume. You are paid a reasonable base salary plus commissions based on your total sales per month and overall conversions for the calls that you received that month."
"Red Ventures",",this job is hard but highly rewarding !! taught me everything about sales . perfect training. and lots of money to be made"
"Red Ventures",",Red Ventures was an exciting place to work. Great call flow and a good product made the sale easily obtainable. Management was ok, and co-workers were also."
"Red Ventures",",,                                                                                 Very fun, Very Stressful, Very good pay...did I mention Very Stressful!!"
"Red Ventures",",It is a great place to work, it can be a tad stressful at times but the compensation is definitely worth it.  The hardest part of the job is getting burnt out having to talk on the phone all day long"
"Red Ventures",",Typical day at work is taking about 20 inbound calls. signing up customers for internet services and convincing  them to bundle with tv and phone service as well."
"Red Ventures",",Fun environment to work in to mask the stress of a sales position. A place for only the resilient and hard working type. Awesome co-workers with very low drama. Great set of personalities and up beat attitudes. Hardest part of the job is the stress if you aren't performing well or there are too many known ops issues affecting your commission plan negatively."
"Red Ventures",",This is pretty much a call center. You will be very micromanaged but the managers do help you get better at selling with 2-3 weekly coaching sessions. You get 30 minutes of break time each day which you have to request- including requests to go to the bathroom, etc. This is very high pressure sales. If you say the slightest thing wrong on the phone you could potentially lose your commission for the month or lose your job all together. The commission plans change every month. The turnover is crazy."
"Red Ventures",",It's very busy all the time every thing is always moving 100 mph.  My co-workers were some of the best people I could work with.  I have learned so much at that company with time management and with my skill set they have really pushed me so far.  My management has changed many times over the years some for the good some for the bad.  The most enjoyable part of the job was was the people I worked with and the experience that I gained. Overall it was one of the best company's I have had a chance to work for."
"Red Ventures",",Get on the phones and start your day. No two days are the same. Co-workers were awesome as it was a great work environment. TVs, ping-pong tables, bowling alley, outstanding food and selection, flexible schedule. Hardest part of the job was constantly change compensation structures. But the job culture was overall awesome."
"Red Ventures",",Overall, A great place to work and begin a career. You will learn alot. Have the opportunity to work with great people and make good money. The saying ""Work Hard, Play Hard"", reigns true at RV."
"Red Ventures",",A typical day at Red Ventures is answering about 25-30 incoming calls. I've learned a great sales process through the companies intense training program. The management has always been great to work for and very helpful in making sure each employee succeeds. All the employees have been great to work with and being apart of a team was a great experience. The hardest part of the job is closing sales for certain customers that are shopping and not wanting to buy. The employees are not allowed to call the customers back so each call is very important and closing the sales is the main goal before the customer hangs up. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and the people working for the company."
"Red Ventures",",No complaints.  The business focuses on the younger work demographic. The culture is slowly changing, However The business would be better off with more seasoned leadership."
"Trulia","I like work/life balance which results into higher productivity in long run and resulting into greater retention of an employee."
"Trulia",",I enjoy technical challenges."
"Trulia",",Great company to work for. Great hours, free food daily, game room. I learned a lot of salesforce, ticketing, working on the back end of a website. Management pick and chose favorites, which made for a lot of extra drama."
"Trulia",",Trulia was a great company to begin with, but it has lost way after zillow acquisition. "
"Trulia",",Trulia is more highlighted a discovering or personalization experience rather than for actual search or accurate buying experience. Some of the best engineers have left and the management does not give a dime to care about the attrition rate. Upper management follow favoritism to promote the teams they think are relevant. "
"Trulia",",Overall, not a very engineering driver but management or business driven culture left now. Hope it improves if and when upper management exits."
"Trulia",",They are not as fun as they think they are. Bad middle management, Frat house culture. Laid people off after promising not to."
"Trulia",",The culture and work environment are great! Leadership is a pleasure to work for. The company is headed in the right direction with new ownership."
"Trulia",",Trulia was a great company to work for. They have great benefits, spiffs, food and snacks, great culture, trulia bucks are awesome."
"Trulia",",Great product for consumer but not for client. Revolving door. Work with angry real estate agents that were sold a product to just get them in the door. Most were not set up with correct expectations. I enjoyed working with accounts to turn them around to purchase more. I felt more like a sounding board then an account sales rep. Not for me."
"Trulia",",Great Management to work for. Took real good care of their employees. Fun company learned a lot about the product and industry. Foosball / ping pong table / hot shot hoop. Free food/snacks available daily with coffee machine. Great afterwork activities."
"Trulia",",Trulia is good, but alot of politics in management. they do rela estate online advertising.It is all kinds of col calling and etc. They also had a CS area for cusomter service focus."
"Trulia",",Started the day with an overview of the past day and what need to be done that day and week. Work hard , play hard. The company got bought out by Zillow and they laid off 350 people including me or I would still be working there."
"Trulia",",Not only did I work side by side with great people, but the clients that I communicated with on a daily basis were always different, therefore, no two days were alike. Free food and beverage was a plus for sure. Not only was there a ping pong table but Also foosball and pop a shot basketball."
"Trulia",",Trulia.com was a great place to work with a fully stocked kitchen and state of the art facility. My coworkers were very cordial and easy to work with. I worked from 730 - 4pm, cold calling real estate agents, selling ad space on the nationwide search engine."
"Trulia",",Trulia provides the best benefits that I think that I will ever have. Most of the people who work there are friendly, and they offer a huge selection of food that means you can skip the drive through for breakfast and save money by staying in for lunch.  "
"Trulia",",The tough part is that the management team acts more like a ""big brother"" than a leader. Promotions are also based on popularity instead actual skill sets. "
"Trulia",",If you are looking for a good starter job Trulia is the place to be, but if you are looking for a career then you should look in a different direction."
"Trulia",",Trulia has a very positive and forward looking corporate culture.  The company is product focused, customer focused and employee focused.  All of the employees are smart, hardworking, and able to laugh at themselves."
"Trulia",",Great company great culture. Easy job for the most part, just sucks that company was bought by Zillow. Company lost all of its IMPACT values which the company quote on quote lived by everyday..."
"Trulia",",Great company, great people, and even more so a great culture! There are a lot of changes going on that will be extremely beneficial for the company and the consumers. "
"Trulia",",When accepting a position with this organization, take the benefits into consideration, they are amazing! "
"Trulia",",If you are a top performer, you can be compensated extremely well."
"Trulia",",Great place to work until Zillow acquired and did a work force reduction of 350 people. Most likely more rounds of layoffs coming."
"Trulia",",A wonderful company to work for, despite sometimes being overly competitive and tough. There are free snacks and breakfast foods, every type of beverage you could want, ping pong tables in the lunch room, wonderful health and other benefits, and competitive pay."
"Trulia",",Trulia has an amazing culture, work-life balance and countless opportunities to grow and advance financially and professionally."
"Trulia",",- I learned to use Salesforce and create excel spreed sheets."
"Trulia",",-Time management"
"Trulia",",- enjoyed the stocked kitchen"
"Trulia",",- loved my co workers and work enviornment"
"Trulia",",This place had amazing workplace culture.  It was probably my favorite position in regards to atmosphere and people that work there.  The job itself was a sales job so I would of like more job security but otherwise it was a great company to work for."
"UCB","Was Fortunate to grow from Collector to Supervisor, hire 80% of own staff, and developed them. Once had a new Manager my development increased, was always able to improve training program"
"UCB",",because that was one of my strong points."
"UCB",",Typical Day was balanced between my Collectors, Clients, and fellow Supervisors along with other Corportate needs, however the priorties were the collectors and the clients."
"UCB",",If you're looking for a place where your efforts are appreciated and your results are rewarded - skip this place. It it is simply not a place to build a career. It is a good place to work when you're in between jobs or if you're not the primary income of the household. Don't expect to be appreciated much, and make sure you only take this job if you have the flexibility to quit at the drop of a dime."
"UCB",",great atmosphere, wonderful coworkers, wonderful management, great incentives, lunches were good. great feedback daily"
"UCB",",Doesnt keep their word about raises after 90 days, only the collectors that have been there 10 years or better are really the ones that gets incoming calls. And makes real money for a bonus check. I hate the fact the pay schedule is set days of each month."
"UCB",",Co-workers are helpful"
"UCB",",Challenging position"
"UCB",",Can be stressful"
"UCB",",Pay is based on bonuses "
"UCB",",Monday through Friday"
"UCB",",Not a lot of training provided"
"UCB",",Learn mostly on your own"
"UCB",",not a bad company if looking for a job.  If looking for a career, look elsewhere.  District managers are good senior management needs a self check."
"UCB",",Always busy, making phone calls or receiving phone calls. Convincing people to pay off their debt and even play with numbers a bit. Supervisors are always there to help and prepare you for different scenarios that you may come across of. Hardest part is finding the consumer and actually getting them to stay on the phone with you and not hang up."
"UCB",",What i enjoy most is the people at this company.  Everyone is very friendly and a great group to work with."
"UCB",",Each day in the office im able to learn new things and build new relationships"
"UCB",",I enjoyed very much working for UCB for the last one year."
"UCB",",I feel valued and got tons of support from management and my peers. I can truly say that I enjoy everyone who works here and that it is an environment in which I want to come to work every day and I'm proud to say I work here."""
"UCB",",The fact the we all work towards the same goals truly fulfill me"
"UCB",",This job was moved to a different state. I had mainly negative experiences working here, which helped me get motivated to change career paths."
"UCB",",Too many people in management positions that don't know what they are doing.  Some haven't ever managed people before and their teams are used as experiments for them to become one with no formal training and transition.  Management should really truly value their team by their action and not giving lip service that doesn't add up.  You stay too long the place will drain you of all of your true intelligence because it seems like if you are clueless you are better off there than being an intelligent person.  If you value your job and work hard you are stuck in your position, but if you don't do anything and just look busy you will be great and set up for success!!"
"UCB",",Management is poor and the work ethics are low. Not a job I would recommend unless you need to something to get you on your feet."
"UCB",",UCB is very demanding.  They are about collecting debt for their clients and making their goals for the month.  Management isn't the greatest, but they will get the job done.  Co-workers are nice but it's a job not a place to make friends.  The hardest part of the job is making the monthly goal when consumers don't want to pay their debt.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when you collect a lot and know that your in bonus."
"UCB",",making sure the sales have the right product and material to see the doctor sells the medicine the company offer them."
"UCB",",its ok company to work for."
"UCB",",hours are just enough."
"UCB",",the hardest part of the job is getting clients on the phone"
"UCB",",Billing to various insurance carriers. too many people in one room with half cubicles hard to concentrate because of noise volume."
"UCB",",easy place to work - caring management and excellent healthcare."
"UCB",",The culture at UCB is very positive with several avenues to advance your career. The training was extensive and very thorough. The management team was well trained and came along side the reps with a coaching and uplifting attitude. The co-workers all worked together as team players and we were able to have a lot of fun and get work done as well. The hardest part of the job was more industry wide not related to the company. It was seeing the physicians and getting in the offices with new policies of no lunches and only so many reps on certain days, etc."
"UCB",",UCB is pharma company that has drugs for the central nervous system, GI and rheumatoid arthritis."
"UCB",",Offer a pretty good retirement plan and other benefits."
"UCB",",The people are fun."
"UCB",",UCB offers education reimbursement."
"UCB",",Making Outbound calls to customers into how to correct there debt situation."
"UCB",",Advising customers on how they can settle their debt without making their finances being affected."
"UCB",",Ucb has opportunities to grow, but at slower pace being that there are so many vets in position. The company give those that are just getting out of school a chance for employment. Ucb offers insurance and incentives for all employees."
"Express","Have to work fast and get use to it. Pretty easy job to get use too. Fun meeting new customers and making sales.A typical day at work wold be making sales, cash register duties, cleaning up. Isn't really much things hard in this job, but if I had to choose one, I would choose working until closing and folding everything."
"Express",",Express was a fast paced and amazing job. I miss working here because the employees were amazingly sweet and the job was awesome. I highly recommend anyone who wants to work here to apply."
"Express",",it is a family own mexican resturant with delicious food and help me learn a lot about costumer service and relations. I would highly recommend this place to anyone"
"Express",",I had a couple of jobs driving a forklift that llasted a half a year at a time and paid good but the job assignment ended. Warehouse  work with them was forklift and assembly  work."
"Express",",Opened mail and sorted through it. It had to go into separate piles. Made sure payments were accurate and if not brought attention to them."
"Express",",Work days were fun and busy at the same time. I learned how some managers only promote their favorite workers regardless of performance. The workplace is always full of amazing and different styles and expressions of people, and their personalities. The hardest part of the job would be the low amount of hours you worked per week if you was not full-time, and the most enjoyable part of the job would be working with the team, and meeting new people making great bonds."
"Express",",I felt that the assignment that was given to me was a dead end job, where I would never be hired on. I found out that no one had been hired in my position in 3 years. If you want to be a temp for years with no paid vacation and no benefits help yourself."
"Express",",omg nothing bad to say about working for express had to leave for family emergency but would go back in a heart beat "

"Express",",fast pasted. computer skills.good management. work environment clean.learning new skills.learning new skills. helping company improve work environment and safety."
"Express",",Very long days. You have to be into retail to work at express. Hardest part is the people and the messes they leave for you to clean up."
"Express",",So far my experience has been great with Express. The people are great at the office and always help with what ever you need. but some times the manager at the schools I get sent to aren't great and i don't want to be a lunch lady forever though."
"Express",",We layer water pipe and sewer pipe. I was the ditch man so I had to lay the pipe in the ditch and stick them together.  We also layer man holes for the sewer."
"Express",",Was a great job, just not many opportunities or benefits. Don't really have more to say about it. I would wake up at 7, call and ask them what job place I needed to go to and what time and I went."
"Express",",This store is closed now so it does not matter what I say about it. I enjoyed working here when it was open, but I left because I wasn't getting enough hours."
"Express",",If you're looking for a quick job the is the place to be, but you can't expect top of the line work, it's menial grunt work, but if you despise the place you are placed at you have any chance you want to change jobs."
"Express",",This was my first job and was a great place to learn the first few things about retail. However, I was not given the opportunity to work very often, as I was only a seasonal employee, which made it rather difficult to gain any valuable experience."
"Express",",I would start off my day by filling the empty slots on the sales floor with merchandise. Some days I would have to rearrange the sales floor because as every retail specialist knows, rearranging draws a customers eye to product more often. Ending the day I would clean the sales floor, back room, organize, and clock out."
"Express",",Was a great retail-clothing experience. Got along with all the co-workers and management. Sad the store closed down. Most enjoyable part was helping others with finding the right outfit whether it be a man or woman."
"Express",",A Typically good day at work would be when you and your coworkers have an understanding of the jobs and tasks that need to be done that day. Making is tasks fun and enjoyable for everyone and learning new things everyday"

"Dillard's, Inc.","The pay was decent and the work was hard but I learned fast enough to keep up with the fast paced environment. A typical day consisted of lifting materials and food, cleaning, speaking to new people at every function and practicing respectable workmanship. The co-workers left me to do most work because I was the youngest but I speak up for myself while getting my job done so that did not remain an issue for long. The most enjoyable thing would be smelling the food and serving smiling faces."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",The co workers were sometimes nice when they weren't competing for sales. I hated that if you werent making goal they would definetly fire you without hesitation."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",I loved working at Dillards and although the hours were long it was a great work experience that I was able to be creative and I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with very much. Dillards is a SPH driven company and you must work very hard and to keep a great atmosphere and enjoy it be a great sales person and offer great customer service. In return your work efforts will be rewarded. Dillards honors its employees and customers often."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",I do not really have any negative to say about this company except hard work is not being noticed for those who work very well and put a lot of effort to be recognize"
"Dillard's, Inc.",",As I worked diligently to grow the business, I learned how to build customer retention through follow up phone calls and sending notes of appreciation for continuing to purchase products."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",In this store i learned what I need to do with my life. I learned  about customer service, how to assist the customers, how to sell products, how ro present a product foe sell."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",Typical day at work is high performance environment yet fun and motivational and best customer service !"
"Dillard's, Inc.",",How to engage with customers and 5 star sales."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",Management rather not say"
"Dillard's, Inc.",",Work Place culture is constant stress"
"Dillard's, Inc.",",Having to deal with traffic makes it uneasy for our clients to visit with us."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",Most enjoyable when I have made a customer happy !"
"Dillard's, Inc.",",putting out shipment, opening and closing register, straightening, cleaning, doing displays, assisting customers w/ clothing choices. learned about retail. management at the time they were not involved a lot of shady things going on w/ merchandise. this job was not very hard pretty chill."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",It was an okay job. Upper management was very rude. If you asked for a day off they wouldn't let you have the day off or if requested more hours. Overall experience was okay."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",If you don't reach impossible sales goals then they threaten you with pay decreases or the fire you.  They don't appreciate the great customer service or upkeep of store and merchandise, only sales. Managers and assistant managers talk badly about employees to employees. There is no recourse for employees.  Complaining only makes you a bigger target.  Gen manager doesn't care about the work environment or that dept managers yell at employees. Don't take this job if you're looking for longevity or respect.  Working under fear of being fired is not worth it."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",Some locations are fun and enjoyable.It depends upon the leadership in each store. Different districts are enjoyable to work in with advancement and recognition. The Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma region is challenging with little to no job secuirty in recent months under new VP. "
"Dillard's, Inc.",",The overall company is wonderful with family feel and The Dillards are a consistent part of their business."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",Gained sales learning experience and also a lot about customer relationships and merchandise at Dillard's. The money you could earn here was unbeatable!"
"Dillard's, Inc.",",Working at Dillard's has given me a lot of experience working in customer service. I have been able to be myself with customers and co-workers. The hardest thing working in retail is being on my feet all day, organizing and marking down items, because then I come home and have to clean up after a toddler. Management isn't the strongest here at Dillard's but other than that I really have enjoyed working here."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",You must be confident in yourself to succeed. I have learned that you can not allow the issues of life to interrupt your time at work. The customer is the most important person in any situation."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",Everyone on staff at Dillards is very friendly and outgoing. Also, gained a lot of work experience in my time there.The hardest part of the job was conflict resolution with some of the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and getting to help customers solve issues that they were having."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",All they talked about was numbers in the morning. It is not inspiring and everyone seemed depressed and stressed to me. The breakroom was gloomy and full of daily quota complaints."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",Dillards was a mistake on my part. I tried to get into retail and got stuck trying to sell womens' shoes. Why would you put a testosterone filled military veteran in a environment to sell womens shoes? really? I should've stayed in the warehouse instead. I was successful with the company there."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",The management was the worse. The department I worked in only had me in it most of the time. I was cussed out the third day of being employed. The only enjoyable part of the day was the customers."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",I like it here, but it's not a forever place and quotas are high and you are punished if you don't meet them... "
"Dillard's, Inc.",",I don't really feel appreciated even though I work my butt off, and if I have a problem with another employee they don't do anything, they just tell me to push through and make my sales."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",Team members are expected to stand all day with only a one hour break for lunch.  Management never offers praise - always negative feedback.  Goals are excessive and if they are not met, Dllards will cut your pay.  There is absolutely no team work.  Associates compete for sales and no one can be trusted."
"Dillard's, Inc.",",Dillard's was my first job. It taught  me a lot about resoect, and discipline of getting up and going to work everyday nd doing the best job I possibly  could."

"Norfolk Southern Corp",",Worked almost all my life for the Railroad.It was a good job to meet my family life.some days was a different job to be completed.The work was hard and in demand to do a good job for the company"
"Norfolk Southern Corp",",It's a good job to have. Employees are great to work with but if you do not enjoy working in the elements then this job is not for you. A typical day can be lengthy depending on amount of trains called."
"Norfolk Southern Corp",",If you have a family this is a very difficult job as it requires alot of time outside working hours. You are staying late almost daily, always on your phone (emails calls), work all hours and days. Dont get holidays off nor compensated for it. You relocate several times your first year."
"Norfolk Southern Corp",",Norfolk Southern is an excellent place to work. They pay great money for people without a college degree, and even more for the managers who do have a degree. Be prepared to be gone from home a lot if you are a trainman. Be prepared to move if you're a manager."
"Norfolk Southern Corp",",The railroad is a great company to work for, great benefits, great pay, great co workers, and management. The only down side to the railroad is the schedule, there isn't one. I am on call 24/7 365 days a year."

"Norfolk Southern Corp",",Worry about being laid off, Management difficult at times, great benefits and pay, great insurance, great retirement like no other, room to move up into management/supervision"
"Norfolk Southern Corp",",You can work here for 15 years, and if you make a mistake (or if they consider) you had a rule violation.  They will just pull you out of service with no pay.  They may even to dismiss you no matter how much time you have with company.  You can NEVER EVER let your guard down.  So basically, its a good job considering pay, benefits, etc...management is so out of tune with you personally, they dont care if they put you on the street.  Always live below your means just incase one day at work they decide to pull the plug on you and throw you out.  Union is ok, but they are limited to the companies Court when your in a investigation.  The best way I can put it, the Company is Judge, prosecutor and the jury, you only the defense.  It is the most unfair Investigation you can be in....if they dont want you to win, they wont let you, even if you have all the proof in the world."

"Norfolk Southern Corp",",when you start you are on call for 24 hours.  will get at call 2 hours prior to going to work.  I enjoy the job that I do and the people that I work with.  Hardest part of the job is may having to do 16 hours without notice."
"Norfolk Southern Corp",",Very little job security depending on location of job. Union useless, taking large dues with np representation when issues arise. Allow for current employees to be mandated overtime when employees in same craft laid-off. Hard work and very little incentive."
"Norfolk Southern Corp",",I enjoyed the internship.  I met a lot of great connections and was given the option to continue working at the company full time after college.  I travelled all over which was the best part."
"Norfolk Southern Corp",",Employee morale has been low for years. You are nothing more than a number and there is no such thing as job security. Company is so concerned with hiring college grads for management, they forget to hire anyone with even an ounce of common sense."
"Macmillan Learning","The benefits are great, great culture, fun coworkers and teams. However the most common complaint about working at Macmillan is the salary isn't very competitive."
"Macmillan Learning",",It was a lifetime memory in learning and getting used to the work environment which is totally different as that of India's. Learning most recent technologies. Development as a full stack developer has added good fortune to my career."

"Demandbase",",They fired people way to easily. At the time I worked there this company was way too competitive and profit focused. That describes a lot of startups in SF of course. I quit here after seeing others let go, and shortly after they fired and outsourced the whole dev team."

"State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company",",State Farm has an array of financial products to offer to its consumers.  This helps to consistently learn new products and take on new challenges.   Working in a highly populated Hispanic community made my skill of being bilingual a great fit.  The progress of meeting new clients and building strong relationships makes it fun and enjoyable.  The office culture was also very important and well structured.  Although, with a small office the opportunity to grow was short and challenging due to seniority    I continuesly challenged myself every year by meeting all office goals and surpassing them as much as doubling or tripling the quota given.  I made it a goal to be number one on sales team every year I worked at State Farm"

"Dealer Tire","company was to strict with time budgeted. did not take into account accidents, traffic, slow responses from customers. would start early at times and demanded overtime whenever they needed it. not the place for anyone who has a family and is not in a mangagement slot."
"Dealer Tire",",During my time at Dealer Tire I've became a more efficient employee.  My typical work day was all around easy simple and enjoyable."
"Dealer Tire",",Terrible company.  Everything bad you read about these guys is true. Avoid."
"Dealer Tire",",Awful corporate culture. Rewards nepotism, discourages sharing of productive idead, barely competitive pay, 24/7 emails, useless conference calls, incompetent and closed-minded management. No upward mobility - often ""higher"" positions are given the same or less pay."
"Dealer Tire",",Typical day at work; you pick orders when they come in, you load out each others vehicles, and you deliver the product to the dealerships on the manifest. If you work in the warehouse you do a lot more ie unload truck(s) in the morning, put tires away, pick orders coming in, help load out local delivery trucks, move smaller quantities of tires to other locations to make room for the next day truck load. Co-workers are very friendly, and everyone acts as a team player to get things done. The hardest part of the job is when it gets busy and it becomes overwhelming with orders."
"Dealer Tire",",Although the company is still family run, the ideas are the same. This is a company that says they hold an ""open door policy"" but frowns upon employees when they voice an opinion that doesn't fit the Midwest mindset. The majority of the company works outside of the corporate office, however, benefits are only really available to the corporate employees. If you are looking for a job in Cleveland, this would be ideal, however, the support in the field is vastly lacking. The people who come in as outsiders (not a referral) feel the stress of being an outsider. The pay is under scale for median income in bigger cities."
"Dealer Tire",",It was a good place to work. Co workers were like family. The hours weren't to great, I like to travel so driving far wasn't an issue"
"Dealer Tire",",Dealer Tire has competent, hard working and yet fun, energetic people working for them.  It has been an honor to work in their IT department and lead IT projects here.  Everyone works very hard but doesn't take themselves too seriously.  There is a good camaraderie amongst management and the workforce as well."
"Dealer Tire",",Ignore the false, phony, tricky buy you in of good comp and benefits. IT'S NOT WORTH IT. Not by a LONG SHOT. Working for this company is beyond human torture. It is degrading, exasperating, infuriating, depressing, and an utter misery. If you just started; GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN. If you're still there, you know what I am talking about. If you are thinking of working here--D O N ' T !"
"Dealer Tire",",This company is ruled by the the worst penny-ante tinhorn dictators at the mid management level who are unfit to run a lemonade stand on a hot August day."
"Dealer Tire",",This company and your whole job is permeated by 100% LIES. LIES to customers. LIES to each other. LIES to your own data. LIES to the public. LIES, LIES, LIES. You will be lied about. You will be lied to. You will hear lies about others. Senior management will ladle out the most hideous, distorted lies and utter fabrications to convince their customers---the major car companies---that they are working well for them."
"Dealer Tire",",They are not."
"Dealer Tire",",You will be tested, constantly judged, back-stabbed by everyone, and thrown under the first bus that passes by. You are totally and completely expendable. When you are hired, you are like one cigarette in the hands of a major chain-smoker: One being smoked, one on deck, on simmering in the ashtray. You will be hired, and so too will your replacement and their replacement so when you get tossed it's a mere replacement of socks or paperclips. Socks and paperclips are treated better than employees here. STAY AWAY LIKE IT'S THE PLAGUE. Because it is."
"Dealer Tire",",WORSE JOB EVER!!!!!!!! All the manager did was yell and complain. Worked 13 to 14 hours a day, it was impossible to get the deliverys done on time!"
"Dealer Tire",",The core values have got lost along the way. Every manager wants to hit their KPIs so they're ok with you checking the box and pretending to have hit your KPIs   Goals are so off the mark considering the industry hasn't grown but you're expected to pull sales from your dealers any way you can  "
"Dealer Tire",",It's horrible watching people promote up when they should be walked out the door."
"Dealer Tire",",This is a great company with great morals. I am proud to work for this company but all roads leads to Cleveland. If you are from that area in the country, this would be a great job for you."
"Dealer Tire",",Depending on what position and department you work in, you can have a carefree day, or a non-stop busy stress filled day (like myself). I worked at corporate and ultimately the ever increasing work load and last minute asap items thrown at me forced me to make a decision that I can no longer sacrifice myself for Dealer Tire. If you can handle these things well, you might succeed. I just know in the end my health and well-being are much more important than a paycheck."
"Dealer Tire",",Fast growing Company, daily changes and opportunity. A great company to work with, Your voice matters and its a great to be if you want to effect change."
"Dealer Tire",",Clock in. Pull Orders. Help everyone. Load your truck. Deliver. Come back. Pull more orders. Help everyone. The staff is ok. The job is easy. The biggest raise you get is 10 cents a year and you starts at $12."
"Dealer Tire",",Great place to work and great people....everyone is willing to help...culture is team work and training is great"
"Dealer Tire",",management really cares and wants you to successed"
"Dealer Tire",",arrived at work at 8:30 a.m performed pre-trip of vehicle, helped with picking batches of orders, then held group safety meetings with warehouse manage, then loaded delivery trucks with orders to be delivered to dealerships. The co-workers were great people to work with, we all got along well, and we helped one another whenever possible. The hardest part of the job was trying to make the deliveries on time, because sometimes there would be construction or traffic jams, or accidents. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting a bonus at the end of each month, because our hard work, commitment, and safety was recognized by the company."
"Dealer Tire",",Enjoyed this place, and very helpful employees."
"Dealer Tire",",MUST work here"
"Dealer Tire",",co workers are willing to help.  liked the training and the way you are treated as an employee instead of a number"
"Dealer Tire",",decent job for decent pay, but the management has no idea how to run a warehouse! no respect for personal lives of employees nor their commitments outside of work. favoritism runs wild!!"
"Dealer Tire",",We really have a great group of talented associates working at Dealer Tire. They are all willing to help one another with anything needed."
"Dealer Tire",",very fast pace and physically demanding.  Must stay until work is complete.  good benefits are available 401k with match and vacation"
"Dealer Tire",",You'll see positive reviews from the corporate clan in Cleveland. But beware if you're going to be working as an outside account manager. "
"Dealer Tire",",I lived in Texas and covered most of southern Texas and Louisiana. I had over 40 dealers I handled from New Orleans to San Antonio. They expect you to spend 60% face-time in your dealers, submit a daily detailed report, and travel from account to account. Hardly anytime to do all of this in just a day. Expect to spend 10-12 hours a day completing everything required of you. Almost no work-life balance with these guys and they will tell you this isn't a 40 hour work week position. "
"Dealer Tire",",The worst part? Imagine hitting all of your sales goals over 100%, developing relationships at all your dealers, working with all your OEM reps, and traveling an average of 2000 miles a month to cover a territory. You'd think this would make them happy? No! They will pull reports and point out ridiculous ""KPI's (key performance indicators)"" they want to measure you on. How many GM's did you visit? How many business plans did you present this quarter? Did you do a target activity review of every account? These are a few of the ridiculous, time consuming and in many cases, unnecessary reports you must do. You'd think hitting your goals and delivering results would be good enough. After all, they deposit money in the bank, not how many GM contacts you had, right?"
"Dealer Tire",",And don't expect to just check a box on your daily report. You have to copy everyone on your email at the end of the day. You have to go into detail of what you talked about, what products you discussed,"
"Dealer Tire",",  "
"Dealer Tire",", what programs you went over, who you visited with, what was the results, how is it going to impact the dealer, what are the next steps, who will be accountable for implementation...blah, blah, blah. You then have to copy about 10 people on the detailed daily report. It will go to your direct manager, his manager, your inside sales partner, the parts and service managers at the dealership, the fixed operations manager, the GM at the dealership, the OEM rep that covers that dealership and sometimes even people you've never met or worked with like regional people at whatever company they are trying to impress. If not, they will fire you over this ""KPI"" you didn't do. I'm proof of that."
"Dealer Tire",",The starting pay is 60K a year....I got no raises in the 3 years I was there. If you decide to work here, be sure you get the money you want up front. You do get monthly commissions but where they pull the numbers you're supposed to hit is sometimes a joke. You'd think increasing your sales by 20% year over year would be outstanding right? Especially in an industry that grow by 5-6 percent at the most year after year. Nope!  They only tell you by quarter what your sales goal is. If you have an outstanding sales quarter at hit 105% you'll make commissions of about 6K for that quarter. Not bad right? Well, expect them to adjust the next quarter to keep your commissions at $0 to even it out a bit. It happens all the time to everybody. "
"Dealer Tire",",You never know what your yearly number is to hit. At the beginning of every year they bring in everyone for a dog and pony show and explain where we are going with our new ""XYZ"" sales approach. They will have a number that is usually 15%-20 growth. You'd think with this they'd have it broke down to every car line, division, territory and account manager so everyone knew what their individual goal was, right? Nope!"
"Dealer Tire",",As I said before it's rolled out quarterly and fluctuates however necessary so nobody gets too big an advantage. A lot of politics too. It's about who you know and can win over than your sales results. I hit 100% for over 3 years combined but I wasn't a valued asset because I didn't check boxes next to a GM's name on my daily call sheet. It's their way of getting rid of people who they feel get the job done but don't conform to their micro-managed style of managing. Imagine getting rid of someone who did their job, delivered results, had dealers praise their consultative approach, yet was let go because out of 45 dealers, I didn't have a GM contact at 16 of them? By the way, all 16 of those locations had very happy parts, service and sometime fixed ops managers that were very happy with my work there and a GM relationship was not needed nor required to get the goal done. That's a fact!!!"

"The Climate Corporation","I love the level of talent at this company and the fact that we are solution-focused, rather than problem-dwelling... as I have too often seen in the corporate world."
"The Climate Corporation",",The Climate Corporation was a great place to work for people who love to be on the forefront. All of my co-workers in the field were wonderful to work with and get along with. It was exciting to work for a company that was innovative and changing the way modern agriculture is interpreted by the farmer."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care","A typical day would be taking up to 75-100 calls a day, I learned their system. The hardest part of the job was that they frowned upon such things as funerals that would be counted against you at time of review. They provide training. A full lunch center with chefs is provided but expensive. The company also provides refrigerators on each floor. They also provide free parking in Quincy."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",Harvard Pilgrim is an inclusive, supportive, comfortable environment to work in. Working in Member Services can be draining because the work can be difficult at times, but the team leaders are extremely supportive and want to see you succeed."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",Wonderful people and friendly environment. Typical day is taking 60+ calls a day meetings every Wednesday to learn something new that all the time to help you with your calls."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",Management is keen to ensure a proper work-life balance. Managers are very much involved in day-to-day activities."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",Learned a lot about the health insurance business."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",Fast-paced environment with lots of interpersonal relations.  Traveled to hospital business departments to discuss issues with claim submissions.  Work with other departments to resolve issues identified by providers."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",Harvard Pilgrim is overall a good company to work for. The pay is decent, and the benefits are great. Working in the company call center, however, became a very physically and emotionally draining experience.  There was an extensive 6 week training which was intense, but very informative - the instructors were terrific and truly wanted to help everyone succeed."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",Once on the floor, the reality of the job became quite apparent.  First of all, you are leashed to your desk by your headset. Every minute of your day is highly monitored. As a newbie this was expected and not so bad, but, as time passed it became more and more difficult to sit all day chained to your station- a ten minute break in the AM, an hour lunch, and a ten minute break in the afternoon."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",There were many days, when I felt like the customers' private punching bag. As a Customer Service Associate, we are on the front lines, trying to assist the members with their plans, and all their issues, complaints, and dissatisfaction with the company, and their insurance coverage. When a customer requested to speak with a supervisor, rarely, would one be available to take the call.  The Call Center Reps were always having to apologize for computer ""glitches"" that caused claim processing errors, as well as many other issues."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",One major perk is the ability to work from home. Such a time saver in many ways."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",The position was not what I thought it would be. "
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",Need to have a good background on health insurance and be able to explain it to members. No face to face interactions with members. Hold high standards of their employees."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",Assisted a team of pharmacists and technicians in a fast paced managed care outpatient setting.  Environment was very organized and collaborative."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",I've only worked here a few weeks..... But everyday I see a whole bunch of smiling faces. Everyone is so happy at work, I've never worked somewhere where of course you'd rather be in bed, but completely do not mind being at work. Also with the telecommunicating capabilities, if you weren't an office person you didn't have to be bothered! The food in the cafe is good, and decently priced. Even the cafeteria workers are happy and content with their job. The starting pay is EXCELLENT, and everyone I've spoken to have been promoted at least twice inside of 1 year! I hope I can make HPHC my home for a long time to come."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",Great benefits make it difficult to leave this company! Affordable health insurance and generous time off, most departments have great work/home ethics. Management is aggressively watching the bottom line financially-understandable. Again, depending on where you work will drive compensation-my area is not getting much in the way of annual merit increases and my income has not changed much in 5 years...but the benefits and coworkers are great!"
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",The staff is very polite and considerate of one another. Although there are times when issues need to be discussed, we always concluded positively and were able to enjoy the time spent together."

"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",the hardest part was the long hours and calls at night"
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",I would have to say that on a typical work day their was a lot of calls!! But their is room for advancement. By the 4 month month I was already boosted up to more pay and another opportunity. The hardest part of the job was MONDAYS since everyone would call for their benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job was having gained friends through the coworkers. Best environment to work for. I WOULD RECOMMEND WORKING HERE!!!"
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",good work/life balance, corporate culture is laid-back, not too cut-throat"
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",Great company to work for. Job environment was the best it could be for the job. It's difficult working in a call center environment."
"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care",",A nice place to work with nice people.. It was not a career.  It was great experience. Hardest part of job was dealing with disgruntled customers.  Greatest part of the job was dealing with regular customers who you grew to love"

I have learned  its all about the right attitude -- work doesnt have to be difficult , its all how you approach each day."
"Dell",",Dell is wonderful company to work with. The management is very helpful and easy going. I learned how the IT environment in a hospital setting flows. The most difficult part of the job was the traveling in the bad weather conditions (snow and icy roads). The most enjoyable part of this job was servicing the many doctors, nurses, and other end users we supported. I would absolutely recommend this company as a great employer."
"Dell",",Love working hands on. Learn alot. Also got my Certifications. Love meeting new customer. Also teach Customers about Dell. Very Kind Company to work with."
"Dell",",I have been employed by DELL at multiple junctions of my career, I have enjoyed the experience every single time. The people the Culture about as good as it gets."
"Dell",",I'm a contractor and contractors are, by nature, 2nd-class citizens in any corporation. But the people I work with are good folks and I have  positive working relationships with everyone that I contact here. Circumstances aren't right at this time, but if Dell offered to convert me to a direct-hire employee, I would accept."
"Dell",",If you like a call center, then this is for you. I really didn't like it and it can get stressful at times. I would just be careful if I was you because sometimes they hate it when you take too long on a call."
"Dell",",I work as part time 3rd shift we did not have much to learn it we do what the menagerie say to do .i operated my forklift I do my tasks and go home .most time we go home after 4 hours work"

"Dell",",Contract was related to opening new factory.  Spent 2 months in North Carolina.  The time in the factory itself was enjoyable.  Spent 2 weeks at a time at factory."
"Dell",",Good benefits and decent pay, and culture was pretty good to start.  Management was good, but too much micromanaging and the culture became too toxic for me or several others to continue.  Industry was interesting, products were good, and majority of coworkers were good.  Cold calling for tech sales is a tough job, and not for the faint of heart."
"Dell",",Dell was a wonderful place to work. I had a few bad managers, but at the end of the day I would still be working there had I had a choice."

"Dell",",Dell is a good place for a person who has no family and little responsibilities.  A constantly rotating shift isn't exactly friendly to a new budding family."
"Dell",",Dell/EMC was a very challenging environment with new issues to resolve everyday. My troubleshooting skills increased during my years there. The hardest part was the traveling late at night."
"Dell",",I worked at Dell when they were trying to get into the mobile consumer space. Unfortunately the company wasnt willing to invest in the necessary infrastructure or strategy and as a result it failed. I saw it coming and got out early. However, Dell as a whole is a great company it just wasnt a good fit for me at the time. This review is highly outdated and in speaking with friends the culture is different than when I was there."
"Dell",",Dell is a great place to work filled with motivated, hard-working people. The environment is challenging but rewarding."

"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",This company requires a cult like following from its employees.  Long Term employees are rewarded while newer employees carry the load.  Management is top down run as a sole proprietorship even though they have a goal of 5 billion in sales. The job description was misrepresented to me. I fell ill during a 72 hour weekend call shift and was forced to take a warehouse position I was totally unqualified or prepared for.  Computer systems and work materials were very much out of date.  Company spent little on employee development."
"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",The atmosphere is laid back. No micromanaging. Most everyone works as a team between departments. A lot of room to advance."
"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",When I first started working at Bio-Rad, the position needed someone to help aliquot specimens.

"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",Bio-Rad has great products! The job I had was very interesting. "
"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",I felt that management needed some training in leadership. Meetings were chaotic and a waste of time. Some managers had problems with giving clear information and helpful feedback."
"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",So, your satisfaction working at Bio-Rad depends on what team you work with."
"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",The co. has been on SAP for about a year. There is no one in the accounting department that can train you. So your on  your own."
"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",Management does not interact with the employees unless something goes wrong."
"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",Co-workers are distant with limited communication."

"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",Now Corp cut throat, employees are numbers no longer personal family orientated place to work. Used to be voted best place to work in the bay, not now. Very sad as I had a career that I loved to get up and go to work and love the people and business. I never thought I would want to leave. Life Science Dept has a bad habit when it comes to product and how they used hazardous chemicals. The lead cannot really do their job due to non proper handling or training about chemicals. So workers are messing up those products which in fact that needs to be properly handle for the safety of the human beings. Not recommended to customers whose buying products."

"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",My working in Bio-Rad is great/bad experience. Since I focus on continuous improvement projects, risk management and building up quality system, I experienced obstacles. Too much politics and people are too used to their current environment. NO body wants to make any change."
"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",Great company to work for, I love the culture at Bio-Rad. Very people centric.  We have a onsite cafeteria and yoga during lunch. Management is very focused on employee participation to encourage a 'family' culture.  One of the best place to work for and build your career."

"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",if you work at Irvine QSD you are either good friends upper management or employees that have been there for a longer time will make you suffer. In other words, You have to be part of the club in order to do well. This hurts morale and drives good people away. Ask about turnover rates before you sign the offer letter."
"Bio-Rad, Inc.",", Bio-Rad  does a very good job of making people fear for their jobs just enough that you never get comfortable. Everyone is always scared, Little opportunity for advancement. Employees are highly cliquey which breeds high drama and gossip most of the time. Most overachievers do leave the company frustrated - seeking better pay ."
"Bio-Rad, Inc.",",I quickly learned how to adapt in a results-driven environment. Every single employee is willing to help and extend their expertise. Even as the company expands rapidly, the atmosphere is fun and exciting. I was very sad to know that this position was never permanent."

"RealNetworks",",Great office environment - only a contractor there but was welcomed by all. Large assortment of food and a great view at the time"
"RealNetworks",",RealNteworks strives to keep its employees happy, and has a generous benefits package. Work hours can be long sometimes, because RealNetworks is trying to re-invent itself and is not yet profitable."
"RealNetworks",",This is a very top-down company. The vision is stifled due to a drive to appease higher-ups. Managers are constantly in the mode of protecting themselves from work, and often don't support the team. Project managers often don't properly support the projects they head, this is relatively common at RealNetworks. However, the facilities are great and the pay was good."
"RealNetworks",",During a typical day at work I answered and routed incoming calls to the appropriate person, greeted guests, helped them sign into the badging system and contacted their host, answered employees' questions from where things were located to how to book a conference room in calendar.  I also took on any additional work that my team members needed help with. "
"RealNetworks",",I learned a lot about the interworking's of a building since I worked in facilities.  I also learned about the relationships between different departments and how they work together to keep a company running smoothly. "
"RealNetworks",",Management changed a couple of times during my employment.  Some were more helpful and better communicators than others.  They were all fair and good managers in my experience."
"RealNetworks",",Dealing with upset customers over the reception phone.  This was because I was not able to help them."

"RealNetworks",",A company that is invested into many areas, which provides a lot of opportunity to stretch and grow"
"RealNetworks",",The location in VA experienced great growth and had golden years as WiderThan (formerly Ztango). WTA had attributes that made it a fantastic place to work, and attractive enough for a hostile takeover to take place from corporate Real in Seattle. The positive benefit like a free Rhapsody account was a nice perk, though pales in comparison to the balance of the equation. My team and department and managers up through the WTA CEO were outstanding and are solidly referable, and would work with and assemble as a team again. RealNetworks at the home office took a diamond and threw it in a pile of sh t, thoroughly tarnishing a once-sound business. That approach doesn't give you a pile of diamonds, just a sh t-covered diamond."
"RealNetworks",",How many CEO's have transitioned through and how's the timeline on the stock price shaped over the past few years? Search RNWK under google finance to see for yourself-"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville","Very average place to work.  Free tuition if you can find the time after working all day. You have to pay for parking. Beautiful buildings and gardens around campus."
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",University of Tennessee was and still is one of the most fascinating institution to get a degree at. Especially, for business analytics programs which is what they are famous for. This institution is not just training their students to be discipline but also giving their students both theoretically and hands on knowledges for their working field requirement in the future. Base on my experience, it has a conducive environment for students to study, good supports from instructors to reach their highest possible potential in getting a good grades in class. Thus, these are all the perks and things that I like from studying at the University of Tennessee."
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",Great experience. Low pay but expected. High time commitment but expected. Pleased with atmosphere and coworkers. Must desire to advance and gain knowledge."
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",A great university for graduate school because of enthusiastic faculty, instrument availability, and hard-working graduate students."
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",A typical day at work:"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",You get to work and NO ONE speaks to you! Very politically correct and unprofessional."
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",What you learned:"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",I learned much about the SAP system and accounting, which is required for your job. Exempt workers have zero concern what non-exempt workers have to do. They can care less!!"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",Management: "
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",Absolutely a joke! There are people in management there that can care less of the lower non-exempt employees. Professional morals are non-existent!!! "
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",Beware, if you apply for a position at UTK make sure it is an overpaid exempt position, otherwise, you get NO respect!"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",Your co-workers:"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",Kind of friendly, but very Political about everything. Not understanding about lower position worker's life issues. What went on in their lives was way more important!"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",The hardest part of the job:"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",Doing your many required tasks and exempt employees, not turning in receipts, time sheets, etc., into to you. These items were needed by your DEADLINES!!! They know this, yet don't do it! Then your boss yells at you if not completed, like it was your fault!"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",The most enjoyable part of the job:"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",Running past my boss's office with paperwork for deadlines, and seeing them reading the paper, TV on, and feet propped on the desk!!"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",No direction, or any help! You are literally on your own!!"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",I wouldn't not work at UTK again, if my life depended on it!!!!!!"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",The University of Tennessee is an excellent institution for performing state of the art research.  UT's close association with Oak Ridge National Laboratory also allows many opportunities for performing globally impactful research across disciplines."
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",My typical day as a doctoral student was relatively unregulated (except for some classes the first two years).  My advisor's policy was that he didn't care where or how I worked as long as I was making progress with my research.  This type of environment was well-suited for my work style and allowed me to get more done than I otherwise would have in a more structured laboratory setting."
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",The hardest part of the job was the research itself (as it should be),  because you are pushing against the boundaries of human knowledge and trying to develop something significant and impactful.  But the work is worth it, because I learned a lot from many intelligent people from a variety of fields.  The multitude of conference trips were nice as well."
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",The University of Tennessee is not a place I can recommend. Faculty mentorship is nonexistent. Resources are promised, but not delivered. Getting help was impossible."
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",My time as an intern lasted from June - August of 2016. I was awarded the Undergraduate Research Internship Scholarship from the University of Tennessee - Knoxville. My research was based on reducing spectral data of Trojan asteroids. I submitted my own hours each week until the allotted sum of $2600.00 was earned at a pay scale of $15/hr. The opportunity presented various challenges but was a great learning experience for doing real-world research."
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",Unclear direction of job, poor leadership(make zero time for you to grow and development though they have been put in a leadership role and they claim that is what they are there for)"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",Hardest part of the job was trying to guess what leadership was thinking because information was not shared down to the people who were actually performing the tasks"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",The PC culture at UT is overly sensitive"
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",Medical Admin Assistant (University Family Physicians)- A typical day at work is very high stress, co-workers are not friendly and not helpful at all, you get no training so there for you do not know what you are doing, but are made to feel bad if you need to ask questions. You do not know the doctors you are working for and do not even get to meet some of them. Unfortunately the manager that hired me retied a month later leaving the office with out a office manager. The office then had  ""too many chief's not enough indians."" The hardest part of the job would have to be trying to explain to a patient why they owe a balance when you have no access to details of why they owe it, plus no training. I would not say there were any enjoyable parts of this job. I was let go after 4 months of working there, after they had just told me a month earlier that I was doing a great job and they were happy with me."
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",The University of Tennessee is a great place to grow and learn. My coworkers were friendly, encouraging, and informative. The laboratory skills I gained during my employment is priceless. I learned several techniques for chromatography and developed my knowledge in organic chemistry. I became more familiar with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Spectroscopy instruments as they apply to chemical analysis and synthesis."
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",good place to work overall but low pay.  I've gained excellent experience while serving as a grad student and research associate, and I hope to use this to springboard towards a career in plant breeding."
"University of Tennessee - Knoxville",",Working for the University as a student was one of the most enjoyable experiences of my collegiate career. I was able to get a behind-the-scenes look at how the Department of Housing worked with the students it housed, other departments, and plenty of family members in order to be more efficient and welcoming to all prospective and current residents. I gained valuable customer service, problem solving, and critical thinking experience while working for the Department of University Housing, and if the opportunity arose to work with them in my post-graduate life, I would absolutely jump at it."
"Men's Wearhouse","Working at a MW is working with business and family. When its time to work its time to work but when its time to play they surely know how to have a good time. You spend so much time together you and your co workers grow a bond."
"Men's Wearhouse",",The company is like one big family. They make sure you have fun at work so you enjoy coming to work. The pay is great and makes you want to come and be a part of a great team."
"Men's Wearhouse",",I actually got to work at a few different stores and everything great the management is great and sales are actually pretty good! the only issue I had was working more hours and more pay..."
"Men's Wearhouse",",Men's Wearhouse was a great company to work for.  Although I worked from home my team was extremely motivated and hard working.  We managed all of the opening construction and on going maintenance for 2000+ stores and office locations.  I worked from home for the last 15 years, and learned a lot about time management and good communication.  I enjoyed everything about my job, the daily duties assisting the stores as well as the large projects."
"Men's Wearhouse",",Having watched the company drastically change some of it's core beliefs over the last few years, once consistently on the Forbes top 100 companies to work. Those days are leaving us behind for. Shifting away from a rich corporate culture of the past, we are now just becoming expendable assets. Only as good as our previous months sales numbers and stats."
"Men's Wearhouse",",Men's Wearhouse is constantly evolving to keep pace with retail trends. They want to deliver a good value to their customers."
"Men's Wearhouse",",Now, I was doing this in high school as a tux specialist but if I could take it back I would be out there on the sales floor, the job was very easy once you master what you are required to do."
"Men's Wearhouse",",i Love selling. It brings me great joy to see that i have helped someone pick out a great suit or tux for their wedding or special occasion, or simply to get them ready for a new job interview."
"Men's Wearhouse",",Managers and associates all talked about taking drugs and cussing in the work place. very childish and poorly managed."
"Men's Wearhouse",",Daily basis I check the SCA orders and ship those online orders out, check my appointment book and prepare for any appointments I may have coming in. Set up a stack for the wardrobe consultants if they have a suit buyer to help sell more items to them. Cleaning and refolding the tables to keep it organized."
"Men's Wearhouse",",to be honest i worked in the company for three years and took care of so many different types of people and worked with the same amount management will walk all over you and do you dirty if you do as they please"
"Men's Wearhouse",",worked in the tuxedo department i liked it alot i helped people find prom tux and wedding parties it was a great positive work place pay is a little on the low side but i liked it"
"Men's Wearhouse",",Very customer service oriented. Company lets store make decisions on how to handle customer needs. The Regional Manager was tough, but extremely fair."
"Men's Wearhouse",",Working here was whatever. The manager of my store was a little toxic and corrupt. I'm not about to go on and on to just complain(for lack of an explicit word) about the manager. Fellow employees specifically the other CSAs and Wardrobe Consultants were fun to work with because we were all young men. I felt highly underpaid working here for all that I did."
"Men's Wearhouse",",best work experience ever. if there was one in my location I would have transferred. The training was mostly hands on but everyone was a team player and treated each other like family."
"Men's Wearhouse",",It has always been a good place to work regarding my school schedule and a good work life balance. There is room for advancement but in my opinion, managers are often underpaid."
"Men's Wearhouse",",Mens Wearhouse has slowly become the typical company that seems to look out for their executives financially while we worker bees get the squeeze."
"Men's Wearhouse",",I worked here and I felt like they didn't know how to keep my personal business out side the job. If the manager know you outside the job she will tell all the new people your business. The company is unprofessional in the Poconos"
"Men's Wearhouse",",A typical day is a stream of rapid fire intimate and meaningful connections with customers. Your goal is to help, and you're taught every day how to be better at selling. Without this job, I'm not sure how great I would be as a person or as a salesman. I wholeheartedly recommend working for this company!"
"Men's Wearhouse",",I worked as a tux rental specialist (CSA) and had a great time. Getting people looking good is a great feeling, and the people i worked with were great.  Whether or not you enjoy it will depend on your manager."
"Men's Wearhouse",",Good environment to work in co workers are a great team to work with. Days can be long  but easy and laid back. Everybody works together. Management tries to meet workers needs"
"TE Connectivity","Nice people. Good projects. We were part of an Agile team building a contact based software. Managment is pretty hands off and the technical team is given a lot of time to work on their own."
"TE Connectivity",",Management team is unstable constant changes with clear direction or vision. No career advancement nor technology developments. Not a good environment to work. Avoid it if you can"
"TE Connectivity",",If your not one of the chosen ones your treated poorly. Management let's adults throw temper tantrums and rule their veiws. Not a place I would try to help a friend get a job. Unless your starving to death and despite, keep looking. Favoritism like you won't believe. LOTS of double standard going on. Raises are an insult. No support from management. Backstabbing and cry babies or inbred rednecks with black or no teeth. Dirty nasty place to work. Will lay you off at a moments notice."
"TE Connectivity",",SharePoint administration,  IIS SharePoint,  Customer relations, Training hard to get.  The people I work with and the customers.  Work from home 90% of the time"
"TE Connectivity",",It was a great run at TE Connectivity.  I spent a solid 7+ years at this organization.  I expanded my knowledge in cable accessories as well as other products in multiple markets."
"TE Connectivity",",Challenging work environment due to matrix organization but local team is great!  Company changes upper management regularly and this causes inefficiencies and fear"
"TE Connectivity",",Company was good to work for. Worked a lot of long hours with no weekends off. Benefits were great the only disadvantage was there was no room of advancement. Company went out of business."
"TE Connectivity",",PROS;"
"TE Connectivity",",Great Benefits (insurance, tuition, retirement)"
"TE Connectivity",",Great co-workers (in some departments)"
"TE Connectivity",",Lots of opportunities for training/education"
"TE Connectivity",",CONS:"
"TE Connectivity",",Little to no support from management"
"TE Connectivity",",Low Pay"
"TE Connectivity",",Mandatory Overtime (weekends)"
"TE Connectivity",",No clear promotion schedule"
"TE Connectivity",",Bonuses based on entire segments performance (not individual facility)"
"TE Connectivity",",No communication between shifts"
"TE Connectivity",",Working at this company is ok. But as far as them wanting to help their employees move up the ladder or even giving them a chance to prove themselves is only  given to a chosen few."
"TE Connectivity",",I was able to make a good living working for this company, However The focus of the IT department is not to make the business more efficient and finding solutions derived from technology. This department only cares about appearing like it is useful to the business. As a result IT analyst were simply focused on inflating numbers and appearing like IT mattered. It all came down to lack of leadership from IT management.  I am not surprised that TE is finally looking at outsourcing IT services. IT management for the most part focused on coming up with numbers such as ticket resolution, how many tickets were resolved etc instead of coming up with actual solutions to business problems."
"TE Connectivity",",TE Connectivity was my employment for 15 years and my job was eliminated due to a reduction in workforce.  Really enjoyed my time their and go to work some really good people"
"TE Connectivity",",When I was there it was a great place to work. Clean workplace, great people, benefits and advancement within company. I worked my way up from assembly to warehouse then to machine operator and some other titles in between."
"TE Connectivity",",I'm a productive person who is focused on my quality of work and work at a steady pace. I time myself so I will know how long it will take to get a specific job done."
"TE Connectivity",",I love overtime and only take days/nights off when absolutely necessary. I am able to work as a team or individually."
"TE Connectivity",",I enjoyed my time with the company.   I was hoping to make a career of it and I did for 18 years.  Hard place to leave to seek a new opportunity."
"TE Connectivity",",Its been an extended period since I worked at TE but I did gained valuable experience although it was a very tightly managed company working under high pressure conditions."
"TE Connectivity",",Good company but not if your a temp, your worked to death. Harassed for overtime, overworked you end up working 10x harder then people that are FT...."
"TE Connectivity",",fun workplace and nice coworkers. I work 5 days a week . very motivated people. great boss . good benefits. very busy company"
"TE Connectivity",",TE Review"
"TE Connectivity",",Worked for this company for a few years.  Do your research before working for this company.  Over the last 5 years they have laid of workers every year.  Good, intelligent people with 20+, or 30+ years, were given their walking papers, as well as some with much less years of service . This has not just been going on for the last 5 years either.  I spoke to people who won't apply for a job at TE,  because they know they are constantly laying off workers. You truly are just a number when you work for this company . I knew a guy who received an impact bonus signed by the top divisional manager, and a promotion in the same year only to be laid off 3 months later.  "
"TE Connectivity",",They also use creative techniques to get around the work laws.  There have been people laid off on a Friday with the rest of their group, and then a ""younger"" guy, or two (read that as under 50) were brought back into the company the following Monday.  Sure, there are a couple who are in the right place at the right time, and can make it to retirement, but you roll the dice as time goes by.  Older workers cost money to insure and pay.  If you are young this company can be a good spring board to better places to work, but I would not sign up with this company looking for a long term career."
"TE Connectivity",",I met a lot of good people working there, and still have good relationships with them. Management is a bit shaky from the top all the way down. For example, management decided to pump millions of dollars into the Whisper products only to find it was very difficult to manufacture, and very expensive to make.  Customers"
"TE Connectivity",",  "
"TE Connectivity",", didn't need to pay the high cost when competitors had products for today's market that were good enough, and much cheaper.  They also tipped their hand to the competition trying to release it to the market so the competition now all know what to shoot for, and have plenty of time to design a better product.  Their big money maker will probably end up with lower margins when they do finally find someone willing to buy it because of this, coupled with the cost to make it.  The point is the little guys were the ones who suffered for this management blunder. Thee company needed to make the numbers look good even though the cash cow wasn't paying off so jobs were lost.  Now they are trying to push hiring more women.  A brilliant move in that they can pay them less!"
"TE Connectivity",",Culture, and work environment are good.  They remodeled all the buildings in Middletown over the last couple of years to ""trick"" perspective employees into thinking it is a great company.  It looks pretty, but don't base your decision to work there, or any place else for that matter on how it looks."
"TE Connectivity",",  "
"TE Connectivity",",I had a great time working. The work culture was excellent. My seniors were very professional. I am grateful that this company provided me with good experience"
"TE Connectivity",",Wonderful place to work. Great people who work together to get things done. TE is very good about promoting from within, which I`m a firm believer in that. Hardest part of this position is component shortages, and getting them here asap. I enjoy the fact that we have an "" engagement team "" that plans dinners, parties, heart walks, etc., that we can participate in. And programs set up to help the community. Many regrets that the facility is closing."
"TE Connectivity",",I worked here for two years and I am now ready to move on with my manufacturing experience and broaden my horizons. I have contributed my full potential to the company."

"Experian",",7.recognition for work"
"Experian",",8. Nice managemwnt"
"Experian",",Poor management style, no trust in employees and little respect for consultants. Not a great environment to work in, especially the Finance team."
"Experian",",Experian is a great place to work if you don't mind being cussed at daily as part of your job requirements, have your bonuses taken away and then have your name slandered on false pretenses"
"Experian",",Experian is one place where you can be secure about your job and be assured of an amazing work culture with a great bunch of people to work with. Management team is very dynamic and highly visionary."
"Experian",",I loved working at Dillards. I loved doing sales with customers."
"Experian",",Dillards has a reputation for a dog eat dog working conditions."
"Experian",",I just did my job and let the rest do what they did. I was warned and did find that as my sales grew and my raises started climbing the store moved me into past season's section for a week to bring my sales below my next pay raise numbers. "
"Experian",",I was disappointed and spoke with my supervisor about that and continued to do my job."
"Experian",",Most co-workers were excellent to work with. "
"Experian",",The hardest part of the job was the issues with my legs and feet that caused great pain."
"Experian",",My favorite part of working there was the customers. I loved assisting them with choices and options as well as with complaints."
"Experian",",Experian is an amazing workplace with great people and extremely helpful teachers. The job is largely based in long hours on the phone and Experian does a wonderful job creating an environment to make you feel calm and comfortable to accommodate."
"Experian",",A typical workday would consist of reading emails to prioritize the workflow for the day. This of course, consisted of monitoring customer affected alerts. I learned how the different business units worked together to achieve the common goal, to ultimately satisfy the customer,s needs. The management staff rolled down departmental and company goals and initiatives that was overall challenging to meet, yet sometimes not achievable. The coworkers were easy to get along with and in most cases exhibited good chemistry. The hardest part of the job was the tension brought on when we engaged in long conference bridge calls between the supporting staff and the clients. This sometimes took several hours or days to resolve. The most enjoyable part of the job when the support team woked collectively to resolve a customer impacted issue in a relatively short period of time."
"Experian",",Experian is VERY old-school in its approach to management, but it's technology and operations were legitimate. Being the niche it was, they found very creative ways to bring in revenue to the company."
"Experian",",Experian provides a large, corporate environment with opportunities across a global organization.  They are going through transformational initiatives right now with each group at varying stages of technology and agile transformation.  The group you are part of will heavily influence your workplace."
"Experian",",Loved working there only left due to medical reasons,  Nice people, good managers but bad hr ,  great benefits, learned a lot of tecnicues and skills on how to deasl with angry customers"
"Experian",",Very good work experience, very accommodative and good colleagues and management. Good learning experience, Friendly & highly secured environment, Employees are well taken care, Facilities are provided as par with most coorporates"
"Experian",",Amazing salary, perks, coworkers....horrible for someone starting a family or with a life.  Horrific middle management.  Keep your mouth shut and perform ur assigned tasks and enjoy what this co. will do to your resume.  Besides that, I hope you like meetings."
"Experian",",Experian's culture is business casual, which makes the work environment comfortable. This is an asset on stressful days, however, I enjoy my job and duties."
"Experian",",Experian was a pleasant place to work.  Nice co-workers.  Great place to work if you have the right job in the right department.  Otherwise, you will probably eventually be laid off."
"Experian",",So, the benefits have been great. However, after I started working there, there was a small pay increase to bring the company up to ""competitor standards"", yet we still make a lot less than other companies in the area. Considering it is a Fortune 100 company, it's kind of ridiculous."
"Experian",",I loved everything about the workplace.  Our benefits were outstanding.  Co-workers were all there to help one another and be a great team.  Management was always available to assist in any way they could.  This is a great family oriented place to work."
"Experian",",No nonsense atmosphere with Big Brother always watching, no time for employee bonding, management and human resources very demanding, good training sessions from human resources."
"Experian",",Call center for Free Credit Report. Com explains it all."
"Experian",",Took calls from people who visited a website and did not read the page and were charged. These people were usually angry and verbally abusive. Very stressful environment with not much management support."
"Experian",",The people you work with is important when deciding where to work.  I don't think I can say a bad word about anyone I met here.  There are really some good people at Experian, but through my tenure there - the ebb and flow of people in and out was pretty evident.  Experian is constantly trying to re-invent themselves and adjust the culture."
"Experian",",I have been working at Experian full-time (More than a year), team is small so you get a lot of learning exposure and make a huge impact since team is small you are always under delivery pressure and staying late becomes regular, management can introduce induction program for freshers"

"kyyba",",The contract work was very pleasant.  "
"kyyba",",Representation upon departing from client was unacceptable, unprofessional, and indicated that money and filled positions were more important than people."
"kyyba",",Below statement regarding CEO, how can I give feedback on someone I have not met.  I can say that the website indicative of integrity all around did not apply to my situation and I was very disappointed that I had trusted this company with my career advancement."

"UT Southwestern Medical Center",",I blame the managers and supervisors for our turnaround ratio. Previous manager was great and very compassionate."
"UT Southwestern Medical Center",",Wasn't a good place to work during my tenure there. Special treatment was given to specific individuals. Scheduling wasn't what was agreed upon during initial hiring and position responsibilies were often modified."
"UT Southwestern Medical Center",",The benefits are wonderful, and it was a great learning experience. I would do it over again. I think it is a good place to start a career"
"UT Southwestern Medical Center",",UT Southwestern is one of the best medical research centers in the nation. Academic research is intellectually demanding with many long hours in the lab, but highly rewarding with excellent benefits and colleagues."
"UT Southwestern Medical Center",",UT Southwestern is a Magnet Hospital with various opportunities for growth.  The environment of care is pristine compared to most facilities in Dallas."
"UT Southwestern Medical Center",",Science always goes on here, be ready to work. Most jobs require a lot of time put in to them, so that's an absolutely important aspect of working here. Co-workers are people who devote their lives to whatever it is they are doing there most of the time, so everyone is pretty intent on getting their share in. Great science, great environment."
"UT Southwestern Medical Center",",It is almost impossible to get hired on at this place. If you don't score a certain way on a pre-employment assessment they won't even give you a chance. I think they miss out on a lot of quality employees and you can reapply again for 6 months...not smart."
"UT Southwestern Medical Center",",No flexability In work schedule with students in this position. Stressful job but pays pretty well. Great benefits, free health insurance."
"UT Southwestern Medical Center",",Everyday was a busy day, but the staff had team work and it all worked out for the better. I learned a lot of things and experienced different kinds of diseases that some people lived through and other didn't. UT Southwestern was the 5th best hospital in the Nation when I was working there. My Co-workers were great when ever we needed help with anything we helped each other out things were the best for me. 5 years and had gained a family, The hardest part of the job was when I had to resign because I lost 4 people in my family back to back and then I had an attendance issue because I lost family members in another state. I had to leave my job to care for people who had passed away. The most enjoyable part of my job was the education that was offered and given and it taught me the experience I have to this day."
"UT Southwestern Medical Center",",I loved being able to work there from 1993 to 2014. It was so amamazing to learn the medical aspects of research and dvelopment. All though i was behind the scenes i knew my research was helping people live longer happier lives."
"UT Southwestern Medical Center",",It has everything that a typical large not-for-profit medical center with graduate school, medical school and hospitals has.

"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION","Answer 100 - 120+ inbound calls per day. Have to reach out to so many different departments to handle a 1 call resolution.  It made it challenging to have a positive customer service experience for the member because they would have to wait on hold for quite some time."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",Have learned a lot in the financial industry. Helping out members is a great feeling. Very sales oriented. Overall great company and can be a great place to work."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",This company is a great place to work if you are positive person and like to take ownership of your work.  Lots of promotional opportunities and the benefits are insanely great.  Strong healthy culture.  IT and HR teams are nice to work with."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",I have to agree with the previous comments on how out of touch this organization is. Their lending practices are for the most part predatory and illegal. Management team needs a reality check."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",Worked for  a year and the people that I worked with were mostly not  great. horrible co-workers,  management was below the line and just plain horrible. The entire  team is being replaced year after year and there seems to be a common denominator -poor management-have been some good  SVPs let go during this time. The managers that you interact with on a daily basis can make things frustrating and annoying at times. They never listen to you, just bark orders and accept it. Very moody and their daily interaction with the team  are toxic. All they do during meetings is to gossip and criticize the top management the front of your peers. A lot of people have transferred out of the company due the constant negativity and lack of advancement and just a good work place. The Application review and the lending practices are predatory not to mention illegal.this is  team in general is not a good place to work in. Lots of turn over and overall not good. If you really need a job and like getting kicked in the face, then go for it. Otherwise, go somewhere else."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",My job entails personal experience with our members each day and building relationships with them in order to provide the best sales options for them.  Some job responsibilities include handling large amount of cash in and out, balancing our cash dispensing machines and vault, ensuring drawer is on balance, and finding products that best suit our members but also help us to reach our sales goals each month."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",Management consists of bosses who hide in offices - they're not leaders.  With little to no actual managerial experience (outside of their current employment), they exhibit very large ego's.  All compete for attention and favor, hence management will consistently steal credit for other peoples' hard work.  If you're not management, then don't expect adequate compensation - even when you deliver exceptional performance.  This is trickle-down, credit-usurping micro-management at it's absolute worst."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",Hence, turnover has increased exponentially within the last 5-10 years.  Annual performance review hits and job security are both employed as looming motivational threats.  There is little to no advancement opportunity, as VWCU prefers to hire people from outside over growing their internal employees' careers."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",Every 3-5 years a new corporate motivational program is force-fed to employees, and management uses cheerleader-style motivational tactics."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",The best part about VWCU is the Board of Directors matching 401k donations up to 7%.  Pay scales are somewhat competitive, but slightly lower than average overall.  This modification by HR is intentional.  Management however, is paid lavishly."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",They do offer an HSA healthcare plan - dental/vision are options."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",If you keep your head down, placate the ego of management, and don't desire advancement in career or financial gain, then you may do well here."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",The only thing I liked about working for this company was the people that I worked with and that does not include management. Every co-worker that I worked with did not like working for this company and most have moved on. Management can not be trusted neither can the HR department. There's not a lot of room for promotion as a Teller unless you decide to become a Financial Rep. Honestly this is not a place that I would refer any of my friends or family to work. If you do apply for a job with this company apply for a position at the corporate office."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",It's a fine place to work if you don't want to advance.  There is definitely favoritism and managers only care about themselves and their annual bonus.  They try to have a culture of accountability,  but that is a complete joke because sr. leadership does not even practice what they preach.  There are people in HR that are currently not qualified for the roles they are in, and there are others that are complete frauds and have been hiding behind the work of colleagues and spinning their web of lies to cover for their own incompetence.  This is very ironic since the managers in HR are supposed to lead by example, not be the opposite of honest and trustworthy employees. They pay an outrageously high salary to managers and executives, while the staff that is doing the daily work to keep the place afloat makes barely enough to live on.  It is disgusting.  They wonder why there is such high turnover, but they are so full of themselves and blind to the truth that they don't realize that the hard working people that keep the business going every day are treated poorly so they quit."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",It was a very great place to work!! Loved my co-workers!"
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",The only issue was management, you could clearly see they showed favoritism. They were encouraging to help you make your goals for the month, but if they disliked  you then they could care less. They would do anything in their power to get rid of you. But overall, great pay, benefits, paid vacation, and paid holidays was awesome!!!"
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",Good to place to work, learned a lot about finance and accounting, but not much opportunity to advance. Also, I feel the leadership is out of sync with its employees."

The manager is involved with all aspects of the live working branch. Security, supplies, branch outlook, and company culture are a few of the daily jobs associated with every day work."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",Growth in the financial business and for our member's financial security was always top priority with Vantage West.

"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",Good company to work for. They have taken a lot of time to create a culture of accountability."
"VANTAGE WEST CREDIT UNION",",I was a teller here. I would say if you got a great manager, your branch should flow smoothly. I know that for a fact my managers were pretty flexible and also it's important to communicate your needs and anything that has to be reviewed whether it's working with member accounts, or your own personal needs. The place here does make it important to promote a company culture so we can motivate ourselves in the morning and also be excited to help our members. It's really the attitude you bring to the plate each morning, so which are you going to choose? We had member service training classes that emphasize on customer service. It's to help everyone and it's good to recap, as well as review what we can improve and continue to work on."

"Direct Energy",",The job at Direct Energy is very relaxed and supportive. The managers are awesome and it has great benefits. They take time to acknowledge your efforts and they have many rewards and perks."
"Direct Energy",",I have worked at this company for 3 years and have moved up through every level in departments but they doesn't seem to be a clear direction from leadership as well as there is no room for growth to move up into leadership. There is no longer and development or training to become leaders so you are left to be only an agent without room to progress higher."
"Direct Energy",",I enjoyed my time at direct energy. Learned a lot while on the job and was able to network with fellow colleagues interested in moving up in the corporate world"
"Direct Energy",",you work hard but sometimes its just won't pay you correctly. I need challlenges and somedays it just seems like you are the same thing everyday. I need more motivation."

"Direct Energy",",the managment are unintelligable. there is so uch paperwork involved in the job 90% of my day is doing paperwork. they have no good streamlining abilities. and the managment calls meetings with very little to zero notice."
"Direct Energy",",Good employee engagement and work life balance.  Poor middle management. Change within the organization was not handled very well and employees were left to speculate and rely on rumor many times due to the lack of communication form middle management.  Supervisors worked hard to maintain team morale. Many ""extra"" activities to keep employee morale and engagement up."
"Direct Energy",",Its okay if your a real pursuant person, or upbeat person. I Needed a car for that job or else you guys WALK around all day... but apparently if you work for them long enough it all pays off"
"Direct Energy",",Every day working here , is a struggle, the staff  is not very considerate of their employees, you just feel like your here to answer calls and not being acknowledge of your  good work,"
"Direct Energy",",Great work life balance but otherwise management is not supportive of employees despite what they say verbally.  They do prioritize safety for employees but do not support internal promotions and developing employees."

"Sarah Cannon Network","Great mission statement that the company really stands by. However working for a company where you have been employed for over 5 years and knowing that if you are being promoted from within - you should expect to be paid substantially less than someone who came from outside of the company is completely disheartening. I have seen this happen way too many times to way too many people - myself included. When I first started, thank you and appreciation for going above and beyond was given always however in the last few years it is now expected that you not only carry the work load of yourself but also the other employees. This is a company that has grown way too fast too soon and they don't have any idea on how to keep their tenured employees anymore so they are losing them at an alarming rate. There are certain people in key leadership that don't value their employees and as a result they are losing multiple departments full of people. Overall, SCRI is a great place to get your foot into clinical research as the experience will take you far. Just know that if you intend to stay here - you will be vastly underpaid (a 50% or more decrease than the competitor companies)."
"Sarah Cannon Network",",I learn so many things here. Good chance to work here. The management is very friendly, working as a team member. Good experience."
"Sarah Cannon Network",",They have a great mission of treating cancer. They have a tendency to only look out for themselves, and promote people who are not deserving of the promotion"
"Sarah Cannon Network",",Rapidly growing company with lots of opportunity but also a lot of dysfunction. On its way to being a leader in the industry, but middle management and innovation/planning in resourcing and processes are currently lacking."
"Sarah Cannon Network",",The mission of the organization is amazing and one to live for. However, there is not much of growth development. It is hard to balance the work/life balance. Lots of work very little assistance. I love the people I work with, they keep it fun and wanting to carry out the mission"
"Sarah Cannon Network",",Sarah Cannon's tag-line, ""Fighting cancer together"", in a few words provides deep insight into the organization as a whole. This is a mission-driven organization comprised of mission-driven colleagues working together at all levels to prevent and treat cancer."
"Sarah Cannon Network",",Enjoy the mission and objectives of the company. High paced performance driven atmosphere and enjoyed the time there."
"Sarah Cannon Network",",The company's mission is great and in that respect I feel like I am making a difference.  The benefit packages are good, but compensation is too low for the number of hours employees put in.  Also, advancement is a problem...there is not much room for it based on your role."
"Sarah Cannon Network",",I love the patients, but the workload ratio to employees is overbearing and our management does not listen to their workers."
"Sarah Cannon Network",",If you like to have reasonable leadership who provide clear directives and are focused on producing a quality product, working at SCRI is not for you.  We are paid less here than most other competitors in town, with no room for advancement. "

"Sarah Cannon Network",",Nice atmosphere. Able to learn alot and aquire alot of on the job experience."
"Sarah Cannon Network",",It is a busy place and on the surface appears to be a good place to work. However, you must be very careful about what you say and do. Things are frequently taken out of context with the managemet; esp. to make a point with you or other staff. Many times you work alone with no back-up; lots of verbal ""we have your back"" but not there when chips are down. Management always backs the doctors; even it they are wrong. Management will change the way things are written to please the doctors. They have no problem setting staff up to fail."
"Sarah Cannon Network",",Co-workers are nice but reluctant to stand up for each other for fear will be the next target. This is the hardest part of working there."
"Sarah Cannon Network",",Remember as they greet you with a sunny smile, southern charm and firm hand shake, they have a knife ready to cut your throat or stab you in the back."
"Sarah Cannon Network",",Rapidly growing company that is owned by HCA. Great benefits and work environment. Culture of excellence and communication from all levels. Management attentive and receptive to feedback."

"Sarah Cannon Network",",I worked with an excellent team. Together we provided cross functional support to sites and patients to drive the IIT (Investigator Initiated Trials) side of the company.

"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory",",some mgmt arnt nice people, and take advantage .."
"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory",",sometimes uncomfortable  environment  when your always being watched."
"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory",",Most of what I do for CSHL is setting up multiple dining areas for brunches, lunches, and dinners. We serve the scientists, researchers, and other scholars who come in for meetings. We serve about 200-500 people throughout the day so the people who work behind the scenes pull together and make sure they are doing the best they can to make everyone satisfied with their dining experience. The people in the kitchen are putting together trays and dishes non-stop, the servers are responsible for bringing out the food, and the utility personnel are responsible for managing dishes. During these activities management is running around making sure that all the staff are alright and also checks in with all the guests seeing that they are satisfied with their meal. Before we set up these rooms we are able to eat lunch or dinner for free. The only drawback is that sometimes the food is cold or not fully cooked, but for really major events we are served the best food. The only hard part of the day is switching between dining setups throughout the day. Overall this job has treated me very well, there aren't too many things I dislike about working here because this job has helped me to financially get through college and other expenses."
"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory",",very good research instistute. You can gain a lot of experience and interact with many scientist since there are a lot of meeting year around."

"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory",",The individual labs are a bit difficult to break though, but most labs work well together.  The atmosphere is academic with a fairly strong work ethic.  The Lab works hard to improve the lives of its postdocs and graduate students and gives easy access to education and top-notch scientists.  The pay at first glance appears competitive, but because Long Island is so expensive, it turns out not be.  Good Benefits, however."

"General Dynamics Information Technology",",Taking phones calls, helping callers with questions about Medicare, billing, and helping the beneficiary's getting supplies that they need. As far as Supervisor's, they were good; Management I felt that they were not for the workers on the production floor. They were basically for themselves, not wanting to help or the wellness to help.

The support and encouragement I have received from my coworkers and managers has been tremendous. I can honestly say that landing this job has been one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me in my life and it means the world to me. Words cannot begin to describe the level of appreciation and gratitude I feel. I never truly understood the saying ""If you love what you do you will never work a day in your life"" until I started working here at Liberty. I consider many of my colleges not to be just coworkers but very good friends. It's a great feeling to work for a company that cares about its employees and would go above and beyond to help you succeed in business and in life.

"Eliassen Group",",I also love how the company believes strongly in employee recognition."
"Eliassen Group",",Highly recommend!"
"Eliassen Group",",I love working at Eliassen and coming in each morning. I enjoy complimentary coffee, snacks, outings, and the overall culture of the company. This company is ever changing for the better. Business casual dress is a major plus! My co workers are great, understanding, and respectful. Management rocks, I work really well with them. Personality is key, there is constant interactions with people no matter your role so being friendly, understanding, thoughtful, and open minded goes a long way at Eliassen."
"Eliassen Group",",Always great interactions with people that work here. The executive team is passionate and committed to moving the company forward. With a 20 year history, it's a big player in the staffing industry. In preparation for growth, the company needs to be open to the required changes necessary."
"Eliassen Group",",The Eliassen Group Resource Specialist program was an excellent introduction to the staffing industry and provided myself and the other Resource Specialist in my training class an amazing training program that was geared toward many different types of learning styles."
"Eliassen Group",",On a day-to-day during the three month training I participated in classroom training, roles plays and shadow sessions with senior recruiters, and had phone conversations with candidates."
"Eliassen Group",",I received continuous support from my managers and mentor, as well as from others in my Resource Specialist class. Not only did I receive excellent training, but I also built a bond with my co-workers and management team through group lunches and out-of-work social activities."
"Eliassen Group",",Good place to work. I would recommenced any new college grad to take a look at Eliassen. It is a great place to get started and gain some real experience."
"Eliassen Group",",I have been with the company for a few months now and can truly say it is the healthiest sales environment I have ever worked in. Management and executives are highly present, involved in helping both individuals and teams to grow, and their ""open door"" policy makes them easy to approach about absolutely anything. "
"Eliassen Group",",A typical work day starts with a daily stand-up meeting with the entire team to provide updates and check in one the status of everyone's priorities.  Really helps with communication and keeping everyone up-to-date. Follow this with standard recruiting of emails, resumes, phone calls and coordinating interviews/offers. "
"Eliassen Group",",Co-workers, Management and support staff in Bethesda are so great to work with. Everyone gets along, knows how to have fun but also are very focused/supportive to the success of the branch and each other. There is trust and commitment which is great. "
"Eliassen Group",",The hardest part of the job is putting in all of the time and effort to get a sale and having nothing work out. It happens with any sales job, but it can be a bit disheartening. You just have to keep going! The other con I would say is the base salary -- should vary depending on years of experience and take into account the local economy/cost of living. Commission package is better than other places I have seen though!"
"Eliassen Group",",The most enjoyable part, again, is the work environment. There is no micromanaging. There is a high level of trust that everyone is doing their job (it shows in your numbers), everyone is just friendly and approachable. We like to have fun and we like to make money!"
"Eliassen Group",",Everyone here is very nice and personable. We all get along great, and there is always someone willing to help you out if you need it. The managers are appreciative of a hard-working employee, and will always recognize the people who put good effort into their jobs. The company is growing quickly, so there are a lot of opportunities to grow with them."
"Eliassen Group",",On an almost daily basis, I am asked to provide in-depth explanations of new 12c architecture and features to a highly knowledgeable staff. A great deal of effort does go into detailed review and explanation of specific technical features that may sound familiar but which function in unexpected ways. 'Selling' new functionality to development teams and operational requires a high degree of verbal finesse as well as the creation of test cases and demonstrations. The hardest aspect of the job - sometimes - are entrenched cliques within the organization which can make evaluation of new approaches unnecessarily difficult."
"Eliassen Group",",Awesome team - great pay, great work life balance and training. Best sales job i've ever had and would recommend to all.  The team and management are amazing.  Very successful company."
"Eliassen Group",",Working for Eliassen Group on a Government contract has been a nightmare. I am supposed to be paid each week and direct deposit won't start for three weeks so my first couple of paychecks were supposed to be mailed to me. So far, no check has made it to my mailbox. The company claims to have mailed the checks and they verified my address but nothing."
"Eliassen Group",",The staff involved with the new employee onboarding process did not seem to know what to do, for example, my security clearance was not migrated over which is usually done the day after the last day of employment from the old company. This held up my access at the new contract location."
"Eliassen Group",",In the future, I will avoid any contracts offered through Eliassen Group."
"Eliassen Group",",Eliassen group offers a great culture & work environment. It is truly a breath of fresh air to be able to see & speak to upper management and leaders on a regular basis. This is a company that has built up a leadership committee that cares about its employees and keeping them happy. Everyone is very welcoming and helpful, the management team makes a strong effort to build interpersonal relationships with employees while also being very receptive to their opinions and concerns. They also do a great job of promoting career advancement opportunities and offers many training programs to help their employees succeed. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a company to build a career!"
"Eliassen Group",",Eliassen is one of the best Agencies I have ever worked for. The Account Managers treat Candidates and Consultants like Family. "
"Eliassen Group",",The pay rate is always good. They are very particular in the ability to keep a consultant on a long term basis and they always have immediate assignments available for consultants when a contract with their clients ends."
"Eliassen Group",",Great supportive staff, friendly and productive team to be apart of, I've learned so may aspects of HR and enjoy the day to day functions of my job!"
"Eliassen Group",",I have only been at the Eliassen Group for a few months now, but feel like I have known everyone for much longer than that. Every employee from upper management, to account execs/recruiters, to the back office are extremely welcoming and outgoing; it really made the transition an easy one and makes every day coming to work pleasant and fun. Days don't only go by quick because of the fast paced nature of the job but also because of the easy going vibe the office has. Everyone is approachable, helpful and willing to have a conversation with you, which makes for a warm, healthy work environment."
"Eliassen Group",",I just started here but it has been great so far. Everyone has been extremely helpful and I feel that the growth potential here is enormous. I'm excited for the future here and am confident in the management that we have."
"Eliassen Group",",As a young professional just beginning my career, I could not be happier with my decision to join Eliassen. The senior leadership and motivated young talent with this group is unlike any other. Everyday I am surrounded by successful professionals that show up ready to work. The opportunities at Eliassen are endless, making it a place to call home for the long hall."
"Eliassen Group",",The management of EG are very nice and personable. The hardest part about working for this organization is the benefits and compensation package."
"Eliassen Group",",typical day at work?checking in on my staff and assessing their progress on the projects. Hardest part of the job? labor job, such as breaking ballets full of computers. the most enjoyable part of the job? Manager understands members."
"Eliassen Group",",Eliassen was able to staff based on my skills at a great location. I was able to be utilized to help improve process and help design and organize a respectable documentation repository facilitating my knowledge and experience across multiple teams outside the initial job requirements."

"Columbia University","Columbia University is a great place to work, it has great employee benefits, you have a 3 month probation period and you have good job security.  The culture of Columbia University is corporate but casual and the management staff, for the most part, are very helpful.  The hardest part of the job is being exact and paying attention to detail; the most enjoyable part of the job are my co-workers."
"Columbia University",",I enjoy working at Columbia University. I work with brilliant people that are doing amazing work in the Public Health sector.  At the end of the day being part of the work is super rewarding."
"Columbia University",",Columbia university medical center is a great place to train as a nephrologist. The glomerular center offers a unique aspect to training."
"Columbia University",",the most enjoyable part of the my job is when kids and rents enjoy the meal. supervisor and staff are very friendly and supportive."
"Columbia University",",Job security is an important factor, the benefits are great. We have decent healthcare insurance plans and a tuition benefit program for people who want to go to graduate school. There is no talent management and systematic approach to employee development. No support to employees who want to advance their career. CU rather hires people from outside than promoting from within."
"Columbia University",",Pleasant to work at but stressful to work with the higher ups. Learned how to handle people's needs and multitask at a fast rate."
"Columbia University",",Columbia is a great calm place to work if you are working with the right professors and staff, students can be annoying around crunch time but everyone is generally respectful and sensible regardless of your position. The curricula need help adjusting to the modern world though."
"Columbia University",",I have been Visiting Scholar at Columbia University - ISHR for two years and I liked it very much. It was one of the best academic places I have studied and worked."
"Columbia University",",I enjoy Columbia, but it's a large organization and I think everyone's experience is determined by their department. Not that easy to grow in the field I am in. I wish they would champion applying within the organization a bit more."
"Columbia University",",Excellent place to work. Have the option to work on your own and also work with others. Definitely a great place if you want to learn new things and have flexible hours."
"Columbia University",",Great environment, great co-workers. Everyone is pretty friendly and accommodating. Worked as a work-study, so I didn't have any benefits, but I'm fairly certain they exist. In my particular situation, I didn't."
"Columbia University",",Excellent place to work because I had the opportunity to work with a group of people, and be supervised by my professor. Also was allowed to work alone."
"Columbia University",",My overall experience at Columbia was great, except one aspect, but I loved the collaborative and intellectual environment.  Great perks of working at Columbia, but if you are looking to get rich this is not the place, but great people!"
"Columbia University",",Hard to get in, but you'll never get out. Nice place tonwork.. Good atmosphere. .no pressure. Not much I can say didn't work.there long.."
"Columbia University",",I worked on my graduate research project on a daily basis. I interacted with my lab mates and other members of the department. I spent most of my time on the computer or teaching."
"Columbia University",",Not a lot of room for advancement, but really good benefits and work/life balance and generally a fun environment. Opportunity to enroll for your undergraduate or graduate degree once you've been employed two years."
"Columbia University",",Great place to work, Friendly and engaging employees. "
"Columbia University",",No two days are the same, have set task to perform, but new request for reports or assistance keeps job fresh."
"Columbia University",",In the Administrative areas, (HR, Finance, etc.) you will work well over 40 - 50 hours per week, take work home and work on weekends.  Certain departments are understaffed to support a large School population.  "
"Columbia University",",I learned that the onboarding is non-existent and there is no real attempt to integrate new employees into the diverse and distinct culture. "
"Columbia University",",Management are hired based on connections and sometimes do not have sufficient credentials for a senior level position.  There is a lack of collegiality, support and development of staff.  There is virtually no performance review process (not mandatory and not recommended or encouraged throughout the entire organization)"
"Columbia University",",Highly decentralized organization much to the detriment of policy, procedures and benefits to staff.  No consistency in policy and procedure. "
"Columbia University",",The hardest part was finding policy for case specific circumstances and no consistency in information and policy provided by central office.  Lack of clarity in policy and a severe findability and search capability for main website."
"Columbia University",",The most enjoyable was the campus and academic population."
"Columbia University",",While attending classes, I've taught at the University in many venues.  This review pertains to the non-profit, Community Impacts classes.  While i feel it is a necessary extension of CU into the nearby under served, under educated neighborhoods, it doesn't take advantage of the wealth of knowledge that the faculty has for advancing those that attend.  I was able to learn and take much from my professors and bring it into the classroom setting to move students along to GED/TASC passing and into college but that wasn't a standard practice."
"Columbia University",",School work could be stressful, but opportunities are enormous. In a highly competitive place, everybody has the passion and energy to work hard on their individual goals. Instructors have different backgrounds: scholars, engineers, actuaries, businessmen etc. Career fair is a big advantage because networking is easier at NYC."
"Columbia University",",High grades are challenging to get because of competitions and high level brain powers, which also makes life more enjoyable."
"Columbia University",",Excellent environment to work"
"Columbia University",",Always work"
"Columbia University",",A lot people "

"Netflix","I enjoyed listening to music while I worked on the machines. When I first started working there it was fun people were tired but for the most part happy. Shortly after I was hired they started laying off and firing most of the employees. They also kept changing and getting rid of supervisors and managers. It was also very difficult to progress even though they said there was room for growth."
"Netflix",",When the company firs came to SLC the culture was phenomenal it was one of those things where you just couldn't wait to go to work. Of course things change, but I feel it tore out the heart of the company."
"Netflix",",This company is typical of every large company, they treat you as if you are easy to replace, and make sure that you know that you are easy to replace."
"Netflix",",Before the company got a new head of operations, there was a fantastic culture, advancement opportunities everywhere, and great clear coaching. After that it all fell short, the company started hiring eternally instead of promoting within. there were no Promotions offered for CSR2 for over a year while I worked there. If you're going there, don't expect to move up for a long time."
"Netflix",",Netflix pays it's employees extremely well with included benefits that are hard to beat. The culture was a stressful environment with consistent changes, yet hardly any follow through."
"Netflix",",A high volume call center and customer service through email. Netflix gave the customer reps a lot of freedom in handling issues. It was a fun culture and we got a lot of Netflix swag. The calls were fairly quick mostly regarding lost discs or help with signing up on the internet."
"Netflix",",I learned a lot about big scale production. The days were long but the people were all kind and professional. Great experience."
"Netflix",",Working for Netflix was a fun experience. I was able to talk to people from around the country and sometimes different parts of the world. That made the job a lot more fun and interesting."
"Netflix",",Netflix is a lot of fun, I mean your working for an entertainment company and they do just that. The only hard part is customers and even then there not too bad. The environment is light and yet professional."
"Netflix",",Autonomy, great compensation and the opportunity to work with the best of the best.  This is an opportunity of a lifetime! Only problem is they spoil you and makes it impossible to find anything else that compares!"
"Netflix",",Love waking up to go to work. Very relaxed work environment with flexible seating arrangements. Teams were very intimate and team leads worked with agents one on one week after week to improve in areas that were lacking. For every holiday and new release there was a celebration including food and games."
"Netflix",",My typical day at work was pretty simple if all went well. My job was to answer questions, comments, and concerns with the website and the product we were providing as well as assisting with devices customers where using. It was a new challenge for each call and that was what kept it fun for myself. You would have a few bad eggs of course, but that rarely slowed down the pace of the day overall. Management told you how you could improve on your calls, and co-workers would talk to you during breaks about what they do when you run into a sticky situation. The hardest part about the job was having a rush of callers that gave us no breathing room in between to collect ourselves again. This, however, is standard with most jobs involving customer interaction. Also, compared to the number of customers they have, we were only helping a very small percentage of the overall user base. In short, the customers that called were the ones that definitely needed our help."
"Netflix",",This is definitely a great and fun place to work. I love video games and tech so working at this call center was really fun. Getting to know new releases and playing with the different devises that you could load the app onto"
"Netflix",",Its alright for a call center, it pays well but that is about it. They also have good benefits but getting time off here is almost impossible."
"Netflix",",Worse place ever as it was all temporary from the very start.. so they have 3 interviews they make you jump thru after you go thru the hardest hiring process as far as applying and awaiting an interview period?? I think I didn't hear a response for about 6-7 months later?? The management was so poorly picked and orcustrated that I would highly doubt Netflix CS survival here in Utah.. I bet now they hire the lower bracket of individuals with actual experience and knowledge about tech support that their turnover ratio has to be a record high.. the supervisor I had was very demeaning and condescending and passive aggressive like he had an agenda to ruin folks lives, cause nobody on my team is there anymore as I still communicate with all of them!!"

"Netflix",",they make advancement almost impossible"
"Netflix",",no understanding of family first"
"Netflix",",i was a volunteer for a pilot show for netflix that is called fallen cards it was a very good experience i got to do makeup and hair for the actors in the show"
"Netflix",",Typical day at work is coworkers greeting me as I walk in the call center and customers eager to speak to me to have their issues resolved. I learned that it's easier to sympathize with a customer than to argue. Hardest part about the job is staying confident in yourself when you have angry customers criticizing you for mistakes that may have been on their part. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and creating new friendships."
"Netflix",",Great Company to work for really takes care of their employees."
"Netflix",",.                                                                                                             "

"Makino, Inc","I had the experience of working there as a co-op, not a full time hire. As someone with a few years of experience, I don't think I was given ample opportunity to display my skills. I worked on meaningless tasks that I felt had no impact on the company. I had no choice in what I worked on."
"Makino, Inc",",Management was not very social."
"Makino, Inc",",Co-workers were good teachers."
"Makino, Inc",",Dealing with customers and engineers was most enjoyable."
"Makino, Inc",",Working for Makino has greatly increased my skills and abilities. The diversity of equipment and opporitunities provided has produced a very exciting work environment. The Makino team is just that, a team. We help each other and build off of each others skills."
"Makino, Inc",",A typical day at work consists of new challenges everyday.  There is so much to learn at Makino.  The people at Makino are great and very helpful in learning your role.  Everyday provides new learning experiences. Overall Makino is a great company in the Machine tool world."
"Makino, Inc",",this job was nice for the most part. I had good pay and benefits after being there for a while. the bad part of cleaning up at this place was the fact that some of the male employees thought it was cute and funny to put fecies on the wall that I would have to clean up."
"Makino, Inc",",I enjoyed working at Makino. The assignments were challenging but I was given the support I need to accomplish the tasks on time. While there was plenty of travel involved the company had guidelines in place to make it as painless as possible"
"Makino, Inc",",Makino is a great company if you want to make money fast and are single. I was never home for the first year and a half, and was always a long plane ride away from home. Field Service Engineers always end up fixing everybody's mistakes, whether its the client or the main office."
"Makino, Inc",",I've been at Makino for a year, and I love it. Everyone is willing to coach you to make sure you understand the process so you can complete tasks on your own. The company is focused on continuous improvement and invests in ongoing training and personal performance plans. My favorite thing about Makino is the involvement in giving back to the community through their volunteer program. All in all a great company to work for!"
"Makino, Inc",",A great experiance in the world of Field Engineering. A lot of information is supplied to you at once at a high pace business setting. "
"Makino, Inc",",I learned many facets of accounting at this job.  There were always new things to learn and improve upon.  The structure is very hierarchial.  The most difficult part was dealing with constantly shifting job responsibilities.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the team based atmosphere."
"Makino, Inc",",Not a good place if you have an alternative. There were some good Managers but the top Tier or Vice Presidents were ego maniacs driven to fight each other instead of working together. Nothing gets accomplished."
"Makino, Inc",",Nice facility. In house cafeteria. Can't get coffee in the afternoon. 90+ cubicles with low walls in a small area. Hard to concentrate when you can hear so many people. Not many smiling faces. Controls engineering resources minimal."
"Synchrony Financial","As an intern at SYF you don't necessarily feel like an intern but rather a part of a team working towards the same goal. The program is different than any other development programs in the fact that the company actually invests in your progression and the people around you want to see you succeed. Overall a great company to work for."
"Synchrony Financial",",great benefits, always a way to get a bonus. the company would like to know how to make it a better experience for employs and customers."
"Synchrony Financial",",Great company to work for. Very diverse and opportunity to have your voice heard is something you don't get from a lot of companies. SYF is a very open minded company."
"Synchrony Financial",",Its a job that has its benefits and good pay. Unfortunately theres a night Manager that has her favorite employees and well if your not one of them she will ignlre you or treat you like trash. She has 0 profesionalism. All other Managers are great. Hardest part is the customers but hey if it wasnt for them you wouldnt had a job."
"Synchrony Financial",",Denied loan for roof online. When I called no reason was given. Given the runaround, call this other number, no answer. Emailed and text, no response."
"Synchrony Financial",",Great company to work for, and company that cares about it's employees."
"Synchrony Financial",",Great company that values employee advancement. "
"Synchrony Financial",",Great work environment. "
"Synchrony Financial",",Understandable and relatable management."
"Synchrony Financial",",Not a good fit for me. Was not familiar with call center environment before. I did not like the micro-managing that is done. They monitor each minute of the day that is not scheduled."
"Synchrony Financial",",Work is not hard. Co-Workers are great. Working on being a Great Place to Work.  Hard internal interviewing process.  Room for advancement within the company."
"Synchrony Financial",",Each department is different. If your department makes a lot of money for the company than everything is golden. Of not than expect a faulty process, horrible job aids and training gaps. Turn over is high."
"Synchrony Financial",",Synchrony is an interesting place to work. For the most part, everyone is very nice and respectful at first, until your are put into your team The benefits are superb and the company mission statement is what all companies should strive for.  However. the pay is very low and the work load is quite heavy.  The managers run from the best to the worst ever.  More training is needed for management along with soft skills and people management."
"Synchrony Financial",",great place to work, people are always so kind and helpful, they make sure you have great benefits, and you also get you own space to work and make it yours, they always try and do something for there employees bc they understand that your at work most of your day!"
"Synchrony Financial",",Don't believe their best places to work survey.  They put a lot of time and money into marketing, not so much into their employees.  Pay is lower than most equivalent jobs.  Time off and flexibility of schedule is better than other companies.  Micromanaging is insane.  Do not look for employee empowerment here as people are treated as underlings that are not as important as management, with the exception of a few events they do, but even those seem like pity presents.  Very modern in it's values, If you're a conservative person of faith it could make you uncomfortable. Proactively EEOC/LGBT-Friendly.  Seems like they have some of the worst turnover of any job I've had, and I've worked fast food before."

"Synchrony Financial",",no thank you I would not like to write a review of this company.  I am not happy working for a company I feel only friends of upper managers can advance"
"Synchrony Financial",",Great company to work for. Lots of great health and medical benifits. Work life balance is there. Not alot of room for promotions"
"Synchrony Financial",",Synchrony/GE, has given me 10 great years of experience in customer service, and account management.. The benefits are fantastic however a lot of turn over in the management department.. My co-workers are wonderful.. I have made a lot of great friends.. The hardest part of the job would be the the negativity, politics shown from upper management, in which has made for a very hostile environment..The most enjoyable part of the job is working with great co-workers"
"Synchrony Financial",",This company provides excellent work enviroment, family felling.  Great benefits. "
"Synchrony Financial",",A typical day at work is mainly answering calls and helping customers with their accounts, taking payments, verifying charges, opening disputes."
"Synchrony Financial",",Everyone willing to help, no matter their ""rank"" they want to help if possible.The hardest part of the job is keeping a cool head when you have been yelled at all day by upset customers, but the great people help you defuse as often as you need."
"Synchrony Financial",",The onsite cafeteria & gym help with that too."
"Synchrony Financial",",It is a senior design. Our goal is to build a security system in order to let the users using their finger print to open the cabinet."
"Synchrony Financial",",And I am responsible for coding the program for hardware like Wi-Fi, camera and physical locker. I connected the hardware with Raspberry PI that is a series of credit card-sized single-board computers by using python library."

"Synchrony Financial",",I love working at Synchrony. From management to coworkers to VP of Operations everyone is amazing. I worked in the Phoenix location."
"Sabre","A typical day at work was easy but frustrating because every body seems to think their problem is a priority over everyone else."
"Sabre",",I didn't learn much because I was never sent to training even though it was promised multiple times."
"Sabre",",The workplace culture is hard to determine at present because a new CEO has just taken over. I can say that the way it was leading up to the new CEO was not pleasant. Everyone had the attitude that you should work as much as possible and be available to answer emails at all hours of the day and night."
"Sabre",",The hardest part of the job was trying to get the company to give me proper training. Because it wasn't given i never felt like I was doing a appropriate job for my position."
"Sabre",",The only enjoyable part of this job was the vacation time that I had earned and some of the friendships that I made. There are no perks and no matter what they say they don't seem to be interested in hiring the most skilled workers."
"Sabre",",This a great company to develop your sales, marketing and distribution skills along providing excellence customer service"
"Sabre",",Sabre has some interesting products in play in the market that can be fun to work with but It also has a lot of Legacy technical debt which at times can weigh things down"
"Sabre",",Sabre's higher management was changed dramatically in preparation to go public."
"Sabre",",That improved the company financially and was great since long due changes were finally implemented."
"Sabre",",However, after a while, that impacted the moral, and job security feeling and the culture was changed to the worse in less than 3 years."
"Sabre",",The employees changed as well. Many of the management level (that knew in advance about the changes!!!) found smart ways to move on.. The laid off people got nice packages and the remaining were either new management, existing management that liked the new culture, and a lot of insecure and resentful people. "
"Sabre",",The fun coming to the office was limited as well as team work."
"Sabre",",Many company-sponsored events to encourage innovation.  Employees and contractors are dispersed all over the world -- Texas, Oklahoma, Poland, Uraguay, India, etc."
"Sabre",",Workers have great control over the software loaded on their company laptops, which means that you get to load your own software.  (For those with desktop skills, this is great!  For those with less desktop knowledge, support is available, but you will have to request/schedule it.)"
"Sabre",",People are generally friendly to newcomers."
"Sabre",",Took inbound calls and assist in making hotel reservations. Assist with errors in reservations. Not much else to say. Just easy job."
"Sabre",",I worked in Sabre for about 2 and half months and I have enjoyed every minute of it. I had to learn completely new technology called React JS. It was very challenging. There is not a single day, when I don’t learn anything new about the technology that I’m working on. Apart from technical knowledge and skills that I have gained while working here, I also got to know the work culture and how to work as a team. I am constantly being challenged to be a better developer, be inquisitive and innovative while keeping the ethics and values of the company intact. The job not only made me acquire new skills, but also made me a better professional. The job gives me exposure of meeting up with new people of different backgrounds, skills and talent which has made me a better person. I’m sure that I’ll be able to apply the knowledge and skills gained in all my future assignments, be it academic or professionally. It gave me confidence to handle other assignments successfully. The learning experience I gained here will help me even after I graduate"
"Sabre",",The people are very immature, even the supervisors they are not trained properly but overall it a good place to start off."
"Sabre",",Platform to use new and cutting edge technologies.Work culture was awesome.People were helpful and all you need to do is just ask.Compensation was great,in fact best among my batch (in Texas)."
"Sabre",",This Place is really good for beginners "
"Sabre",",Helps people to learn things "
"Sabre",",Co operative and team building is good "
"Sabre",",Work environment is really nice"
"Sabre",",No job security is the only problem. Work culture is good and managers were also great. Self organized small teams, space is cluttered"
"Sabre",",Sabre went from wholly owned subsidiary to a private entity.  When taken private, work morale went up because of modernization of the corporate culture."
"Sabre",",There are too many changes in the management in the last 2 years.  All the new managers want to change something, and sometimes it caused communication problems."
"Sabre",",Overall, working for the Sabre call center provided sufficient work experience. There were many issues with the software, which made tasks difficult at times."
"Sabre",",Individual ideas are given importance and if they see potential they go out of the way to help you implement the ideas."
"Sabre",",Fun atmosphere but work life balance takes a beating once in a while."
"Sabre",",Good work for interns I particulary liket it and i hope many will join. Less conversion rate to full times.Hope it changes in fututre. Good environment"
"Sabre",",Wonderful customers, peers and depth of expertise in travel.  A new grad can gain a wealth of global experience in the first few years on the job.  Now, the downside - The work days are long and the emails never stop.  Unfortunately, the leadership culture involves too many tactics and not enough focus on true strategy and growth."
"Sabre",",This place is very strange. On the outside it looks like this great company but once you are inside it's cut throat, there is no familiarization training, it's learn as you go.  One airline runs the AS side of things which leads to losing customers.  Performance reviews are based on heresay, the manager who you report to has little say, they go in front of a committee. If you are not in the cliques they won't know you and if they don't know you, your score will be low and you get no raise or profit sharing. "
"Sabre",",You are expected to work 14 hour days to accommodate that one airline, and other projects/customers go by the wayside.  You have to work on Sundays and holidays to accommodate THEIR lifestyle and religion.  You are thrown into things without training, with managers that are not trained and expected to do a stellar job.  Things are not good right now for Sabre, the pipeline of work is going to by dry after 1Q 2017.  Work from home depends on your manager. Some employees get permission to move to Florida and work remotely, and others have trouble getting a week to WFH because of personal issues. It's all about who you know not how much you can do."
"Sabre",",This is a terrible place to work.  They have a history of massive hirings and massive lay offs.  They don't care about their people."
"Sabre",",I worked the early morning shift. I learned a lot about travel agencies and cruise lines. You could work at your own pace within specific deadlines. Reduced costs traveling on American Airlines, especially for international travel."
"Sabre",",Surprisingly large technology company serving airlines and other travel suppliers. Slow-moving compared to more contemporary tech providers, but many opportunities to move to different roles."
"APPLECART","The team of people I worked with helped me to learn all new types of skills. My co-workers helped me to learn the ropes from new. It was almost always busy so could expect to be rushed off your feet."
"APPLECART",",A typical day at work depends on what shift id be working. If it was a 5:30am start id get to work for 5:15am get all my early jobs done (cash in tills, cash in ATM, make sure breakast buffet all set up plus much more) from 6.30am - 10:30am run the breakfast shift with 2 waitresses feeding over 100 people from the hotel next door. Once breakfast is finished clean down and get ready for lunch which starts at 11:30am. Do a kitchen check at 11am making sure all products are correct and labeled correctly, food is served from 11:30am til 10pm, the hardest part of the day would be between 6pm and 9pm when the restaurant is full and guests are wanting their food etc... I've learnt alot about customer service and how a restaurant should be run"
"Dexcom","Already completed a review and I have to say this company is a decent company to work for. You get a decent pay for a stressful amount of work but hey any job you choose has its ups and its downs. There is no reason to not consider this company."
"Dexcom",",They sell a great product!!!! Stand behind it. Certain managers need to get trained they need basic people skills and how to talk to fellow employees. Very diverse culture as far as staff.  You can work long hours and feel very fatigued. Enjoyable part is hearing how the product has impacted a patients life and changed someone life."
"Dexcom",",Rude management. No room for advancement. Very minimal work life balance. Micro Management. Poorly compensated for the amount of work that is expected to do, very poor. What the company does for their patients is great but what the company  does  for the employees is awful and it starts with management. Management needs training on how to treat their employees. There is a lot of favoritism and sometimes racism. If you want to move up in this company you better know someone on higher  upper management or know how to brown nose . Various have very minimal management experience and it looks like they are just putting this company together as they go. They do not know how to Value their employees all they care about is sell sell sell"
"Dexcom",",The way can never admit they need their employees. "
"Dexcom",", The salary that they have listed is a lie, that's only for the main positions."
"Dexcom",",This is a very dynamic and fun atmosphere to work in as they company is experiencing double digit growth! They have a dedicated and professional team of people who seem to really care about the product they make and the patients who benefit from it."
"Dexcom",",I have been working at Dexcom for almost two years now. Dexcom has opened doors for opportunities for employees with little or no experience. Training was on point. Great activities for employees. Compensation and benefits are exceptional. Fun workplace. People are friendly. Leaders are very approachable and they listen to employees' voices."
"Dexcom",",Great product, training is okay. You learn more on the job (as with most jobs). Goals are very high and depending on which territory you get and how that territory works will be heavily dependent on your pay."
"Dexcom",",good company continuously on the move but exciting.  always a fun day at work, just be on time and ready to work. I was an Operator1 loved it."
"Dexcom",",Rude management. No room for advancement. Very minimal work life balance. Micro Management. Poorly compensated for the amount of work that is expected to do, very poor."
"Dexcom",",Would not recommend"
"Dexcom",",You grow with company, Its a really fast paced environment and the people there are friendly but the expectations for you to catch up with the rest are too high."
"Dexcom",",This is my first job out of college, and I've learned a lot about both myself, and working for a big corporation. this job will teach you what is expected of you while following strict guidelines from the company. The co-workers there are helpful and friendly and open to any questions you may have, you get hands on training operating multiple sales programs and get to know vital information regarding diabetes and insurance guidelines and qualifications."
"Dexcom",",I helped Patients and their family's sleep better at night by simply setting up their mobile glucose monitoring system."
"Dexcom",",a very innovative company with excellent products. I learned a lot in reference to medical products and FDA requirements. working at Dexcom has been rewarding."
"Dexcom",",I loved working at DexCom, Their CGM is an unbelievable product and has saved many lives. If you look at the stock growth over the years clearly the public sees a future with this company. The management was easy to work for, everyone was driven and very type A so there weren't any issues with someone not doing their part. We were all so excited about the product and the growth that we were happy to be a part of it. Management was so encouraging and positive you wanted to do your best. My typical day was the same as most sales reps, I called on doctors, a few of the progressive doctors had heard about Dexcom and they were interested and excited. Most doctors had no idea what Dexcom was. I also taught Diabetes classes, started new patients on their Dexcom and provided education to health care providers. Both management and my co-workers were great, no complaints. The hardest part of the job was the same challenge most people have. We need more hours in the day. Which also leads me to my most enjoyable part of the job. I needed more hours in the day because I had the great product in my bag that was saving lives and doctors needed to know about it now! They needed to understand it and prescribe it for every type 1 patient out there. I would hear stories of specific patient's lives that were saved by using their Dexcom, that was definitely the most enjoyable part of my job. These stories also motivated me to make sure I could get to my doctors as quickly as possibly and help them to understand how life changing this product is. And they only have more to come in the future."
"Dexcom",",Life-saving product instills a sense of purpose in the work you do.  The Customer Service department is unfortunately all about the numbers, however, when seeking personal/professional growth, management is helpful in your development.  Promotes from within which makes it easy to advance your career.  The most enjoyable part of my time at Dexcom was the amazing people I worked with."
"Dexcom",",I was on call to provide guidence and leadership to a team that was new to Managed Care rebating.  Dexcom provided a great working environment."
"Dexcom",",awesome product! great place!"
"Dexcom",",we all care about our patients who come to rely on us!"
"Dexcom",",A typical day is a good amount of phone calls helping peoploe understand the use of their diabetic supplies all done with a smile in your voice"
"Dexcom",",I enjoyed working there immensely. I particularly appreciated their flexibility towards available schedules. I'm sorry it didn't work out."
"Dexcom",",The people are nice and decent and the company is fair. You will advance quickly if you stay. The company is growing and I advise you to really understand your new role and what you want."
"Dexcom",",There really isn't much to the technical part and troubleshooting is minimal. You do what the paperwork states and that's about it. Highly repetitive. If your looking to advance your computer career this is not the place. Don't come in thinking you will get it. You won't, unless you move to IT and everybody wants that job."
"Dexcom",",Everything is QA related. EVERYTHING. The FDA paperwork is suffocating and they will micro-manage everything you do. If you like QA this is the place for you. If you don't, stay far away.  I'm glad I left and I'm happy in my new role."
"Dexcom",",Don't get me wrong. Dexcom is a good company and the people are decent, it just wasn't right for me. It may be for you."
"Dexcom",",In my 3 years at Dexcom, the company underwent major expansion. The growing pains require employees to be flexible and open to constant change. My daily tasks included outbound calls to outside sales representatives, current and potential patients, doctor's offices, insurance companies and partnering distributors; educating patients on the product and process of obtaining it; gathering all necessary documentation required by insurance companies from the doctor's offices; obtaining authorization (if necessary) from insurance companies while maintaining guidelines; confirming orders with patients and ensuring successful delivery. On a management level, I felt that my coworkers and I could have been more successful with less involvement from supervisory teams. This was a struggle for all inside sales representatives collectively. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that the product I was selling would be saving the lives of many diabetics across the country, and at the very least, giving them the freedom and peace of mind to live a ""normal"" life. I also enjoyed my co-workers as many of us were recent college graduates early in our careers. Working at Dexcom taught me numerous sales skills that I am confident and eager to use moving forward."
"Dexcom",",Worked 50+ hours every week while other employees doing the same job only had to work 40 because the workload was so unevenly distributed.  Some of the customer ops managers were unwilling or unable to help due to inexperience or laziness.  Large organization, lots of cool people to work with.  Hardest part of the job were the nearly unattainable sales goals and the soul-crushingly long work hours."
"Dexcom",",A typical day at dexcom is basically like any other job you would go to, for example a clean room environment. Get suited up, check to see the progress of the group that work on your station, and carry on from then. In this type of work environment its plain and simple that you'll learn how to do things properly, fast and efficient. To me co-workers are just like me, come to work and only strive to do a better job. Some co-workers may be a handful but what can you do. Just focus on your job. Hardest part of the job would be nothing, because i've done more than this company. What i enjoy about the job is the consistency of work being finish. I like to see products being pushed through the assembly line without the thought of doing something wrong, and that pretty much is what i enjoy. Basically to get things done."
"Wind Creek Hospitality","Fun loving people who enjoy being there!  Everyone works hard yet enjoys what they do.  Culture is awesome.  They keep training you for more mobility within the company."
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",The Management is too Passive.  The Benefits are Great and so is the training Program. I would work here again if there were changes made to management."
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",I've been there three years and it continues to get worse and worse. Between management imposing new rules, that never apply to them, increasing demands that are impossible to meet and they are never happy with us. Employees are always treated like trash and reminded we are replaceable. Very little chance to advance, incentives to work there are at constant risk of being removed. Oh and if you're a vet, you're SOL. To them you're a ""ticking timebomb"""
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",a typical day at work i bring home about one hundred dollars a night . the most enjoyable part my job is seeing the people win jackpots some scream so loud"
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",Work in a casino atmosphere that has gambling, hospitality, hotel, drinking and smoking. The quality of the environment is not pleasing but is a good paying job for those in the industry."
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",If you have kids and a family you love, this isn't the company for you. You barely get raises, if they do give you one it's 30 cents . You only get one holiday off ( if you're lucky ) , they don't paid you for holidays if you work them like every other company in the world. The only way you can move up is if you kissing behinds . Management and H&R stick together so they treat their employees terrible and get away with it. The only good thing this company has to offer is the benefits. Other then that it's an daily headache each and every day ... Oh and I forgot management can take any holiday off or better yet any day they want off with no problem..."
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",make sure your ready to be fake if you wanna move up. People sleep in the closets and the other person gets blamed for everything. It's a ""who you know"" workplace or ""who you sleep with"" ."
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",- The company is a great company to work for but management needs to learn how to empower their employees. The co-workers helps the days seem like they are flying by."
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",Wind Creek Hospitality is a wonderful company to work for.  I've met wonderful people.  Competitive pay, excellent benefits.  I would encourage anyone to work for this compay."
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",I enjoyed working   but the smoke gave me migraines. I work the whole time I was there picking up behind customers and making sure they had clean environment  sit down at a machine. I made them feel like they were at home by meeting and greeting them"
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",The part of the job I enjoy the most is meeting all different types of people. I am able to engage in interesting conversations with many guests that enjoying spending time at Wind Creek."
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",Great place to work. The company is not as worried about labor as most stand alone dinning establishments which helps to ensure that we are as staffed as we can be on those busy nights. The management here is very understanding but they also have high expectations of their employees. Working here has taught me how large companies operate."
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",great benefits, lots of opportunity with the company, get to know people in other departments. must believe in team work in order to make this job successful."
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",Providing callers with the beginning of a wonderful experience at Wind Creek Resorts. Working on phones to help callers is the highlight of my workday."
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",Great benefits, good pay, quarterly bonuses, lots of PTO and fun place to work."
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",Recently, lots of petty rules have been set into place; thankfully it's nothing that's a huge problem... however, I do think the new rules will be reconsidered later on to improve employee moral and revenue."
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",Great place to work.  Enthusiastic commitment to the purpose.  Great opportunity for advancement.  Friendly work environment."
"Wind Creek Hospitality",",I enjoyed meeting new people which I was able to do every day. My bosses and co-workers were awesome. We were more than just employees we were a team and a lot like family."
"Viacom","I had a solid word environment at Viacom. I enjoy my fellow coworkers and the benefits supplied. I recommend for those interest in this company to apply."
"Viacom",",Employees are awesome, management can do better to support their teams.  The overall environment is positive and great to work in, building has events and special activities that liven the atmosphere of the workplace."
"Viacom",",Lots of opportunity to grow. They have a lot of people that have been with the company for 20 plus years. They hire internal candidates all the time and the culture has been the same there for years."
"Viacom",",1. Good work culture"
"Viacom",",2. Fun to work"
"Viacom",",3. Good learning"
"Viacom",",4. No compensation "
"Viacom",",5.Good people"
"Viacom",",6.Good team"
"Viacom",",7.Good boss"
"Viacom",",8.Learned managing team managing people"
"Viacom",",9. Got the chance to handle project independently"
"Viacom",",I learned so much here.  One can move ahead here rapidly if you are willing to put forth the effort.  A real opportunity to quick learn and apply new skills and launch your career or move elsewhere."
"Viacom",",The company is great as a whole. "
"Viacom",",Depending on the department the leadership styles of the managers will vary. "
"Viacom",",It is a well known global company to work for."
"Viacom",",Viacom has a great company culture. With some exceptions they do value their employees which is shown through various company events, initiatives, and perks. "
"Viacom",",Viacom does employee many freelancers and non-staff personnel in more than just traditionally creative roles. Those personnel do not receive any benefits or paid vacation leave. There is no set path to being staffed and those team members can be left in limbo for years. This model borders on illegality and is not a sound ethical business practice however it does allow many additional team members to be on board."
"Viacom",",Viacom & it's management treated me well during my tenure. They willingly advanced me,acknowledging my accomplishments through the years. The employee base is one that is willing to make the company great and will strive to meet company goals."
"Viacom",",Interning at Viacom my sophomore year of college was a dream come true! The environment is great - not too strict of a dress policy, everyone is very in touch with media, a wide range of ages across the employees which made for many learning/teaching opportunities, and there's always something fun going on! I learned a lot and felt that my work actually held value for the company."
"Viacom",",management is fickle  No consistency to policy procedures  Expectations are above the time allotted  no OT but expects all to be completed  Expects to cross over to other divisions with no training"
"Viacom",",Large company with a lot of room for advancement, I personally did not work with the company culture. I enjoyed my coworkers, but had a frustrating time working as a permalance employee."
"Viacom",",Viacom has the greatest employees.  I was blessed with the greatest co-workers.  We all worked together, helped each other, and always taught each other new technologies each week.  We supported each other goals and accomplishments..  The people make it a great place to work."
"Viacom",",This is a great company to work for however the pay is always less that what it should be for the position. It is very hard for employees to move up as the managing positions are usually hired from outside of the company."
"Viacom",",Working at Viacom was a fun experience.  I interned for my whole senior year a Comedy Central and Logo.  There were no entry level opportunities when I graduated college.  I worked with some great supervisors that cared about teaching the ins and outs of the business."
"Viacom",",During my time a Viacom there were pros and cons .My experience at Viacom with my co-workers was very positive. The work environment was great, the projects I worked on were very exciting and challenging. My team pushed me to really grow professionally. Management typically has a difficult time making decisions on just about everything. Expect little value on work/life balance.If management put more into their employees they would have better retention. A single ticket here or there does not make up for time lost while in the office."
"Viacom",",The glitz and glamour of Viacom's shows and markets are fun and energizing, and there can be some fun perquisites, but at senior management levels it is serious business."
"Viacom",",The benefits were good but the salaries are usually lower.  Great place to start your career in media but you must be willing to work very long hours and be flexible with constantly changing priorities.  I loved working at BET, many cool people and a fun working environment.  The people were extremely nice and I enjoyed going to work.  Always areas for growth and the managers were always helpful.  Very talent group of people, dedicated to creative work.  I learned so much and would do it again in a heartbeat! I think one of the best companies to work for to learn and grow."
"Viacom",",It used to be a great place to work but the creative culture has changed and lost some of its appeal lately. The benefits are still great but the salaries are usually lower."
"Viacom",",I love working here - such cool work environment. People are extremely nice and I crave to come to work everyday. Sky is the limit to growth and your managers are always helpful to help you grow. I think one of the best companies to work for to learn and grow"
"Viacom",",You can still get a free cup of coffee if you're ok with not having Starbucks.  Most people work here for years.  Some people grow while some stay in the same roles for years.  This place is what you make it but it's not as fun as it used to be I hear."
"Viacom",",Great place to start your career in media.  Must be willing to work very long hours and be flexible with constantly changing priorities."
"DataXu","Considering the tediousness of the job itself, one of the best things about working at DataXu was the work environment and the office culture.  There was an excellent sense of moral because of the hard work of the HR department.  And generally an enjoyable place to work.  There was a great deal of trust with the employees and the benefits and salary grades were incredibly generous.  With these two things, there was a great deal of incentive to be an excellent employee."
"DataXu",",Ok place to work - the people are helpful but the managers try to be strict.  the weekly lunches chosen by the lunch club are great.  It is located near south station which is a comfortable commute.  They have video games."
"DataXu",",A typical day: come in, make myself a latté with our freaking awesome Jura Impressa espesso machine, pull myself together for the scrum, then get to work. Free lunch on Fridays, beer and wine after 4:30 pm. XBox and PS3 come on at 5:00. There's also an AppleTV for movie nights."
"DataXu",",What I've learned: I'm STILL learning. This place really is on the bleeding edge. No one gets hired without completing at least one coding exercise, but even then, you'll probably feel lucky to have made it in. We're working with really BIG data. So big, Cloudera has their monthly user meetings HERE! The internal Wiki is truly awesome. Really love how much everyone uses it. If you can't find what you're looking for there, then you'll want to add it."
"DataXu",",Management: Much improved. Our CEO is super serious, but clearly listens. It took a few high-profile departures to get management's attention, but the new ""No Jerks"" policy has definitely improved things immensely for the rest of us (non-management types)."
"DataXu",",Co-workers: Beyond the technology, it's the people that make working here great. We do a lot of company events & parties (Halloween, Holiday, Super Bowl, Ice Cream, etc.) and outings, such as Kimball Farm or DataXu Cares (one a month community activity helping food banks, schools, prison book dispensaries, Cradles to Crayons, etc.), so there a weekly opportunities to meet and interact. Everyone here is super bright, with a lot of diversity in terms of backgrounds and age-ranges."
"DataXu",",Hardest part of the job: Honestly: Not thinking about it when I'm not here. This is probably more my problem than a company"
"DataXu",",  "
"DataXu",", problem--although I know a others who share it. I've had to make real efforts to not check email or think about my projects when I'm not ""working."" On the other hand, some of the challenges we're working on are just that exciting that it's hard to not let yourself get sucked in."
"DataXu",",The most enjoyable part of the job: Okay, now we're getting really subjective here, but in my case, beyond the perks (flex hours, cool people, free food, beer, espresso etc.) it's definitely about being able to work on a product that is doing incredible things and is definitely on it's way to even greater things (company's been growing 60% year-over-year since I started!)"
"DataXu",",  "
"DataXu",",Sometimes a fun place to work."
"DataXu",",My coworkers are my friends."
"DataXu",",Free lunch Fridays..yeah!"
"General Mills","working as a seasonal operator was tough, on a typical day you could be forced for overtime when you get ready to punch out to go home. good benefits if you got hired for permanent. hard to get into unless you know somebody on the inside"
"General Mills",",This job was my first job. we used package processed foods and we were working fast depending on the machines. It was a place I learned lots of things."
"General Mills",",While working in the warehouse I packed sealed and affixed labels to prepare materials for shipping"
"General Mills",",Delivered materials to departments"
"General Mills",",picked products and prepared them for shipping "
"General Mills",",loaded and unloaded trucks"
"General Mills",",using the forklift"
"General Mills",",It was always fun but fast paced"
"General Mills",",The company people only care about themselves and could care less about the union workers.  Can barely make a liveable wage unless willing to work 70-90 hours a week."
"General Mills",",I enjoyed working for general mills , I learned a lot and received very good training . It was very family like . Benefits were very generous ."
"General Mills",",Summer hours are a great peak to the culture and love the people I work with. "
"General Mills",",Great work life balance as you have the ability to work from home when needed."
"General Mills",",General Mills is creme de la creme if you want a grown-up job. Good pay, amazing benefits, incredible work/life balance, seemingly endless vacation days. The HQ office is really lavish and comfortable. "
"General Mills",",BUT this is not the place for a young creative. If you're looking to move and shake, you may need to reconsider. GMI puts business and numbers first, then communications/advertising on the bottom of the list. "
"General Mills",",If you take this job, you'll really round out your business savvy. You'll learn a lot about operating a business, sales, supply chain, and traditional marketing."
"General Mills",",I am proud to provide a beautiful campuse for employees as well as all visitors - I love my job!"
"General Mills",",Hard part of any outdoor job is heat and humidity in summer and extreme cold in winter.  Most enjoyable part of my job is being in nature everyday. I have rescued multiple families of ducklings stranded somewhere, have watched fox kits grow up, we monitor and maintain 10 wood duck nests."
"General Mills",",Enjoyed working at General Mills. Good people, efficient and hard working. They have a great campus. Staff is open and kind and promotes a strong work ethic."
"General Mills",",General Mills is a great place to work. During my time it suited my needs and now with family changes am looking for a more challenging opportunity in my career path."
"General Mills",",I loved my job at General Mills.. The people I worked with were the most awesome people I've ever worked with.  I learned everything I could possible to learn at General Mills.  So that I'll have more of an opportunity there.  The more you know.  The more they'll have a working spot for you.  That's how I recieved a permanent spot.  The hardest part of the job for me woiuld be missing work for any reason.  "
"General Mills",",The only thing that I don't like about General Mills is that they can permanently hire people.  They would'nt have as many problems that they have.  Far as keeping regular and consistant people."
"General Mills",",it was a very stressful place to work. they are not people persons at all. and they don't appreciate there employees at all. and all they think people do is work 24 7. no time to spend with family at all."
"General Mills",",Demanding hours. Continuously running for up to five weeks before a weekend clean out and fumigation. A lot of forced twelve hour days and six day work weeks. You can work a whole month straight if available and you are willing."
"General Mills",",it was a good work place, I learned more about cleaning, the management and co-workers was great and easy to get alone with, and at the end od the day I get to go home."
"General Mills",",Basic job duties and laid back work environment.  The chance for job advancement is pretty low, despite what the hiring manager says during the interview.  The team aspect of the job is very laid back, and often times members get away with not pulling their weight.  But the compensation is pretty good for a a straight forward job."
"General Mills",",This was a really good place to work. I worked in the HRIS area supporting multiple Power Builder applications for the various General Mills Departments. I enjoyed the co-workers and team out there."
"General Mills",",Truly a great place to work at. Everyone is very helpful. Does get boring at times but other then that it is wonderful. The one thing that irritated me was they wouldnt hire me cuz i was going to be gone for a month."
"General Mills",",I worked on a line and made excellent pay.  The people there were not friendly and I didn't learn a lot.  The breaks and lunch were right on time and never denied.  The down side is that you can get told to stay after your shift and you don't have a choice so if you have a family or other obligations then it's hard and stressful."
"General Mills",",Good job nice people just not enough money. Very easy work gotta know how to work at a fast pace and keep up with your task. 8 hour shift 30 min lunch 15 min break"
"General Mills",",Great company with great pay and good people . Management needs improvement .Breaks and lunch go for at least a half hour each . The safety culture has finally changed to where the employe is number one not production ."
"General Mills",",long hours, seven days with little to no time off. very strict not very flexible. I do not recommend working here if you have a family. Or have other things you find important."
"Invesco","Great company to work for. fast forward thinking and clients are very happy with Invesco's results."

"Invesco",",The downers Grove location is very nice and clean. Employees are always happy and willing to help. They make you feel home. there is no room for advancement"
"Invesco",",My department is being outsourced in the next few years, and with morale at an all time low, I am not interested in staying through the transition.  If not for the changes, I likely would not be applying elsewhere.  The culture is particularly appealing, as the people and upper management are a pleasure to work with."
"Invesco",",typical day: 8hrs with lunch...worked at desk"
"Invesco",",what I learned: ins and out of risk and change management processes"
"Invesco",",Management: great mentoring"

"Invesco",",Great opportunities for growth and learning. I would retire here if I could. Excellent benefits and they seem to really care about their employees."
"Invesco",",Due to poor management, there is not enough cross-training within the department, which makes it harder for some employees who have a heavier load."
"Invesco",",Great company and great people.  Good benefits, great work life balance.  Team oriented workplace environment the excels in collaboration"
"Invesco",",Proactively reach out to clients in assigned Territory to drive sales and meet/exceed goals."

"Invesco",",Colleagues- more entry level and not sharp to be able to learn from."
"Invesco",",Current management not supportive of upward mobility."

"Wunderman",",Great, stable company. Generally, managers are very flexible with schedules and time off for personal reasons (doctor, etc.). Working remotely is generally acceptable but can vary depending on your department and specific responsibilities."
"Wunderman",",Coworkers love to play and work is always delayed.  Many of the core systems crash multiple times a week.  Technical teams are extremely slow to respond.  Large gaps in age in the departments making it a struggle to communicate.  Most of the time blame is pushed over the fence and very hard to get things done.  Most of my day is spent fixing everyone else's issues making it difficult to move forward with my duties."
"Wunderman",",If you love to slack off, come to work late, and have others do your work, this is the place for you."
"Wunderman",",Was a nice place to work at first but went downhill as the job went on.  Was ready to move on by the time I left. Got a better job afterwards."
"Wunderman",",Wunderman chile is a very good place to work and learn, we work hard but we have very good time there! The people there is very nice and everybody is willing to teach the knowledge."
"Wunderman",",I truly enjoyed going to work every day and working for a manager that enjoyed that I took the reigns and got my job done.  The work was interesting and I had the opportunity to work with colleagues that still remain in my social network today."
"Wunderman",",Advertising is a fast-paced environment that can quickly change due to loss or win of accounts. Long hours and weekend work. Fun employee events."
"Wunderman",",A typical work is not a typical day.  Working in the CEO's office you need to be flexible and be able to deal with all types of requests.  Sorting emails, handling calls, getting briefs ready, making changes to the schedule, dealing with other C-level staff and their assistants, etc."
"Wunderman",",My day consists of supporting two high profile advertising executives. I manage an extremely heavy calendar for both executives. I communicate with current and potential clients via email. And monitor both my and both executives email accounts."
"Wunderman",",I have worked for the founder, which is the ""father of direct marketing"" since 2007 to present. He is not only a famous ad executive, but has an art collection at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. I have had the pleasure of being exposed to both the digital advertising and art world simultaneously. Therefore, manage both business and personal affairs for him."
"Wunderman",",In the past 28 working at Wunderman I was able to grow and train young talent for a career in Marketing."
"Wunderman",",Wunderman was a great place to work. It tested my ability to keep my nerves intact and how to play a good prank. For a mid-level move this is a great agency, but their lack of agility can be frustrating. This causes high turn over, under resourced departments, uncertainty with clients and management to put on a veil that freaks everyone out. All stated should be expected of a client that size, but I still believe they will evolve into a stronger agency."
"Wunderman",",Exciting and progressive ad agency!  Working with some of the best and biggest clients in the world."
"Wunderman",",Very busy as usual for agency life. Client is Best Buy and it is a very fun, social, innovative agency with an amazing staff who all works together as a team."
"Wunderman",",It is incredibly fast paced, especially in the first 3 months!  The people are great to work with although management seemed to overlook a lot of individual's hard work if they were not working on that project as well.  There is opportunity for huge accomplishment on the project/client/personal level, however management has many blind spots.  Work/life balance is promoted throughout the company but DOES NOT apply to project managers who, as an unspoken rule, are expected to work 45-70 hours a week without compensation."
"Wunderman",",Everyone says it's prudent to have agency experience under your belt, and Wunderman is a great place to cut your teeth. As with any agency, the company is chock full of innovation and creativity but unfortunately a lack of process and disonnect between global and local markets stifles that."
"Wunderman",",Overall, a decent place to put in a couple of years."
"Wunderman",",Excellent Boss, excellent team, excellent employees. Work everyday included serving IT needs."
"Wunderman",",Very ""cool"" marketing firm which doesn't seem to value its employees a whole lot"
"Wunderman",",When I first started there it was an amazing experience. I got to learn a lot of great things from some great people."
"Wunderman",",Great people, fast paced, exciting work. Sure there are challenges, just like with every company, but the environment, culture, people make it a great place to come to every day. I love coming to work everyday."
"Wunderman",",Fast pace enviroment with fun loving group of people. Ever changing, you will never get bored. Sometimes it is over welling, but there are always someone around to help out."
"Wunderman",",The people are what makes Wunderman an incredibly special place to work. Unfortunately, getting properly compensated for your time and effort can be a very slow process due to the huge corporate structure."
"IgnitionOne","This is a tough one. They no longer sell the tech I was hired to sell (DMP). The other divisions are solid with good support. Again, my whole group has dissolved, so not much to review."
"IgnitionOne",",This is a great company to work at for individuals who are fresh out of college as well as for individuals who are creative."
"IgnitionOne",",Unfortunately, I was let go for punctuality, however, the individual in charge of monitoring my punctuality couldn't accurately do so as he was hardly there on time himself. "
"IgnitionOne",",Other than that the positive feedback I received from literally everyone else was very encouraging and allowed for a positive and productive work environment. I was able to have free reign in investigating and procuring new ways to save money for the company and my opinions and thoughts were valued. The atmosphere was bright and healthy."
"IgnitionOne",",It was not a good work environment. About 16 of the people I used to work with have all moved on to other jobs because of the management or culture."
"IgnitionOne",",As an Intern during the summer of 2015, I was able to experience and talk with each department of the company to gain useful insight on the future of the digital marketing industry."
"IgnitionOne",",The people at IgnitionOne are very nice. They are like a big family. The environment is very comfortable and you won't feel pressure. It is a good place to improve your skills and personality. I LOVE that company."
"IgnitionOne",",This place has a great environment with food/drink perks all the time and great events, but it is a 6 day a week job on most cases and between the commute and long hours, it usually turns into a 14 hour day."
"IgnitionOne",",The culture at IgnitionOne is very fun and filled with amazing, hard-working and intelligent people. Management is another story."
"Liberty Mutual","Sales of Home, Auto, Life and specializing in Human Resources add-value of Group Savings Plan. Cold calling, prospecting, consulting."
"Liberty Mutual",",Liberty Mutual is an average place to work. There is some room for advancement however they have a highly political environment among management. Good place to work if you want to do your job and go home."
"Liberty Mutual",",Let's start off with all the amazing things about Liberty... First off, the pay is great, the benefits are amazing, they treat their employees wonderfully, and they invest in each and every person. They offer real development plans to help you get where you want to go within the company. You get monthly coaching along with monthly one on one meetings with your supervisor. In the claims customer care department, we got 3 team meetings per week, and it was always extremely clear what the expectations were and what was going on within the company."
"Liberty Mutual",",Now, for the less positive stuff. They have a very strict attendance policy, and if you have children that get sick or even if you get sick a lot, you may not last long. Not even doctor's notes will save you on this one. They also require you to work whatever schedule they have available when you're new and you won't know until about half way through training, so you could be working 6am-3pm, 10am-6pm, or potentially 5pm-1am if that is all they have available, or anything in between."
"Liberty Mutual",",The plus, once you have your foot in the door, there is always an opportunity to get a better schedule as they become available, and first pick is based on your stats. They do however offer great flexible options when available, like work from home schedules, 4x10s, and split shifts"
"Liberty Mutual",",I worked there for 10 years.  All 10 years we sold the local office and local service to our customers.  Then they decided to consolidate service into 5 locations and close down local service operations.  For 10 years, service felt like second class citizens.  Then the company proved that we are."
"Liberty Mutual",",The company has a very good work life balance.  The company has the same problems all other big companies have.  It is getting rid of its health benefit plan options and switching to a cdhp."
"Liberty Mutual",",I worked for Liberty for over 10 years.  Overall the benefits are far better than many companies out there.  Time off is great (although accrual based which can be difficult in the beginning), tuition reimbursement and bonus/merit structure is in line, if not better, than competitors.  Work load is heavy at times which can impact work/life balance.  Company is far more technologically advanced than many of their competitors.  Lean environment can be challenging with continuous changes however this reflects the company's dedication to staying competitive.  More and more flexibility in schedules being offered."
"Liberty Mutual",",At first I enjoyed working at Liberty, they offer different shifts, 5 day, 4 day work weeks, flex schedule etc. The metrics deffinitly take away from the overall experience of the phone call because your handle time must not be too long, your after call work must be brief and your Time off phone must be very limited. They discouraged you from grabbing a drink a water if not on your break. The biggest issue is work/life balance, if your sick, child is sick, you got a flat tire, family emergency, anything unplanned that causes you to be late or needing the day off you get a point. After a low amount of points, your let go. I feel if I have vacation time available I should be able to use it for what I need too and not be plenalized for not knowing I'd wake up to a flat tire."
"Liberty Mutual",",Great company to work for. Difficult to make business because most rates are higher than those at other companies. Fun atmosphere."
"Liberty Mutual",",Work/life balance is hard to maintain. Benefits are good and good vacation plan, but appears that most are overwhelmed with their positions. Good management."
"Liberty Mutual",",Great place to work and learn about insurance claims, processes and investigations.  The most enjoyable part of the job, is being rewarded for a job well done."
"Liberty Mutual",",They do not care about the life long employee.  The emphasis is now on youth and inexperience. Hire the less experienced for less pay. Toss the older more experienced employee aside."
"Liberty Mutual",",Liberty Mutual values its employees, and provides ample opportunity for advancement. The true professionalism of all the employees  makes it a great place to work."
"Liberty Mutual",",Very demanding from management. Not enough work balance. Customer service is number one priority. Loved helping people get back to normal life."
"Liberty Mutual",",Awesome coworkers"
"Liberty Mutual",",Great deal of scrutiny on every dollar that is spent, which is good for the bottom line but not so great for the employees.  All monetary benefits have been drastically cut in the last 5-10 years and have been replaced with non-monetary benefits like WFH and a lounge area in the Boston campus. "
"Liberty Mutual",",Lots of layoffs in 2016."
"Liberty Mutual",",The company provides unlimited learning potential and abundance of smart capable co workers who are specialized and knowledgeable."
"Liberty Mutual",",Excellent company culture and great place to work. I enjoy work there with my co-worker. And my boss is so nice that I am willing to work there again."
"Liberty Mutual",",This is a large company with many opportunities. My department was outsourced. So any data my work environment would not be helpful. Overall, this is great company to work for with many opportunities in education, advancement and relocation. There pay scale is excellent Until my department was outsourced, this was the best job I have ever had."
"Liberty Mutual",",Great job but offers no flexibility for work/life balance . Management team is good but not empathetic. Hours do niit work for family people with young kids."
"Liberty Mutual",",maintaining a healthy work life balance is a significant concern for employees."
"Liberty Mutual",",The company does a good job at developing talent and employees are able to move up the ranks."
"Liberty Mutual",",By far one of the worst jobs I've ever had.  On the phones all day taking calls. It was impossible to handle your own claims and meet state regulations. Customers were always complaining they never heard from their adjuster. The main focus of management was how many calls you took and quality of inbound calls. You are working as a call center representative not as an Auto claims adjuster."
"Liberty Mutual",",A typical day at work was coming in and giving 110%. I take pride is my work, and I am very passionate about completing and meeting my goals."
"COUPANG","Great place to work! Really flexible timings, amazing ping pong competitions, have the best co-workers and management is very amiable."
"COUPANG",",Best part.... Catered lunches! Great on a busy day because you don't have to worry about going somewhere or making your lunch in the mornings!"
"COUPANG",",work was easy going, not too much to complain about. it was come to work and leave within a few hours. due to it being a smaller job as in; it hasn't be up for more than a year, made it pretty simple. with only a few coworkers in the department, a normal day was come thru the gates, set all your belongings in the lockers, clock in, attend the daily meeting, the get to work for the next 8 hours."
"COUPANG",",One of the best companies I've ever worked for. The  benefits were great. work was plentiful. management was awesome and a nice clean and safe place to work."
"Connecticut College","I have worked in three different divisions of the college over the past 15 years and have marveled at the evolution of the college services and opportunities."
"Connecticut College",",Wonderful staff, management and co-workers that are like family to me.  "
"Connecticut College",",I intend to move permanently to our home in Murrells Inlet, SC around the end of June 2015."
"Connecticut College",",I had an internship at the college.  My mentors were wonderful, however, the internship was not for someone who wanted a lot of social contact.  I performed my tasks without much human contact.  I believe that this was the hardest part of the internship...being quiet all day.  The internship did not lead to any work opportunities."
"Connecticut College",",I managed Palmer Auditorium, the Martha Myers / East Studio, Evans Hall and Tansill Theater."
"Connecticut College",",I taught Dance and Theater Production and Design."
"Connecticut College",",Patience"
"Connecticut College",",My managers were good to work with."
"Connecticut College",",My Co-workers and Student workers were always pleasure to work with"
"Connecticut College",",The hardest part of the job was to juggle many things at once but that also made the job enjoyable."
"Connecticut College",",Good management, great pay, great co-workers, you are always doing something different. Great environment, everyone makes you feel welcome and is very helpful if you have any questions. After working full-time for a year you can go to the college for free i believe."
"Connecticut College",",I absolutely loved this job and the people that I worked for.  Having worked here over 12 years I can honestly say that this was the best job I have ever had.  Great environment, people, atmosphere and overall place to work."
"Connecticut College",",Terrific and supportive atmosphere in which to work."
"Connecticut College",",Great students, articulate and involved classes."
"Connecticut College",",This was a great job in a great location.  New London is a beautiful town on the shore of Long Island Sound."
"Noble Energy","Difficult but great experience. As the CEO i have learned a lot operating a new business. Learned various sales and management skills"
"Noble Energy",",Good place to work, but not much room to grow in IT. Great for gaining work experience, but not all that great to advance your career."
"Noble Energy",",Complete disorganization everywhere you look and people are constantly changing groups (sometimes forced). The advancement opportunities are based on politics and not achievement. No pay increases for advancement opportunities. Data is a complete mess, their focus is to look good (in the community) other than doing good (as in work, innovations, optimizations, etc). After years of working there I still felt like everyone was either miserable there or just didn't really care, no one truly enjoyed their work"
"Noble Energy",",It is a perfect place if you want to be an underachiever and leave work whenever you want because no one holds you to a standard. Good work/life balance in that respect"
"Noble Energy",",Downtown Denver is nice during the Summer. People working there were uneducated except one. I spent lots of time and effort to get an education. Others did not. Pay was too low!"
"Noble Energy",",This is a good company to work with as long as there is a project. Love working with the people and the VP, managers, and other engineers."
"Noble Energy",",Very quite environment, helpful people, nice and awesome VP."
"Noble Energy",",Great place, incredible people. It is a true school for anything related to business. Came in as a new employee, learned and left there as a veteran in oil and gas."
"Noble Energy",",Good working environment, smart and friendly co-workers. Results oriented, however due to rapid growth of the company, planning of projects suffered."
"Noble Energy",",Overall the company is a pleasure to work for. Great company culture and transparent management."
"Noble Energy",",Working in the oil and gas industry at this point leads to less stability in the work environment, but if you can make it through to a rebound it'll be worth it."
"Noble Energy",",Very nice people and environment with many different people, in many different departments. Makes working here very interesting but useful.  Job duties are basic to the needs at hand for what ever project your working on and of course, making that project successful.  And again - my co-workers become family friends that i will maintain these relationships inside and out."
"Noble Energy",",good work load balance"
"Noble Energy",",manager good"
"Noble Energy",",some lack of communication"
"Noble Energy",",good co workers"
"Noble Energy",",hardest part, getting timely decisions"
"Noble Energy",",they well train new hires.  make all employees feel appreciated. fair and reasonable compunction. works well with matters of family/children.  Organized clean friendly. wonderful customer service"
"Noble Energy",",Working for Noble Energy was probably one of the best working experiences I have had. The culture in IT was fantastic, the people I had the opportunity work with were excellent at their jobs. If the price of Oil hadn't plummeted I would have loved an opportunity to work there."
"Noble Energy",",A quality organization that works hard to work in an ethical manner.  Great workplace environment.  They take great care of their employees."
"Noble Energy",",I was hired as a temp for basic clerical duties and record keeping for their accounting department while the corporation was in the process of digitizing it's files. "
"Noble Energy",",Despite my temporary status I was able to work for the company for 2 years and they tried to give me an advancement opportunity by turning me over to data entry.   "
"Noble Energy",",I enjoyed working for them and they gave holiday bonuses as well as year end bonuses even to a temp."
"Noble Energy",",There are two distinct classes - contractors and employees. It seems that who you know gets you more job recognition and opportunity than what you know. Social connections count more than job skills and experience do, so if you're on the ""inside"" and fit in with the social culture, you'll do ok. If you don't, you'll be discounted, no matter what you do. Hiring and promotions that I saw were based on social connections instead of quality of the person's work. It may be different in other departments, but that was my experience working there."
"Noble Energy",",Good place to work if you have job security. Management lacks involvement with your daily activities. Work is delegated and ignored unless you're in a critical position. I received very little to do."
"Noble Energy",",Terrible place to work for.  The culture is toxic.  The management goes out of their way to try and get people to quit by excluding people from meetings, making information deliberately concealing information and neglecting to answer emails."
"Noble Energy",",This job was different everyday, I loved that challenge it gave the everyday experience. The laid back atmosphere, and how they were flexible with life and job was appreciated."
"Noble Energy",",Excellent place to work. Management very helpful in daily operations. Safety was number one on our daily work schedule. Great locations."
"Noble Energy",",All management needs to be more involved with the day to day on-goings of the organization. There also needs to be transparency when the company is not performing to minimum goal requirements."
"Noble Energy",",Company that will allow you to learn your job.  Benefits are great with excellent medical, dental, and vision.  Wonderful vacation policy."
"Stanford University","My typical day working was doing administrative tasks. Assisted in managing spreadsheets, creating property control inventory records, filing, and much more. Management was ok.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the cafeteria.  Also, working with a bunch of Physicists. These people were absolutely Brilliant.    My boss was an 80 something-year-old Nobel Prize Winner Physicist. He was very friendly."
"Stanford University",",Enjoy working with students and Co workers. and Good Benefits, always there are many opportunities for advancement, very nice people both Co workers and Students,"
"Stanford University",",Stanford is a great place to work as a postdoc. "
"Stanford University",",Although the cost of living is kinda insane in Bay area, Stanford provide better salaries than other universities. "
"Stanford University",",Stanford also provides great resources and platform for postdocs to conduct top-tier research and encourages collaborations."
"Stanford University",",Working at Stanford is more like adjusting to the culture.  Everyone is very smart and kind to interact with.  It really depends on what your job entails?  Best part of working if you're full time is the free access to public transportation.  Since this is a progressive campus, they don't support people commuting to work via car."
"Stanford University",",There are so many interesting departments and programs to work for at Stanford; each of which, have very different cultures. Stanford offers fantastic benefits including, medical, dental, wellness incentives, free public transportation and tuition reimbursements. Stanford does have a reputation for low salaries and difficulty with promotions and advancement. Also, it can be very difficult to find good managers that care about your development and want to see you grow. Administrative roles tend to be a very invisible job. Stanford on your resume, it is very easy to always have a career with Stanford."
"Stanford University",",Working for the University of Medicine at Stanford has been such a great experience because of the professional employees, advanced technology, and friendly atmosphere. A typical day at work is very busy and exciting because everyone is happy to be there because they enjoy what they do. I learned time management and how to communicate more efficiently with patients. The management that I have been involved with is very professional, organized, and they respond promptly. My co-workers are great because we all work hard together and help each other out when needed. The hardest part of my job is when I have to inform people of information that is hard for them to hear. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing people satisfied with their care and educating people about their health."
"Stanford University",",Overall, Stanford is a great place to work as far as stability and a steady paycheck, not to mention the wonderful benefits the University offers to staff. From experience in two positions at Stanford, growth and advancement was not offered to me in two different departments. Speaking with others throughout campus, it appears that this is somewhat accepted as the 'culture' for certain positions at Stanford. "
"Stanford University",",My co-workers were all in all a great group of people. Most of them are close friends now."
"Stanford University",",collegial, friendly, interesting technology, always able to work remotely when needed, minor issue: some ""looting"" of staff from one project for another, so planning is disrupted"
"Stanford University",",Working for SLAC was one of the best jobs I have ever had, they offer great benefits, a great work environment to learn and grow. The experience will last a life time and follow me everywhere."
"Stanford University",",The most enjoyable part of the job is when a patient walks out of the hospital or clinic feeling that we have done everything possible to answer all their questions and  they leave feeling more knowledgeable"
"Stanford University",",about their condition and feeling secure."
"Stanford University",",I value my work experience at Stanford. I had good co-workers and some interesting projects. However the politics are brutal. People who have worked there for decades run the show and suppress new ideas and a faster pace. Opportunities for advancement are non-existent, even for someone like me who receives raises and bonuses every year. I think it's a good place to gain experience and then to move to a company that values and rewards employee contributions and innovations."
"Stanford University",",I enjoyed my coursework.  Some courses better than others-depends on who teaches them.  I will consider taking courses there again in the future.  Especially if someone else pays for them."
"Stanford University",",Working for Stanford was a great experience; I learned a lot with the hospital billing systems that we used in patient's clinic and hospital visits; Our Team Leaders; co-workers and higher management were great; Trying to achieve what Stanford stands for is always hard but through hard work and dedication it was a great experience;  At this great farm I witnessed that the holiday and Christmas seasons always brought us together as the most enjoyable part at our Stanford family"
"Stanford University",",Stanford is an amazing place.  They provide good compensation, benefits, work life balance, growth, and you get to work with some amazing staff and faculty."
"Stanford University",",I would recommended Stanford to anyone.  Cost of living though is quite high."
"Stanford University",",Was a resident assistant in the dorms during summer quarter.  Had flexible hours, but demanding when on the clock.  Co-workers and supervisors were great."
"Stanford University",",I've worked here for a few years. It's truly is a a great place to work and learn. A small team setting makes it challenging for me since you have to start building things from the ground up. You'll get a lot of support and can follow the direction that you wish to pursue."
"Stanford University",",They provide many materials to make art projects possible for the children the environment is very controlled so things don't get out of hand, and the co workers are very nice"
"Stanford University",",Stanford can be a wonderful place to work depending on the work environment in your division. It is a large organization but there is little interaction with peers in other divisions and little room for career advancement. Working in an understaffed department leads to burnout."
"Stanford University",",Enjoyable envireoment. Learning room to grow in a comapny to suceed. Training provided. Productive. Enjoyable temporary job I had"
"Stanford University",",We like to stay productive to keep a good flow with the food that is coming in and out. It is very outgoing and everyone pretty much gets along with each other. We mainly go there to work, but at the same time some of us get excited to see on another."
"Stanford University",",Worked by myself filing donor information at Encina Hall for Stanford's Development Office.  Management and co-workers were helpful in teaching me what I needed to know.  Culture was good.  I enjoyed having a large pile of filing and getting it filed efficiently and correctly.  The most difficult was having an overwhelmingly large pile of filing that I had to file in a short deadline.  I was able to meet my deadlines."
"Proofpoint","Proofpoint has a phenomenal product set and is better than anyone in the industry.  I was glad to have the opportunity to help businesses protect themselves against the #1 threat vector, email."
"Proofpoint",",Ghostery could be better at giving sales people autonomy, and have crossed the line of cool start up to more corporate.  However, the people I worked with were amazing, and I know they all will do extremely well."
"Proofpoint",",Good place to work if you're an entry level employee or low level management.  Company is extremely frugal with tight controls over spending to the point where areas of the business are starved for investment.  IT Department is extremely weak and it is difficult to get things done."
"Proofpoint",",I answered all incoming e-mails and helped with everything asked of me, including working long hours and being flexible. I entered deal packets for computer software and submitted them to sales reps supervisors."
"Proofpoint",",Great place to work,fun,fast paced and room for growth. This company will pay for certifications. Great challenges and great people to work with."
"Proofpoint",",Love proofpoint, not only does this company have the best product in their market, but pay is solid,  work life balance is awesome with an unlimited vacation policy. Lots of autonomy, just hit your numbers and no one bothers you. I gave them only 3 stars for comp/benis because there is no 401k match or profit sharing. They do a great job with strategic marketing and focused efforts to develop business. Love the execs, Gary Steele CEO is very personable and approachable."
"Proofpoint",",Poor training, sterile environment, poor energy within organization. Do your homework before coming here, that is what I learned from this experience."
"Fujitsu","Good learning place to be in but no balance between personal and professional life. Management is good but sets up very high targets and project estimates are very aggressive which imbalances the personal and professional life."
"Fujitsu",",Became part of Fujitsu as part of them acquiring DMR Consulting. DMR had limited clientele in consulting business and limited vision for expansion and no room for growth."
"Fujitsu",",Worked help desk support for management teams in certain department stores using ServiceNow. Would not recommend it for work not reliable on hours"
"Fujitsu",",Benefits are not good, micromanagement takes away from what should be a smooth easy going job."
"Fujitsu",",Going permanent is extremely hard, some have worked for them under contract for more than 3 years and still have not gone perm."
"Fujitsu",",Fujitsu is a diverse enterprise. It has companies and subsidiaries worldwide.  The span of products and services run the spectrum."
"Fujitsu",",I very much enjoyed working with all my coworkers and continue to maintain friendships within the company."
"Fujitsu",",I advise any technician who is looking to grow with a company to NOT work for Fujitsu America.  They make the work environment difficult, they provide no bonuses or pay raises for hard work, and I believe they practice unlawful practices when it comes to overtime."
"Fujitsu",",Since starting with Fujitsu in 2011 I have thoroughly enjoyed working with all the team. There is a varied skill set and everyone pulls together to help."
"Fujitsu",",As a team lead, I am in touch with many facets of our team role."
"Fujitsu",",We handle everything from hardware intake through the life cycle of the pc, back out to scrub and reallocation."
"Fujitsu",",Feel free to ask me for more information as needed."
"Fujitsu",",Great place need more work, good chance to better skill set Assignments are always different and a great change of pace."
"Fujitsu",",A wide range of skill are needed to here."
"Fujitsu",",I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the people I worked for while at Fujitsu. this is all I would like to say about Fujitsu at this time so I am just filling in stuff to meet the minimum character count requirement."
"Fujitsu",",Fujitsu is a great place to work. Work/Life balance is fair and lots of perks! On-site gym and cafeteria. The campus is beautiful. Programs in place for transparent communication for all levels of management."
"Fujitsu",",Worked from home , I would check emai around 7:30 am  for any new updates, contact my Sales Execs that I supported. Contact any customer that  may have problems or questions. I would check with the guys on my team to see if I could be of any help to them."
"Fujitsu",",The hardest part of my job, was sometimes I would have to tell the customer No, I all ways wanted to give them what it was they asked for."
"Fujitsu",",The most enjoyable part of my jobs was meeting the customer needs"
"Fujitsu",",Management doesn't have a clue on how to run a Consulting Practice.  No advancement unless you are Indian.  Good benefits."
"Fujitsu",",In 18 months managers changed 3 times. Constant turnover. Constant reorgs. People were fine but the processes and organization were incomplete and not tied together."
"Fujitsu",",worked there for 5+ years : very little communication with management, they ask for feed back on task/calls but ignore all emails/ face to face talks, only way you get paid more is by taking more calls, very small to no advancement. management knowledge is questionable, most agents have more knowledge than management. there is a buddy system going on with management they will never mark each other absent or question each other on anything, they rather have the agents take the fault."

There are certain areas within Salesforce that are much better than others (R&D/product side of the house, HR, etc) seem to be run very well, care about their employees and have great career development in place.  IT, has the same benefits, but lacks both the career growth/development opportunities, and positive management.  I'd suggest if you are considering Salesforce and are technical go to R&D and steer clear of IT.  Otherwise, loved the culture and environment."

There is always something that need immediate attention.This is what I like about Working for the University of Chicago.

I was very pleased with the relationship my co-workers and I established and that was we always worked in our solution as team players. The most challenging part of my job was working with heads of departments and programs but being the level headed and diplomatic individual I am this only grew my people skills.

They were very strict on meeting deadlines and being under budget, which is completely understandable when dealing with contracts. But it can however make for a very stressful work environment."
"Applied Research Associates, Inc",",My co-workers were very knowledgeable and came from a variety of backgrounds and schools/degrees. It was not unheard of for an engineer to work with a physics major. It made for very interesting group dynamics, but also made it easier to generating new concepts by having people from different backgrounds."
"Applied Research Associates, Inc",",The hardest part of the job was generating the white papers and lab reports while still meeting the, usually, tight deadlines."

The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing job satisfaction that they were ready and that I made that happen."

Most of our work involves research to find out how to get better results by going through a lot of papers and articles. We are guided by my adviser and Post-Doc who mention our goals and assist us in understanding our experiments better. The hardest part is getting the machine to work properly as it gives trouble from time to time while the fun part is the freedom we are offered. We can conduct experiments with our own ideas provided they are feasible. This has helped us gain a lot by means f trial and error."

"Applied Research Associates, Inc",",9-5 job. Great work environment and great people to work with. "
"Applied Research Associates, Inc",",Outstanding to work for. Great support form all levels of management and branches of the company. As a contractor, I am at a remote site, and have never actually met my supervisors face-to-face, but have any support if needed. They leave you alone to perform your job, and the review/ratings for promotion/pay increase is very fair! As a recently seperated veteran, this company was an easy transition to make. But- with all DoD contracting firms, job security is only as good as the politicians and the needs of the military. No fault of the company- but I got my sequester notice.

Wildly successful - consistently profitable with $300MM in GM in 2015 - the company is only 8 years old and still discovering all of its potential.

I came out of my internship learning a lot about the company, the real estate industry as a whole, and the basics of financial modeling and financial forecasting. Everyone was very encouraging and helpful, yet everyone was determined to do the best job they could on their respective projects. The management team is filled with some of the most brilliant and visionary people I've met, and my boss was a fantastic mentor, teacher, and guide."

"Vanguard",",Support offered for pursuing CFA, CFP, and MBA designations. Managers who care about your personal development. Great benefits, ability to purchase additional paid time off, paternal leave offered."
"Vanguard",",Managers are typically young, inexperienced and unqualified to develop and lead their crew.  Crew members are constantly being ""coached"" to meet the behavior or metric of the month.  At year-end, crew are ranked and rated against their peers; consequently, if you do not drink the koolaid, be prepared for a poor performance rating, no merit increase, no bonus and start looking for your next opportunity!  Vanguard has long touted the fact, that despite the many recessions over the years, it has never laid off any employees - Google ""managed out"" and draw your own conclusions.  In addition to the practice of managing crew out, there is a well kept secret  of late, at least internally, and that is that Vanguard recently published its first ever Severance Plan; needless to say, layoffs have begun and the process of offshoring jobs is also underway.  If you chose to start your career at Vanguard, the place will break your spirit if you stay too long, so don't."

"Vanguard",",This company is such a cult, senior management often reference ""drinking the koolaid."" They're not joking. The amount of discrimination is astounding!"
"Vanguard",",Vanguard was a place for learning. Vanguard, by any means is not a place of advancement. Or a place to work of long duration. The work conditions are terrible and never change.

"MLB Advanced Media","I learned a great deal while working at MLB. They have so many departments and it has helped me get interviews and job offers from what i have learned here."
"MLB Advanced Media",",Whatever is thrown at me, plus my standard duties. We tend to wear a few hats, which has given me the opportunity and experience to touch a few different areas outside of my role."
"MLB Advanced Media",",A dream job. Work for a professional team. catch some rays in your off time. enjoy life with this careers benefits. Free meals. health insurance, Life insurance, vision insurance, college funds. 5 star rating in my opinion"
"MLB Advanced Media",",."
"MLB Advanced Media",",You get to work independently on a relaxed environment.  Colleagues, co-workers and management work like a team to make sure the job gets done."
"MLB Advanced Media",",The only drawback, however, is the pay and room for growth.  The pay is dependent upon the workload and there is not enough work to go around.  Also, due to the freelance status, there is no job security or room for growth."
"MLB Advanced Media",",I worked there eight years and did not advance to ""bigger and better"" things.  When this type of situation occurs, it can be tough to enjoy your job."
"MLB Advanced Media",",Love the team that I work with. Management is amazing!! Have learned a lot about Team managing since being here. Hardest part of my job is not knowing when the day ends."
"MLB Advanced Media",",It was fun while the season lasted. You get to watch MLB games. However as other reviewers have said for part time workers, there is no room for growth, you get no breaks no matter how long your work day is. Hours varied each week depending on the schedule, so there was no set schedule. No extra pay for working holidays. After the season, they say thank you, and that's that. "
"MLB Advanced Media",",And as a warning,  they have very strict policies,  particularly with arrival time and social media. So arrive Early Every Day, and don't blabber on social media that you work for them and what your role is."
"MLB Advanced Media",",The environment itself was delightful to work in due to the people that were pretty much always willing to help even if it wasn't in their job description.  That part of coming into work made it enjoyable to participate in the day to day activities.  As for the actual job duties, I found it to be unfulfilling and virtually all menial with no prospects of growth or advancement.  The tasks became tedious, predictable, and there were many instances of down time.  And even as I was trying to find things to do from my manager I didn't feel like I was being utilized to my fullest potential.  I would ask many times if there was anything I could do to help around the building, but was told that there was nothing I could do to contribute to the process or development.  So as a result I would just return to the perfunctory duties that did nothing for growth and development.  There was little to no variety in what I did each day and challenges were few and far between."
"MLB Advanced Media",",They would rather save $.50 per hour and have a much worse employee doing the work. They will lie to get people to work on holidays."
"MLB Advanced Media",",First few weeks of this job, its okay IMO. Its a big company so you'll most likely meet people in your own dept so if kind of clique-ish. I work overnight so I dont really know to much people outside of the overnight crew. The hardest part is sometimes it can get boring especially during overnight and if you're part time you get no benefits which kind of sucks, but the good thing is part-time gets paid hourly and most times you will have full time hours which equals overtime something full time dont have (silver lining)."
"MLB Advanced Media",",Live Look-In Operator and Production Assistant. Duties included editing incoming video content for immediate use on MLB.com, including highlight reels and melts, as well as enabling the ""Live Look-In"" window on MLB.com (running parallel with Yahoo Sports internet streamed baseball highlight show ""Full Count"")."
"MLB Advanced Media",",Started out as a good job but quickly I learned it's a horrible place to work. Long hours, no breaks, no appreciation. I'm sure they break about a dozen labor laws. Grossly underpaid for the job that's done. Has a holiday party that only a small percentage of the workforce is allowed to attend. I'd only apply here is it was a job right out of college. Use to to build your resume and get out quick."
"MLB Advanced Media",",It's a great place to get started in sports media. A long baseball season and expansive resources are a pro."
"MLB Advanced Media",",I love working here. In many aspects, the company covers both extremes of the spectrum. It's a very relaxed atmosphere, even though we all know it is important to the fans out there that we deliver the media without any hiccups. So, it is fast paced when necessary."
"MLB Advanced Media",",The best part about my job is stepping into something new everyday, troubleshooting and feeling like you're not at work when you are."
"MLB Advanced Media",",MLB itself is a great company, but the Media jobs leave a lot to be desired. Rough hours, poor pay, not really valued or respected. Not great job security once the season is over, likely to get laid off."
"MLB Advanced Media",",Co-workers who are in your same role are nice, but the superiors act superior, and don't show any effort to interact with or respect you."
"MLB Advanced Media",",Amazing company and great environment to work at. Everyday I learned something new."
"MLB Advanced Media",",Overworked, underpaid, not respected, a lot of egos, very little chance of advancement, almost zero perks."

"UC Davis Health System",",Great company to work for because of the amazing benefits and pay. The training is all over the place. If you like being stressed out this is a perfect job."
"UC Davis Health System",",A typical work day starts with a huddle. Management likes to go over safety regulations and procedure we need to practice.Than we follow up with our assigned areas for the day. We than begin to set up our carts and head to start our first assignment. The toughest part of the job is performing to many calls at once and trying to get to them as quickly as possible. "
"UC Davis Health System",",The enjoyable part is being able to know what i do makes a difference for patients."
"UC Davis Health System",",I rotated through a variety of departments and found every one to hold the highest standards of quality and patient care. Management and staff were friendly and knowledgeable,The hardest part of the job was seeing people in the ICU wards and pulling methadone syringes for abandoned babies that were born drug addicted. The most enjoyable part was working in the clean room and satellite pharmacy."

"UC Davis Health System",",The staff is great to work with and the benefits are excellent and the pay is decent. I don't like that employees have to pay for parking and have to park far from work place with no security. No fun events occur where all of the staff can  participate together."
"UC Davis Health System",",I enjoyed working with my co-workers they are team players and loved helping the patients out in anyway possible. Also would assist patients with their further appointments and explaining the procedure if needed."
"UC Davis Health System",",The management was horrible. They were unapproachable, rude, and was always busy with their own work. There was not enough assistance and training available."
"UC Davis Health System",",UCDHS is a good place to work with competitive benefits. Managers are approachable and open to suggestion and with a team building atmosphere. Growth within the organization can be difficult depending on your field but training and development is available as a resource and highly encouraged."
"UC Davis Health System",",Long time employees whose work ethic and culture are very similar to those who work at the DMV; including the management here. Many employees have been here for several years and some even up to 35 years and are outright scary. "
"UC Davis Health System",",I expected a higher caliber of employee. Because this  institutional learning system is on the cutting edge of healthcare and medicine, I really anticipated so much more and was extremely disappointed. I've had multiple conversations with fairly new employees (two years or less) who, independent of each other, have all reaffirmed what I've experienced there; rude, lazy, ill mannered employees  with very little structure who are a reflection of the managers that are supposed to be holding them accountable but are so lazy they barely show up to actually work half the time. "
"UC Davis Health System",",This is a union environment which, in the state of California, there really is no need for unions. There are so many state laws that protect employees.  Coworkers were calling in for sick leave, FMLA's, Kin Care, late  excessively and everything under the sun."
"UC Davis Health System",",I worked for UCD as a temp loved working there. I checked in patients answers phone calls and checking elig. The hardest part of the job is seeing ASL patients every first Friday's of the month. I enjoyed seeing patient smile when they leave"
"UC Davis Health System",",I believe in the culture of the UC Health System management could put their training to a more effective use. I work with a very good bunch of people, my work day is not overly challenging, I enjoy my assignments because it allows me to work on an indenpent base. i've learn over the years of working here that your quality of work is as important as your quantity"

"UC Davis Health System",",I cannot say anything bad at all. Not even on a bad day. I enjoyed my co-workers, Superiors, structure, benefits, pay and the purpose they served. I worked in the best department for the best team EVER! Patient Financial Services Medicare Department. I wish I never had to make the choice to leave. I would love to go back. Best place I have ever worked for hands down."
"UC Davis Health System",",Fun work place with great benefits. Not all about getting patients in and out, but how they feel when they leave.

"RIVERSIDE RESEARCH","Typical software development company. Management is good. Co-workers are good. Hardest part of the job - management communication could be more effective."
"RIVERSIDE RESEARCH",",Any typical day at work would be to accomplish any assigned task meeting the customer's satisfaction and or mission need.  I expect management to take care of the majority of office functions allowing me to perform the mission activities.  I work well with co-workers or completely solo.  The hardest part of any job is to perform without having a clear direction from management of what their expectations are.  The most enjoyable part of any job is the satisfaction knowing you performed well and met the customers needs."
"RIVERSIDE RESEARCH",",Great place to work with lots of benefits until they got hit with what the rest of the 'for profit' industry has been hit with, budget cuts."
"RIVERSIDE RESEARCH",",It is likely that with proper management decision making and effort things will rebound readily and more work will become available."
"RIVERSIDE RESEARCH",",Excellent co-workers and atmosphere.  Management needs to take a more active role in getting requirements from the customer to those responsible for delivering the work."
"RIVERSIDE RESEARCH",",Before starting my internship I was aware that there was no guarantee of a permanent position. The job environment was very nice and relaxed. Management was very effective and encouraged further education in area of study. The only downside is that they will invest in interns but not really consider hiring them as a permanent employee however they are very large and very well respected and will look great on a resume."
"RIVERSIDE RESEARCH",",Great place, great co-workers, juggling three jobs and meeting all the requirements.  Love the type of work.  Always very busy.  challenging job."
"RIVERSIDE RESEARCH",",You show up to work, do your job to your best ability and the company takes care of you. I was told at the beginning of my 1 year contract that they would be able to find another position for me at the end of this one...unfortunately they were unable too."

"Realtor.com",",this was a great place to work, stimulating at times, only a few times i could say i was bored. managment was excellent, never micromanaged or over burdened me with work."
"Realtor.com",",Its a good way to learn about Real Estate and Advertising. It is not an entry level job. If you cant take rejection well and don't believe you can make 100+ calls a day it probably is not a good fit."
"Realtor.com",",This is a concentration camp that sells products to real estate agents that don't work. This company steals money from real estate agents and if you have any integrity you would not work here"

"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",",The work at LBNL was very organized and well managed. The collaboration is one key point of my experience. The time schedule is flexible. Offices quite small."
"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",",it's hard to have a developed career if you don't have a PhD at national lab. Stable but salary can't be high. You will have good health insurance and pension plan which is rare now."
"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",",Good place to work.  Good benefits, and a great view.  Opportunities depend on the Division you work for.  Culture is improving daily."
"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",",I moved to the Bay Area for a postdoc position at LBNL. I love working there and have good colleagues, but the culture of LBNL is different from most other national labs in that there isn't a well-defined track for advancement. You either get one of the rare staff scientist positions, or your out looking for jobs in 2-5 years. Overall, it was a positive experience, but I would have liked more stability."
"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",",I worked on the Administration side of LBNL and unless you're a scientist, they don't really value you as an employee.  After being employed for a administrator position, I was relegated to a storeroom issued parts for 90% of my time.  My manager did a poor job of training me for the duties listed in the job description, pawning me off on other employees from time to time.  While this may sound normal, during the interview process I was told that I would be working closely with my supervisor, attending meetings and shadowing him to learn both his position and mine."
"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",",Although there as a contract employee, this company is a great place to work. The company is diversified and everyone you work with is pleasant. Each of the persons in different departments supported HR and worked together as a team to ensure each Department at the lab were supported and each employee and student received the information needed to be a success."
"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",",The Berkeley Lab is managed more like a university than other national laboratories, likely because of its proximity to UC Berkeley. This has some of the benefits of a university-like feel, but sometimes makes it difficult to execute large/ambitious projects that (a) require coordination between different departments/divisions, and (b) require some legwork before being able to publish results."
"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",",If you're interested in building new capabilities instead of making slides about all that cool stuff you're going to do with your grant money, you might want to look elsewhere."
"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",",I have been working with the scientists who work real hard to advance the current knowledge state of science to the next level. I am really inspired and motivated by seeing their motivation for the good cause of humanity. Typical job day includes a lot of computational work including scientific programming, simulation, data analysis, visualization, and above all sharing these information with the fellow scientists and colleagues. Also, there are a lots of enlightening seminars almost every day where we can learn the new knowledge of a research area. The work culture here is excellent and the people are very helpful and supportive. The most enjoyable part is how knowledgeable the people working here yet so humble. Hardest part is to keep publishing of cutting edge research papers which sometime takes years."

"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",",The best part about working at LBNL is the beautiful location. The lab is located in the Berkeley hills surrounded by nature with a beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving new employees, taking their  photos for their badges and interacting with them. The hardest  part of the job was dealing with bureaucracy. "

"Sparrow Health System","Good people to work with and an excellent job atmosphere to continue excellent care to all patients each and every time."
"Sparrow Health System",",Greeting customers at car, helping with all their needs. Great work environment, awesome management and coworkers. Most enjoyable part would be, patients thanking you for your hard work."
"Sparrow Health System",",A typical day for me at Danville Regional Medical Center, starts with me getting charts together for the facilities that I schedule radiology procedures for, I maintain 12 offices that I have to schedule patients for radiology procedures. The offices fax me the orders, I schedule the patient and pre-register them, If the insurance requires authorization I call the insurance company get the authorization and then get the patient scheduled, if the insurance company denies the patient from having the procedure done then I have to send correspondent back to the office letting them know why their patient has not scheduled. I also, have to collect copays. I have learned a lot about health insurance, Management is fair to their employees, my co-workers are a great group of women to work with. The hardest part of the job would be collecting the copays over the telephone, patient do not like to give their personal information on the telephone, they would rather pay in person. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with many people on the telephone, and just sometime being a listening ear."
"Sparrow Health System",",Very busy place to work. If you like keeping busy this is the place to work. There are several rotations so the variety of exams are great. Great group of girls to work with!"
"Sparrow Health System",",I always wanted to work here, and now I am only here because of the benefits. Understaffed, broken equipment, over worked, poor management, no room for advancement, interdepartmental chaos and expected to be married to the job. If you use this place as a stepping stone to learn and move on , you should be ok."
"Sparrow Health System",",STOLE THIS FROM A PREVIOUS REVIEWER.. BUT IT DESCRIBES SPARROW CARSON CITY HOSPITAL TO A T. This hospital is going downhill quickly as far as working here goes. What used to be a great place to work is now a soul sucking experience on a daily basis. You can clearly see that the focus has shifted from focusing on what's best for patients and employees to what's best for the higher ups pocketbooks. It makes me sick to see the total lack of appreciation we employees have at this hospital. Everyone is stressed and miserable due to understaffing, horrible management, and lack of resources. This is not just my opinion but the opinion of the majority of those I work with. This is the truth about this company. I hang in there just hoping things will change but I'm not crossing my fingers."

"Sparrow Health System",",Pharmacy staff is always so short handed because the management is terrible.  Scheduling is atrocious,  Management could care less about anything other than themselves.  Atmosphere is negative.  Customers constantly yell at employees and management does nothing.  Management gets raises and declines raises for others."
"Sparrow Health System",",Sparrow IT is a great place to start your career out of college but don't plan on sticking around for the long haul unless you like to play politics with leadership.  "
"Sparrow Health System",",Job postings for management positions are put up mostly as a joke; the directors get together and cherry-pick the individual they want for the position long before the sham interviews begin.  If you aren't tapped on the shoulder and told to apply (with a wink), you haven't got a shot at breaking through to management."
"Sparrow Health System",",Performance evals are a joke.  First you self-eval, then your manager takes a pass, then the directors (many of whom are not qualified to judge your performance as they don't work with you) knock your score down as they see fit."
"Sparrow Health System",",If you want a place to get a start and then quickly move on, Sparrow may be a good choice for you."
"Sparrow Health System",",I had a great experience at sparrow during my 2nd year of the Radiologic Technology program. The radiologic technologist help you to become the best you could be. Sparrow works hard to provide the best possible care to their patients,alone with working together as a team."
"Sparrow Health System",",A typical day for me consisted of answering phones, checking in and scheduling a series of appointments for quality patient care. "
"Sparrow Health System",",I have learned that everyone has a story and compassion is very crucial to make sure that every patient feels that they are validated to receive the best care  possible and that they are as important."

"Sparrow Health System",",In a smaller community hospital, there is more opportunity to see more variety, which I like.  You learn everyone's names and you also see the same people from the community come in.  It's nice to build a relationship with them because it makes them feel more accepted and valued, which all patients should feel."
"Sparrow Health System",",The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers and visitors. I enjoy helping them."

"Sparrow Health System",",Having worked there since I was 19 years old I have seen many changes and growth in Sparrow Health System"
"Sparrow Health System",",For the most part I found my time at Sparrow rewarding. Have always been a bedside nurse providing direct patient care which is what I enjoy the most. Working in different departments and specialties I learned a great deal on how to care for people with different diagnoses. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing your hard work pay off-a patient recovering, being able to go home, a patient happy with care he/she received. "

No advancement in positions or pay grade.  Recently allocated budget for training again.  Many people retiring in the next five years."
"ORAU/ORISE",",Great Benefits working here. Employees club is a huge perk and food trucks come to the location a couple of days out of the week."
"ORAU/ORISE",",No opportunities for advancement. Stale management ideas. Out of date corporate culture. Employees can be difficult to work with because the workforce is largely uneducated. The job you start with is the one you will get stuck with. Backstabbing employees with a lot of mistrust because of dishonest corporate policies. Mostly concerning ""reductions in force"". Everyone is job scared and protective. If you need training on a job task, you are likely to get some misinformation so that someone's job stays safe. "
"ORAU/ORISE",",This company is ripe for a lawsuit. There is a lot of offensive discriminatory language being used by both employees and managers. Employees use social media all day on their work computers for gossiping. Managers turn their heads to it."

"ORAU/ORISE",",My job was top secret and cannot be described publically. Sorry for the lack of information here. The lunches were good."
"ORAU/ORISE",",A negative working environment.  I would not recommend this company to anyone looking for a stable work environment."
"ORAU/ORISE",",This company has many different projects and manages them quite well. Working in my particular facet of the company has been fun and educational. I have gained invaluable contacts and experience. Management is always available to answer any questions or concerns. I noticed many employees had been able to advance on this contract rather quickly, which was encouraging. The most difficult part of the job has been that I was hired on just before the contract was ending. Luckily I was not put out too much, but others moved to the area specifically for their position, just to be told a week after starting that they will be out of a job in a few months. I don't believe ORAU knew, until they received the official word, that the contract was ending three years earlier than projected. I think they have handled the reduction in force very professionally, providing as much time as they could for their employees to find other employment. I also understand this is the nature of contract work."
"ORAU/ORISE",",Overall good place to work.  Flexible hours and alot of opportunity to learn.  Depending on your manager there is autonomy.  Job does involve alot of politics inhouse and with client. But, in all you gain good experience."
"ORAU/ORISE",",Flexibility is great, benefits are great, but Management plays too many games and everyone of the managers blames each other for all the issues. Not a good healthy environment to work if you are wanting to grow."
"ORAU/ORISE",",This is the company that I was hoping to retire from.  ORAU is a wonderful company to work for.  I would continue to work there had it not been for the lack of government funding, salary freeze, continuing resolution, furlough, and eventual layoffs."
"ORAU/ORISE",",ORAU remotely manage NPP fellows. Anytime they are needed, they are there. Otherwise, very quite. Great!"
"ORAU/ORISE",",Very interesting job, but ORAU ran out of money for both my projects."
"ORAU/ORISE",",Majority of the employees there are very immature and will gossip so much. The culture is very CYA and if you want to advance this company is not the place to work."

"PayPal",",One of my favorite companies to work for. They made the day fun and exciting. Had special employee appreciation days often. Really awesome benefits. Somewhat easy work if you're good with customer service. Daily team meetings, will make sure you are well trained. The catch, you will be at a desk for most of your shift, and for a good majority of the week. They want you to give world class service to each and every customer that calls in, but with a time limit of like 6 mins. Kinda stressful."
"PayPal",",PayPal is a fantastic company to intially grow in.  They will bring you in from entry level and as long as you are flexible in your work hours you can move up quickly and gain awesome experieinces in leadership.  However once you achieve entry level leadership you once again need to be flexible with schedule and at this point you are 5-10 years in and no longer can afford the flexibility when you have a family.  If you can't be flexible you will remain entry level leadership.  They still do reviews which are subject to manager opinion, goals fluctuate but for me I maintained high performing teams yet one quarter or half I will be an Exceeding expectations and then I may get a new manager who will rate me as a meets for doing the same work I did before.  One manager will tell you its all based off performance, another says its the extra work you put into it, and then they change your teams so much it's impossible at times to remain a high performing team.  They will be very respectful and helpful to entry level but it comes with a mental cost to higher up leaders who are over worked and under appreciated. recently many mid level leaders are stepping back down into entry level due to low pay as a leader, no work life balance,  and low appreciation for the jobs they do."
"PayPal",",The best part is the people there, I have formed friendships for a life time and I also learned valuable lessons about coorporate business, structure, and it made me a very strong leader for it.  I highly reccomend it for any one starting out who wants the opportunity to gain a wonderful experience."
"PayPal",",Back end skip tracing, calling, message leaving, customer negotiations for repayment. I learned to be better at handling customers needs. Management was very nice but sometimes lacking to assist in personal advancement. Very nice people co-workers. Hardest part the way they promote people. Nicest part people and atmosphere."
"PayPal",",In a typical day in my last position I fulfilled a QA tasks of  working with business analyst on analyzing the priority and severity of defects. Throughout the day I created various  tests cases duties as well, including creating system integration test cases for third party systems.

The hardest aspect of this place is how you see peoples life taken away and the efforts that are put in to survive. The most enjoyable is putting a smile on a patients face and making a difference."

"Memorial Sloan Kettering",",I really enjoy my job at Memorial Sloan Kettering. It has proven to be a great place to work. The staff are polite and compassionate about their work. The leadership is knowledgeable and take an interest in their staff."
"Memorial Sloan Kettering",",The Basking Ride site was a difficult place to work. I worked there for 4 years and there is little support from management in the Medical Oncology department. Session Assistants are expected to get patients onto the schedule last minute with little to no support. The job absolutely comes first, they do not care if you have somewhere to be after work, if they need you to stay late or you cannot complete all of your work by the end of your shift you are expected to stay. If you are a non-essential employee you are still expected to come in during storms and dangerous weather."
"Memorial Sloan Kettering",",I was under contract for a brief time.  I enjoyed working there and learning new techniques and protocols as well as utilizing my past experience.  I was able to work individually, in groups, was taught and as well teach others alternative methods."

"Memorial Sloan Kettering",",Good company to work with. Learn a great deal. Friendly staff. Busy environment. Doctors are very friendly. Patients may be a bit challenging but overall good."

"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",A typical night a work is quiet employees half fast the job and rushing and didn't fill orders properly.

"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",7:30AM-4PM or 3:30PM-12AM Overtime if offered"
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",You work with very dangerous, flammable, corrosive, and toxic chemicals. Chemical Packers pour chemicals into bottles by hand and need to label bottles as well as package and label boxes. Machine operators work machines that bottle chemicals. Make connections for chemicals going to machines as well as tables.  Before each job is started the lines need to be sampled and taken to the lab to test. When they have a chemical spill, they have employees that are train to clean up spills.  The job has a high exposure to chemicals that can cause cancer and many health issues.  I don't believe that the compensation for the risk is reasonable. "
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",Management always emphasizes safety first! However they are always looking at your production! The place is going through some management changes and the group leaders tend to surpass there authority. Workplace is for the most part clean employees are very friendly for the most part.  Some old timers that think they run or own the place can be difficult at times"

"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",the company overall was a great company to work for however lack of management skills was crazy. typical day of work you would go in find out what the days schedule was what had to ship for instruments and test them customer satisfaction was our number one priority"
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",thermo has a good work/life balance. but job security isnt there. no career growth. they have a good cafeteria . coworkers are friendly and easy to talk to ."
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",Nice working culture. Friendly atmosphere. Superior products and superb work culture for one to flourish.At Thermo Fisher Scientific, we work together to accelerate research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics and increase laboratory productivity. We know that our people are the source of our global success, and we embrace the unique qualities and differences of each of our professionals.

"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",I take a great deal of pride in everything that I do. From the moment I say hello to someone in passing to engaging in conversations that improve how we do things on a business capacity."
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",I've learned a tremendous amount of things so far which gives me an edge over my colleagues in how we can always improve how we move inventory aligned with the expanding business needs."
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",ThermoFisher encourages and provides us with a work/life balance that I think is very important. As for my personal needs it helps me improve and boost my self esteem while also improving health choices by providing us with a on site gym, fitness programs like yoga, boot-camp training and all sorts classes that improve and impacts my day on a positive level."
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",The hardest part of my job: We are are always creating new ways to store materials in different temp. controlled environments. Space has always been the enemy. We've overhauled 4 temp. controlled rooms, in which I was very much involved in by strategically planning how to store materials that are sensitive to temp. These projects take time to complete and sometimes pose challenges when material is not moving out as fast as I am introducing it into inventory. So this I'd have to say is the toughest part of my job. - But It challenges me. :)"
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",The most enjoyable aspect of what I do, Is knowing that I implement ""Tangible Quality"" - which lets my customers know that Quality is important"
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",  "
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",", to me. Everything that I encompass (work-personal life) is executed with Integrity and a great deal of care. "
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",I love what I do!"
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",  "
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",management changes daily.  Try to do good but some people don't see it that way.  Few bad managers make everyone miserable. Good is that you can work remote for most positions. Company is too large."
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",Great place for people who don't want or need job security. Most decisions are based on shareholder value so many jobs go offshore to reduce labor costs."
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",A typical day was always with conference calls or meetings. I worked in a fast-paced environment so I learned how to budget my time and prioritize tasks. The management could be very demanding at times but was very supportive of its employees. My co-workers were great to work with--the best I've ever had. The hardest part of the job was working on project(s) under a tight schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work-life balance."
"Thermo Fisher Scientific",",This management team cares about how the departments work together to successfully get product out the door.  Impromptu meetings keep each other informed of developing issues. Each member of the management team actually cares about the other.  Management regularly communicates to workforce."
"Mayo Clinic","I love working with this company and I was able to work from home"
"Mayo Clinic",",Every day was very busy, witch it was a good thing, work was not equally between 12 phlebotomist. I did not learn anything more than what I already knew when I came to work for them.  I felt that management needed to improve especially in the laboratory department, I felt I had no support from manager of supervisor. I had no problems with workplace culture. The hardest part of work was the lack of communication between supervisor and co-workers. I enjoyed working with people and I felt pleased to be able to help them in any way I can."
"Mayo Clinic",",Throughout my time here at Mayo it has been a roller coaster ride of red tape. Mayo offers great pay and great incentives to stay employed here. There is one major problem I constantly run into while employed here. The supervisors have little to no power to actually affect change in a positive manner. Conflicts with co-workers will go unanswered. For that very reason I have chosen to work elsewhere. Through out my two and a half years here i have had three supervisor, all unable to do anything with troublesome employees. This is because Mayo is a top down organisation. The supervisors cannot affect true change without having prior authorization from one of their superiors, so any move they make is slow and unresponsive. This makes their positions very difficult and inhibits many positive would-be leadership decisions. I really enjoy most of the people I work with but management remains immobile in certain situations which has sanctioned my position unworkable. Mayo Clinic has high standard for care and employment. Its not a terrible place to work and build a career, granted you can handle all the politics that comes with it."
"Mayo Clinic",",Management and co-workers are more than willing to share their knowledge and teamwork as well as individual success thrives in this organization."
"Mayo Clinic",",This hospital is always at the forefront of the latest innovated technology and medical advancements. It is well known all around the world and looks good on any resume! The experience is incredible and the opportunities for advancement are limitless. I worked with someone that started as a housekeeper then worked his was up to a systems management position with the help of tuition assistance and advancement opportunities. Overall it ahs been one of my favorite places to work."
"Mayo Clinic",",I will recommend any employee even testing team all people are motivational. Fun at workplace on time submission. I worked for contract role."
"Mayo Clinic",",Coming into work everyday made you feel like you were really part of something big, prestigious, and well-known.  Well, that's because you were!"
"Mayo Clinic",",supervisors and managers encourage people to get education, but when one gets it there is still no chance for advancement."
"Mayo Clinic",",Mayo is a great place to work and learn.  Treated with respect by Physicians.  The patient population is amazing.  I have been very happy working there."
"Mayo Clinic",",My day would start out with getting instruments ready to perform testing. Sample would come in at various time and work load varies. You can be busy one minute and then the next it can be slow. Slow time you can get documentation done along with other projects. Busy times you need to be great at multitasking and communication with co workers about what can be ran and what is calibrating or repeating."
"Mayo Clinic",",Great place to work for but it is very large to the point where there is a lot of communication gaps.  The city of Rochester is quite small so, it is great for families but not much else outside of work."
"Mayo Clinic",",my time at mayo was the best time of my life ,going to work was a blast,the culture was amazing and very diverse,not only did i learn from the best but i felt apart of a great team,i regret the day i handed my 2 week notice in...."
"Mayo Clinic",",Through my short employment with housekeeping I felt emotionally abused by my supervisor and that she forced me into a hostile work environment. She used my illness against me to fire me. Great job but horrible boss."
"Mayo Clinic",",At Mayo Clinic I would work on getting approvals from the insurance companies before patients would be able to be seen. I would also work with insurance companies when they requested medical records of patients that were in the hospital."
"Mayo Clinic",",Wonderful place to work. Great people and great management. Benefits are not as comprehensive as they once were but I feel like that's hospitals in general. They have the best staffing ratios I've ever seen."
"Mayo Clinic",",""The needs of the patient are the only ones to be considered."" This is the attitude of all the staff I have worked with for the past four and a half years at Mayo Clinic. Every person brings their best every day to offer patients comfort, hope, guidance and answers. It has been my highest privilege and honor to work side by side with peers who represent the very best in health care today."
"Mayo Clinic",",Team based care model in a policy driven, physician led institution. Resources readily available. Truly embodies honoring the ""needs of the patient are the only needs to be considered."""
"Mayo Clinic",",As member of the Health Information Team responsible for implementation and roll out of the Mayo Phoenix Hospital's Electronic Clinical Information Management application my typical day entailed meetings with various division leads and management personnel planning for various patient and workflow procedures and protocols. Meetings also entailed collaborating with vendors involved with building the infrastructure and installing various systems and clinical equipment. Among key lesson learned was the need for a clear and distinct vision and an adequate workforce of skilled professionals as essential elements for successful completion of a complex, project. The management was mission driven and had a keen eye of talents needed. They spared no expense in ensuring that resources were available to accomplish the mission at hand. The hardest part of the job was operating within the established time constraints while becoming familiar with new systems systems and emerging technology. Successful roll out of each clinical application was the most enjoyable part of this job."
"Mayo Clinic",",Great co-workers. Good benefits. Decent work schedule. Good paid time off. Work short often. Poor management. Pretty fair pay. Do work every other weekend and holiday."
"Mayo Clinic",",as an aide, we had a lot of busy work to complete before shifts end. Nurses were always willing to help though! its our job to answer calls lights, wash up patients, change linens, transfer, and we can even assist in procedures upon nursing discretion."
"Mayo Clinic",",Principal investigators are great mentors here and very supportive to build you on your chosen academic career path. Work ethics are very strong such that experiments are planned with publications and conferences in mind."
"Disney Consumer Products","I enjoyed my time at Disney. I met amazing individuals who helped shape who I am today. I learned an incredible amount about team building and day to day operations."
"Disney Consumer Products",",Everyone has a smile. Friendly customer service high priority. Was trained in all levels of retail service by a great team. Team training and meetings were fun silly learning experiences."
"Disney Consumer Products",",Definitely a super fun job, probably the best retail experience I've had. I knew a lot about Disney going in and I know even more now. Management is great and very organized. Dealing with kids and their parents can be hard, but it's typically very rewarding."
"Disney Consumer Products",",The company expects a lot from their employees but its always fun. Most people do the work of 2 people and only have the title of ""Associate"". Associates often have the experience level of over 5 years and could be a manager at any other company. Its difficult to move up within the company. You'll see a lot of people moving from department to department but keeping the ""Associate"" title."
"Disney Consumer Products",",Don't let the recruiters fool you. There is not a lot of growth and development to move up quickly. There are no plans/tracks for people to advance their careers. And don't even think about getting any significant pay increases."
"Disney Consumer Products",",The downside is the senior level managers know there are 1000 people lined up at the door just to work for Disney and they use that to their advantage. You'll definitely feel like a dime a dozen."
"Disney Consumer Products",",the job is actually great, a little stressful. but i enjoy it, The team on the other hand....not so much, Very unprofessional and management does not appreciate hard work. Get pointed for family obligations, and if the computers dont load up in enough time....that is a point. no one in there that i noticed does the job according to what we were taught. its like a jr. high school."
"Disney Consumer Products",",When you work at the Disney store you day start of ok but you never really know what you walking in too.... It really is not the happy go lucky place..... We  just put on a good show."
"Disney Consumer Products",",Fantastic work environment, management and other cast members are encouraging and supportive.  Overall excellent team work."
"Disney Consumer Products",",It was fun and encouraged to work itself. But I got very frustrated by people who liked politics. By those experiences,"
"Disney Consumer Products",",I would not work there again."
"Disney Consumer Products",",typical day was short due to lack of hours. I learned a lot about the basics of retail industry. management was helpful. co-worker were helpful. hardest part of job was working during the holidays. enjoyable part was serving the community."
"Disney Consumer Products",",had many good times at the Disney store, did not mind doing the job it was fun. the employees were great had many contest in which I won. the Management was ok nothing that was to demanding"
"Disney Consumer Products",",Such a fun place to work.  It doesn't feel like work.  The assistant managers are all young and have no leadership experience.  Most are only working there to discounts and free park tickets.  It's like high school.  If you don't belong to the cool crowd, you get treated different.   Not many hours."
"Disney Consumer Products",",Fun Active Work Place. Fun Coworkers and Overall Pleasant Customers. Easy to Understand Duties and Responsibilities."
"Disney Consumer Products",",I was only a seasonal sales associate, but it was usually pretty fun. The only thing I didn't like was that the store manager at the time didn't like me or the fact that I was in college, so she constantly scheduled me for ""call-in"" shifts. Which were basically I had to call in an hour before that allotted shift would start to find out if they needed me or not, and they hardly ever did."
"Disney Consumer Products",",Tough place to work and management needs help.  Many learning opportunities but won't stay long.  Advancement is very difficult. Work life balance can be challenging if not impossible."
"Disney Consumer Products",",A typical day at the Disney Store starts with opening the store with a story and letting a little child turn the ""Story Book"" light on.  If a famous Disney song comes on, everyone is welcomed to join in.  I have learned that every child grows up and every adult must keep learning.  I have worked with and meet people from all over the world and a good attitude can change a bad attitude most times.  I enjoy working with my manager and meeting new co workers each season.  The hardest part about working retail is approaching shop lifters, you just never know where the person's thinking is.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping new grandparents pick out toys and clothes for the new member of the family."
"Disney Consumer Products",",Excellent place to work and is so inviting to everyone of all ages. "
"Disney Consumer Products",",It is such a fun place to visit even if you do not plan to buy something. There is something in the Disney Store for everyone!"
"Disney Consumer Products",",I had the option to get to work at an earlier time and was able to leave one i completed the 8 hours. I learned how to maintain a set pace while working, once I became acclimated to my work. management was really friendly, and understanding. along with my co-workers were a colorful beam of personalities, all witch enhanced my work experience. The hardest part I would say would be trying to break the occasional monotony that was brought along with the job. The entire 8 hours was just desk/computer work."
"Disney Consumer Products",",I loved working for the Disney Store. Very sad to see the store close, but the customers and events we would have for the kids were extremely fun and brought everyone together"
"Disney Consumer Products",",Great company, excellent brand. The atmosphere alone is inviting to visit and work in but the culture suffers from poor store management. Both the store level and above are not in tune with the guests or the experience. Over the years they have grown complacent and gone away from what was once special about these stores. They are now like any other retail store when you visit. Advancement is almost non-existent, the management never go anywhere, and the good management always ""disappears"" why do they let them go? Internal guest service is always preached but seldom ever actually experienced."
"Disney Consumer Products",",Who wouldn't love to work at Disney! Working in the retail store was just like any other retail store, running a business. The store cast members make it a magical experience."
"Disney Consumer Products",",A typical day at work included replying to emails regarding our product or a guests order. Working at Disney gave me a lot of patience and helped me deal with people in a better way. Working here also has showed me that I can also communicate with my managers about anything that would possibly affect my ability to work."

"Harvard University",",Intellectually stimulating atmosphere and encouragement to have some fun in the office now and then. Honestly, is the very best environment to thrive. Take advantage of the tuition break for the Harvard Extension School as well."
"Harvard University",",A typical day of work involves reading materials that have been submitted to me such as screenplays, television pilots, short stories, manuscripts and novels (fiction and non-fiction), and providing written and oral feedback.  Days also include: telephone calls with students and clients, discussing their material and ways to advance and improve their projects, calls with industry professionals such as agents, producers, studio, network and cable company executives."

"Harvard University",",The institution is the oldest and largest devoted to the study and preservation of the records of the human past. The featured courses are stunning settings to learn the key skills of art-historical and image-based investigation. Through books and visual sources they reveal the meaning of architectural works and artifacts in their historical and geographical realms. The institution is an exciting place to grow professionally, to outline scientific questions in depth, and to propose better solutions for their solving."
"Harvard University",",I really learned a lot about university billing. The pay was pretty good. I wish that the position could have become permanent. The Harvard square are is an exciting place and a great location for my daily commute."
"Harvard University",",I don't know what to say for this section. It depends on what you do or what your role here. Typically for a research assistant, you work long hour. Sometimes I stay past midnight and coming in during the weekend. But i love what I do because I think finding a cure for cancer is important."
"Progrexion","you are only going to make money there if you are a salesman (manipulative) i did like the leadership though they will help you succeed if you really want to"
"Progrexion",",Helping others launch a profitable career was very rewarding. I enjoyed helping the management team get a lift in results on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis."
"Progrexion",",They scam people. Do not work here. They don't care about their employees and the GM was fired for cocaine my first week working there. All they care about is sales."
"Progrexion",",Hands down the best job around Idaho Falls. Great pay, benefits, and work environment. Easy to move up in the company and have a career."
"Progrexion",",The environment here was amazing. Fun. They have lunch planned for every Friday, whether its sugary cereal your mom wouldn't  buy for you or bbqing hot dogs during the summer. And not cheap gross hot dogs either. They have a play room that has a ping pong table, tv, mini golf hole. They offer a service I believe in. And it works."
"Progrexion",",I worked here while going to school. They were very flexible with hours. They made sure you knew what you were doing. There is no script to follow, which made it a bit hard, because you had to memorize questions to ask."
"Progrexion",",Helping clients with credit repair services and changing the lives of people stuck in financial situations.  Expert advise and continued follow ups.  Management is great as well as training and coaches help you succeed beyond.  Your teammates are always there to help cheer you on as well.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get clients to talk with you at that particular time, there are many excuses that they don't have the time but you need to try to get them interested at that moment, instead of call backs.  Working from home is the best part especially if you need to be home.  No need to go to the office during bad weather.  The company provides you with all the equipment need for you (computer, keyboard, mouse and headphones) all you need is a ethernet connection and your good to go"
"Progrexion",",The environment is nice. Management is pushy but inspiring. Long hours aren't very flexible. The company itself was enjoyable and did a lot for the community. Srill a growing company and likes for employees to be involved in and out of the office."
"Progrexion",",a typical day at work is sitting on the phone all day and selling a credit repair service. I learned much about credit and laws in connection to it. Management is not that great, you get promised one thing but get another. Co workers are great to have around to have a certain energy and environment at the workplace. the hardest part about the job is having to try and keep certain metrics on point so your pay doesnt get cut down. there is no enjoyable thing about this job."
"Progrexion",",Great Place to work. You will get paid more if you sell. Management should be paid more. Super easy and you are selling a product that really helps people."
"Progrexion",",I really enjoyed the amount of time i got to spend working for Progrexion, the company is very taken care of and knowledgeable. Friendly employees and a positive work enviorment"
"Progrexion",",The call center is a nice call center. In the OKC location the site manager and operations manager know who you are. They come out on the floor and talk to you. Other coaches also know your name an will help you even if youre not on their team, which is unlike other call centers."
"Progrexion",",Watch out for management. The OM Andrea is very fake. As soon as she took over everything drastically starting changing and everyone started quitting. Management is two faced. They will never acknowledge your hard work and dedication. As soon as you mess up or make a mistake they are real quick to write you up. They play favoritism. They all like someone until drama starts and then chooses who sides to be on. Pay sucks. They play with your money. They tell you that you commissioned out but some how your check would be lower from the check you didn't commission out on. They will over pay you and take it out without permission. Payroll is unprofessional and makes up lies. But overall watch out for ANDREA and LANCE. Andrea is extremely fake. You can tell it is extremely hard for her to even smile at work. She has to force herself too only because she is the OM. Not really a friendly person at all. She sits in her office with all the MEN coaches for 2 hours while they all laugh and have fun and there are no sales coaches on the floor to help the agents.  Coaches all of a sudden stopped being available even though that's what they get paid to do supposedly. Management will tell your business to other agents. Not a professional place. It was in the beginning. A lot had changed!"
"Progrexion",",Call center environment, so the work was hard, emotionally taxing, and demanding. Due to this environment, employees learn how to work well with clients, how to assess their needs, and help to resolve their concerns. Employees also learn how to keep a positive attitude to build confidence in clients as well as to help build the moral of their coworkers."
"Progrexion",",Training was good but once on the floor and working hard to convince the poor they need there credit repaired in order to get ahead was a task in itself but once that was achieved the pay became different that what was presented in training."
"Progrexion",",I loved working at Progrexion! I was there for a little over two years and it's the best job I've ever had. The work is not hard at all, as long as you pay attention to your trainers and coaches and do what they suggest when you're on the phone. I loved my coworkers and my coaches. We got free food all the time, whether is was hot dog/cereal Friday, pizza, tacos, or doughnuts for meeting our team goals, whole pies for Thanksgiving, or random food just because. We also watched tv/Netflix/dvds basically all day. You just had to be sure you were paying attention to the client when you got a call though. We also had guitar hero live for PS4 in the basement area to play on breaks. I felt valued and appreciated in this company. Basically, if you implement what you're taught in training and coachings, and you actually TRY, you'll be successful. Like I said, the work isn't hard. You just have to want to do it. I will say, if you're not much of a people person, maybe don't apply for this job. You'll have to deal with all kinds of clients in all kinds of moods, so if you can't handle that, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. But I really loved this job so much. I only left because I moved."
"Progrexion",",Full day on the phones, helping customers with improving their credit so they can achieve their financial goal. Co-workers are helpful and encouraging."
"Progrexion",",Overall the company doesn't encourage any diversity at all. They talk about PACE but only demonstrate it on a case by case basis. Wouldn't recommend working here to anyone. Current leadership is very weak."
"Progrexion",",I like all the events and random holidays they celebrate but theyre very 2 faced on  they say and do.I like the benefits and the insurance is good. But I will never go back."
"Progrexion",",your blindly selling credit repair to people who think theyre getting into a rent to own program, a car or loan. we have these ""partnerships"" with companies we cant even speak about. Very sketcky. Hard to sell"
"Progrexion",",This position is more for someone who can be ruthless and dishonest to make a sale. I get that it all about the bottom line but I just could not do it. It is not my style."

"Regeneron",",I have worked at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for 3 years in the manufacturing department. The company is growing very quickly, has a very healthy culture, and is relatively flexible to the needs and wants of its workforce. They go out of their way to do numerous small events such as bringing ice cream trucks to the employees, and hosting some enjoyable year end holiday parties. I have greatly enjoyed my time working here, and consider myself fortunate to have started right after college. "
"Regeneron",",The only thing to watch for is that in the manufacturing groups it is very easy to work 70-80+ hours a week. Overtime is freely given to all who want it, but sometimes the schedule and processes dictate very long continuous work times."

HR is terrible and is only concerned with recruitment activities at RPI (college). No respect for Mechanical engineers or Designers.  Devices are all purchased overseas by Regeneron's partner/ Sanofi.  Life Science majors are Project managers.

"Lenovo",",I was just laid off and will miss the place.  I was able to enrich my skillset and contribute my talents to a team who wanted to help me be the best that I could.  The management is really great.  I enjoyed working for a real leader.  The culture could be uptight at times but my immediate team was always great to work with.

"Dropbox",",-People are not only the best at what they do, but they're also super humble and down to earth (i.e don't be intimated by all the ivy league linkedin profiles, they're also really cool, genuine people and you don't need to come from an ivy league school to work here contrary to what others say)."
"Dropbox",",-Prior to joining, I thought the team was much larger and much further along than it is and as a result there's a lot left to do as we scale and grow. You get the luxury of an already well known brand but the infrastructure of a small to mid-size company with a lot of things to still tackle!"
"Dropbox",",-They do a really good job of empowering/involving offices outside of HQ so we get to be a part of the strategy conversation vs. just implementation/execution"
"Dropbox",",-On the sales side you get to be the first and only ones calling into large Enterprise accounts, you don't have to worry about competing internally or dealing with a bunch of red tape internally to sell"
"Dropbox",",Dropbox is a decade old ""startup"" that has yet to make a clear profit.  Benefits and pay are competitive for SF.  Workloads are high as many people leaders are not competent at managing others.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with smart people.  The hardest part of the job is taking some executives seriously that have no business managing other people.  The HBO series ""Silicon Valley"" should do a future season based on this company."
"Dropbox",",The perks of the job are way better than the job itself. Being security there can be boring if you're not the favorite of the supervisor. Work loads are Not evenly distributed. There's no room for advancement and no guarantees to anything promised. But the Benefits are awesome and its definitely worth it not having to buy or bring lunch everyday."
"Dropbox",",Dropbox was behind on invoice processing so brought in 3 temps to catch up, using NetSuite software. They also use their own software for email management; and also Zendesk for task management. That was new to me, so was a good learning experience."

My coworkers and I got along very well and never had any issues. The hardest part of the job was learning and developing skills I didn't have prior to being hired.

"eBay",",-Scan them or take photos with a digital camera"
"eBay",",-Post them up on ebay"
"eBay",",Overall, this is a great company to work for.  The overall atmosphere is very positive and the environment is certainly focused on personal and professional development.  The one negative would be that with the given management structure, departments are so compartmentalized that they don't do well when it comes to working cohesively. Also, in certain instances it can be very difficult to operate in circumstances where you reporting staff is not in the same location as you.  However, it is very exciting to be a part of a global marketplace as big as this one since you get to see how much goes into giving the buyers and sellers the best experience possible."
"eBay",",Fast paced busy environment, great atmosphere and benefits.  The campus is very nice once you can get to it from the parking lot.  eBay has a strong presence in the community encourages charity and commits to not only the employees but the communities and the world.  The company is always changing management and in doing so operations goes through many changes.  Some have been great and some not so great."
"eBay",",eBay has been a great experience in making additional income. I am allowed to work on further enhancing customer service for clients in an online portal. I have shipped to many countries and people leave great reviews for me based on their service and products provided."

"eBay",",eBay is underrated and is a fun place to work. Great pay and smart people. I would encourage others to find roles here. Strong leadership. Global presence. Established history."
"eBay",",Taking pictures of items that have potential to be sold. Uploading pictures. Listing them. Describing items, Pricing them and posting them to your listing. Another fun part of this work experience and shipping the items out once they are sold. Printing out the shipping label, boxing them and shipping them out. In this profession you gain experience as a Photographer."
"eBay",",The first day I went into work not knowing to much of what i was going to be doing while working there, and by the end of the first week i felt like i knew almost everything about my job and how I was supposed to do it."
"eBay",",Ebay is a great way to make extra money in your free time. It's flexible, easy to use, and provides a great opportunity to showcase your skills and make money from your talents."
"eBay",",Basically, don't work here unless you are desperate for some income, like I was! I was forced to work 6.5 weeks straight during peak season with no days off, on a 12-hour shift! HORRIBLE"
"eBay",",I loved this job it was easy once you got the hang of it,fun work enviroment, management is great and your co workers are friendly, the worst thing was short lunches since alot. had to leave to get there lunch."
"eBay",",eBay is way past its prime.  I worked in a solid group of people, but overall the business is a boat lost at sea.  You have to expect that while HR has its hype, in reality the business is a business and as an employee you are just fodder and don't be surprised if the day comes you get laid off and lose all your benefits."
"eBay",",The hardest part of the job is making sure you get the products to ship in time. With working and doing that and the post office closing at 6:30 beomes very time managing."
"eBay",",I liked eBay a lot, but because the department was so thin and new, many people didn't have answers, if I didn't come to the table with the background I had, it would have drown within days."
"eBay",",A reliable site where you can find anything you want and also a great and secure place to sell your collectible items. You have the opportunity to do all the requirement of the job from your computer and it is easy to print and ship the purchase items from home. Feeds are taken care of by the site as well as a comfortable ans secure transaction with your PayPal account."
"eBay",",When I work at RIA we had warehouse parties and the teamwork was fun! Learn a lot of exciting things and filing was difficult but everything is all digitized now!"
"eBay",",I wish my contract at eBay had been extended. It was an amazing company to work for. Very professional and they know how to take care of their employees."
"eBay",",Plenty of overtime great benefits "
"eBay",",Management chooses a favorite and will let them do what they want and then pick on people until they quit or will lie and get you fired. Management had no idea what they were doing or how to manage. No way to advance.  Everyone acts like they are in highschool. Everyone is rude and angry all the time.would never recommend working here"
"DST Systems","Typically there is no manager available to ask questions and when you do find one they don't know the answer. Everything is so gray nothing is black and white"
"DST Systems",",My team takes over 200-250 calls on a daily basis.  We work hard to make sure we are giving quality customer service to our clients investors."
"DST Systems",",Is a middle size company that is poorly run.   Very little proper communication and management is done at DST.  Its hard to get ahead based on knowledge and work.  Typically you get ahead because of who you know."
"DST Systems",",Doing business with calling cards and helping customers with accounts. It was a family ran business and I was transferred from being a telemarketer to a receptionist is 2 days time."
"DST Systems",",I've been with DST for almost 5 years, and in that time, I have learned so much. I am grateful to work here. Each day is a different, fun, new challenge and I've never been bored. I can honestly say that I love working at DST - I love what I do."
"DST Systems",",A typical day at work was very Stressful & Slow"
"DST Systems",",The coworkers were very Respectable"
"DST Systems",",The hardest part about that job is Management"

"DST Systems",",Employee's where nice to work with.  Because they choose an temp service, it makes it unbareable to work with the company.  Training was not the best and they feel if you don't get the concept, then you are out the door.  They don't care about people, they only care about the production only."
"DST Systems",",This was my first real part time job and I LOVED it. I was able to go to school and earn some good money. My coworkers and management were the BEST."
"DST Systems",",Since the company was mainly focused on the Mutual Fund industry for so long and the Mutual Fund industry has changed a lot, the company is venturing into new businesses."
"DST Systems",",The company is also changing employee benefits that has caused a lot of controversy among the long tenured employees."
"DST Systems",",DST Systems is full of different departments and is made up of smaller organizations as well. There is a large variety of individuals and personalities at the organization, in any particular segment. There is a great deal of training involved in obtaining a position with the company. A typical day in my position, as a call center representative, was taking a wide variety of calls daily. No one call or caller was like the other. The days were a constant test on understanding and knowledge of products taught and discussed in the trainings. There is a possibility for growth as long as an individual wants to grow with the company and all the positions it has to offer."
"DST Systems",",the managers do not train you. HR protects the wrong Associates. they throw you under the bus and don't want you to have your own mind."
"DST Systems",",DST is a great company with great people and good place to learn a lot of good skills.  Many different areas to work in with many different type of clients."
"New Directions","All my days are mostly long and challenging work with the kids I help on a daily Basis. These youth need to know that someone cares and is welling to take time out to show them a better way to live their lives outside of violence and crime.

Looking beyond what the youth has done and helping them understand that there is a better life for them if there willing to let someone help them."

"Northwestern University",",Standard stipend, able to live in Chicago area, albeit frugally. Quality of the working environment depends almost entirely upon who is your lab advisor. Beyond the day to day, Northwestern is a huge school that can give you as much HR stuff as you need."
"Northwestern University",",A typical day at work would start with a good morning greet from many co-workers, we would come a hr early to have coffee, very nice people no problems from any co-workers, I learned the great culture, met people that have worked that for 25 or more years , they was very helpful showed me all the work. Taught me how to use proper cleaning supplies,proper ways to to use a hand mop, and more. My supervisor was very nice and understand and made sure you knew your job over all i enjoy my time there because i learned new experience."
"Northwestern University",",I learned a ton while I was there but since my pay was based off grants it was very insecure. Work can be very satisfying if you end up in a good lab with nice people."
"Northwestern University",",Northwestern is an amazing place to work. It fosters a creative environment and freedom of expression. They compensate their employees well and provide good benefits. They give you a lot of latitude so you don't feel stifled. The bonus is that the campus is gorgeous. Apply!"
"Northwestern University",",Great place to work. Nice co workers. Benefits are great, but pay is lousy. Employees are not paid fairly for their hard work, dedication to the job, or for their contributions. Management needs improving."

"Northwestern University",",Imagine working along side intelligent creative individuals of the utmost professionalism. That was every day at Northwestern University A&RT. I would donate my left kidney to work there for the rest of my life!"
"Northwestern University",",NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY allowed their employees to go back to school. A gym membership was allowed to employees, alone with flex time. It was a family oriented work place. You feel close to all of the staff. You are able to purchase at a discount NORTHWETERN UNIVERSITY athletic team tickets for you and your family."
"Northwestern University",",Overall work load is high. People are very friendly here. No windows in my office. Tons of talks can be attended. Some courses can be taken for free."
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.","Pretty standard company to work for. Decent pay and benefits. The managers are accommodating and helpful. I don't work in an SSAI building so I cannot say much about coworkers and office life."
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",SSAI is an excellent place to work! They are extremely supportive of their employees and promote a positive work environment.  They encourage career growth and are extremely flexible by reinforcing a work/life balance.  They ensure that their employees are well informed and are transparent in their decision making process.  "
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",I have read the reviews on this website regarding SSAI and see that the majority of them are positive. I fully agree with them. For the few that were not positive, it seems as if those were extremely disgruntled former employees who blatantly lied about the company.  "
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",I highly recommend SSAI to any prospective applicants."
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",Working with SSAI was a true pleasure.  The company was very productive and had a strong moral status.  From upper management to the employees everyone had great costumer service and worked as a team."

"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",SSAI is definitely a company I would recommend."
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",This place would be a great place to work if the HR department wasn't so poor. Lack of motivation, self centered, self accepting- forgetting the employees are why you have a job!"
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",This program is designed well to help current students, recent graduates or early transitioning professionals develop technical and personal skills. Each person I have interacted with has been supportive and given me the resources I need to succeed."
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",I am fortunate enough to have a boss who not only empowers you to be successful but encourages you in every aspect from education , training to hands on experience."
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",Prime example of a company that will use you until they are done with you.  And then kick you to the curb when you get old or sick.  Management places no value on employee loyalty and experience.  Then they quietly dump you with no future, no ability to find another job due to your age, and no benefits--you cost them too much.  Though some of the work they participate in is nice science, their bottom line is prime motivator."
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",Worked at NASA as a systems analyst for SSAI and the work was very rewarding and interesting. Daily interactions included communicating with rocket scientist and highly experienced engineers."
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",Study flow of customers, productive days, help management with reports, staff, time cards, PTO, HR rules/regulations, and I enjoy doing it all. A typical day at work is busy from 7:30am until 4:30pm with very little down time."
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",I worked on three different projects with the company.  Even between projects they kept me on at the company headquarters while I was looking for my next project.  From the owner on down, I knew and respected them all."

"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",Overall, great place!"
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",SSAI is best place to work, people are friendly, and managers are always giving me excellent opportunities to perform my job. I would to work with SSAI to my retirement, but unfortunately, the company was lost current contract."
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",I worked as a contractor for this firm and really appreciated these folks. Would work for them again in the future."
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",Excellent employee support, education, advancement, health and retirement plans"
"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.",",A creative and challenging company, open to new ideas, and willing to climb out of a rut if it improves the product."
"Lucas Group","Solid company, great opportunity, and great work environment if you like to be self-managed with little overhead. Pay is fair for New York City."
"Lucas Group",",Let me just start by saying I am an experienced recruiter and these people do not know how to manage or motivate individuals.  They make promises they cant keep and don't promote from within.  "
"Lucas Group",",Unprofessional organization with a straight commission paycheck."
"Lucas Group",",Learned a lot.  Great team work.  Enjoyed my time at the company"
"Lucas Group",",Great to have an opportunity to learn from others.  Small corporate office at the time"
"Lucas Group",",This job is difficult to begin and takes a lot of hard work, time, and effort.  It takes about 2 years before you really begin to reap the benefits.  It's exciting but can be very defeating for the faint of heart."
"Lucas Group",",Due to their billing error, I did not get paid for 2 weeks, which caused me to pay an additional $300 for late rent fees, plus an eviction report going on my credit. They did not care. "
"Lucas Group",",I am on an indefinite assignment, which means that I do not get PTO or health insurance. Disappointing that they do not fight for me to get hired on, especially when other permanent positions have opened up, yet I am not allowed to apply for them."
"Lucas Group",",Good company but very volatile, it is directly impacted by any changes in the market. Compensation (commission/draw plan) is difficult. Great management but no growth opportunity."
"Lucas Group",",Would have been nice to have a little more support for new employees."
"Lucas Group",",I have always been placed in a position that was perfect for me. They really work hard to keep you working and send you to assignments that exactly fit what you are looking for."
"Lucas Group",",You cannot get a straight answer out of the recruiters.  They are terrible.  Avoid them at all costs."
"Lucas Group",",A professional workplace that rightly demanded productivity."
"Lucas Group",",Firm no longer exists. Was a reasonably good place to work while it existed. Management consulting involves a number of interesting challenges. The firm itself was a bit chaotic, but the work had the potential to be quite interesting, and there was a good collegiality among the junior team."
"Lucas Group",",Great support from home office with a small office feel. Office provided great benefits with a gym in the building. Great location in downtown DC"
"Lucas Group",",intermittent job. Enjoyed my co-workers. Worked the receiving log daily, looked for bad receipts  and item numbers"
"Lucas Group",",Working through Lucas Group as a contractor at MarkWest Energy"
"Lucas Group",",They are very helpful in following up on how the assignment is going, and if there is anything that I need."
"Lucas Group",",I have learned so much about the whole milk marketing and accounting functions."
"Lucas Group",",The one reason I left Lucas group is because it is, for lack of a better term, a ""sleazy"" company."
"Lucas Group",",The first hour working there, I witnessed two recruiters lie to a potential client about their capabilities without concern. You look at their website and it is like a great poster for a bad movie."
"Lucas Group",",The headhunters are underpaid and seemingly need the money which hurts ethical conduct."
"Lucas Group",",Picture the recruiting version of Glen Gary Glenross and there you have it. If you need some extra money, tossing resumes can be lucrative sometimes, but many of the people working at the Lucas Group are part-time waiters, but don't tell clients that which blew me away."
"Lucas Group",",The one saving grace is that you don't have to work too hard, but then again that could be a negative. Work there at your own caution, but you won't feel good about yourself."
"Lucas Group",",Very tight bunch that work hard and play hard. Great place to be if you like more of an inside sales role."
"Lucas Group",",Very good search firm. Does primarily contingency search but does it well."
"Lucas Group",",I chose Lucas Group as my employer because of the long tenured employees. There is typically a lot of turn over in the recruiting industry but LG has a lot of very tenured recruiters, which says a lot about the firm."
"Lucas Group",",It is 100% commission, which means that you determine how much you make by how hard you work. The management team is great, progressive and they have excellent training, tools, and systems."
"Lucas Group",",The thing I love most about the company is the people, we work hard and play hard."
"Lucas Group",",If you are a seasoned sales person OR a great recruiter who can develop business, you will thrive here."
"Lucas Group",",Six figure commissions are attainable - you are the only one who can keep you from doing it."
"Lucas Group",",Progressive thinking firm. Great training program for experienced people."
"Lucas Group",",Hardest part of the job is finding new clients"
"Lucas Group",",Best part of the job is helping others get a new job And getting paid for it!"
"Lucas Group",",Great annual award trips to exotic locations"
"Lucas Group",",Collegial"
"Lucas Group",",Warm and Family-atmosphere"
"Lucas Group",",Employees are the greatest asset"
"Lucas Group",",Lucas Group is a medium-sized company with a corporate staff size that requires plenty of coordination between departments and the field. I find this to be a positive. Everyone can have contact with the revenue generators of the company and make contributions to the company's future."
"Apex Systems","The companys' acutual managers are not approachable or not available at all.  Therefore would not know the actual problems down the line, and thus can't manage."
"Apex Systems",",Worked at client site and was able to support the client remotely.  Great team of people that I worked with. Individual interaction with team made you feel like home and comfortable and free."
"Apex Systems",",Great staffing company.  I was a contractor.  They were more concerned with you making it to work than the environment you were put in."
"Apex Systems",",This is a contracting company with minimal benefits. It is not suitable for people who wants good benefits and salary to succeed in their career."
"Apex Systems",",Apex is a phenomenal place to work. It is very fast paced and demanding, but also very rewarding. The hardest part of the job is meeting various clients needs. The most enjoyable part is collaborating with your team on meeting the business deliverable."
"Apex Systems",",Driving around to the customers homes to install purchases. I learned how to install over the range microwaves and other items. The people that I wored with loved doing their job"
"Apex Systems",",I think Apex Systems is a good company to work for. They make sure to keep you informed from first interview until starting day. I really liked my recruiter."
"Apex Systems",",Everyone is really kind but all the work is temporary and they don't let you know that until your contract is over. They never offer to extend contracts and they tell you it's a real job instead of a temporary one."
"Apex Systems",",APEX is the best contracting company I have ever worked for.  They were extremely friendly, professional, and thorough with my screening process, and performed the same service to prospective employers."
"Apex Systems",",When working for Apex System I found that the job is not the most  enjoyable part but the people and the atmosphere is what keeps the drive alive. The workplace culture is congruent with the management experience; exceptional."
"Apex Systems",",If you have to file paperwork with Chain of Command for outside employment, make special arrangements before taking time off, request time off, rent a car, book a hotel (for a week....), and dry clean clothes, all to be cancelled last minute because ""APEX"" Management cannot get their details in order and run an operation that amounts to not much more than being a ""bouncer"" at an event..Then do not bother with this company. "
"Apex Systems",",Otherwise you will be out cancellation charges, sound like a fool for saying you were going to do something but don't, and include your close mates in the process because of Apex management requesting any and all qualified personal for a week long contract gig in a city 400 miles away.  "
"Apex Systems",",It's understood that the company cannot control the sometimes high demands of the costumer however, you cannot expect qualified individuals to go through an entire process to help your company out when it supposedly needs all the  ""Agents"" it can get for a specific event, and then say ""sorry for the trouble guys, we can't guarantee you work."" "
"Apex Systems",",Highly unorganized, and unprofessional. Just my two cents."
"Apex Systems",",Really enjoyed this job. The traveling, the chance to attend classes and further learning. Only down side is it was a contractor job. No stability"
"Apex Systems",",Overall, I was satisfied with the company. The Client they placed me with was a very good fit as well. Apex frequently kept in contact and never missed a single payroll payment, except once through my own fault. The only downside was the position I had was 300% more travel than I was told upon accepting the position."
"Apex Systems",",A typical day was getting into the office at 7:30 and leaving at 6:00, and work wasn't even completed, so you were behind when you came in the next day.  There was no training involved, so it was figure it out as you go.  Also, the director was new, so when you would ask a question, oftentimes you wouldn't get an answer.  There were no guides/resources to refer to and processes changed on a daily basis which made consistency non-existent.  Would have been nice to have a contact list of who to call when issues arose.  Technology was poor - not even set up to print and had to utilize web mail which was awful.  Client was difficult to work with - no matter what you did, you couldn't please them."
"Apex Systems",",We had a great team at the customers site providing 7x24 coverage of the Data Center. Everyone was willing to help other team members. We had a lot of fun in and out of the office."
"Apex Systems",",Great place to work.  Great people."
"Apex Systems",",Excellent compensation opportunities."
"Apex Systems",",Young and vibrant culture.  Earning potential is unmatched for recent graduates."
"Apex Systems",",Overall, I was satisfied with Apex Systems, Inc. and the Client they placed me with.  They frequently offered to take me out to lunch, kept in contact and never missed a single payroll payment - not even an inaccuracy.  The only wish I had, was for Apex to ""go up to bat for me"" just a bit more when I really needed them in a pinch.  They seemed a lot more concerned with pleasing and catering to the Client's needs, but that's to be expected anywhere."
"Apex Systems",",Apex Systems is a good company they help you find work, the only thing is its through an agency and you don't get alot of the benefits other companies do."
"Apex Systems",",Apex is second to non in job placement and technical managerial skills. The working relationship is superb and no hard time at all towards it's employees."
"Apex Systems",",great place to work, would recommend to anyone looking to expand their knowledge in the irrigation field. Looking forward to what APEX will do in the future. I learned more in 5 months there than I learned in a full year working for a different company."
"Apex Systems",",I really enjoyed working with Apex.  The did a great job matching my skill set with good opportunities.  I only wish they would have worked harder to find me new roles and helped me grow more."

"A9.com",",Good working environment. Smooth cooperation among colleagues. Free snacks and drinks, comfortable desk and chairs. Need a gym and more shower room."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN","A great professional environment with a well established IT work force that's not afraid in having a good time while keeping a professional attitude."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",AB is a great place to start your career, however, there is little room for growth once you have been there for over two years. The majority of it's employees are either Associates or VP's. There is literally nothing in between."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",""The most valuable assets at the firm go up and down the elevator each day.""  The firm is certainly filled with the industry's best and brightest individuals, and it is truly the people that are one of the most enjoyable aspects of each and every day.  No day is ever the same in the financial services industry as the market can impact all aspects of the job almost instantly.  This can quickly wrench the work-life balance and lead to late evenings or weekend hours to assure all projects are successfully completed, but it is certainly nice to be surrounded by great people while doing so."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",In company every one were helpful and provide guidance to learn new technology and environment. Everyone in team were like family ."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",AB is a great place to work, but moving up at the company is very politically driven. AB does not have the smartest employees, but the company culture is very good. AB strives be a Wall Street firm, but misses the mark on a number of fronts."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",Some very smart people leading the firm. If you can interact with the leaders there is a chance to learn tons about the markets. Large size makes them a player and get involved in exciting parts of the market. good pay and great work/life balance."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",Can be too friendly and political of an atmosphere and some under qualified people fill roles better suited for younger talent. Technology is inefficient and support for investment professionals is lacking at times."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",Your time here greatly depends on what team you are placed on. Each FA acts as their own, independent company in many ways. I would recommend requesting that you meet your entire team before accepting the position."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",Equities trading floor is a productive and fun place to work at AB... A very professional place to work at. Great co-workers. A lot of opportunities to learn and grow..."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",Work/Life balance is excellent.  Really smart and driven people.  Have high hopes the company will turn around and AUM will grow."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",management took a turn for the worse when they made a change"
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",they moved the entire department to white plains and it didn't sit well with many employees however they didn't care"
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",very cliquey"
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",Poorly organized business which makes work balance and advancement difficult.  Company performance has been challenged for a long time now so compensation has been poor regardless of personal performance."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",Not the ideal place to work. Good benefits and working environment. However, training is lacking.  There is no motivation for employees."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",Great state of the art technology. Innovative and ingenious personnel. Effective at getting projects completed accurately and timely"
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",Knowledgeable co-workers, managers are good mentors as well.  Each day was different and included activities ranging from requirements gathering to testing as in a typical sdlc process."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",-Definitely recommended"
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",-Culture is great"
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",-People are smart"
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",-Senior managers are approachable "
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",-Supportive team"
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",-Can't think of anything negative to say"
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",This job was great I spent many years here and I learned a lot about the computer science system of the company. The coworkers were nice and I made many friends,"
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",I worked for quite a few people in my 23 years at AllianceBernstein. I loved going to work!  They all treated me with kindness and the group felt like family.  They helped me to get any training that I needed.   They were also very supportive."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",Co-workers worked well together.  Management was flexible. Lots of training is provided.  There were some late nights but management always compensated your time."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",Working at alliance was a great opportunity for growth and development. The company also had great individual and cohesive talent which showed through service delivery."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",Go watch a group of 5 year olds play soccer - that is what a typical day is like at AB...including goalies playing in the dirt making dump truck sounds."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",In general, the people here are what make this company great. The people I personally work with are very knowledgeable, professional, and were always willing to help. "
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",Due to increasing project demands and limited resources, there is never a shortage of meaningful work. You will have many opportunities to further your skills and knowledge professionally, which is a plus."
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",However, sponsorship from management could be improved. Managers could do more to ensure that their best talent is properly awarded for their efforts to minimize turnover. "
"ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN",",Benefits are standard."
"Seattle Children's Hospital","A great place to work with great benefits and a good work life balance with leadership encouraging a positive work environment."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",A typical day at work would include outside time with the two year olds, taking a nature walk with them in a wagon, diaper changes, short arts/crafts time, very intricate day sheets. I learned about the 30 hour Basic STARS training while there, but took the course shortly after my employment there. The management seemed easily upset and unfortunately had a hard time helping me through family deaths, including my niece. The hardest part of the job was not being supported through family emergencies and having to pay $100 a month to park there. I also only got paid once a month and only at $11/hour"
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",As a student in the computer Science field, I wanted to branch myself outside of the classroom and try and learn something that a teacher/class cannot teach to me, and that's actually having hands on experience in a IT field and working with the people by solving real world issues. My job shadow at Seattle Children's Hospital was a whole new experience for me. Having the chance, I got to work with an actual team of IT and Computer Science people by installing software, experiment by installing new hardware and actually collaborate in a group on how to make something work more efficient for all users. The hardest part was hearing everybody speak code, but to be honest, that was also the most enjoyable part. Because I wanted to learn and know everything step by step, the team was more than happy to explain and show me ""what did what"" and ""this is our end result"". I always find excitement in new learning material and topics that can help me grow in my desired dream job."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",Knowing that your here to help children is the most humbling experience that you have, knowing everyday you go to work to do your best to give life to the next generation and help to build amazing memories for the children of the future."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",I enjoy working for Seattle Children's Hospital and feel that I have acquired skills that I will take with me and use throughout the rest of my career. The staff at Children's all dedicated to providing the best care possible to children and families."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",Great Company to work for. Great environment and management. Pay could be better. Non-profit. Opportunity to move up, and good range of hours."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",As a nurse assistant certified, I took vitals every 4 hours, reported any abnormalities to the nurses, helped patients and families with their activities of daily living. I also helped restock medical supplies. At the end of each shift, report was written and given to the next nurse assistant."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",SCH,  horrible location. can take 1 hr to get from Montlake to Hospital if a sports game or any other function is happening. VERY clicky environment with employees. If you dont mesh well with older employees you will be "" out"". "
"Seattle Children's Hospital",", I suggest another location is you wish to work in Seattle."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",Also working at a childrens hospital isnt for everyone. Can be extremely depressing, and many serious childhood illness there which you bring home to your own family. Things people dont realize when they work in the environment"
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",  This hospital requirement so many extra curricular classes on site on off hours. VERY inconvenient if you live out of seattle city."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",Ready to move on sunnier skies from Seattle rain to Arizona sunshine - work at the hospital is fine but ready to change my environment"
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",It is a great place to work. The teamwork is excellent and the job is worthwhile, as we are all doing our part to further the hospital's goal to fight childhood illnesses."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",Most enjoyable is providing families with great care."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",Hardest part about the job Children's provide such great care sometines not having the opening in clinics to provide services and having to say no."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",A typical work day is always busy never a dull moment. What I have learned about management in this particular department they do not take ownership for their mistakes.  The hardest part of my job, is coming into a situation where there was no proper documentation or support on the job.   The most enjoyable part of my jobs is the support of my coworkers."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",I could write so many negative remarks but I will try to temper my words with some facts. I was hired is the Medical Staff "
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",Services department as a Credentialing Specialist. After only 4 weeks. The Director of Medical Staff Services told me in no uncertain terms. That 'It would be highly unlikely, that I would be successful in the role.'. "
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",Three and a half weeks later I terminated. More over the MSS Director went on and tried to dispute my WA State Unemployment claim. By indicating that I resigned. When in reality the separation from employment was by termination, Moreover, HR was not present at my termination, "
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",I would like to believe overall this is a dedicated and professional organization. However the Medical Staff Services Dept is a joke."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",Seattle Children's puts their employees through a ton of training, but it is worth it to be able to provide quality patient care."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",Analyzing data to see track cost initiatives.  I learned an extreme amount and will be forever grateful.  I learned more about excel, how to think analytically, and management."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",I work in the IT department and have seen major improvements over the last year which is very refreshing. Finally we are not only making progress, but the future work we are planning is exciting and inspiring. Impressive new leadership within IT over the last year!"

"Seattle Children's Hospital",",going to work can be a hassle because of how many sick children you see. But once you look pass the sickness and develop a relationship and bond with that child and their family it then becomes more then just a job! it becomes a life changing moment."
"Seattle Children's Hospital",",People don't generally end up working at a children's hospital by accident, they are there on purpose. Now, the reasons may vary, but the mission, the goal is shared. There are few places I could so wholeheartedly endorse as Seattle Children's. Work there, you won't regret it."
"General Assembly","I was never employed here. I took a 3 month bootcamp, so I cannot speak to the majority of the categories to be ranked. It's a great educational environment though, albeit very stressful and hectic."
"General Assembly",",the typical day is hard. it takes commitment to see continue for the whole program duration. from 9am to 5pm, you are continuously learning and solving problems. this is necessary to absorb the skills that are necessary for the industry. the instructors are great and there are TA who gives all to help other people."

"General Assembly",",I only volunteer right now but management was incredibly excited to get me involved. They are also excited about the prospect of having me be a TA after I graduate."

"General Assembly",",A 12 week programming boot camp that teaches students about developing Android apps using a training program developed under the guidance of Google."
"General Assembly",",The culture at GA was really great. Everyone with a like minded focus and passion towards learning and developing.

"General Assembly",",I was here to go to school, but my final class project was a pro bono design sprint for a real client. I'm very thankful to GA for the opportunity to connect with that client."
"General Assembly",",Although I was a student, I would definitely work for GA in the future. Their work culture is super relaxed and everyone is very easy going."
"Rocket Software","I was present during the early days of Rocket, formerly known as Seagull Software.  Much different environment at that time but once Rocket purchased Seagull, management and internal processes changed dramatically/"
"Rocket Software",",I really enjoyed my time at Rocket Software. The senior who was there was really invested in training me and I learned a lot from her. There are some really smart people out there."
"Rocket Software",",Not an awful place to work, it really is what you make it and who you end up working for.  Some people love it and some people hate it.  Biggest downfall- people are not social.  You can say hi to anyone in the office and 99% of them will ignore you for no reason."
"Rocket Software",",staff do their job to the best of their ability and the senior staff are always willing to help when you seek their help as a junior staff."
"Rocket Software",",Rocket is a growing company with many growing pains in it's many companies that it has bought to grow it's customer base"
"Rocket Software",",As a Rocketeer, your focus is on customer satisfaction, and cross-product communication.  The management team is hard-working, and interested in the employees."
"Rocket Software",",Remote employee, enjoyed going into the office as well."
"Rocket Software",",Learned e-learning software and technical/course writing."
"Rocket Software",",This was a good summer job for me because I got a full understanding of how it is working in a office setting at a computer. I got to understand the basic skills of using Microsoft office, Excel, Access, etc. As well as using my customer service skills to contact customers by email or phone. The hardest part about this job is getting the understanding of the software this comoany uses to process transactions of payments from different companies."
"Textron","If you seek the opportunity to work in IT supporting multiple industries and locations while remaining in a single company, Textron is a good place for you."
"Textron",",Started out as security police officer and then promoted internal to the warehouse section. Enjoyed working with management and co workers. Worked on a government project."
"Textron",",I worked for this company for almost 16 years, and the only reason I left  is because my division was adversely affected by the credit crisis in 2008. Upward mobility was excellent; as evidenced by the 8 positions with increasing responsibility that I had during my tenure.  We worked hard, and played hard.  This company felt more like family than a corporation."
"Textron",",It's an easy career once you get in but it's very hard to get into you must know someone to get into Textron/Cessna. But the overall work life is awesome. People are great!"
"Textron",",Textron has been a great place to work. With a lot of bright and talented people."
"Textron",",Textron has always had a flexible schedule and a good work life balance."
"Textron",",Had no problem with workplace except for the fact that it was very unorganized and there was no room for advancement in my position."
"Textron",",i enjoyed my time here to an extent when there was no drama between co workers. if your looking for a steady job this is the place to go, as long as you can put up with some questionable rules and people. easy to not get fired all you gotta do is your job and show up."
"Textron",",This is a good company to start a career at with an entry level job. Folks are nice, good location (Hunt Valley, MD...close to Baltimore). Compensation and benefits are competitive."
"Textron",",No set work times. Forced overtime. Not following labor laws and overworking employees. The management doesn't talk to the employees are have a clue about what's happening with the safety of the company"
"Textron",",I find it to be ridiculous that they have this position still open and yet i applied for this position almost a week ago and they sent me a denial email stating they found someone that's more suitable. what I find to be even more ridiculous is that I met all of their qualifications for this job and they still claim they found someone else that's more suitable."
"Textron",",Great training, promotions and bonus regularly given. Prompted comrade. Was laid off due shift in the economy. Great place to work and family oriented."
"Textron",",Good company to work for. Great teamwork, work environment. I would recommend this company to anyone that is looking for an opportunity for growth and good learning opportunities as well."
"Textron",",I spent 6 years with Textron and have zero complaints. My move from the company was purely for my family. I had plenty of opportunities to advance and felt that I was rewarded for the work I put in accordingly."
"Textron",",i learned how to adapt to people with different ethnic backgrounds. I really going to miss the relationship that were made there."
"Textron",",A typical day at work was very busy. I learned to work with engineers and various support personnel. Direct management was always supportive and extremely helpful. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was lack of calibration personnel to support the lab. The most enjoyable part of the job was working closely with my co-workers."
"Textron",",There is longevity in Textron Systems and pride in the products that they produce. "
"Textron",",They take great interest in developing new employees to move the company into the future."
"Textron",",If you like golf and like to travel this is the job for you. Along with this job you'll learn more about different areas and also get to interact with various types of people."
"Textron",",The company focuses on reducing cost by looking at tangible items rather than how to cut cost by improving processes. There is so much opportunity for this company if they'd just pay attention. Recently it has just been layoff after layoff! Which make the work life so difficult. The motto is ""Do more with less"" but that can only go so far until you have the rest of the team stressed to the max. "
"Textron",",They make known they want to replace talent with new college grads."
"Textron",",I worked there for a little while and loved it. They are great to their employees and a fun place to work. They have a great benefit package and banking on site. I would go back to work their anytime"
"Textron",",Textron stands out as a company where employees are free to communicate with each other as much as necessary to get the job done.   The managers are very accessible and easy to talk too.  Employee concerns are considered and addressed as much as possible.  Everyone I worked with was knowledgeable, talented and focused on getting the job done."
"Textron",",The culture at Textron is extremely flexible at letting people contribute their skills on whatever program needs them the most.  In the twenty years I've worked for the company I've had a chance to work on almost every airplane the company builds.   "
"Textron",",On the downside.  With the decline in the business jet market, Textrons been unable to expand.  To maintain it's profitability they've been forced to gradually lay off people.  Despite this, they've maintained good communications with employees and severance packages are generous."
"Textron",",I hope the company can turn itself around and start growing again."
"Textron",",Opportunities"
"Textron",",Again, having worked here for many years, I was able to enhance my skills, working in many different areas. Having the role of DC manager I was able to see all phases of the business."
"Encore Capital Group","Work hours can be long and fast paced. Company is changing but does offer competitive benefits.  The work life balance is minimal."
"Encore Capital Group",",This is not a bad place to work.  Management is bad.  Turnover is high.  Lots of fines from government in the past few years resulting layoffs."
"Encore Capital Group",",Great work environment at all offices throughout the organization. A place where one can advance their education with the company's assistance."
"Encore Capital Group",",As in all organizations communication could be a little better."
"Encore Capital Group",",Great executive team."
"Encore Capital Group",",This place is a joke. Overworked and under paid. Management is completely ridiculous and decisions are constantly made without keeping the staff informed of the changes. Nothing you do is never enough. No room for growth at all! The amount of people that leave each month is nearly uncountable at this point. There are even temps that will tell you they don't want a full time position here because of the stuff that goes on. Everyone is miserable and it just keeps getting worse. If you call in sick, you get an occurrence and two more of those in a 30 day period, its a write up. So if someone in your life happens to pass and you didnt give a two week notice of your time off, too bad. Occurrences it is for you. They do not care about how stressed and overwhelemed you are, they will keep pushing mandatory overtime on you. You as a person, do not matter to this place."
"Encore Capital Group",",Bottom line: STEER CLEAR OF WORKING HERE!!! Your sanity is worth much more than what this place will pay you for."
"Encore Capital Group",",Expect to work with the most useless and uneducated people. There are times you have to read your already sent emails to people to get a response, otherwise they don't have the ability to respond. Management puts you out to deal with items on your own with little to no training.  HR is a joke. HR is a joke. HR is a joke (this needs to be repeated).  HR is the most incompetent group in the entire organization. Other departments need to perform HR functions because HR will otherwise not perform the tasks correctly, instead of simply firing those incompetent individuals and replacing them with individuals that can perform the required functions. Hardest part is coming to work everyday for a company that you don't believe in, doesn't value you, doesn't pay you anywhere what you near deserve, yet expects you to perform at 200%. 3-4 of your coworkers will leave, you will be asked to perform their functions and take on more work, with no pay increase or promotion."
"Encore Capital Group",",This company is great for work life balance and security, but no advancement or career growth. They don't care about coaching and career path. Low salaries."
"Encore Capital Group",",All Co-workers have respect, dignity, and value. The amount of unrelenting drive is something to behold. This is a good company to work for."
"Encore Capital Group",",Most managers use intimidation and fear to get things done. It's all about the bottom line. No empathy for people - employees or customers."
"Encore Capital Group",",In order to do this line of work, you have to have patience and excellent customer service skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I worked with. You get a lot of irate people calling but it's your job to stay calm and work with the consumer."
"Encore Capital Group",",I would prefer not to provide commentary at this time, perhaps I can provide it once a new position is found. Once I find myself in a new position then I will gladly provide more feedback."
"Encore Capital Group",",Most of time was spent on a computer, and entering data. There was not much hands on work in regards to cases.The overall culture of the office was fun and laid back."
"Encore Capital Group",",I worked for Encore - Aero Drive location for just under a year. From the start I could see that the majority of the employees were young (minus upper management) and everyone had a very ""laid back"" attitude. It's supposed to be business casual but I seemed to be the only one dressed nice the entire time I worked there. People formed their own little cliques and the environment seemed very high schoolish. Group managers were not professional at all, little to no training was offered (everyone is kind of just thrown into their work), turnover is HIGH (people were always quitting and new temps were starting all the time). I constantly heard people complaining about their pay. Raises and promotions were very rare. There is absolutely no growth at this company which is why so many people, even people in higher positions, moved on to bigger and better things. I lost count of how many people quit while I was working there and everyone always talked about how they were searching for new jobs and how they couldn't wait to leave Encore. The friendships that I made while working at Encore I'll always remember. The happy hours after work were always a blast. There's not much more I can say about working at Encore other than walking out on my last day felt AMAZING!! :)"
"Encore Capital Group",",A lot of highly intelligent, professional and courteous people. I've built many strong relationships, gained excellent experience and I've had the opportunity to work with people that truly want to make positive changes in the organization."
"Encore Capital Group",",Encore has changed a lot over the past few years. The success of the company has inevitably put more focus on making money than taking care of the people in terms of helping them grow and succeed. IT specifically is seen as ""second class citizens"", always blamed when things don't work right, but never given the support to solve the problems the right way (e.g. replace outdated technology). All IT staff is expected to be on call 24x7. If you don't pick up a call then you are reprimanded for it."
"Encore Capital Group",",Management only cares about making quick decisions instead of thinking through options first. I enjoyed the first few months of working at Encore but most of the good people/leaders have left so there is really nothing that sets this place apart from any other multi-billion dollar corporation. "
"Encore Capital Group",",If you want to work at a place where your opinions matter, where your growth is important, look elsewhere."
"Encore Capital Group",",Happy to go to work my typical day is on the computer working on  legal documents, updating information. My co-workers are positive people that are fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is when I run out of work. The most enjoyable part of my job when I learning new project."
"Encore Capital Group",",Was a temp. Managers were excellent, but the work was grueling."
"Encore Capital Group",",My job is pretty repetitive and the atmosphere is a little ""immature-ish"" for me. Working for so long in an office setting I am used to professional guidelines and in my department there really is none. Overall if you need a job to make money I recommend it, but not one to further a career."
"Encore Capital Group",",This job provided me with almost no training or orientation.  They made me go through a temp agency via online located in California after the interview.  The job was only temporary, but in the short time I was there the manager provided zero guidance.  I wasn't even sure what I was supposed to be doing as a file clerk.  I was laid off after the first week."
"Encore Capital Group",",A typical day for my position would include reviewing the attorney calendar to determine which hearings we needed to attend, or dismiss, reviewing files for litigation, reviewing files for service and dismissals, preparing suits for court, preparing instructions for attorneys to appear at court, gathering exhibits and other necessary documents for evidence, reviewing statuses of cases at court, calling courts on occasion, reviewing tentative rulings, reviewing files for bankruptcy, updating files, preparing notices."
"Encore Capital Group",",The hardest part of my job is a lack of communication between departments. It makes for a lot of wasted time, having to redo tasks that had already been done."
"Encore Capital Group",",Not a bad place to work, but not a great one either. The pay is slightly below average for the job titles, and promotions are rare (I've only seen one in any department after working here for a year). The company is large, but small teams make it feel more personal. Work can be mundane, and month-end pushes tend to be stress-inducing."
"Encore Capital Group",",There is a strong push from management to be creative and boost revenue, but a lack of incentives, high pay, promotion opportunities, and moral high-ground make the pushes relatively useless in terms of actually producing productivity."
"Encore Capital Group",",Hours are not very intense, but they are very rigid. It's hard to get time off on short notice, and shifting your daily schedule by an hour (eg: 8-4 instead of 9-5) necessitates a talk with a manager. Salaried positions are treated like hourly with no overtime. You must be in the office 8 hrs/day or 40 hrs/week, even if you have nothing to do. In addition, you aren't paid extra for working overtime (not even with a year-end bonus for hard work)."
"Encore Capital Group",",Co-workers are a lot of fun, and the culture is good, but it is not an innovative company, nor is it an interesting or inspiring industry - it's debt collection; know what you're getting into."
"Encore Capital Group",",Encore has changed dramatically over the last couple of years.  The work culture used to be fun, flexible and relaxed.  Now there are lots of rules and regulations.  This is not a professional office, and you are treated like children for the most part."
"Encore Capital Group",",The company expects you to have a college education, but the hourly wage is not reflective of this."
"Encore Capital Group",",There is almost always mandatory overtime, averaging at around 15 hours per month.  And when there are incentives to work more hours, they are pretty nondescript.  The overtime does boost your income, but it also interferes heavily with your free time."
"Encore Capital Group",",The work is very mundane, and requires a high level of concentration throughout the day.  As a Legal Specialist, you are signing affidavits that can end up in the hands of defendants, so you are subjected to a certain level of risk.  Many Legal Specialists have been mentioned in blogs on the internet (myself included), and some have even been served with a summons at home."
"Encore Capital Group",",The company offers 15 days vacation, however, there are no sick days offered, so vacation days will be used for any periods of sickness.  There's also the opportunity to work back the time at the weekends if you don't want to eat into your vacation time."
"Encore Capital Group",",The hardest part of the job was trying to keep my opinions to myself with regards to management."
"Encore Capital Group",",The best part of the job was working alongside some great people."
"Robert Half Technology","Sales environment.  Management are the past top sellers.  Long hours, 10+ hour days. Can earn a living if you give up your standard of ethics and push every sale."
"Robert Half Technology",",My experience was great.  I don't have anything additional to say."
"Robert Half Technology",",They helped me with I was in need of a job, sent me on interviews as well."
"Robert Half Technology",",They were able to find me employment opportunities where I mostly provided short-term project assistance. The jobs themselves were nothing special or anything worth writing home about, but as short-lived as they were, they fulfilled a need."
"Robert Half Technology",",Quick offer but communication lacking after job assignment. Lower pay than other consulting firms. Pay is weekly and fast! Website is easy to navigate."
"Robert Half Technology",",I have done several contracts through Robert Half"
"Robert Half Technology",",I have learned a lot of new valuable skills and overcome many challenges."
"Robert Half Technology",",My recruiters are great and always work with me to find me work."
"Robert Half Technology",",Great company to be with, I got my first start in recruiting with this company and I highly recommend this company for anyone looking to get into recruiting."
"Robert Half Technology",",As a contract recruiter the entire RobertHalf  team treated me with respect & made me feel like a true member of their team. RobertHalf is a great company . I  enjoyed working with them. It is a place I will recommend for anybody that looking for  a job in any professional field"
"Robert Half Technology",",Great training not enough follow up once trainer. "
"Robert Half Technology",",The culture between teammates is the issue.  It's not really a team, it's basically every man for themselves."
"Robert Half Technology",",Worst company ever worked for and high turnover.  Most persons last 9 months and then are terminated or leave due to burn out.  Meetings just to have meetings.  Metrics over quality.  All about volume"
"Robert Half Technology",",Good company to work for when starting your staffing career. Decent training/on boarding depending on the team that you specialize in but I do believe this depends on the offices."
"Robert Half Technology",",Never give up finding work with Robert Half Technology because there are hundreds of people competing to get placed too and so be consistent with contacting staff. This company is great with customer service satisfaction."
"Robert Half Technology",",I have had mostly good luck with Robert Half."
"Robert Half Technology",",Unlike most firms, they tend to only submit you for jobs for which you are actually qualified."
"Robert Half Technology",",find a different temp agency low pay hard to build experience because your job type will be all over the place. Low pay low pay low pay"
"Robert Half Technology",",loved working here. If you want to advance your career within the staffing industry go here. Salary, benefits and PTO are solid"
"Robert Half Technology",",great company a lot of training to move up "
"Robert Half Technology",",great teamwork and management skills"
"Robert Half Technology",",hardest part was traveling"
"Robert Half Technology",",good pay and understanding for customer needs"
"Robert Half Technology",",This is a temp company and that pretty much explains the company. You work there and never know who you will be working with and or the pay. Usually 3 month contracts."
"Robert Half Technology",",Nothing but positive things to say, I’ve had great assignments and worked with some really cool people.There a very suppotive staff and they really seem to care."
"Robert Half Technology",",Salaried Professional Services is a great way to work with RHT."
"Robert Half Technology",",Flexible and constant work with good clients and compensation."
"Robert Half Technology",",Varied and diverse clients in a wide range of industries, if you like variety then this is the firm for you."
"Robert Half Technology",",The pay was nice though. They would call while you would be working to see how things were going and you would have to tell them you were in the middle of working. I think sending email would have been better especially if you were on the road at the time of the call. Technically they could be liable for that phone call made."
"Robert Half Technology",",Great work environment! Very team driven. Most employees enjoy the working together and are very willing and helpful when it come to completing projects. Manage and culture is big on work/life balance. I would recommend this company to others"
"Robert Half Technology",",A good company with lots of short term contract with some a lot of the major players.  Wish there were more long term contract of 1-2 years and more permanent work."
"Square","Good fit for new grads but not very engaging for senior sales professionals. Managers don't provide too much mentorship"
"Square",",Weak CEO does not provide leadership.  Employees do not work together to deliver solutions.  Lots of back stabbing and turn over."
"Square",",I worked here part time while at school. A great place with great employers. This business is now closed. I would probably still be there if not. Sad to see it go."
"Square",",I would love to work here in the future, I was part of high school code camp and I already fell in love with the culture of Square."
"Square",",There isn't a typical work day, each day is filled with new challenges and difficulties. Each day ending in satisfaction."
"Square",",I would never recommend this place to anyone to work. They treat their contractors like objects rather than people. They segregated us by colored badges just like the early 1900s. The 'Blue Badges' wouldn't even look at the 'Green Badges'. It was very discriminatory."
"Square",",Easy job. Everyone is nice. Long hours and must be attentive to detail. The expectations are high in order to get quality orders to customers."
"Square",",- Everyone is there to help!"
"Square",",- Friendly Coworkers"
"Square",",-Very Fast paced and challenging"
"Square",",-Transparency throughout the whole company"
"Square",",Square's work environment makes it really exciting to go to work every day. The people are so nice and it's a great place to learn and be more developed day by day."
"Square",",get company with diverse people. great benefits and the customers are awesome. family community. sincere, genuine people. awesome place of employment, i enjoyed my time with them."
"Square",",Three week training on products, hardware, troubleshooting, credit card processing, and company history. Then a few sporadic online training. Daily notifications and alerts of ""all hands on deck"" to say please work as fast as possible and avoid creating internal tickets and emails to focus on phone calls. Very difficult to get answers to questions from managers and other team members."
"Square",",The people are very friendly. Worked on a team with highly capable people. Managers respect your input. Changes and input to software is genuinely considered and evaluated."
"Square",",The company is fun and takes care of their employees. I enjoy my time working there through my recruiting group. Fun place."
"Square",",it really nice place to work it is great management, but hour is less for me at least I am looking for 40 hours a week and if possible ot that part."
"Square",",I value the time that I spent at Square because I I grew a lot in my own personal development. Square fosters a fun environment and carefully balances fun with working hard. It's a company that you can work for and be proud of the product."
"Square",",Great company with lots of talent. You're bound to learn something new several times a day. "
"Square",",Perks are great. Free food, flexible vacation policy and ..."
"Square",",One of the fastest growing companies eve."
"Chef'd","I enjoyed myself working with this company. My old co-workers were always respectful, caring and fun. The job was to prep the food and ship it out...."
"Chef'd",",Culture was great and exciting. Everyone is very welcoming. I learned how to become a leader and a manager with coaching from upper management. Best part of my day was working with my team and the hardest part of my day was getting short staffed and having a heavy load on work."
"Change Healthcare","Chaotic which is typical of a company going thru growth and trying to establish themselves in a positive manner. Overall, CH had good intent, but lacked the experience and leadership to effectively execute. I think in two or three years, they will be a formidable force in the corporate healthcare community especially now with McKesson's involvement."
"Change Healthcare",",This is truly a great company, it is a contract job working for the hospital but excellent benefits and independence.  I had knowledgeable management team and very supportive.  The company would take good care of the employee.  The benefits are outstanding they provided company perks that are very rewording.  The tool to do your job are always present and they help you along the way to set you up on what you need.  The communication with upper management is great and you don't feel like you are under them rather your working as a team."
"Change Healthcare",",change company is a great company to work for and offers opportunity for growth. management and staff are outgoing and very helpful. i enjoy what i do and the people i work with."
"Change Healthcare",",Change Healthcare's environment is very laid back. The company doesn't have a sense of direction. Laying full-timers off because of a merger."
"Change Healthcare",",Was normally organized.  I had one of the best team lead that had a great management style and was a outstanding teacher.  There was many ongoing training session on Claims Formatting, HIPAA Compliance, every aspect of the claims.  The hardest part of the job was pay was low and market rate.  The most enjoyable part was the coworker they were family."
"Change Healthcare",",Loved the company, hated that it ended so soon. Loved the benefits and pay and wouldnt mind coming back to work for them if I was able to"
"Change Healthcare",",Change Healthcare is one of the best places to work. Company culture is awesome! Always a reason to acknowledge and celebrate the people who live to change other peoples lives for the better."
"Change Healthcare",",Good working conditions until very abrupt layoff with possibly illegal 1 week break in health insurance. They gave me laptop, docking station and two monitors to use remotely. They paid all expenses when I visited the office."
"Change Healthcare",",As a patient advocate, you fulfill different duties as you assist patients and families in applying for state/federal benefits. This is the greatest reward of the job, but sometimes this is overlooked by executive management. Every application completed represents a person and/or family that no longer has to worry about the cost of medical expenses. The advocates are often the voice of reason and voice of comfort to a grieving family or gravely ill patient. The volume of work (patient referrals) are high at times, but it is manageable if you have organizational skills."
"Change Healthcare",",I think the company does need to do a better job with training. For too often, young healthcare representatives struggle within their first year because there is not enough classroom training or ongoing support. Management obtains grades or percentage of the new hires, however, trainers are not required to follow up with recruits which may be showing early signs of difficulty grasping the information. Therefore, managers whom often rely on the senior health care representatives have to go through additional training with the new hires with the hopes performance will increase.  Primarily, training is completed through webinars, but the type of work Healthcare Representative are expected to complete requires a more in-depth face to face training particularly on the federal process. The executive management needs to take a look at the training provided to the new hire to ensure their longevity."
"Change Healthcare",", Also, they need to rethink the salaries of Healthcare Representative.  Though, I agree the starting salary should"
"Change Healthcare",",  "
"Change Healthcare",", adequately reflect the cost of living in an area, there should be no reason why a new hire who does not have any experience with the company should make the same salary or more as a person who has been with the company longer  (3+ years) especially if they have no prior experience in working with state or federal benefits. "
"Change Healthcare",",For my location, I have a manager that is very flexible with time and often is very supportive to personal needs. My manager does assist the team with meeting the goals to ensure we are successful."
"Change Healthcare",",  "
"Change Healthcare",",Development, testing, customer interaction, payer interaction. Training and mentoring developers. Good teamwork environment as well as the ability to work independently."
"Change Healthcare",",The company is fast growing, but under employed.  Team atmosphere is low.  Poor training.  Salaried positions require several hrs."
"Change Healthcare",",I found myself working above and beyond the required responsibilities of my job and was never recognized or acknowledged.  Management was condescending pay was not comparable."
"Change Healthcare",",I actually worked as a contractor here, and just loved the whole atmosphere at this office - the coworkers were awesome, the management was approachable and fair, and it was probably one of my most favorite jobs."
"Change Healthcare",",The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry/impatient pharmacists who were having trouble processing the discount coupons, or dealing with those who just wouldn't listen to your instructions.  However, after a time, the problem got resolved and the pharmacist would hang up satisfied with their experience."
"Change Healthcare",",As a healthcare rep at the hospital, your day is very busy.  Interviewing patients and trying to stay detached from their problems becomes very stressful."
"Change Healthcare",",No comment on this company. No longer familiy oriented and employees who have been there a long time are let go first. No stability when you want to move into management"
"Change Healthcare",",Change Healthcare was a wonderful place to work and provided great opportunities and benefits. The culture is encourages individual growth."
"Change Healthcare",",You are busy all day long that time goes by fast."
"Change Healthcare",",I have to keep up with the multitude of payers and I am responsible to check status on a daily basis.  Always having to keep up with their enrollment instructions, never know when they will change."
"Change Healthcare",",Our managers are always looking for different ways to get us involved with activities outside of the job force.  "
"Change Healthcare",",I work with the best coworkers; we are more like a family."
"Change Healthcare",",Always worrying about the next set of layoffs."
"Change Healthcare",",Working with a great group of people."
"Change Healthcare",",Energizing and motivating.  Working in sales each day was different but challenging.  You have goals and sales to achieve.  Also mtg new clients and building relationships as their trusted advisor was an asset."
"Change Healthcare",",I was given the opportunity to work with a great group of team members in the HR department in Atlanta. I learned a lot and i will always valued the skills attained at Change Healthcare."
"Change Healthcare",",The work environment was pleasant because everyone on my team worked together and went the extra mile to get the job done. You didn't have to worry about slackers on the team.The workload was full but you always had someone there willing to help and provide you with the tools you needed to get the job done."
"Change Healthcare",",It is a good job that allows flexibility. Definitely great for someone who wants stability. Great supervisor, self motivating job"
"Discover Financial Services","Awesome company, treat their employees well, have monthly goals to achieve which are achievable.

"Discover Financial Services",",When you are having your interview they make it seem like the best place in the word. I would have to disagree. They constantly harass you about numbers and make you feel bad about yourself. Instead of helping you they just tell you that you're not doing what they want. Unless you are full time there are absolutely no benefits. If you miss 5 days because of illness you are fired. The management is there because they are loyal, not intelligent and sometimes it is embarrassing to know you work under such uneducated individuals. The job is boring. You take call after call for hours on end with one 15 minute break. The pay is low compared to the responsibility. Honestly, I could go bag groceries and make as much. The only positive is the coworkers. They seem to higher genuinely nice people."
"Discover Financial Services",",Discover was one of the best places I ever worked for. Everyone was so kind to one another and helped each other out. Management was great, especially when it comes to your personal life. the benefits and pay were great!"

"Discover Financial Services",",Made outgoing calls to card-holders that are delinquent on their to obtain full balance owed, set-up payment arrangements or settle to avoid account going to collections."
"Discover Financial Services",",It is a call center so expect to be on the phones. Unless higher qualified for non-phone job mental paitence is needed. They offer incentive but they have to many factors and stats. that affect how much if any you receive and also tax it heavily. Other than talking on the phones great environment to work in management and co-workers are all freindly."

"GM Financial",",Depends on the position you're applying for as to what your going to get from the department. Customer service (for example) is the typical standard of ensuring call volume, time management, phone etiquette are on point. Other departments have some leeway for a work life balance, but it just depends on your skill set, which is going to determine the leniency for that work life balance."
"GM Financial",",While working at GM Financial, I always prioritize my work.  Which included first posting and researching payments.  Secondly I would send out new request for refunds via fax, email.  Thirdly I would began the collection process which would take up the rest of the day.  This would include contacting the dealerships and product company; resolving all controversial issues and confirming promises to pay."

"GM Financial",",GM appreciates and values their employees. The company culture is laid back, but professional. Yet, not stuffy. I honestly wish I had never left. Wasn't worth it.

"GM Financial",",Great job and envionrment to grow and work. Not to mention the countless friends you gain working here, the people are awesome!"
"GM Financial",",The company has outstanding environment, management is very transparent and involved with their employees. There are 60 calls being made per hour on average, mostly voicemails being left with customers to return our call in an attempt to collect a debt. Co-workers are friendly and helpful, the design of the floor and working area has large walls that prevent additional socializing on the floor. I enjoy working close with the team leads and AVP's to discuss career growth opportunities."
"GM Financial",",Over all this is a great place to work and hands down there is plenty of work that needs to be done. But I need more money. I am having a hard time paying my bills. I just need more money."

"GM Financial",",as a small company you only have the choice to work and share your limited opinion."
"GM Financial",",However, still there are some challenges to prove yourself being learning from others."

"Fanatics Inc.",",Ups section is pretty laid back organzitions just make sure you arrive on time the manage shows  favoritism towards  certain employees which I personal didn't understand."

"Fanatics Inc.",",Overall good place to work, the pay is really good & the overtime is great as well . The only thing is that overtime is mandatory most of the time you really get no free time ."
"Fanatics Inc.",",Sadly, I only worked there a couple of months. However, the job was easy, the pay was amazing, and the people I worked with were fantastic! The only thing I didn't care for were the 60 hour weeks during peak. Other than that, an absolutely amazing job that I can't wait to go back to in the summer!"
"Fanatics Inc.",",Take 3 breaks first one 15  minutes 2ed break 30 minutes and last break before u go home 15 minutes again..  We stretch our body's as a group before starting work"

"Fanatics Inc.",",fast pace love the people could be ran a little better very many opportunities to succeed within the company. kind and very understanding people no matter which department."
"Fanatics Inc.",",I worked there for a couple months there are good people working with you but management and human resources needs improvement the reason i left was they were treating employees unfair paying one shift that comes in the same time does the same thing more just because they chose thay shift and then they shorted me on my pay two weeks in a row and im still waiting for my money"
"Fanatics Inc.",",They routinely give short notice on schedule changes, ie one day notice. The job description they have up for hiring for graphic design fashion apparel is misleading it's not graphic design at all it's image editing (really color matching, resizing and renaming) and if you're lucky you'll actually get to use Photoshop. Most adult aparel is sent to outsourcing now. Managers don't know what they are doing and have poor communication skills. There is definite favortism with those that suck up and promotions aren't based on hard work or knowledge. They change company policies at the drop of a hat. Has no set standards for how images are edited since there are so many exceptions. The attenance policy is not a great one and definitely not family friendly. They make promises and don't keep them on promotions and company incentives and change frequently. The department is treated like the red headed step child. Horrible communication between teams in the department. Department moral is constantly low and feels like a private high school with all the cliques and politics."
"Fanatics Inc.",",Management think they are above you, sexist and all about numbers.  They treat you like a number not a team member unless you suck up.   Supervisor. Put their work on leads as they get lunches and credit for department. Peek is horrible. Season, long hours,  You have people over dosing in restrooms, shooting up in parking lot. They drug test funny how they have leads and supervisors that really need a surprise drug test. ..FAIL........ metal detectors, funny most of your product is not metal. You work never call off and your mistreated It's a place everyone cheating or messing around,  so bad they make out in pick mods. If your married it will affect your marriage no morals in most that work there."
"Fanatics Inc.",",Low pay, hard/hot work, long hours, and terrible environment. I was hired during a ""mass temp hiring"" most of the hirees are from the ""hood"" (aka the Northside). You know its bad when you have to go thru a metal detector/security guard just to get in and out of work (the metal detector isn't for products since they make sports clothing)."
"Fanatics Inc.",",They will move you around and make you do jobs way outside of what you were originally hired to do while paying you the same low rate. As a order picker I picked clothes, you get the pleasure of dealing with mites that bite you, heat, dust, and the ""fresh"" color dye they use on the clothes that smell terrible and can't be good for your health."
"Fanatics Inc.",",Managers think they are above you and treat you that way (forget moving up in the ranks by working hard). The scanners they give you to pick clothing disconnect at least 3-4 times a day causing you more headache/delay."
"Fanatics Inc.",",Overall if you NEED a job, exhaust all other options before applying there, its a textbook dead end job"
"Fanatics Inc.",",good work hours"

"Stryker",",Stryker empowered me to take on responsibilities that were above and beyond my job description which allowed me to further increase my knowledge in Manufacturing (CNC Machining). My everyday goal at Stryker is to reach the max in production, motivate my team, and meet leadership expectations. I have gained considerable institutional knowledge which allows me to continue to provide significant value to Tibial Metal department and expand my role as needed."

"ADP",",- Good money if you can build a book of business."
"ADP",",Very fun place to work, great support but no the easiest thing to sell "
"ADP",",You are micro managed! and they track everything you do"
"ADP",",Corporate feel, work life balance is the best here"
"ADP",",Salary is great, location is great"
"ADP",",But upper management is changing all the times, everytime they change then your reporting will change also"
"ADP",",Unstable, being accounting and finance are being outsource out"
"ADP",",ADP is a great place to begin your career. I was hired right out of college and began at a new location they opened in Maitland, Florida. As part of the first batch of new hires, we were given the freedom to make our own culture. ADP management offered encouragement and guidance as we got several programs off and running."
"ADP",",Extremely micro-managed.  The boss was terrible and was very condescending to all of the employees, especially in sales.  I left there after being there about 6 months and ran out of the door."
"ADP",",management tries to create a fun office environment. benefits are good. job is tough but pay is rewarding, company tries to promote from within which is goo, lots of room for advancement"
"ADP",",ADP is great with promotions and job growth. ADP Promotes continued education and compensates accordingly. Work life balance is wonderful when eligible to work from home."
"ADP",",This is a very large company, always improving. This company embraces change and always has room for growth. They reviewed the employees constantly and promoted good work ethics. Compensation was great."
"ADP",",did not like the agency liked the company that I worked for and the TL was ok people on the team very young and childish nothing more to say about this place"
"ADP",",Data entry job doing payroll. Lots of opportunity to move up and gain different skills in small business. Upbeat and positive work environment. Great communication between management and employees."
"ADP",",ADP served as a great foundation to hone my challenger and consultative skills. Being one of the original in the industry, the old-guard mentality still exists heavily. My suggestion to management is to give people more opportunity to grow within the organization. Identify key players and move them through the ranks. We also need to shift focus to put clients first. Since ADP is a service provider, that should be key in what we deliver to clients day in and day out."
"ADP",",Barely room to grow. Let's say you do, and you're promoted. You're only allowed up to a 10% increase in salary and 10% being the max if you have a manager that fought for you. So what happens is that when you're promoted, having most likely already been underpaid to begin with, you receive your 6-8% (on average) increase, lets say you got lucky and they give you 10...you still fall below the minimum for the new job grade you fall in. The max increase cap is in effect for anyone and any position, no matter how far away from the minimum you are. Which creates such outrageous inequities. It's common knowledge that staying with most of the larger corporate entities that surround you and growing from within end up hurting you in terms of pay. But not even making the job grade minimum gives me zero interest in growing with a company that doesn't compensate me not even the minimum of what my colleagues would be receiving. "
"ADP",",About 80% of employee's at a certain level start off working as temps and are forced to stay as one for up to 2 years, I've heard of someone working as a temp for 5. There's no room to grow, the benefits are awful considering this is what they offer among other things. I've heard of small companies paying for their employee + family's healthcare entirely. ADP's plans are awful and very expensive."
"ADP",",Assisting external clients with ADP branded pay roll product issues, was the main work , located in several locations in the US training was done in Florida, loved to work there"
"ADP",",Working at the Dallas office of ADP was a horrible decision. There was no structure, it was so unprofessional, and only about 10 people in the entire office actually succeeded at their job."
"ADP",",to be able to wake up and have your own business helping customers rebuild and restore their dream vehicle, learned many new ways to build vehicles to customers standards, no hard parts to the job itself, very rewarding to know that customers were satisfied"
"ADP",",ADP is great! Love the call center enviorment some of the supervisors are great. Some are not. Work very hard, still a temp though. Need to get recognized for my hard work and my dedication. Need an employer to take my hard work fully and appreciate the good strong employees."
"ADP",",ADP is a great place to take your career in different directions.  I've managed sales teams for over 10 years at ADP and also in 5 different states.  ADP gave me the flexibility to grow my career.  I had great mentors and had many opportunities to give back as well to many fellow peers.  ADP is an overall great place to be!"
"ADP",",Great employee engagement and workplace culture.  However the workload was unrealistic and quality was sacrificed for quantity or productivity."
"ADP",",If you want overtime, it is freely given. I wish i could make more money by working more overtime even though I get five to ten extra hours because they asked me too. If you work mornings, it is a great idea because job life and life is balanced for the most part."
"ADP",",Terrific place to work and a great place to develop new and meaningful skills.  A wonderful place to work and utilize your skills,"
"ADP",",They are constantly hiring.They do however, have some high turnover. The culture is a great experience. They do feed us a lot and take time to train thoroughly."

"Seagate Technology",",* worked for 27 years at Seagate and got many opportunity to learn new things and apply them in a variety of jobs"
"Seagate Technology",",* great industry that is reaching the top of the S curve"
"Seagate Technology",",Worked hard to implement several organizational development programs to company employees.  I learned the importance in providing exceptional customer service to senior management and peers."
"Seagate Technology",",Let me preface this by saying that the employees are great; the people are fantastic. "
"Seagate Technology",",Management is bad. Continuous bad purchases lead to lower quarterly earnings leads to no bonus. Bonuses are based on things which you have no control over. Great quarter = small bonus. Bad quarter = no bonus. There is a constant fear of layoffs. You could be a year into your career and you could get laid off. The cuts are across the board and often arbitrary."
"Seagate Technology",",Very good work/life balance, benefits, and on-site amenities such as gym and cafeteria.  Low stress and great people."
"Seagate Technology",",Frequent restructurings and RIF's due to changing HDD market.  Expect more to come."

"Seagate Technology",",Pay was fairly competitive."
"Seagate Technology",",Good benefits."
"Seagate Technology",",Good working environment."
"Seagate Technology",",Seagate was a place that understood that the developers were their bread and butter.  Even their building was laid out to show that, the windows opened onto the cubicles, and the managers and VPs had offices on the interior."
"Seagate Technology",",Seagate is a fast paced technology company which challenges individuals to multitask on a daily basis. I have held many roles at Seagate which has required I learn the day to day systems and process used at the company. Management supports their team and helps nurture their growth within the company. The administrative staff at Seagate performs as a ""team"", everyone is always willing to lend a hand if needed. I truly enjoyed the team I supported."
"Seagate Technology",",Offers good experience in the tech industry.  However, working in software for a hardware company can be a bit frustrating at times as software-industry best practices aren't much of a priority.  Good opportunity for advancement for motivated and diligent individuals"
"Seagate Technology",",overall experience is good. High-tech, dynamic, lay-offs...The business is going up, which is a good sign. The last two years have been suffering."
"Seagate Technology",",Multiple projects with complex analysis plans required knowledge of materials, mechanics and analysis.  Also, the job required project/lab management skills, hazardous materials handling, mechanical understanding of the products.  Learned about coaching, lab management, product specfications, component specifications, and database utility.  Learned how to interact with co-workers in an effectively.  The hardest part of the job was conveying scientific principles to non-chemists which sometimes was not realized.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and the challenges we fixed."
"Seagate Technology",",Seagate is a great company to work for, and the compensation is also good. Most managers and colleagues are hard working and talented. We are thru technology transition. As a result, people who used to work on old technologies have to leave the job inevitably. Those people are mostly very talented and can make contributions if they get into other industries."
"Seagate Technology",",Working at Seagate has its pros and cons. I have learned a lot wokring there and don't regret it but leaving was the best thing I could have done. It was draining me mentally and emottionaly. When you go home everyday crying you know its time for an exchange."
"Seagate Technology",",The job is very easy and pays really well. The benefits are great once you become an offical employee. "
"Seagate Technology",",Management is not very good. They don't seem to care about the employees. They pretend to listen but aren't really. There are a few people there that are great people, but most the people there are suckups and back stabbers. They will do anything they can to move up. Some are so rude to customers and other employees. I've seen several employees make up lies and gossip about others and stab others in the back just to move up. Most of the people that Seagate keeps around are not good people. I lost repect for they company once I realized I there was no room for growth and that Seagate loves to keep terrible people."
"Seagate Technology",",That's another thing is that it is very very hard to move up. I worked there for years and tried very hard to move to other departments but you could only move up if you knew someone. "
"Seagate Technology",",Anyways the pay is amazing and the benefits are perfect. Those are the 2 reasons I stayed as long as I did."
"Seagate Technology",",I really enjoyed this place at first. Then there were way to many layoff scares and it became such a sad place. Maybe things will look up in the future."

"Seagate Technology",",The employees at Seagate were wonderful.  I liked the challenging work and the fast paced environment."
"Seagate Technology",",Manager was not interested in helping me advance.  There was more of a click in the group and outsiders were not as welcomed."
"Seagate Technology",",Seagate has a powerful brand proposition but it is challenged to find a relevant place. It wants to work successfully but working hard and working well as two different things. Its a very earnest company however."
"Seagate Technology",",A decent place to work. Depending on the department you're in, you might work in fear of layoffs. Not much effort for advancing people, you must do that your own. Hard for people like lazy coworkers to get fired unless laid off. Good work life balance though, lower pay than industry average."
"Roche","Experienced Hospital Account Manager. Established relationships with many call points in the hospital, providing glucose testing and blood gas analyzing solutions."
"Roche",",I successfully completed three co-op rotations at Roche Carolina Inc., in Engineering, Manufacturing, and Maintenance. At Roche, I was able to learn how pharmaceutical plants operate, and how to work effectively in teams to solve problems and help achieve results. I was fortunate to have worked with many different people from various background. It was a very rewarding experience."
"Roche",",This has been my best working experience yet. I was in charge of a project given by my manager and that gave me responsibilities which made me work harder to show what I'm capable of and leave an impression. Even though I worked there for a month as a summer job due to a program they have work their worker's sons, I enjoyed my time there learning and growing as a working person."
"Roche",",Absolutely loved my team!! Roche was a great transition job for me coming from Genentech. I felt like I was truly contributing to the company's success while being on the front lines as a client services rep supporting my sales team. The environment fostered open mindedness, productivity, fun, and team appreciation."
"Roche",",Great place to work. Learn valuable skills, low pressure environment but constantly improving. Great coworkers who are motivated and motivate you."
"Roche",",The best place to work at. I had an awesome experience during my year of service. Would highly recommend for direct / regular job or consulting. Very professional environment and people treatment."
"Roche",",It's a privilege to work at Genentech/Roche.  Genen Bus is very convenient to reach office.  I can work in the bus when needed.  The management is very caring about the employees; they provide needful resources to perform my job.  Co-workers are very supportive to each other.  The hardest part of the job is to participate in the meetings with folks in other continents - EMEA and Asia.  Sometimes, time zone different is challenging.  Celebrating the completion of mile-stones with the team is most enjoyable part of the job."
"Roche",",Great Place, Great Experience, 6 years of work with great partners, Human Resources its family, Everything its Good, focus in the future"
"Roche",",your typical summer resort, beautiful pacific northwest. Front desk operations, reservations, phone, advanced reservations, taking payment with credit cards."
"Roche",",The Roche facility has a great atmosphere with great employees. Roche is well respected in the pharmacuetical industry with a great reputation and a great place to work."
"Roche",",I've been a contractor for almost 13 years and it's been a great experience. Unfortunately automation is taking my position. Working at Roach one can expect high quality products and the new automation that's been installed high quality will continue."
"Roche",",Fast pace and good work environment.  The research facility has been closed so no longer applies, but it was a good place to work with a general severance package. Good management and coworkers..  The most enjoyable part of the job was the good science."
"Roche",",Roche Diagnostics specializes in the production of highly technical 'kits' used to diagnose and prevent illness. This complex industry requires tight communication between the United States and Switzerland, and up to the minute financial details required to meet market demand."
"Roche",",The company is progressive, treats employees like family members, and is setting new standards in health care."
"Roche",",Demanding, challenging, and rewarding environment - never a dull day.  Driven to be the best and deliver results for the customer and patients affected by cancer."
"Roche",",Roche is a great place to work. They host plenty of events throughout the year for the employees. As a contract worker, I find it difficult to become a Roche employee, it is definitely based on who you know."
"Roche",",My role in this job ranged from documentations expert to data manager to bio-statistician. Entering with a background in applied physics, I had a diverse and strong skill set, and this job required me to preform at all levels nearly all the time, whether I was networking with colleagues overseas to develop a testing procedure that would yield strong statistical power or to give an open presentation on our team's progress and statistical results. As my contract approached its end, my time was spent on data management and documentation."
"Roche",",The company provided ample support and cross-department assistance. The atmosphere was largely amicable and the employees were incredibly friendly, which alleviated the stress that came with the workload. "
"Roche",",I was given the space and guidance to learn R, quickly becoming our office's expert, and developed statistical analysis modalities for verification protocols. I learned quality control procedures and how to produce adequate scientific publication for FDA submission. Learning is my favorite part of any job, and my role at Roche allowed me to absorb the knowledge and experience I need to become a stronger industry scientist."
"Roche",",Our company was approaching launch when I joined, so my employment was restricted to a contractor position which did not grant vacation nor holidays. This was an issue for me, having missed out on holidays for the previous 6 years (4 during undergrad, 2 grad school), impacted by the high-intensity requirements of the job as we approached 510K/CE-marking submissions. These are the only qualms I had."
"Roche",",If you don't agree with anything, make sure to keep it to yourself.  You'll by walked out the door so quickly that it'll make your head spin. HR...clueless"
"Roche",",Roche is a very stable place to work, it provides great health, 401K and maternity benefits and job security. It's an international company with lots of growth opportunities internationally and locally."
"Roche",",The work/life balance and benefits are far superior to other employers in the area.  The overall attitude of all leadership is to be learn from you as they teach you and prep you for the next stage in your career.  The most difficult part of working for an employer like Roche is having corporate headquarters in another country.  It can tend to cause some angst in getting through red tape and the fact that things are ran differently in Switzerland vs the US.  In short, a great place to land and settle in for the long haul."
"Roche",",The direct reports control your outcome of your performance. The cafeteria is decent and the place is full of people who have worked more than 10 years. It is very difficult to win with the constant harassment by your reports and constantly going to HR to create havoc for the Manager."
"Roche",",Roche is full of intelligent people who are always striving to better themselves, their company, and their products. I worked as an intern in the Technical Transfer Team and could not have been happier with my experience. I was encouraged to learn as much as I could during my time their and everyone I met was enthusiastic and helpful."

"University of Pennsylvania",",Great learning environment due to interacting with individuals in various stages of their education and career. Post grad students, undergraduates, doctors, researchers, nurses etc... However, it takes awhile to move up and you are faced with heavy competition for jobs. Great benefits. Once your in, stay."

"University of Pennsylvania",",unlimited resources, world class teachers. and the top hospitals in the country. what I have learned the most is patience, and an unwilling resolve to never quit and always find a way."
"University of Pennsylvania",",I loved the job itself, have zero complaints about the work I was doing. I can not say the same about the people I was put to work with. Very rude and lazy."
"University of Pennsylvania",",good institution with lot of opportunities. Good environment to work. Well recognized in the world. Good library and journals are available online with institute's subscription."
"University of Pennsylvania",",I personally feel my experience was an eye opener. I was responsible for patient care along with the research/laboratory portion, which caused me to become better with my time management. When their were a lot of tasks that needed to be completed, I was able to organize myself, so I was constantly working/finishing tasks throughout the day, so they would all be completed by the end of the week."
"University of Pennsylvania",",UPenn had a good culture and good people working there.  Unfortunately I was stuck on a dog of a project, but beyond that, it was a great place to work."
"University of Pennsylvania",",a lot of changes going on.  With change comes anxiety of some employees.  Hard to get through to them that change is needed but continually try.  Great work environment"
"University of Pennsylvania",",On a daily basis, my responsibilities vary , which consist of no less than training new drivers, dispatching, payroll,  book keeping, road observations, driving when needed. The hardest part of the job is when I may have to terminate an employee."

"University of Pennsylvania",",Great experience as a teaching assistant. Learnt a lot of skills I normally would not have been able to polish. Hours can be long at times but a very enjoyable and rewarding experience."
"Kellogg Company","When I started, the job was not bad at all. Good people to work for, company car, gas card, company phone, good benefits. I did have to work in several places but the company car took care of that."
"Kellogg Company",",There have recently been managements changes along with other changes from corporate that have made this job into a nightmare. I work in a pretty expensive part of the country and for what they pay a manager is really laughable. Especially for the work they expect you to do. There's barely any work/life balance and if you don't hit what THEY want you to hit numbers wise, you look like garbage to them. Even if your doing your job! I was also not given any real management training and was thrown on a route that I knew nothing about. Manager said that they would give me training and I am still waiting for it as they say what I terrible job I am doing."
"Kellogg Company",",Bottom line, is a good job if your a merchandiser but once you move to management, you have to deliver. It's more money for management. But it's also more stress than they pay."
"Kellogg Company",",Great place to work overall. Always something more to learn about the business. Many opportunities to cross-train and advance in the company. Very understanding of work/life balance"
"Kellogg Company",",Easy job. Great benefits. Union guaranteed minimum pay. Well maintained trucks. Puts driver safety above all. Best job I have ever had. One in a million."
"Kellogg Company",",Pay, benefits and management were great. Good equipment. I'd be working there for years to come if not for the lay offs. I'll miss it."
"Kellogg Company",",Lots of change leading to instability within the organization. Great pay and benefits, constant restructure with no sense of job security within the organization."
"Kellogg Company",",The team was very passionate about the business and achieving the goal set forth for them. I is unfortunate that the dsd portion of the business is closing."
"Kellogg Company",",I was selected to tour the facility in Battle Creek Michigan, and help the company come up with more efficent ways to run their production line. The opportunity was one of the best i have had, even if it were only a co-op."
"Kellogg Company",",Kellogg Corporation making changes to downsize."
"Kellogg Company",",Being part of of huge organization, being successful in my sales management role and getting results to customers was key to my success with the company."
"Kellogg Company",",Don't really like the scheduling process. I still haven't received one ""data usage"" check.. and everytime I ask about it, I just get told "" they're working on a date so that the always come out on the same day."" Just run around after run around"
"Kellogg Company",",the layoffs hurt i have a family but u have to start from the bottom to move up but it was an good opportunity for me an i wish i could stay longer but i need job security"
"Kellogg Company",",You stock shelves with merchandise. Great if you're going to school and need a part time job. You work in the store with all the other store associates that work there."
"Kellogg Company",",it is a good environment I love the job it to learn different thing they let do overtime when you want to I love planet manager the job have nice peoples there and I won't mind working back there again"
"Kellogg Company",",This place went from a career, to average, to just a job.  It pays good and has good benefits for the area, which is why I stay.  Continuous change, as they tried to become Clearfield, then PPG, now are trying all the latest factory ""crazes"".  "
"Kellogg Company",",Nothing is steady and many of the management initiatives hinder our work.  This place used to be safe and was very clean, but they cut all the freezer cleans in half and overall cleaning frequencies to the point the oil is nasty and smokey before it is changed."
"Kellogg Company",",Overall, I will stay and work.  I once was a lead, but backed out due to all of this change and poor leadership.  I just hope our wages or benefits are not cut, otherwise I (along with lots of others) will leave."
"Kellogg Company",",Hanging out and hoping for change back to the way it once was."
"Kellogg Company",",Would never go back they didn't even know half the people that worked they not a very good place to work at they don't care about the workers we didn't get anything for hitting our numbers each day"
"Kellogg Company",",Ideal for someone looking for lots of hours and hard work, with good compensation for it.  Poor workplace for the family/free time oriented, because hours are completely unpredictable and it is impossible to make and keep plans.  Is poorly organized/has poor communication.  You feel left out on your own, but plus side to that is no annoying coworkers - you really only communicate with the scheduler and the sales rep. Advancement opportunities are available only if you are willing to travel and/or relocate."
"Kellogg Company",",Overall good company to work for. Kellogg is a food distribution center. At my facility, we made a vegitarian soy burger. It was rated the best in the country."
"Kellogg Company",",You are giving a set of stores and deliveries to work. You must be able to walk , go up ladders, crawl, move up to 50 pound, bend alot. work alone in each store and fallow through."
"Kellogg Company",",The company has jumped the shark. Recent changes in business model drops field employees (sales and merchandising) to a sub-level that gets absolutely no support from management. ""our way or the highway"" mentality rules. Employees and customers no longer matter as long as the trucks leave full and return empty. Management is selling out to the shareholders in an all too obvious manner. They expect the world and when they don't get it the blame goes to the over-worked and poorly scheduled field employees. Stay away-stay very far away!!"
"Kellogg Company",",Definitely not a job for the minority worker.  I felt looked down upon by upper management and never was given a chance for advancement, even though my reviews were always good."
"Kellogg Company",",I have recommended to all my relatives and friends to not come here, to go elsewhere for jobs.  I don't want them to be treated like me and feel unsafe in job security."
"Kellogg Company",",Typical day would be paying bills for accounts payable, interaction with vendors to resolve any problems that may arise, (damaged products, etc.) then making sure payroll is updated and submitted to Corporate weekly."
"Kellogg Company",",This is the best place to work for so many positive reasons. Kellogg spoils us with great pay, 401k match and top of the line healthcare. They also have many jobs to choose from. your future depends on your hard work."
"VF Corporation","Great company to start your career out with.You will learn a lot in a short amount of time, however, no room for growth from within."
"VF Corporation",",The distance from home was a tough commute for the amount of pay I was receiving and not enough hours to give out."
"VF Corporation",",Not a whole lot of business coming in and out"
"VF Corporation",",Great place to work the managers really care and try to get to know you as a person and not just an employee they make things fun and keep drama down and always keep you informed with what is going on in the company"
"VF Corporation",",team work,, pleasant work environment.  "
"VF Corporation",",learned to work on and adjust sewing machines"
"VF Corporation",",management was friendly and helpful"
"VF Corporation",",hardest part of the job was working on conveyors"
"VF Corporation",",the most enjoyable was working with the team members"
"VF Corporation",",I can only say how my experience was as an intern. I loved the whole experience. I was treated with respect and compassion at every step. I felt like I had a real work family not just a job. Even on a day that I felt not 100% I still looked forward to going to work there."
"VF Corporation",",Great opportunity to learn more about the industry in a fun and professional environment.  Very helpful in making sure you get course credits."
"VF Corporation",",Great opportunity.  Great company.  I represented 6 apparel lines.  A great career company.  I left for another opportunity.  That was a mistake on my part."
"VF Corporation",",I've been at the job for awhile now and I have the skills but was not advancing. I don't get enough hours or pay and the company doesn't give part time employees any benefits anymore."
"VF Corporation",",A typical day of work depends on what dept you're in, in shipping mostly you will be on the lines all day, but if they need you somewhere else they will move you around. Mostly gonna be walking all day picking up boxes and taking them to their locations and pulling out pallets and what not. I learned plenty of things as this was my first warehouse job. Management doesn't seem to be that good, the leads and supervisors don't really do much but sit around or stare at u while u work, occasionally they walk around and find ways to get people in trouble. Their really isn't a hard part of the job, once they train you its a pretty easy job, sometimes it can actually be chill if its slow, but expect to be sore when you first start out as your feet and body isnt used to walking all day and carrying boxes. As for the most enjoyable part of the job well that's when your on lunch when you can finally just chill and eat, and when you're finally off work."
"VF Corporation",",I loved working for the corporation. They were very helpful when I had issues using my employee discounts to other stores within the company. I only hear good things from my co-workers."
"VF Corporation",",Your whole life is about VF. Typical corporate culture,one hand does not know what the other is doing. Great place to learn the basics and move on.The store culture is fun and people get along good."
"VF Corporation",",Vf was a great part time job. the staff there was awesome and very supportive. Many employee appreciation days. plus the 20 percent discount off already low prices is pretty sweet.only left because i was offered a full time job"
"VF Corporation",",Leaves employees handicapped by having to ask a team leader for answers while on calls, as well as having to put customer on hold for 15/20 minutes to get the answer almost every call. If you have an emergency at work for personal reasons you will get a point for having to leave work (sick child, school problems etc) they are not efficient in handling product problems in a timely manner, most of the time you are dealing with very angry customers of no fault of your own. But it was a paying job."
"VF Corporation",",Friendly co-workers, clean/new office space.  "
"VF Corporation",",Location is right across from 2 train stations."
"VF Corporation",",Great view of NYC skyline."
"VF Corporation",",Good management and friendly employees all around enjoyable place to work. Organized clean environment and customer-friendly. Also large variety to choose from starting from newborn to adult"
"VF Corporation",",My typical day at vf outlet is that it is very busy during rush hours. We had amazing co workers. Most enjoyable time at vf outlet was meeting different faces"
"VF Corporation",",All the work is layed out for you. Communication skills are great at a corporate level. Too much fraternizing at store level and Store managers have favorites. They also tend to hired friends and family which makes for an uncomfortable work place and unfair promotions."
"VF Corporation",",They were really great to there employees.  Management from the President on down were willing to teach.  Benefits were great"
"VF Corporation",",This job taught me a good leason. Sometimes it's not you as the employee that is bad but the management can also be wrong. Sometimes it's just the wrong fit. Bit when the boss repeatedly tells you that you suck at your job and that's he's going to fire you as an example (at least 3 times a day) you just leave. Change of management was a bad decision for the company. However for some reason they don't care. But when the boss gives you the worst review you've ever had from any person in the company (before this person was there everybody always said i did great and was improving steadily). This manager said a blind monkey could do my job better than i. Pay increases came in the form of a few cents. Benifits sucked and insurance covered nothing. The best thing was that they matched your 401k contributions. Very little room for growth within the company very little support. They make life very stressful in and outside of work. So maybe this was just porr management or I wasn't the right fit but it definitely ruined my opinion of the whole company when my concerns and complaints went ignored."
"VF Corporation",",Great company loved being a part of the team!! They invest time and energy into coaching and developing all staff. We have wonderful peer support and great Dm support."
"VF Corporation",",Worst place to work. They work you like a dog, don't appreciate you, give you as little pay as possible and overall treat you very badly."
"Adecco: USA","love working with the clients , fun environment , have to have a good heart and patience to work in this field.  the most enjoyable part about the job is spending time with the clients they become your family"
"Adecco: USA",",This is a company filled with lies and twisted information. They never let you know of changes, lie about pay and assignment dates, and do not value their employees. If your assignment is set to end one date they will tell you the date is further out than it is, let you come to work and tell you at the end of the shift randomly your assignment has ended."
"Adecco: USA",",Working at Publix will teach you a lot, including the fact that you should work for a great company which looks out for your well-being and also cares about you."
"Adecco: USA",",The Job is just what the company is Temporary. I couldn't keep an assignment for long. The lay off temps very quickly. The company is not at fault. They always do what they need to do to reassign workers."
"Adecco: USA",",Not the best place to work at. Management is not the best. No room to grow. No life work balance and not very comprehensive."
"Adecco: USA",",Working for adecco and CTDI was the Worst place to work management and leads have really bad communication,  they don't appreciate your work. From one day to another they terminate you for being 1 or 2 minutes late. When in reality I had work for them  in past 10 hour shifts seven days a week.."

"Adecco: USA",",Working at Adecco was a great experience. I appreciated the job placement. There career coaches really take time to work with each individual. They help find the best fit for you."
"Adecco: USA",",They do not care if you are happy where you work or if you are treated well. They do not care if you are ever hired on, in fact, they prefer you never be hired on so they make more money. Most of the time they have no idea what the job they're placing you at, even entails. Most of the time, they have only walked through the location once. Just stay away from temp agencies. This one bad mouths other temp agencies as well, which only goes to show."
"Adecco: USA",",At work I picked material from shelves to prep for shipping. Not enough pay for the  hours i worked after pay went down from seasonal pay. No good management to motivate  workers especially when hours and pay gets cut"
"Adecco: USA",",When I worked at Adecco USA it was a good time most of the time  they are very strict about being on time from your break and your shift pretty easy to get terminated"
"Adecco: USA",",The staff at the Adecco in Parkersburg, WV are top notch professionals and some of the friendliest people I've ever dealt with. The job that they set me up with turned out to be a permanent career. I work for a great company and my co workers are friendly and we all get along great. The best part is there is only 6 of us so when we get things done it feels great. This is by far the best job I've ever had and I have Adecco to thank for it. They gave me a opportunity when the Adecco staff in Wheeling, WV wouldn't."
"Adecco: USA",",It's just that it's temporary and I work for an agency so room for advancement seems so far away. I like the work environment and I would like to move around a little bit more but we will see."
"Adecco: USA",",a typical workday 8-12 hrs. Learned a lot about production and warehouse. Management was very motivated and helpful. Hardest part of the job was starting very early mornings. Most enjoyable part of the job was the work environment and the people."

"Adecco: USA",",Overall it is not a bad company to work for. The management team could be a little more eager to help with problems you may have. Although when they do get around to helping you problem is usually solved"
"Adecco: USA",",The job was okay. Job culture could have been much better and organized. I enjoyed the job security there, you are guaranteed to get  plenty of hours (which I enjoyed)."
"Adecco: USA",",I would work for this company again if I had the opportunity. I would love to have been given a permanent position with this company . I would love to have been in a different vertical though but other than that I really had a wonderful experience working for this company."

"The Jackson Laboratory",",Terrible treatment of employees (really bad), customer service skills lacking (everyday making new rules in all departments) Demanding the impossible in work, and overwhelming stressful workplace (physically and mentally, as a result so many injuries are happening). They believe in favoritism and quantity over quality. Mostly all coworkers believe the have received the one over and are unhappy ( not just 2 or 3, a LOT like 40 or 50)"

They really take care of their employees, promote a healthy work/lilfe balance and they value innovative thinking.  This is definitely one of the best employers in the state of Maine."
"The Jackson Laboratory",",The staff was great. All your managers treated you equal not like they are above you. The benefits are great they match 401 k. lots of holidays and day off including two floating holidays every six months. The hardest part of this job is you have to be determined and ready to work and do everything, once you get in routine it is easy. Just now your managers  is always their for you."

"The Jackson Laboratory",",Since Jackson Labs is a premier institution for mouse genetics, we had access to a large array of genetically modified mouse models, free of cost. This facilitated testing of various hypotheses in relevant mouse models without compromising on time or lab resources."
"The Jackson Laboratory",",The most exciting part of being at Jax was getting an opportunity to acquaint myself with the tools of mouse genetics that help identify modifier genes. These are genes that act as suppressors or enhancers of disease phenotypes and will form the very basis of personalized medicine in the future. "
"The Jackson Laboratory",",The ambiance is great and people are friendly and helping. The extreme weather conditions were sometimes hard to tackle."
"The Jackson Laboratory",",Many opportunities to learn and grow. Integrated approach to running a business, ability to gain experience in all aspects of project management."
"The Jackson Laboratory",",A typical work day involves continuous use, development, and design of biological assays and subsequent analysis of assay results. Skills gained include, but are not limited to: specific lab techniques and use of analysis software, multi-tasking, critical thinking, email communication with customers and upper-level management, and team work with co-workers to work towards a shared goal of customer satisfaction and quality results. Co-workers are focused and expected to meet specified metrics. The department is divided into several different teams, each with its own ""team lead"" and specific set of assays. More advanced technicians are cross-trained to fill in for absent coworkers. The most difficult part of this position is the constant flow of work and the unrelenting pace of the work. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is the autonomy granted and individual responsibilities allowed to each employee- this demonstrates a high level of trust in the technicians by upper-level management and is a reflection of the competency of employees."

"The Jackson Laboratory",",The Jackson Lab is a unique not for prophet organization that has three main focuses; world class customer service related to supporting research using mouse models, cutting edge translational research and quality education both on and off campus."
"The Jackson Laboratory",",The lab has focused in developing internal resources to truly provide a space for high quality products and research. The dichotomy of having a thriving research program and an large production facility sometimes makes managing the lab as a whole seem awkward, but this has also allowed the lab to explore product and research space not possible for other institutions."

Every day is work but also friendly involvements with coworkers. Their motto is a fun job environment creates good workers and good workers create a good business."
"Zappos Family of Companies",",A typical day consists of being on the phone talking with your customers. Seeing how their day went, becoming their friend and also taking care of their needs. The zappos office is fun, decorated quirky, however it can become repetitive. This is a great place to work if you ENJOY customer service. You have to love doing it or it will get tiring if that isn't for you. Management is personable, the culture is nice, and overall it's just a great place to work for at least one time in your life!"
"Zappos Family of Companies",",No day is exactly the same.  If you enjoy fast pace company with a culture and corporate family that is second to none, this place is for you.  Depending on the department, your schedule is quite flexible, which includes Work from Home days.  If you don't enjoy constant change and prefer predictability, this will not be for you."

"Zappos Family of Companies",",Great place with a fun unique culture. Core Values that guide the business model and culture. Tony does not just hide in an office, he actually gets out and interacts with everyone. Role and titles don't stop anyone from interacting nor sharing their ideas."
"Zappos Family of Companies",",Right balance of work, play and life."
"Zappos Family of Companies",",Culture was huge for them!!! They believed that in your work environment, you should also be able to have fun and feel appreciated for your work and efforts. With them, they fully did that to the extent!! Even though during peak season, you would have to work 12 hour days or 6 days a week, they showed that they truly cared that you would do that for them. They made sure that you were also well taken care of while working. The hardest part of that job was being on your feet all day but your coworkers were always fun to be around and your managers showed that they truly appreciated what you did and the company would take the time and effort to show you that they appreciate all you did. Was sad to see Amazon take over."
"Zappos Family of Companies",",never had worked for a company as such before. they operated like a family and even had meals catered to the employees. the work was easy and getting to use computers and karaoke machine at break times was a nice plus."
"Zappos Family of Companies",",Tony Hsieh is a genius, sadly not involved in running the business anymore.  Business management is weak. Fun place to work and nice people.  Las Vegas is a very odd community."
"Zappos Family of Companies",",Sold out to Amazon, now that place is TORTURE. No culture, no care, no love, no commitment, your just a number. Tony was a sell out and left many people behind to suffer to the hands of amazon. A company that does not care about employees or their safety and well being."
"Zappos Family of Companies",",I worked at zappos for over 9 years and enjoyed the experiences and work I did there!  The management is like most companies, but the people that work side by side with you make it what it is today; a fun, challenging, entertaining place to work."

"Zappos Family of Companies",",Everything is awesome at Zappos. I really enjoy that there is lots of support. It is a wonderful company to work for. The company offers many different perks. Cheap gourmet coffee. Free lunches."
"Zappos Family of Companies",",Call center and distribution center employees love the company because they pay everyone the same whether you work 80 hours a week in marketing on salary or work 40 hours a week in the call center hourly. So half the company is picking up the slack for everyone else enjoying the free booze at the office. And work life balance is non-existent because they only want you to work then your social life is work happy hours."
"Zappos Family of Companies",",I feel that Zappos is the type of company that values its workers education and experience above their profit margin. I have no complaints."

"Zappos Family of Companies",",In a state of change for the past 4 years, overall okay place to work if you live in Las Vegas.  Lots of needless perks..free food, parties.  Would be better if they valued employee talent. Employee ambition is killed after a while, upper management is living in 2007."
"Zappos Family of Companies",",I was just a seasonal employee but I learned so much about business in general from working at Zappos. I honestly felt European how much they cared about my well-being... They just talked about free food, fun and benefits. The best part is that they care 100% about the customer experience versus their numbers! Its risky but it pays off for them!"

"CARVANA",",Great Job, However the pay could be better in some areas. Also staffing seems to be focused in one area and not evenly distributed. There is a napping pod! yes a napping pod! Waffles, food trucks and just overall friendly staff. It can be stressful but I love it!"

"CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY, CHICO","Learned how to do different task on duties and get it done before deadline. Learned how to work in small group and as an individual. Management were good and was very helpful. Co-workers are fun to work with. The hardest part about the job is that you don't get the weekend off and it is hard to request days off.

"State of Arizona",",Finishing the project that makes the division look good."
"State of Arizona",",I'd show up, do my job for the day, then just go about my life. I got along fine with management. I only had a couple co-workers, but they were easy to work with and had no problem working together as a team. I wouldn't say there was anything hard about the job. It wasn't exactly enjoyable, but it was okay."
"State of Arizona",",there is nothing good to say about this place ever it sucks and if you go you get nothing but heartache and it can and or wont be your fault pooooooop"
"State of Arizona",",Out of 600 co workers only a few will do something about all the illegal drugs and contriband. But still nice co-workers I would say. Management isn't half bad. They tend to hire nothing but youngster these days that aren't men yet. The girls they hire get alot of respect from inmates but when assaulted it's pretty bad."
"State of Arizona",",Wonderful place to work. Enjoyed learning about the trucking industry. Exposed to outstanding trucking company owners and employees. Participated in multiple functions."
"State of Arizona",",Operations management refers to a focus on the practices designed to monitor and manage all of the processes within the production and the distribution of products and services. The largest activities that operations management focuses on are product creation and service development, and the efficiency with which both are distributed. Managing purchases, monitoring inventory and preserving quality are the primary goals. Operations management often includes analyzing a company's internal processes. Ultimately, the way that an organization carries out operations management depends upon the nature of products or services that it offers."
"State of Arizona",",I have work for Adult Protective Services as an investigator 2 years and the only reason I stay is because I can work from home and make my own schedule. The state provides great benefits, but the department does not offer raises, bonuses are scarce and 12% of your paycheck goes toward retirement, which is insane. The employees are typically great to work with, but there is high management turnover and management tends to micromanage you whenever they give you an overload of cases and all of the work can't get done in 40 hours. There are too many cases, not enough workers and it is very hard to get overtime. The worst part of the job is the constant policy changes every few months."
"State of Arizona",",Security is no longer there when your constantly worried about which administration will be there next and what people, managers, etc will change with it."

"State of Arizona",",got equip[tment for Doctor ready, called patients to confirm appointments, took payments, cleaned areas. Management was at my service when ever needed. Co-workes very friendly and great at their jobs. Hardest part was hiring co-workers of trust. Best part was learning about the dental procedures."
"State of Arizona",",A typical day at work for my position would be handling personal files and arranging them. management for this department was the best never worked with such a tight group"
"State of Arizona",",Overall, the job itself was rewarding because we had the ability to impact the lives of many children who had been apart of the system for most of their lives.  However, I believe most upper management positions took for granted how difficult and overwhelming the position could be.  Many case mangers were given an unreasonable work load without consideration for the demands of each case.  The hardest part of this job was trying not to become emotionally attached to the children you worked with, but the most enjoyable part was working with these children and making a difference in their lives."
"State of Arizona",",High learning curve, enjoy the work.. not the rate of pay.  It seems only the people at the top are concerned about their money, and do not remember all the people supporting the agency.  Poor leadership, especially when the leadership have not SEEN the people below them in over five years.  I think there is a lack of coordination, and leadership by the senior staff."
"State of Arizona",",Good place to Begin and End a Career. There are many good people who are dedicated to service the people of the great State of Arizona. Many of the staff and management are willing to go the extra distance to meet and exceed the need of the people of Arizona."
"State of Arizona",",Customer centric but very fast paced. Must remind staff to take breaks. Management turnover high, very unstable for learning new management techniques."
"State of Arizona",",Co-workers are fabulous, the ability to assist people with their needs provides great fulfillment.  The hardest part of the job is having to tell clients that they don't qualify for benefits when you can tell they were counting on receiving anything, no matter how much or little.  Greatest part of the job is being able to tell people that they can receive much needed assistance and seeing some of their daily stress lifting off of their shoulders."
"State of Arizona",",The State pays well but the work environment is mundane with little chance of advancement.  Management has promoted several employees with positions of supervisor when these employees were not good in their current positions.  A highly stressful workload burdens employees with daily tasks which exceed 33 percent the traditional workload."
"State of Arizona",",Decent job. Stable. Excellent benefits. Excellent coworkers. Not the most glamorous job in the world, but okay. Very good teamwork."
"State of Arizona",",With the state I evolved my skills in time management, organization, bookkeeping, communication, multi-tasking, social networking, research and problem solving."
"Praxis Engineering","Company with integrity, respect for their people, and as they continue to grow, they try to maintain a small company attitude and keep their employees feeling like 'they' are the company!"
"Praxis Engineering",",A small company with wonderful benefits.  Very hard work, but refreshing to be heard by management."
"Praxis Engineering",",I would still be there if government funding had not run out on funding."
"Praxis Engineering",",I had a great experience working with Praxis. Relaxing and kind environment to work within."
"Praxis Engineering",",Praxis has more legit work than I am used to. Previous employers had never given me an opportunity to pick the type of work I wanted to do. I don't feel that the good work is a mystery here, it's shared with everyone and I can be in charge of pursuing my own interests and have the support of my management, seemingly profit coming 2nd. I've been encouraged to pursue training in areas of emerging technology, and cost hasn't been a concern. When I had a surgery, my family received a very thoughtful care package, and I have noticed an overall commitment to employees being a priority. It's the first place I've worked where I've felt the company has a heart. The other engineers I work with are very good, consistently. I've not met one that made me wonder how they got hired and I've learned that I am given the benefit of the doubt by customers because I work at Praxis. Because this is confidential and I won't have to admit it publicly, I admit that I have grown professionally here in large part due to the people from Praxis I work/interact with. I've also started brewing at home thanks to a special interest group I am a part of at the office. Excited for my first creation. As long as my profit sharing, bonus, projects, and annual increases aren't cut, I can't currently see any reason to want to move on."
"Praxis Engineering",",I've only been with Praxis for about 6 months but I love the group here. It's hard to find a company that genuinely encourages a good work/life balance; most companies say they do but rarely follow through. Just about everyone I know here is involved in something outside of work: charities, running clubs, theater, etc..., and whatever you want to participate in, the company will almost always provide some kind of support."
"Praxis Engineering",",As for the work environment, it's the little things that I've been impressed with here. In this industry it's often the case that the contracts you work on don't vary all that much regardless of who you're working for, but how the company supports you on those contracts does. My initial set up here was quick and seamless, from HR and the whole hiring practice to IT and getting my workstations running. I've seen enough incompetence in those areas in other companies that I notice when it's done well."
"Praxis Engineering",",Bottom line: In my career I've worked for very large defense companies, an extremely small one, and even a gaming studio, and I can say without reservation that Praxis has the best mix of interesting work, well-rounded employees, and great ownership."
"Praxis Engineering",",The Praxis Management team is an outstanding group of knowledgeable technical and business professionals. They guide the company and the policies. They ensure that the employees and staff are provided the best training and opportunities. We, as employees, are encouraged to pursue training, certifications and additional degree programs that both interest us and benefit the company. What makes us better makes the company stronger. The dedication of management and employees to customer success drives all of us to do our best. When we exceed customer expectations and requirements we increase the opportunities for the company and employees to expand our base of satisfied customers. The hardest part is choosing what to study next. In a way the training opportunities are like being in a candy store and having to choose one treat at a time. Truly, the only limitation is how much you restrict yourself as an employee. The opportunity is there. My co-workers are great and it's always a relaxed learning environment. The most enjoyable part is the balanced approach. We work hard and the management recognizes that and holds activities to show appreciation for our efforts. What I've learned is that it is okay to speak up and share ideas. On any given day any one of us may come up with an idea that makes a difference to one or more customers. The job is always interesting, challenging and rewarding all at the same time."
"Praxis Engineering",",Praxis Engineering is a collection of talented minds that like to have fun. Very collaborative and productive culture. Management is available and approachable. Corporate goals are clearly defined and the vision is engrained into the daily routine. Solutions driven (not just butts in seats)."
"Praxis Engineering",",My time with Praxis has been truly enjoyable. Company is built upon and driven by its core values, which translates into a balance between productivity and fun. Full of great people that are customer driven."
"Electrolux","Start work at 730am. go through mesages and check for my customers who need immediate service. Check for orders to be delivered and map out my route for sales calls for the day. i learned how to close a sale and fine poits of cold calling. Management was pushy and selfish.My coworkers were excellent and very competitive in a good way.  The hardest part of the job was the door to door sales calls and rejections. the most enjoyable part was closing that deal after a hard day cold called and door to door canvassing."
"Electrolux",",Typical corporate environment.  There are opportunities to learn and grow if you take initiative.  Global company so there are global opportunities.  Decent work/life balance as product care engineer not sure about other roles.  Travel to Mexico is required for my role"

"Electrolux",",Overnight production of 3000 per night.  Safety first .  Reports and inventory.  Fix issues that might occur during the shift such as bubbles, broken wheels, machine related mistakes or flaws"
"Electrolux",",I love the idea of working in a factory, because I love hard work and getting my hands dirty, but they're very strict and almost 100% unforgiving about attendance. The way they look at it, you're replaceable."
"Electrolux",",this job is like modern day slavery. standing up working 8 hrs shifts. it was torture, and you couldn't go home until you reached the production goal."
"Electrolux",",It's hot and the machinery is loud, but the pay is good.The breaks don't last long enough, and the lunch is expensive. Other than that I can't say much else."
"Electrolux",",Was great place to work. Team mates were easy to get along with. Pay and benefits were excellent. Training for jobs were done with patience and skillful persons."
"Electrolux",",I learned how to manage the sales aspect as well as the customer service aspect.  This is a great place to lean new things and a fun work environment."
"Electrolux",",I worked on an assembly line dealing with ovens. I did my part to keep the assembly line moving at it's correct speed. I also moved around and worked different parts of the line."
"Electrolux",",my day at work start at 9:30pm-6:00am and I work on three lines "
"Electrolux",",the first line is line 6 and I just stand there and the ovens go around in a circle and I just have to test the ovens to make sure everything works . the second line is line three where I have to pull the ovens and then I have to turn the ovens around and use the fire attend to make sure that it heats up and that the burns work. the last area that I work in is the back of smooth top and I just have to cheek the tops to make sure they don't have any marks or anything wrong with them . I work very good with my management . my most enjoyable part of my job is that it a very easy to learn job"
"Electrolux",",They place any one in management that has been working for the company for a number of years even if they don't have leadership skills. They allow leads to run the entire floor with out supervisors there to over see if the job is being done properly. Leads will take their friends off the line so they don't have to work and put more work on others. The person that was suppose to do the relief did not know how to do all of the jobs or if she did not like you, you would not be relieved. There is a high turnover rate because its not a good work environment"
"Electrolux",",The managers were practically non existent. As a new hire not knowing anything about the job, there was no one there to help. Employees constantly argued, made lewd jokes all the time and it was generally not a good place to work."
"Electrolux",",This is a great place to start your growing career. There is room for growth and to learn more about a call center environment. Handling consumer calls when they are frustrated and locating the proper resolution, can be a difficult task."
"Electrolux",",The people and the benefits were good. When it was time to get off work. Put washer and dryers together. Got payed holidays that was nice. Got vacation time."
"Electrolux",",The company is global.  It is a call center and can be stressful. You learn many systems.  The company  hires temp but you can become a permanent employee.  You can advance in the company if you choose.  It is constantly changing. You meet some great people.  The hardest part are the irate customers and sometime management seems far removed from reality."
"Electrolux",",stressful and very poor leardership, and they say have good advancement but that was a lie to. only good thing some of the people that work there. and the hardest part of the job is trying to stay positive and work hard"

"Assurant",",Assurant Health was a great place to work with many opportunities available to grow. Unfortunately due to certain circumstances Assurant Health needed to close their doors."
"Assurant",",Working at Assurant was great when it came to the work and my coworkers were great but management is horrible. You'll find a few good people (and you better keep them close, saved my butt once). The turnover rate there is so bad, I've seen so many people come and go there, even genuinely good people. HR does not put the Human in Human Relations, they have no interpersonal communication skills they act like robots and treat everyone like robots too. My advice for any new people there is just be careful I've seen people get fired over things normal jobs who care about their employees would never fire someone over. I would not be surprised if they have hired and fired about half of York County by now."
"Assurant",",This job has taught me how to handle certain situations carefully. This will improve customer service skill and computer knowledge. It has its good and bad days. Management will try to make the place as comfortable and enjoyable as possible."
"Assurant",",Excellent place for an employee to grow.Multiple work options so it gives you ample opportunity to add work experience to your resume. Flexible schedules and pay."
"Assurant",",While I really loved the people I worked with in my department, the work could get tedious and the management was not great. They weren't very good with appreciation in my department. You didn't have a lot of opportunities for advancement within the department, and the only way to be promoted is to leave the department. "

"Assurant",",Nice people to work with"
"Assurant",",Management was great, the job although stressful was fulfilling, the dress code and environment was professional to semi-professional.  We could earn or purchase passes to dress casual, the proceeds from those sales went to the huge company Christmas party at the end of the year.  Constantly had bake sales, and potlucks going on by various depts., and groups.  They sponsored huge benefit drives, and we raised money for various non-profit organizations, ( red cross, united way, etc.)   Environment of constant learning with team building seminars, and personal growth seminars.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who felt as if they were wronged by the company, the most enjoyable part was calming and explaining to the same customer the program and how it worked and allowing them to see step by step that the program is actually built to benefit them.   Making a happy customer gave me joy."

"Assurant",",This company gives you great experience. You can enter as a entry level job and gain enormous experience. The most enjoyable part of the job is  the activity the company sets up for the employees. They do alot of family oriented activities through out the year. In my department you are constantly getting trained on something new, which can be a con and a pro. You dont spend much time on the same task. I feel it has been hard to move around in the company or department for that matter. They want you to have experience, however sometimes you arent given the opportunity to show what you are capable of."

"Assurant",",I would assist administrative assistant with clerical duties, such as filing, data entry, copying and scanning. I learned how to make security badges with employees' pictures and names on them, input them into company security system and maintain them. My immediate supervisor was the best, but during the period of time I had to make ID badges for the whole office, I met many members of management, and they were all very accommodating and kind. I had to interact with the whole office and I've never seen such upbeat employees on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job for me was the commute. Other than that, it was a great place to work."

"Pearson","This is not a career. Works better for retirees and students seeking to earn extra money while in school. The pay is isn't great and hours are not guaranteed. Not a good thing when you are paid by the hour and you have a family and bills to pay. Do not make this career. I'm a Test Center Manager therefore I make my own schedule. We interact with dozens of candidate each day taking various professional licensing exams. We are the security part of the exam to ensure it's integrity is protected. The job also entails administrative work. In this job I have been a Test administrator, Manager, Security, a computer technician, a plumber, a handyman, a customer service representative, a coordinator among other titles. I hire the staff and I really enjoy working with my teammates. We work together in order to get candidates seated by the 8:30 AM deadline. Working with them and having the ability to work with little oversight is the best part of the job. Management is awesome and I appreciate all they do for their field workers. My one advice to Management would be to develop the field workers who are willing and wanting to grow. Do not keep good employees stuck in a position with no advancement."
"Pearson",",Prefer not to answer as I don't have anything negative to say.  I am not sure why you are making this a mandatory answer.  In the future, this should not be on the questions or you should give an opportunity to opt out."
"Pearson",",You don't stay with a company for 26 years if you didn't like what you were doing. I had advanced thru the company warehouse/distribution center. Management was very cooperative. They would take the time to explain what they wanted and when. They would assist when necessary. All in all a great company to work for."

"Pearson",",Supported executive in the human resources department.  Very well respected, positive work environment.  Salary was decent at time of employment. Was exposed to inner working of Human Resources department.  I was allowed to have a good work life balance, as I was attending school at the same time while working."
"Pearson",",environment is good.  hours are flexible and management listens to the staff.  no micro managing as they allow you to work on your own"
"Pearson",",I scored student assessment papers for required state testing.  I enjoyed the challenge of learning scoring for each particular project."
"Pearson",",We were given sufficient break time between projects."
"Pearson",",Well organised. Great job enviroment. Stellar support. From first contact, you’ll work with certified, knowledgeable, and highly experienced staff that will give you fast access to the information and support you need."
"Pearson",",The staff is not always on top of their game. The hardest part of the job is the repetitive nature and level of interest in the word. You can never take time away for a break."
"Pearson",",Work-life balance very poor if you are not a manager. Top heavy with big-salaried managers who are more concerned about working from home than with what's going on at the office. Managers very out of touch."

"Pearson",",The hardest part was when we ran out of books."
"Pearson",",The most enjoyable was meeting new people and learning new thing every day."
"Pearson",",A typical day at Pearson Educational Measurement was either scoring tests, Human Resource duties, distributing paperwork to scorers and supervisors, scanning answer sheets, answering questions and the phone, setting up scoring room computers, depending upon which position I held. I learned how basic state tests given to elementary/high school/college students were administered, what happened to the information, and how it either helped or ridiculed school districts. The management was pretty good. Although it was a temporary position, those jobs helped a lot of people earn a living. The hardest part of the job was saying goodbye to everyone at the end of each session. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people every session."
"Pearson",",Register clients into our computer system and make sure the comply with the sponsor requirements.  Review company policies and procedures and provide a high level of customer service. Problems resolutions on site."
"Pearson",",The culture is terrible, moral is down, poorly managed from the top down.  The company has gone down hill.  They do not care about their employees.  For several year they have drastically cut bonuses and even in some cases said to people you are not getting a bonus.  Twice is the past 8 years they have not given any increase in salary.  Over the past 8 years, salary increases have averaged 1.5%, not even cost of living."
"Pearson",",I enjoyed my work and my co-workers.  I feel outsourcing and providing incomplete solutions to the client is the cause of loss of contracts and layoffs."

"Pearson",",Last few years day to day has been day to night to day. Lots of overtime, lots of emergencies, few people to cover them."
"Splunk","While it is pretty impressive at HQ, remote employees (and there are a lot of them) tend to be forgotten.  Management at Splunk is hit and miss as well.  There is a lot of ""previous company nepotism"" for incoming managers.  Many of the organizations have large swaths of people that have worked together at previous companies.  While that's ok for easy relationship building, it also builds a clique that is difficult to work yourself into, especially if the team is spread out nationally or globally."
"Splunk",",As is normal with most companies, growth is Splunk's main focus.  However, recently, that growth initiative has been met with releasing products that aren't ready, and forsaking many small customers for that BIG WIN.  Like I said, this is common,  but still something that is difficult to work in."
"Splunk",",The people at Splunk are the reason I remember the experience so well.  Everyone was very helpful and fun to work with, and when I didn't know the command I was supposed to use people were extremely helpful.  Great environment to learn, and I had fun projects and a clear direction."

"Splunk",",sales manager, good company, but lack of management rules. but working environment is good and good coworkers. average speaking, it's a good company,"
"Splunk",",This was one of my favorite jobs that I ever got. Being said I worked as hard as I possibly could, knocking all tasks out of the park. I was promoted quickly but just as quickly I was fired. So far they have given no reason whatsoever. I believe there are a lot of office politics of which I never took part in."
"Splunk",",Great product.  This company is growing so fast.  Co-workers where great to work with and had a lot of fun with them."
"Splunk",",The product is incredible and Splunk is leading the market. This motivates everyone to work hard and get excited to work hard on the product. Engineering is fairly agile and PMO seems to do a good job finding the best processes for the organization. Overall a very supportive environment."
"Technica Corporation","If you work on a contract supporting a difficult client who knows you work hard, complete tasks on time and they still give you grief, don't expect to get support from management because they will tell you that the customer is right, the customer pays our bills so do what they tell you.  I would never recommend anyone or anything to work here."
"Technica Corporation",",The contract that I was hired to work on was dissolved before I got hired. I watched people get terminated in such a tasteless way since I first got there. The hardest part of the job was knowing who I was answer to on a daily basis."
"Technica Corporation",",Technica won the contract that I was working on.  The transition from one company to another was a smooth process.  There was no lapse and time and the HR department worked with me to ensure that my benefits mirrored my last position.  I enjoyed working with the Technica team while I was employed with my previous employer so to transition to the team of highly trained engineers was great."
"Technica Corporation",",Technica is a smaller company with minimal upward mobility. Executive Management likes to personally manage even the smallest of projects.The most enjoyable part of my day is working with my teammates as they are very bright and are capable great things."

"Technica Corporation",",A nice place to jumpstart your professional career as an entry level employee."
"Technica Corporation",",I normally would write a view however the management is terrible. There is no support in the leadership. There is no growth in company. They have hight turn over rate. If you go to other company run."
"Technica Corporation",",Productive and very relaxed atmosphere. Co-workers are great."
"Technica Corporation",",Technica was a small place to work at with little room for growth/advancement. Overall, benefits, salary and work environment were above satisfactory. The best part was that I was able to grow in my career and as a person with knowledge and experience."
"Technica Corporation",",A typical day at work was hands off management which I love. I learned more telecommunications/networking experience. I definitely was given an opportunity to add skills to my resume. Management was ok. Almost as if their hands were tied as far as advancement/promotions due to the company operating on specific contracts and specific skill sets are needed to change/move between job duties. The hardest part of the job was that Technica relies heavily on certifications and time to study and take these certifications on my own was lacking due to my job duties at hand as well as my personal life being a single Dad with two kids to tend to. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with. Great people and due to the size of the company everyone was a little closer to each other."
"Fidelity Investments","A typical day started with calling my accounts and reviewing pertinent information which would affect their portfolios and investment strategy for the day. I learned about many aspects of investment, how to be a fast and concise decision maker, ways of dealing with and easily customer concerns, and how to train my staff   handle my accounts and to increase our business. My coworkers were quick learning and dedicated to the job. The hardest part of the job was handling massive order flow when world news hit the markets be it adverse or positive. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching clients accounts grow and our order flow do the same due to our hard work, dedication, and training methods."
"Fidelity Investments",",Good place to work. career growth, training provided. pay for advanced degrees. promotion opportunities. Management staff interested in your advancement."

"Fidelity Investments",",I learnt to work on the Mainframe and it has been really enjoyable and fun."
"Fidelity Investments",",During working hours it stays pretty busy. People at the job makes life a little easier because everyone is friendly. So for the most part working there for this company was pretty good not bad at  all"
"Fidelity Investments",",Fun place! Typical workday was fun. People nice and had subsidized lunches. Learned a lot. People were really cool. Nice campus."
"Fidelity Investments",",I have spent 15 years at this company.  A great place to work! Management can be demanding at times.  Lots of competition to get in.  You need to fit the company culture..."
"Fidelity Investments",",There are many bright people here but the quality of your average engineer is incredibly low. This makes it easy to shine but hard to stay motivated. There are a lot of great managers and a lot of horrible technical executives."
"Fidelity Investments",",Most talented individuals are trying to jump off a sinking ship"
"Fidelity Investments",",Great place to start a career with a exceptional training/ on-boarding process. Managers are truly there to assist each employee better themselves. Schedules can be the most challenging piece but management will work to correct if it does not work for life balance."
"Fidelity Investments",",I have to say Fidelity Investment is one of the best company's I've work for by far of my 20 years of working. I love this company with everything in me. "
"Fidelity Investments",",They have the best benefits on the planet and their core value are completely beneficial to the employees."

"Fidelity Investments",",Overall, they treat you well.  They push you to learn more and be a better representative."
"Fidelity Investments",",They don't tell you you will be stuck with a night shift or a weekend shift to start off with. I understand you have to start somewhere, but i wish they would have told me this upon hiring instead of hiding it until we finished training and licensing."
"Fidelity Investments",",Excellent work environment, great co-workers lots of opportunity for volunteer work. Great incentives for healthy eating. overtime"
"Fidelity Investments",",Fidelity is the kind of company that works hard to make sure that its employees feel supported and well-equipped to handle what they experience in their work day. "
"Fidelity Investments",",The only drawback to working there as phone representative is what any person working as one anywhere will tell you. Participants can be snippy, unkind, and impatient. There are some expectations that come with calling someone on the phone. No one wants to be on the line for very long and they want results. No one wants the issue to take more than one call either. When all these expectations fall in line with what you can do, everything is great. Of course that is not how many calls each day end up turning out and the stress of dealing with the ramifications of doing all that I can and still having issues with pleasing a customer were really difficult for me."
"Fidelity Investments",",Personally, I think Fidelity needs to forego the call centers and instead creates offices that people can go to speak with people in person about the management of their pensions or health insurance plans."
"Fidelity Investments",",Great benefits and work environment, depending on management. Service Center provides a lot of opportunity for growth. Branch environment is similar to a small business with the perks of being a large corporation."
"Fidelity Investments",",Working for Fidelity Investments is a great experience, learning skills that I will use for my life time. Also, a great working environment with senior management always finding new ways to make work an enjoyable experience. Co-workers work as a team with everyone willing to help each out."
"Fidelity Investments",",Fidelity is an outstanding company.  The FInancial Services industry faces regulatory and technological pressures that are stressing the business model and and putting downward pressure on margins."

"CACI International Inc",",Government contracting has it's ups and downs. CACI makes it easier by providing a company experience that makes the uncertainty of government contracts easier to tolerate. CACI has a mobility program that works to give preference to existing employees when contracts end and new work is needed. There are some negative aspects of government contracting that can't be avoided, but CACI does its best to shield it's employees from that."
"CACI International Inc",",Best job I have ever had. I am so grateful for the opportunity to have worked with CACI. I had to leave to focus on college but I feel bad for leaving because there is no company as great as CACI that I know of. I hope I can work with them again."

"CACI International Inc",",I've only been with CACI for a little over a year and so far they've taken good care of me.  I was placed on Maternity Leave just under 1 year of being with the company and though the time was too short, the process with CACI went well. After returning from maternity leave, they placed me at a location that is closer to home so that I'm not driving 2+ hours to/from work, allowing me a little more time with my kids."
"CACI International Inc",",Work for 10 years at CACI.  Management pass information to employees,  Sometimes slow in respondin to benifits.  They reconized your work and would get praise as deserved.  Overall we got what was worked for."
"CACI International Inc",",A good company that is customer and employee centered. The hardest part of my job was leaving it. There were some periods of hectic pace and some of drought. Unfortunately the economy went sideways leaving many of us determining new futures. I would recommend CACI to anyone."

"Pacific Life",",I enjoyed reaching out to and collaborating with multiple departments on several different high priority projects. However, recent changes in the financial services industry coupled with reduced sales ultimately made the work environment much more stressful and much less flexible."
"Pacific Life",",It is not a great place to work, the setup of the cubicles keeps employees very isolated. Managers do not have daily interaction with employees and employees that have been working there for longer time do not accept new employees in their circle. Excellent environment for people that only goes to work for a paycheck."
"Pacific Life",",The management of Pacific Life dedicates a significant amount of time to finding ways to make the employees work life fun and enjoyable.  The work is engaging and dynamic.  The pay is competitive and the workload is just enough to keep you busy but not overwhelming.  Overall, I'd work for Pacific Life again in a heartbeat."
"Pacific Life",",Overall great pay decent work environment flexibility with schedule would recommend big learning curve but manageable"
"Pacific Life",",People either do not want to leave their position because they have been here forever or they don't see a point in moving up a level. Management is partial to long term employees and gives step treatment to Contractors."
"Pacific Life",",Good Benefits, Good learning experience, good location and great cafe at the facility. No Coffee/Tea for the employees."

"TechTarget",",Really, the downsides of this job have been a lack of adequate compensation, and internal teams that don't always recognize when you're working your butt off"
"TechTarget",",Good place to work out of college. You make a lot of phone calls (150 minimum a day). Not going to lie, it's pretty easy and tedious work. The managers were ok. The job is nothing special and wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for serious employment."
"TechTarget",",Overall, a decent workplace.  Co-workers are nice, benefits are great, CEO is excellent. It can be frustrating at times and certain new members of management have created somewhat of a toxic environment.  But before then, it was truly a great place that I enjoyed coming into everyday."

"TechTarget",",Great place to gain experience.  The salary is on the low end, but they hire college grads and help mold them into real people.  It was a great experience for me and so many others that I saw. If you're dedicated and love the business, there's room for growth,"

They gave me the support and budget I needed to create good content for vendors."
"TechTarget",",extremely low pay but good for smart, hardworking people to move up fast"
"TechTarget",",Sales oriented atmosphere. Flexible hours. Very low pay. Young environment."
"TechTarget",",I learned a lot. Good business model and good people. I honed my craft at this company."
"TechTarget",",Loved working here. But because the salaries of most employees are way below average, there were other options that needed to be explored. Loved how you could wear jeans every day and the laid back atmosphere. Plus, open-door policy on vacation and working from home is great."
"TechTarget",",Flexible work environment allows employees the ability to work from home whenever they like and set flexible hours. However, communication across teams and department lags and employees are often not informed of process changes, position transfers, etc. until the absolute last minute."
"TechTarget",",Although employees may be promoted often, they aren't always compensated for the move and many ""promotions"" may simply just be a lateral title change."

"Conversant Media",",I've learned a lot about the media/marketing/advertising industry and increased my technical skills in SQL database programming, R programming, predictive modeling, and analysis techniques."
"Conversant Media",",The management here is the best I've encountered.  My manager tends to be more of a coach or academic advisor than a boss, and I never feel micromanaged."
"Conversant Media",",Similarly, my co-workers seem engaged, energetic, interesting, and fun -- it is a pleasure to come in to work each day to work with these friends."
"Conversant Media",",The hardest part of the job are the demands to be better and faster than the competition, which is no easy task in the past paced advertising tech industry.  Sometimes I may have to work overtime to keep up with projects, but because I enjoy my job I don't mind this too much."

They celebrate everything!  The company values moving forward professionally and values employee learning."
"Akvelon, Inc.",",Not bad place for start. A lot of snakes, fruits etc. Good location and office place. Friendly co-workers.  Provide new experiences and challenges."
"Mitre Corporation","The only issue is the commute and sometimes getting new project work is difficult until you get established.  the company does not mentor or have an efficient way to build up your resume. those with experience do well but those with little experience is hard to grow or get onto good project work. Requires clearance to work as primary customer is US government."
"Mitre Corporation",",A reorganization has changed the company into something that is no longer different from the status quo. The company culture that was like a family is no longer there. Rather than a culture of those who help one another it is a cut throat enterprise."
"Mitre Corporation",",Mitre is a great well managed company. This is not always a good thing when you are trying to advance. The people here love being here so they never leave making it harder to climb the ladder. I would say overall management knows how to keep up moral while meeting deadlines. I will miss this place, but I must be career oriented at this stage in my life."
"Mitre Corporation",",Management is very interested in work-life balance.  There are many opportunities for continuing education and it is encouraged.  Many opportunities for socializing with different groups within the corporation.  Employees are encouraged to give back and volunteerism is very much supported with paid time off to pursue volunteerism. Great place to work.  Very diverse & inclusive."
"Mitre Corporation",",It is what you make of the opportunities from inside and outside the company. There is a real love for what the company tries to obtain from its employee groups by way of balancing job with passions."
"Mitre Corporation",",However, the culture is changing from a Senior Government Expert (SME) to that of a contractor house, less the $$$ benefit.  Lapses in the end of the government fiscal year has everyone chasing their tail, looking for little contracts to work under... Musical chairs."
"Mitre Corporation",",MITRE is very flexible with work/life balance.  They encourage you take your vacation time and enjoy your personal life."
"Mitre Corporation",",If you are energetic, hard-working, career minded, this is not the place for you because there is almost no chance for career advancement. Typical promotions at low level take 6-7 years where they take 3 yrs in most places."
"Mitre Corporation",",The company values newcomers more than their own proven and loyal employees, so negotiate when you join as you will not get a promotion after you do. This is so well known that there is huge grade inflation at the time of hire when compared to the tried and tested abilities of existing employees. Sad, but true."
"Mitre Corporation",",Generally a laid-back place to work.  Good work-life balance - flexible schedules and work locations, healthy leave policies.  Satisfaction will be highly dependent on the program you are placed on."
"Mitre Corporation",",The MITRE Corporation is a not-for-profit organization that operates seven federally funded research and development centers.  The company offers a decent salary, benefits, and work-life balance."
"Mitre Corporation",",It is a dream come true to pursue ideas and innovate that leads to serving federal agencies. "
"Mitre Corporation",",You can be creative and innovative to benefit the federal agencies. "
"Mitre Corporation",",Nice people and conducive work environment."
"Mitre Corporation",",A typical day in MITRE can be as simple or as interesting as you want it to be. Your job at MITRE is rarely every simple, though. You get to help solve some of the most challenging projects in the industry. The management does everything in their power to help you succeed. The hardest part is getting used to the idea of not having to deliver a product and that you'll be doing mostly research for a large portion of your project. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to meet so many smart, insightful, and interesting people."
"Mitre Corporation",",Lots of flexibility to work from home and other flexibility. Project management and division management is very frustrating to deal with as no one really seems to be in-charge or accountable."
"Mitre Corporation",",Company was fantastic to work for. They took care of their employees and catered to the employees children. Benefits were great"
"Mitre Corporation",",Fun and family oriented. No issues, would work here again. My issues are structure. They are constantly reinventing the wheel. No firm plan in place."
"Mitre Corporation",",The only down fall to working at MITRE is the commute that is just getting worse.  I love the company, the benefits and their mission"
"Mitre Corporation",",Poor management.  Not all organizations adhere to work life balance.  Job tasks are not challenging or innovative.  In the ""This is how it has always been done"" mentality.  No career advancement.  Everything moves as slow or slower than the government.  Trying to figure out why it has been rated such a great company to work for."
"Mitre Corporation",",As things go, MITRE seems to be an almost ideal place to work.  Amazing benefits are part of the package such as tuition fully covered as education is encouraged,  PTO, and sabbatical available for employees.  Knowledgeable people work at MITRE and you can expect to learn a lot while here. "
"Mitre Corporation",",Problems exist because management has some unrealistic expectations of subordinate employees as they are out of touch with reality.  In fact, some managers are downright sadistic especially if they have tenure with the company.   Expect to see managers play favorites.   Also, rivalries exist between  departments and older employees are sometimes threatened by new staff members and interfere with their ability to learn the particulars of the job.  "
"Mitre Corporation",",MITRE might be the right fit for some while others will struggle to fit in. Beware...."
"Mitre Corporation",",MITRE is a wonderful company to work for, they are very family oriented, have great benefits and the job culture is great."
"Mitre Corporation",",Decent workplace when not bogged down by unrealistic government expectations. Worked on Big Data problems, so the project was interesting."
"Mitre Corporation",",Excellent culture, great management. I wish I were still there, but the government sequester made my staying on untenable. Loved my co-workers and my bosses."

"Northeastern University",",It is very international and has an excellent standard of education. The academic staff is highly qualified and co-workers are generally very helpful. The Global Pathways, College of Professional Studies organizes meetings for instructors, which is a good opportunity for the rather large teaching staff to meet up and exchange ideas."
"Northeastern University",",There is little to no possibility of advancement when hired as a part-time adjunct instructor. The workload varies and is unpredictable. No benefits, no job security."
"Northeastern University",",School is growing fast. As a graduate student, I felt there were not many professors working on a research actively, even young professors doing only services such as department works, teaching..  Only a few professors are working on a research."
"Northeastern University",",Good place to work. You do have to listen to directions and do as much as you can even when not asked. Great personnel and really calm place to work!!"
"Northeastern University",",Worked as a teaching assistant. Work of course relies on the professor under whom you work. I have had the privilege to work under some very good professors and the experience has been very good."
"Northeastern University",",Northeastern offers great benefits but the pay is not as great. There are a lot of opportunities to move within the University, but some offices remain stagnant. Overall it is a positive place to work and there is a level of excitement as the University moves up the ranks nationally."
"Northeastern University",",I work about 20 hours a week and it has taught me organisational skills. I organize towels in the closet and make sure that appropriate individuals enter the facility and no outsiders cross the gates. The management is very supportive and very understanding. If I have to drop a shift due to some academic work they are very understanding regarding it. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I got meet undergrads from different cultural backgrounds and we have become good friends now."

"Geometric Americas",",The managers here get paid quite a lot and the engineers are the lowest paid employees. "
"Geometric Americas",",There's no job growth here and no pay raises either. The CEO of the company isn't very honest and when the time for pay raises comes around, he always tells that the company isn't doing good and avoids the raise. "
"Geometric Americas",",The managers never care about your concerns. The only positive here is the opportunity you get to work with some well known companies. However, don't expect to get any pay raises or work related training here, no matter how good you are."
"Geometric Americas",",Good cultural learning"
"Geometric Americas",",Very nice work culture"
"Geometric Americas",",Good work-life balance"
"Geometric Americas",",Nice to have such good co workers"
"Geometric Americas",",People are nice here but if you are looking for advancements, growth, recognition, etc then this is the wrong place to be. The management doesn't care about you. All they want is that you do your day to day job and stay in the same position for years with no growth prospects. Above all, the pay is one of the lowest in the industry."
"Geometric Americas",",I was working at Caterpillar site, Had very little communication with Geometric management."

"Geometric Americas",",Staff is very helpful in the day to day issues that may arise."
"Geometric Americas",",I got this job right after high school and got in very easy due to experience in autocad and solidworks. The job I was assigned was to retrace old boeing plans within a tolerance and submit them."

"Geometric Americas",",Co-workers are helpful and co-operative."
"Geometric Americas",",I typical day at work I am creating many reports in Excel alot of my information for these reports come from SAP. I have learned many trades here I control AMEX expense reports and managing all employes AMEX statements. I have also spent two years working in SAP which has become very valuable to me I would say I am pretty savy in that system. I have great co-workers we all work together to get the end resoult, sometimes it is a bit diffecult ans we all may not be on the same page, but at the end of the day we work together and utilize eachother for our assets. I really enjoy having responsibilty for weekly task and being able to get in a focused state of mind to complete my task."

"Bed Bath & Beyond","A typical day at work involves assisting customers both on the sales floor as well as behind the register/customer service desk. This job taught me quite a lot about time management, and learning how to work smarter, not just harder. Co-workers are very friendly, no complaints here. Overall a good work experience."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",Work was monotonous."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",I learned nothing new."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",Management were none free-thinking drones."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",Workplace culture was confrontational and petty."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",The hardest part of the job was listening to the morning meetings."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",The most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",I love working with people, retail setting not so much.  Relax atmosphere, but they do not compensate their people for what they are worth. One break a day for full timers, too little in my opinion. More training for new people needed right off the bat. Take care of your reliable people first. It took me 7  years to increase a dollar an hour which in my opinion is ridiculous."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",A typical day starts with stock replenishment followed by a morning meeting to discuss the plans and projects for the day. During Store hours most of your time is spent greeting and assisting customers, processing online orders ringing transactions. Those at customer service ring returns and exchanges. The evening is spent putting away new shipment and recovering the store. Tills are counted at the end of the night."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",Great opportunities for training and advancement. The staff for most departments is very supportive, and there are a wide variety of opportunities available in the event you are not comfortable in your current assignment."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",they are restructuring. they have a reputation for paying well for management positions. lots of room for growth. they also own Buy Buy Baby, Christmas Tree Shops, Harmon Face Values, Cost Plus World Market and are looking for other companies to buy."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",Work depends on what position I work that day. It changes every now and then. I usually switch between cashier, floor associate and replenishment associate. Typical days usually involve helping the customers with questions, finding items they need, or ordering certain items online. I learned a lot about working in retail, but overall, I learned the best parts about customer service and I feel that my knowledge about it has expanded greatly. Management is great as I feel that I'm on steady ground with the manager and I feel that though they can be tough at times, they have a lot of faith in me and what I can do. The workplace culture itself is great, sometimes hard since there are so many things I wish to buy, but still its a wonderful setting. The hardest part of the job, again, is restraining myself from wanting to buy so many things. While there are many things about the job that are enjoyable, I find that interacting with the customers and being able to help them find what they need is the most enjoyable part of the job."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",Bed Bath Beyond is a fun and somewhat peaceful environments to work in, but the management team as a whole are 1. lack understanding for employee concerns and issues as they arise 2. they do not offer hours and pay that can help a hard working man pay his rent."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",i absolutely loved working here! the only reason i left is because i moved... they teach great customer service skills and how to sell products... i would encourage anyone in the retail field to work here. they teach you great skills you can take with you anywhere."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",great company to work for, great people.  always busy and great environment.  Excellent working condition.  will go back any time."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",A typical morning at work includes putting away new merchandise and dropping and filling merchandise to maximize profits. Between helping customers and keeping up with the merchandise rotations, your shift goes by pretty quickly. I am fortunate in that I have great managers and coworkers, so going to work is more fun than it is a chore. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, as with any retail job; but when you help a customer find a product they were looking for or genuinely had a connection and helped them in some way, it really does feel good."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",This job would be good for people, working on the side of college or high school, needing some extra cash. It pays minimum wage, I wouldn't suggest this job for people who live on their own."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",Company is full of opportunity,  staff are respectful as well as understanding it is quite A fun place to work and shop. Would recommend people shop here and or be a part of the hardworking team of employees."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",The company was fair on the pay. The company was stable and the hours were good. The management was good and organized and carried nice merchandise."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",Opening the store required counting tills and filling the registers for business. After walking the store for any safety issues, a game plan is created to put freight away and merchandise any new products. Seasonal areas needed to be dismantled and remerchandised according to the time of year."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",Training is always happening whether online or on the floor with trainers. Management spend most of their day assisting customers and associates. An open door policy is always in place to allow associates the opportunity to come to management with any issue or problem that they may be struggling with."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",Customer service and safety were always top priorities and empowering associates to help please our customers and to identify and fix any safety issue."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",The hardest part of the work is staffing. With call outs, it spreads the rest of the staff very thin. Also trying to fit all the new products into the store could be both hard challenging."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",The best part of any retail is helping customers from greeting them while they're in the store to going above and beyond to satisfy a customers needs while creating a customer for life."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",I loved my coworkers. Bed Bath and Beyond was very considerate when working around scheduling. A great work environment and learning experience."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",Very friendly coworkers. A fun working environment. Flexible hours and great training from all the mangers. Great management that understands all the aspects of the business."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",With the exception of two of the managers, I found the upper level staff to be quite hostile and aggressive. They were unforgiving, did not provide adequate training and the store was understaffed."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",As one of the team leaders on a nightly basis I would lead a small of employees. I also worked in receiving unloading pallets restocking the store. The most difficult part of the job was the fluctuating hours switching between first shift and graveyard shift."
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",This company is in a friendly and welcoming environment.I loved being able to know that I was able to help a customer to the best of my ability.Ive learned that you should never tell a customer no you should always be willing to help. The hardest part of the job sometimes would be when customers wanted the coupons used in a certain way that couldn't be done. Mangers always handled complicated situations successfully"
"Bed Bath & Beyond",",I worked there too long before i realized my work ethic was not going to get me promoted. Favortism was the worst when i worked there! The pay wasnt that good for the unprofessional antics i dealt with. No time an a 1/2 on holidays. Customers are allowed to disrespect you, and if you so much as raise your voice too loud defending yourself you just may be fired. They take that ""customer is always right"" stuff wayyyy too far! Save yourself the headache and work anywhere else! I wish i was warned before hand."
"Western Digital","There is nothing to brag about. It does not have the hype of other high tech companies. Compensation is an average. The SAP team knows they will be gone after the top management made a decision to move to Oracle ERP."
"Western Digital",",I really want to work western digital.. but the problem when their slow they laid off me.. and I like the places this is a good company at all"
"Western Digital",",WD is generally a good company, it is a leader in its space in the computer storage segment, follows best practices in management, design, development and manufacturing of products and most importantly seems to always make money! One great thing about the company is how transparent it is."
"Western Digital",",Off late with a slew of acquisitions and with the resulting restructuring, layoffs have been too frequent. People working in core teams and who are competent at what they do have been less affected. There are certainly exceptions to this and that is a gamble that a company that needs to preserve its financial statements takes. So there can be a lot of demoralized people depending on the team you join. On the other hand, if you join the right team, you have a great opportunity to grow with the company. The demand for storage is always high, so from that standpoint, it is a great industry to be in."
"Western Digital",",Storage is an interesting area of work without a doubt. Moving disks and moving parts made traditional storage technically fascinating. SSDs have their own sets of challenges with regards to reliability and performance which need to be solved with innovation and development."
"Western Digital",",Notice that I said WD is a good company. It is not great because what generally happens is once you get into an area of work, there is not much opportunity to go up in the organization beyond a certain designation. Too many old timers from the HDD times with tremendous but irrelevant (anymore) knowledge need to retire. However, if you want a steady income with a steady job especially in Southern California, you need look"

"Western Digital",",I work from my home.  My co-worders are spread around the country but corporate is in Irvine California.  My typical workday is sitting behind a desk analyzing data, sales trends and forecasts.  I manage item creation as well and many other details.  Management at Western Digital is all very nice people.  Western Digital just acquired Sandisk and Hitachi and we have been under integration.  The culture is changing and still undetermined.  The most enjoyable part of my job is quiet time when working on fine details in a spreadsheet or ""when"" I get to be around co-workers.  The hardest part of my job is the stress that you encounter from customers and simply trying to get it all done during stressful weeks."
"Western Digital",",Western Digital has a great vision of where they want to go."
"Western Digital",",They have a great work environment, employees."
"Western Digital",",I really enjoyed the type of work I did there."
"Western Digital",",While the reverse commute kept me hanging on longer than I wanted, the reality is that the leadership team has bitten off way more than it can chew: WD acquired Hgst, and Sandisk, and are trying to homogenize the three subs into one company.  This means they went from a 40,000 employee company, to a +/-80,000 person company.  There is a lot of planning and perseverance that need to happen in such an enormous integration.  Systems, teams, product lines and cultures need to meld.  Exec's are making decisions without fully understanding the final impact, because they don't have insight to the lower levels.  Leaders aren't selecting comprehensive tiger teams to plan facilitation of these enormous tasks, and at the end of the day, they're not willing to back off from bad decisions or poor or faulty execution.  That results in tremendous hardship for the lower level people who are just trying to do their jobs. And as people leave (voluntarily, or through many layoffs that are inevitable after acquisitions) there's no urgency to replace or reassign critical roles.  Communication is nearly non-existent."
"Western Digital",",Any company of this size that misses a pay cycle to all legacy Hgst employees is simply not planning well!  Leaders should be embarrassed.  Exec's need to reach deeper into the employee population to plan and make facilitation and implementation decisions, as they clearly don't understand down the road impacts.  There will be many more employees who give up along the way, and they're likely to be good ones.  My guess is that by 2018 the worst issues will be resolved.  Good luck!"

"Western Digital",",70 hours / per week was the norm.  lately this has improved since the merger with HGST.  Promotions and raises were nearly non-existent for upper level engineers."
"Western Digital",",WD is a no nonsense company with little empowerment and most decisions made at the executive level. Company has major amount of debt to pay off, which forces the executive team to focus on getting maximum postive operations cash flow."
"Western Digital",",Fine work place but hard disk drive TAM is decreasing."
"Western Digital",",WD is very good at low cost consumer products for PC and external personal storage."
"Western Digital",",The hardest part is the hands-on working 1st line manager culture."
"Western Digital",",I hired on as an HGST employee out of college, and enjoyed the company. While it was not quite a startup culture, it was very evident that it was trying to compete in the job market. While things weren't perfect, and I didn't agree with everything the company did (ie use TCL) it was definitely a nice work environment overall. Once the Western Digital merger went through, people were cut, and projects were added. I was laid off in the merge, but none of my co-workers are happy with the increased work load."

"Western Digital",",A typical day at works starts with completing any tasks from the prior day, returning phone calls or emails left on voice mail or email. Then continuing to complete any tasks or projects asked by the management. Tasks such as sales projects, inter departmental projects, and assisting with other coworkers projects. When all is complete, calls are required to new and existing customers to ensure all services are up to par."
"Western Digital",",WD is the biggest storage company in the world after the merger with HGST and Sandisk. Overall, very good opportunity to learn about storage industry."
"Western Digital",",A typical day at work is always a busy day but manageable and fun environment because the people i work with are very friendly and family oriented. Management in our department is great. The only hard part of my job is if no one's around when it comes to very critical and sensitive matter but I guess that's where our training comes in handy when where under pressure."
"Western Digital",",A somewhat progressive environment that took the occasional chance despite a staunchly corporate environment suffered from a series of mergers and acquisitions. What remains is a soulless, unimaginative, ""old-school"" company that relishes the old way of doing things at the cost of employee happiness. "
"Western Digital",",""Well, at least we still have jobs"" became the depressing motto of those individuals ""lucky"" enough to remain after a dizzying bevy of layoffs and restructures."
"Western Digital",",The company pretty much defines what it does only on the basis of marketing and doesn't really have a vision to lead and innovate anymore. No more vision for technology, only to make money. If you want to really explore and innovate with software, unless they already know someone will buy exactly that, they just don't care. As such, the company is entering a period of stagnation, especially with the decline of drive sales."

"California Institute of Technology",",I've succeeded at every company I've worked for, including some of the top businesses in the country, because I give 110% everyday. I figured this would be a boon for me to work at such a highly regarding institution. I was WRONG!!! The management is unsupportive and passive aggressive, the pay is very low, the health benefits are subpar and expensive, there is zero room for advancement, no employee incentive program and the HR department likes to sweep conflicts under the rug to maintain the institutions ""reputation"". After 25 years of working for various companies, this is by far the worst place I've worked. The only reason why I stay is for the expensive health benefits because I have a child with a medical condition so I am currently stuck at this horrible job. The only saving grace is the co-workers who, unsurprisingly, are also looking for other jobs because of the poor working conditions and culture. To get me to join their ""team"", I was promised advancement and growth opportunities that never happened. There is never enough money in the budget to give raises. Apparently, there never was or ever will be any money in the budget for raises. They are famous for spending their money on hard costs like installing new doors and awnings but not for soft costs like employee raises. God forbid you actually have happy employees. The turnaround in my department is at least 50%. Yes, 50% of the people that start in my department leave after 1 year. Terrible statistics.

"SRI International",",I believe that any typical day at any job is the same all around. There are times when you could be busy all day, that you don't even realize where the time has gone. And then there are the days when  work is slow that you have to go around asking for work, just trying to look busy. Management was real kick back, but firm when need be. But very open minded people. Not hard to get along with at all. I would have to say that the hardest part about the job was having to pick up after the technicians and maintain the medical supplies in the warehouse. And the most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things and meeting people with many different personalities and characters."

"Farmers Insurance Group",",I have been with Farmers for many years and through many different departments. Although I do realize any large organization has its internal issues, Farmers seems to thrive on micromanaging and in-fighting to the point of stagnation.

I would have retired there."
"Farmers Insurance Group",",This industry has given me so much experience and knowledge. I have learned how to work with a diverse group of people. The experience has been great. The most rewarding of this job has been to help people understand the importance of insurance and what role it plays in our lives.  Many people see it as wasted money because they are not seeing the return of their dollar upon paying premiums.........unless there is a claim. So thankful for all the experience I have gained."

"Blue Cross Blue Shield","Blue Cross/Blue Shield and my other employer, Healthcare Management, were, overall, very good to me for a period of thirty-three years. I made a fair salary and they were both generous with benefits and seemed to care about their employees. It was also satisfying learning new systems as they advanced through the years. As with any job of course, some people were more pleasant than others to work with but you learn how work around these minor problems. Itself, is a form of learning and maturing. No one enjoys being laid off which was the case here both times. I'm used to working. I think it is better to look at it as an opportunity."
"Blue Cross Blue Shield",",there were many ways to advance in this company and job security was very good. This leadership really cared to help you and make you a stronger employee."
"Blue Cross Blue Shield",",Great opportunities for advancement, pays well, great employee benefits, fun place to work. Steady workload and great team environment."

"Blue Cross Blue Shield",",But, I had the most wonderful supervisor she was a GOD sent. Company's need more of her. "
"Blue Cross Blue Shield",",And now about my co-workers was off the chain they were very helpful, fun and overall just a great bunch of people to work for. Love them to pieces."
"Blue Cross Blue Shield",",Overall, Blue Cross Blue Shield is a great company to work in grow within. On a daily basis, I have to maintain a 90% adherence, service members, quote benefits, take up to 50 inbound calls a day. Also, I have been working with the company 3 plus years, and I had the pleasure of training new hires, being a mentor, and assisting with escalated issues. What I love most about the job? It is a pleasure making a change in a person's life, and knowing that you made them smile in some point of their day. The job itself is demanding, but it is always great to have challenges and be able to overcome them."
"Blue Cross Blue Shield",",I learned a lot at Blue Cross Blue Shield"

After logging into the phone i then auto in and take calls. It definitely depends on the day if it will be a high call volume or not. The job itself is not what's hard but making sure you maintain the pace of the calls. I loved how the job was repetitive. The longer you work there, the easier it becomes to take calls and document everything accurately even if things are moving at a fast pace."

Logging into my phone to take call. Documenting every call and from the caller name to reason and resolution of the call. Management is hands on and always ready to assist when needed. The hardest thing about the job is a right away fix for billing due to the time frame and process it takes to get a resolution. Enjoy my overall job and responsiblities of being an agent."
"Blue Cross Blue Shield",",Blue Cross has terrible management due to outsourcing. It is in my opinion that the culture has taken a major hit due to massive layoffs and outsourcing."

"Baylor Scott & White Health","very stressful environment but great team work and team members, management could be better not helpful at all, promotion based on who you know not what you know."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",Great place to work. Just didn't work out with me due to the hours but I would recommend  this place to any one who is looking for a job as a phlebotomist."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",Very nice hospital to work at. The staff and management are very nice. It is a small place and is usually pretty manageable."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",When I endeavored a case study at the suggestion of an advisor, I had no idea how many connections I would make within the Baylor S&W system. My advisor not only taught well, but directed me to chief residents and community-based faculty who met me for coffee and edited transcripts/posters with me frequently. While I did not ""win"" the poster competition, I made connections that were far more valuable."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",I liked this job because I would get to interact with people and draw there blood at the same time and the patient would tell me I was good that I found the vein on the first stick so would tell me they go any where else they would dig to find the vein and then stick them a lot of times"
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",They want you to come to work early and stay over your shift to help the next shift because the hospital has had a million call-in's. Some of the management is engaged while others are just there to collect a check.Upper management is aware of the screw ups but no accountability system wide."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",Great opportunity for advancement. Competitive benefits in a health care environment. Job culture continues to change due to the recent merger."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",It was a very structured, learned something new everyday I was taught by the best! They always found ways for us to be better"
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",A regular work day easy paced although there are days that is can be very face paced. In healthcare there is always something different and different opportunities to work. So there is something for everyone. Management is friendly but slow moving in communication which can leave departments in the dark. Co-workers are friendly and helpful."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",Greeting patients and handling front desk operations. Management works well with family needs, co- workers are hit and miss, some are rude and others are the nicest you could have around."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",From the minute your shift starts it is a hardworking and compassionate work environment. I enjoy going to work and getting to help people in need."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",I enjoyed working for Scott & White and hope to return in the future. I felt that the ""higher-ups"" took good care of the nursing staff. At my previous job at another company, we wore many hats such as nursing staff, front desk staff, call center, janitor. At Scott and White, there was a cleaning crew, a call center and a full front desk staff. I was able to focus on just nursing duties. "
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",I would give management a 4 out of 5 stars because I did feel one of my managers was biased. I did bump heads with a RN who had more experience then me and that manager took her side of everything and made it seem like everything was my fault. My most recent supervisor was very fair and very attentive and easy to work with."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",Besides the one RN, the staff at Scott & White was excellent. We were like an extended family. I will truly miss working with them but I had to move on due to the commute and moving to a new city."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",The hardest part of the job and this probably happens everywhere; the RNs look down their noses at lower level nursing staff. Luckily, for me we didn't have many RNs and all the CMAs and LVNs were like a sisterhood. "
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",The part I enjoyed the most about the job was there was a clear job description for a CMA. We did not have to take phone calls all day long unless it was an emergency. The call center would make up a phone note and transfer it to nurse staff inbox. There was a janitorial service where you could call and someone would be there in minutes to help clean something up. A full front desk staff there to make, cancel, reschedule appointments. It was nice, I just"
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",  "
"Baylor Scott & White Health",", came to work, did my specific duties and went home. "
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",Another good thing is you are able to transfer departments every 6 months. You must spend 6mo's minimum in a department. If someone calls in, we usually get moved to that department to fill in and that's great cause you'll get more experience. "
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",I would recommend Scott & White as an employer to everyone."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",  "
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",It has been a few years since I worked at Baylor but I would definitely return. Everyone is friendly, works as a team and they take great care of their employees"
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",The supervisor was understanding and a great letter. I enjoyed interacting and meeting new people. I was able to work in different suites and there was a chance for advancement , however not in other departments."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",Baylor Scott and White was a great company to work for. They treat their employees extremely well. It's probably one of my most favorite hospitals I've ever worked at."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",A great place towork for , co workers are fun , family like . Management cares . Hardest thing is 12 hour shift being away from family for 12 hours . Most inenjoyable is taking care of patient and family !!!!"
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",Working at Baylor Scott and White has been an exceptional experience. The culture is positive and the standards for patient care are very high."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",Baylor is a fast paced, very busy business.  I learned that all doctors like different ways of doing things.  As long as you strive to do your best and worry with your job it is ok.  Most enjoyable is the thank you's from the patients as you give your best to them daily.  Hardest part is trying to not become emotional with the patients as you go through their sicknesses with them."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",My days start by looking at the scheduling make sure insurance are IIN or OON. I learn new things every day about different insurance. Letting patient know about their insurance being OON or insurance isn't active anymore. I enjoyable talk to different patient everyday and enjoy working with my co-workers"
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",I'm as a seasoned RN I have never seen more bullying. They take great pride in beating down their nurses. I have tough skin and it doesn't bother me so much. I really worry about the new nurses  though. When everyone is failing a test, the problem is not with the employee. The problem is with the education. I won't stay simply on pprincipal. I won't put up with seeing my co-workers beat down. Pay is good but I'd rather wait tables!"
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",The attitude is that they are elite. However, they aren't all that."
"Baylor Scott & White Health",",great facility, find the right people and you can take your career to new heights, however make the wrong ones upset or don't fit can make workdays difficult and cause gossip."
"HotSchedules","Fun place to work where employees will be challenged to do their best. Great coworkers, with a wonderful work/life balance."
"HotSchedules",",Note the other review from a Software Engineer in Sept 2015... the perks mentioned - lunches, snacks, events -  are gone after the most recent big layoffs. "
"HotSchedules",",As stated, they underpay. I took less money to work there and got much more and the following job.  "
"HotSchedules",",They are tech-debt heavy- the rush to put something out eclipses everything else.  "
"HotSchedules",",The product is a mix of LOTS of different tech - Backbone down to XSLT - so ticket to ticket you don't see alot of continuity.   "
"HotSchedules",",And they seem to be outsourcing more and more."
"HotSchedules",",This is a great place for experience. Very family oriented and beer, work hard play hard. Free pizza every Friday and games."
"HotSchedules",",HotSchedules is a great Austin company to work for that is rapidly growing.  They have a great culture and definitely believe in the work/life balance."
"HotSchedules",",The good:"
"HotSchedules",",HotSchedules has a lot of nice, talented people. There are decent perks such as subsidized lunch delivery, snack bar, ping pong and foosball tables, and the occasional company sponsored fun event. There are lots of interesting new products to work on."
"HotSchedules",",The bad:"
"HotSchedules",",There's a decent amount of attrition, which means many people aren't happy. The company underpays and and some of the managers seem to be in it only for themselves. "
"HotSchedules",",The company sets unrealistic arbitrary deadlines for software and then rushes out products whether of not they are ready for prime time. As a result we put out buggy products. Then they wonder why they aren't catching on."
"HotSchedules",",The fun events keep getting cheaper and more rare. The benefits are so so."
"HotSchedules",",opportunities for advancement but behind curve as far as compensation."
"HotSchedules",",- office is improving"
"HotSchedules",",- fast paced"
"HotSchedules",",- relaxed atmosphere"
"HotSchedules",",-"
"HotSchedules",",Very unique positions that don't really transfer to and from any other work place. They understand completely when family just happens. Benefits package is excellent along with the vacation pay."
"HotSchedules",",This is a very young company that is run like a fraternity. They hire for personality not necessarily  job skills. They demote talent in favor of yes, men."
"HotSchedules",",Interacted with clients mainly in the restaurant business all day, we trained and fixed any issues with the software for the customer. The workplace is very relaxed and a fun environment. Everyone gets along with one another."
"MassMutual Financial Group","I learned quite a bit for the short time I was with MassMutual. I had a great manager. He is incredibly smart and encouraging. "
"MassMutual Financial Group",",We have great weekly meetings and I still remember many of the tips I still feel I can use today as I interact with constituents."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",Great company to be a part of. Customer needs always comes first and cares for their employees.  Our mission is We Help People Secure Their Future and their Loved Ones."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",Company has great offerings for its clients, however the support and payment structure is more suited for experienced reps within the industry.  There was a huge push for results by all associates using a cold call system.  The cold calls were just that ""Cold"" and were from areas within the city that didn't necessarily meet the type of clients they were trying to associate themselves with."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",I go into work and because I'm new there is a completely team training in all areas.  I also contact referrals, prospective clients, and a full financial plans."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",An excellent place to work and grow. I spent many years Managing many different areas with support from my management, I moved from the Business area to IT upon the request of the IT division."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",Wasn't there long enough to get a feel for the company post acquisition. Wish I could offer more in this review but I'm not in a position to offer anything impactful."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",Great place to work! Many opportunities. Nice bonuses in some departments.  Able to even work in MA if you are wanting to see your family, but to do have the time to take off."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",MassMutual does a great job of having a sense of community responsibility. They are very aware of the need for diversity in the workplace and how it supplements creative and prosperous thought."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",Since my start here, many years ago, I was well trained and given lots of opportunities to grow and move around within the company. I understand many things have changed but I am thankful for having a great career here."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",MM is undergoing major changes internally in hopes of achieving expenses efficiencies and a larger market share.  MM is a very strong/solid company."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",MassMutual was a good place to work for when raising my children. Depending on your manager you were supported as a working parent. Unfortunately the companies prides themselves for working mothers but they do not require all managers to manage in this manner. Everything is left up to management discretion. Once you reach the age of 40 and have over 20 years of service, you know you time is limited. If you area happens to be hit with layoffs, those are the first to go."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",Reputable company.  Job stability if you are in the Springfield MA area near the headquarters.  Company is trying to be more progressive.  Benefits are solid."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",Large company with excellent room for advancement. Excellent benefits packages. Unlimited income potential and career growth. Extremely diverse employer."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",Great place to work, but like many companies in the job market today you are never truly secure. Benefits are fantastic and great development opportunities for ambitious achievers."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",Great company, but the position of Customer Service Representative was challenging. Very fast-paced and somewhat thankless. But there are opportunities for advancement."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",Company is growing too fast and has little regard for the people that they employ.  Management has little insight into the day to day struggles and needs of the employees.  High numbers of contractors in PM and IT support positions."

"MassMutual Financial Group",",Systems Administration- maintain operations of all windows servers, focus on all aspects of Windows admin. Using VMWare build and modify servers according to Client specifications."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",Manager is excellent, cares about staff, work/life balance, team -oriented, team focus and overall experience is rewarding thus far. Typical day is dealing with clients externally. Very frustrating however when client work against you rather than work with you, makes the relationship you are trying to build very difficult."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",I believe it to be a very well-rounded company in all aspects. The broad diversity, work-life-balance, and working culture allows for people to have a sense of enthusiam for the company and for their direct jobs."
"MassMutual Financial Group",",Although I was with the Mass Mutual DI Department for a short time (6months) I was able to connect and enjoy the team. Each day was different and the team connection was vital."

"Ibotta",",Solid teamwork, great culture, on point CEO and management. I look forward to coming in each day. Watching this company grow is fulfilling and heartwarming."
"Ibotta",",I love the variety of hours I work, and the days I can work. I have learned how it is to deal with customers via email and not face to face. Management is helpful. I don't have direct contact with Co-workers but we help each other using Hipchat. Hardest part of the job is not being able to explain to customers face to face or on a phone line.  I enjoy this job because I can work from home and not have to drive anywhere."
"Ibotta",",9-530 work days. As a customer service rep you get block days off, but not weekends. "

"Ibotta",",Expect to stay late and be able to pivot on a dime. The company lacked clear direct when I was there which was very frustrating from a brand building perspective."
"Ibotta",",great company! I feel like I am apart of something special. Young and fun atmosphere. You have to be easy going and a self starter to work here!"
"UTC Aerospace Systems","Family rented company. great staff.Good perks. Great company to start your new career."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",Nice facility some challenging work. When using solder you must be very careful and safe. Management philosophy is influx. A lot of changes was happening to promote and balance work schedule"
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",I worked in shipping Receiving ClerkII forklift I love my job.done the work unsupervised for about 7yrs.bymself l lived good and made good money."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",Do not work there, no loyalty, don't care for the employees, they give you a hard time,Favoritism, H.R don't listen to your concerns.No Fun,Sucks....."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",Not a bad place to work, A lot of very dedicated and smart people. Pays well and offers a good work life balance. Stressful at times."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",Hard working employees should be recognized and appreciated. All employees are rated similar rather than talent being identified promoted and groomed for further success of the company."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",Elementary Management team. Creates a poor work environment that takes advantage of good employees. Too often the focus is on quantity and not quality. Team Managers have little to no interpersonal communication skills. Salary does not meet the industry pay rate. Very toxic environment that is created in the boardroom and passed down through the directors. No feeling of job security even after going above and beyond to support the customer. Even after working every Holiday and literally preventing a line down situation at Airbus and Boeing numerous times. Management accepts all the credit. A place where you are a number and not a human being. I literally had to put close to $19,000 in overtime because noone would help me achieve customer demand."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",Days would consist of checking the Pratt & Whitney shop floor for any parts that arrived over night and any quality issues that came up over night. These would then be reported to UTC at a morning phone conference. Then, throughout the day the team will keep track of what parts are suppose to show up, what quality issues occur, and track down any serial numbers that were at Pratt & Whitney for several different reasons."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",UTC was overall a good place to attend employment each day. As a young individual it was easy to connect and make friends in the work environment."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",UTC has a lot to offer as a company for growth and job security, highly focused on quality of the product that is produces here at this site."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",Although you get a better pay for this area, you must be willing to give up your home and family life, because the company doesn't care about it's employees, and works way too much over time. The company is poorly managed, the supervisors are unable to do their jobs because of the poor management, which in turn, makes it harder on the union employees to do theirs."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",UTC Aerospace systems was a great place to work.  I had many opportunities to learn and perform new tasks. Overtime was plentiful."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",My experience there has been substandard but doable. I wished I could have moved more quickly in advancement."

"UTC Aerospace Systems",",Opportunity for advancement with fair reviews and ability to grow based on results"
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",Teamwork environment with recognition for both team and individual performance"
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",Our quality management team has changed leaders within the last couple of years. All they care about is supporting production and moving hardware. They don't care about following procedures, and the quality personnel on the floor have no one on their side. Quality supervisors of technical areas have absolutely no idea what their subordinates do, and have no desire to learn how to support their employees."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",Human Resources is terrible. They do not take complaints seriously, unless they are complaints from management. If anyone raises questions and concerns about a member of management who is violating company policy, discipline falls on the employee raising concerns."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",If you have any sort of integrity, the Riverside CA facility is not for you."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",I really enjoy this job and all that it comes with it, however the only downfall is their layoffs. It's a friendly environment with lots of room to learn and grow."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",Big Company with some good and back things.  It can always benefit from reduced management.  It has grown too large to be efficient."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",I've worked at UTAS twice in the past 5 years and been laid of with zero notice twice. Easy job but no security there. They lay you off and bring you back like a yo yo. Hard workers stay but are whipped like a wagon mule for more work."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",Great products and a vast customer base made for a lot of pride in the job. Coworkers were wonderful people, very driven and intelligent."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",I was not a fan of ACE as I have been exposed to simpler and more effective improvement models such as lean and six sigma."
"UTC Aerospace Systems",",One of the better jobs in the country.  Free Pension. Stock options. Benefits. Strong union. Workload is up/down. Weekend overtime is 100% voluntary.  Good clean atmosphere."

"FICO",",Change in management has put FICO back into ""improvement"" mode, which is good, however, many processes have existed in the past and just need to be re-instituted not re-invented.  It is hard to watch the company travel in a circular path over and over with each leadership change."
"FICO",",Great people, advanced technologies, good office culture;"
"FICO",",But unwise arbitrary firings for the ""cost cutting"" reason destroyed several perfectly well functioning teams;"
"FICO",",Always moving and changing. They only care about the bottom dollar. They used to care about employees. The benefits are bad and the premiums high."

"FICO",",I moved to VA and started working at the Annandale location. My manager was based in TX and almost never came to the office. She was very negative about the senior manager on-site and tended to gossip and undermine everyone including the senior manager that was HER boss. We were coached on what to say/complain about during meetings to create an atmosphere of negativity for everyone. So much drama created by one lady-especially since she created the drama over instant messenger most of the time."
"FICO",",I realized that this is not a position that has advancement potential. The constant tension between the TX-based manager trying to manipulate the local senior manager was really the worst experience I had-very unprofessional. No one seemed to talk about this but it was very obvious to me so I decided to look elsewhere."
"FICO",",The company also offered a work at home option for Fridays but took this day back from us explaining that the decision was ""policy from above"" despite the fact that our manager worked from her home every day in TX and failed to explain why the company allowed her to work from home."
"FICO",",Co workers were nice. Lots of free time-we weren't always busy. Many people surf internet or chat on cells during lulls since the manager is out of area. I found a better, more upwardly mobile position in DC with a substantial increase in salary with none of the weird politics @fico."
"FICO",",This would be an ok placeholder job to tide you over untill you find the real job you want elsewhere. This is not a place that will advance your career."

"On-Board Services",",I have been with on board for 5 months. They had a system crash in the beginning of getting my last job. I was told one year contact, called on a Friday evening to tell me "" your not the right fit"", however I worked very hard and represented on board very well.i was told I would be placed right away for Job loss, yet I see jobs on indeed and non money is contacting me for opportunities. I had an issue with a worker at my last contract to which I had Layed out a complaint and information on what happened and was basically told that my concerns were not valid by onboard. I do not see them trying to find me work while I have a child at home and beyond enough qualifications to work half the jobs they post."

"RAND Corporation","Working at RAND corporation was a mix of great and sorrowful. Many times I felt like I was not wanted or needed. There seemed to be something on the senior supervisor's mind that went without specific expression."
"RAND Corporation",",Mgmt is terrible , pay is terrible , if your a researcher it's great I guess . Lots of clicks but great location and free parking .,"
"RAND Corporation",",There is no typical day at RAND. It's a world class organization with world class researchers. People work hard, juggle many tasks and clients, which require a high degree of collaboration across departments."
"RAND Corporation",",Worked there as a temp for a month.  Never felt comfortable in the role, and often felt like I was being watched from the time I arrived to when I left."
"RAND Corporation",",I learned that people can be filled with a lot of egos in a think tank such as RAND.  The hardest part of the job was the constant hovering over the supervisor did while I was there.  When the assignment ended no one wanted to just say that I would not be continuing the assignment, yet when escorted out of the building every one pretended that they were interested in me personally."
"RAND Corporation",",Surprisingly, their computer system was wonky too lots of working around the ""systems"" and lots of disorganized rushed behaviour."

"RAND Corporation",",Worked for the company for a number of years and have to mention that it was an extremely high demanding place to work. Work life balance is non existent, more and more is expected and there are constant changes in the way work is done. Lots of people in charge to answer too and no one to provide helpful information to get the job done."
"RAND Corporation",",It is a great part time job"
"RAND Corporation",",-Great if you like working with people "
"RAND Corporation",",-You need great communication skills "

"RAND Corporation",",-Need to be a team player."
"RAND Corporation",",Being a part of a think tank in a research environment was a very different and welcoming experience.  The diversity, depth, and variety of talent of the employees spread across the different divisions is astounding.  RAND is an organization which values its culture and values, and it shows through and through."
"RAND Corporation",",RAND is full of friendly, interesting, and intelligent individuals. The work may be a bit repetitive but important to in a societal sense."
"RAND Corporation",",I am fortunate to have worked with RAND Corporation; everyone of my co-workers and assigned researchers, as well as the administrative staff, was responsive, helpful and available whenever there was a need; communication between every department or unit was always available and, as a result, we were able to accomplish the task at hand."

Based out of California there is a real concern for the overall well-being of the employee. They hire the cream of the crop, so if you are lucky enough to get in, congrats."
"PwC","PWC is an amazing place to work, and really rewards employees with high work ethic. Throughout the day you will meet many challenges, and be relied upon by coworkers to keep up your end. Management is both understandable and approachable. I've learned that what you put in is what you get so always make sure to give it your all to reach your goals."
"PwC",",Depends on role. Varies by level and focus area in the organization. Provides advancement and opportunities to grow core skills and explore other areas of interest over time."
"PwC",",Culture is dry and command and control.  Lack of international capabilities.   Internal structure and communication style is old and unstructured.  some people are nice."
"PwC",",I worked at PwC as a compliance intern. The Jersey City compliance team is very friendly and heavily rely on interns during summer. Cons: Assignments can get repetitive."
"PwC",",Many leaders in place that were good revenue generators but should not be managing people.Hoping that new CEO will be able to turn around mess made by previous Advisory leaders."
"PwC",",PwC is a great firm to work for and provides numerous opportunities for staff and other people.  You are surrounded by smart people and the culture of work life balance is great."
"PwC",",PwC is one of the best places I've worked.  As a firm, they invest in each of their employees to grow their career.  You work extremely hard for your projects but the reward is beyond what you can imagine.  You are surrounded by exceptionally intelligent and forward thinking people who always teach you something new.  The dynamics at PwC allow you to really push to be a better version of yourself."
"PwC",",Pros: There are the many opportunities and resources of a large, efficiently-run company. Flexible work arrangements to an extent. No micro management."
"PwC",",Cons: Busy season workload can be very heavy, and busy season can last for a long time. Coworkers can be gossipy."

"PwC",",array of people from all walks of life which helped me to grow as an individual and learn to work under many different circumstances."
"PwC",",Had a great internship experience. Work was challenging and hours were brutal, but if you're an accounting student looking for experience or an internship, PwC is hands down the best.  Developed my knowledge and skills and prepared me for the future."
"PwC",",PwC has a reliable progression framework and is a place to learn a lot, but the job will always come first.  There is a concerted effort towards flexibility, but no matter how much you flex, the volume stays the same and must get done.  Truly must have passion for the product and service to withstand to rise to the top."
"PwC",",A great place to work and full of opportunities that allows you to enhance your technical and soft skills. The diversity and the work culture is the most enjoyable part of PwC"
"PwC",",Flexible work times, great level of management structure and feedback, friendly environment with business casual dress. Overall, I enjoyed my experience with this company and would highly recommend them."
"PwC",",This job always has the different challenges of the new projects The hardest of the job is hard to have a balanced work and family life since it would request a lot of traveling time. The company has a very good vacation benefits and unlimited sick days."
"PwC",",I really enjoy working for PwC, however, I feel that career progression is extremely difficult within the firm. The culture is awesome at the firm and there are a lot of team building events, which I think is important for staff's morale."
"PwC",",It is a really good place to work. Good place to learn and good place to improve your mathematics and statistics skills. I have learned so many tax regulations and excel skills related to financial industry."

"Smith Hanley Associates, LLC","Smith Hanley Associates is such a great place to work.  The environment is terrific, one where management is supportive and work/life balance is promoted.  This is the type of role where the sky is the limit.  If you want to grow your business and income and have that entrepreneurial spirit then this is the place to be!"
"Smith Hanley Associates, LLC",",While management are very supportive and look for ways to help each recruiter succeed, our success at SHA depends on the amount of time and effort each person is prepared to put into their work.  If one's billings are good, then the amount of time you work is up to you.  The lack of red tape and the ability to address any concern with management is also very refreshing."
"Smith Hanley Associates, LLC",",Do you have superior business instincts?  Are you persistent?  Are you curious about people?  These are some of the characteristics of the recruiting team you will find here at Smith Hanley.  Recruiters here manage a particular book of business and the smarter they work, the better they do.  The leadership team provides the tools and guidance to help recruiters be successful, but ultimately, it's up to each recruiter to produce results. Great office dynamic in a good location."
"Smith Hanley Associates, LLC",",Smith Hanley Associates is a great place to work for those who are productive in an independent environment.  The niche verticals allow you to become a subject matter expert and make confident recommendations for clients. "
"Smith Hanley Associates, LLC",",The amount of business you take on is up to you and there is no pressure to from upper management, unless you aren’t doing well.  Management is always looking to help and make you comfortable in order to be the most successful you can be."
"Smith Hanley Associates, LLC",",Smith Hanley Associates is a great place to work and promotes a very collaborative environment. Although we are identified as a boutique and niche recruiting firm, it is personally rewarding in the sense that I am constantly working cross functionally with my colleagues. It promotes an atmosphere of respect and healthy competition."
"Smith Hanley Associates, LLC",",Being a boutique staffing firm, opportunities for advancement are slim, however when compared to the work life balance and satisfaction I get out of being hands on, I find it to be a great fit for myself. Our recruiters here are always looking to learn more and management is always open to fielding questions of any kind. "
"Smith Hanley Associates, LLC",",4 of 5 stars!"
"Smith Hanley Associates, LLC",",The independence of running my own specialty niche is what attracted me to recruiting and to Smith Hanley.  Of course, the high level of compensation that is possible didn't hurt either!  It is a supportive environment but not an intrusive one and the support staff, database system and office setting couldn't be better.  Roles are clearly defined so there is none of the fighting over candidates or clients that exists at some recruiting firms and the opportunity to own your own clients is open to everyone...not just owners.  Associates are personable and just fun to work with.  The longevity of the company and the reputation of the firm because of that integrity and longevity make recruiting that much easier."
"Smith Hanley Associates, LLC",",Smith Hanley has  a business model and if you stick with you will make good money.  If you don't  - you'll be buckling the system and not be that happy."
"Smith Hanley Associates, LLC",",I was a contractor with SHCG. Very friendly recruiters. Great to work with."

"UCLA Health",",mostly everyone is cordial."
"UCLA Health",",Everyone is friendly and so helpful!  I would recommend UCI Health for employment.  UCI Health is a place that you can learn and interact with all levels of management.  There are no silos as they all work as a true team."
"UCLA Health",",Director is a problem, real p o s.  Very hostile. A bully, stressful work environ. Not because of cases or ancillary staff so much as is the Director.  Retaliates against you if you call in sick. Regular Staff extremely overworked.  Only new grads hired as Director maintains a oppressive work atmosphere. Staff constantly training new grads.   Experienced perfusionists are never hired on staff as director fears for her job due to own incompetence.  Lazy, pumps minimal cases.   Why would you expect there is Always a job opening.  She needs to be fired."
"UCLA Health",",Most nights were busy but not overwhelming because many of the patients were quite sick with many procedures and meds. I learned something new that I did not know or had seen before just about everyday I was at work. All co-workers were very helpful and caring. The hardest part was  losing patients you had been taking care of for so long. We always had good food to share and many potluck dinners and parties at someone's house."
"UCLA Health",",It was a good job before I got hurt and after that it was all down hill. Being harassed, management is inadequate of fulfilling their duties. Co-workers help make it bearable."
"UCLA Health",",great place to work, great benefits, good place to advance . Not a great place to balance your personal life and work life."
"UCLA Health",",I sort of find it your typical organization where full time employees stay for many many years.  Main issue is people get promoted just because they've been there a long time but don't have the skills."
"UCLA Health",",I find many people with titles that exceed their knowledge or skill level.   Positives are it's a good work balance and pay is good."
"UCLA Health",",Culture is blah for me I like a more casual environment this is more uptight but it's a hospital so hard to argue in that respect."
"UCLA Health",",UCLA Health's mission & vision are not only met but exceeded. "
"UCLA Health",",Received UCLA Health's STAR Reward 2016- Outstanding Supervisor, improved quality and patient care."
"UCLA Health",",Management has favoritism, and they take the side of staff who is there for yrs. Even thou they are wrong. Dont listen to both side. They will just fired you before the 6 months probation like on your 5th months. No memo or 2nd chance even thou u have no absent and late. But other staff its ok. To absent because they are white. In short racist company. All gossip and no consideration. They dont honor your license or education. They dont care to new hire. They should remove people who is not qualified dont have bachelor or license. Not those who is new but qualified. Too stressful to work. A lot of bad people."
"UCLA Health",",Great work environment with everyone focused on the goals and working toward them. Enjoyed one another as part of a team. Excellent customer service skills throughout organization."
"UCLA Health",",I have worked in health care for over 10 years and never have come across a manager so disorganized, clueless, and someone who is easily manipulated by her subordinates.  The only thing enjoyable about this place was the delightful patients, doctors and most of the nursing staff minus a couple."
"UCLA Health",",The patient experience is always first. However, leadership is a challenge with regard to support and favoritism. "
"UCLA Health",",Great culture of front line staff."
"UCLA Health",",I worked for UCLA (LAX Location) and this location was extremely unprofessional as far as Management goes. People who have no background in one area get promoted and trained by the people who really deserve the position."
"UCLA Health",",Reputable institution with great benefits.  Nice retirement plan for those who devote 5 years with this organization.  Also must establish connections with the right people for upward mobility."
"UCLA Health",",Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine:"
"UCLA Health",",Management was completely inept at managing employees and handling employee affairs. Management was overly aggressive and, at the same time, non-interactive, unapproachable, uncommunicative, and unable to take the initiative to investigate and confirm whether there was any substance to perceived problems, often because Management itself would create those misperceptions. Thus, Management simply acted negatively and believed negatively about almost everyone while believing Management to be the ""savior"" of the organization. Management had nothing nice to say about anyone, including other departments like HR, or other units within the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. Management would tout its abilities and achievements to Upper Management while actually being a disaster and not having much experience with handling administrative matters. Management also had a very real problem with the School of Medicine and there was a nonsensical and idiotic rivalry with or hatred for SOM employees and programs (even though, ultimately, they are all part of UCLA, hence the idiocy of it all). This distaste for SOM extended toward even high-ranking SOM employees also within management. Management disparaged and spoke remarkably unprofessionally of SOM Management, saying that SOM Management was not qualified and lucky to be hired. Management verbally prided itself on being scary. Management verbally announced it didn't care about quality applicants but needed positions filled. Management blatantly lied. A specific example is when"
"UCLA Health",",  "
"UCLA Health",", Management claimed there was no research within the building. In fact, there are numerous SOM employees working in a subsection entitled, Research & Development. To what purpose or effect this lie was supposed to have, is unable to be ascertained. And to think this lie would never be exposed is completely insane. This is indicative of the poorest management skill and/or training, gross unprofessionalism, disastrous lack of humanitarianism, revolting arrogance, and a nearly complete loss of connection with reality. Former employee feels most for the children (i.e. young adults, interns, students, and postdocs) that come to UCLA Health to learn, grow, and start a career. Former employee was blessed with great mentors and human beings when entering the workforce for the first time. The young people there will not get a great example and may mistakenly believe that the world or every organization is like this. This is sadly Mean Girls being brought to life within an organization that currently enjoys the reputation of being Top 3 in the Nation and Best in the West. UCLA Health is physically fragmented and divided with some units being nearly completely cutoff from the organization and left to develop a Lord of the Flies culture. HR is whittled down to almost nothing but Recruitment and has no neutrality or strength to assert itself. Leadership within the management hierarchy has no vision into cutoff units and therefore no ability or mechanisms to improve or prevent gross misconduct by members of its own management. Leadership is too distant and too far upward to be felt or relied upon in times of need by grassroots employees. Executive Leadership needs to take the time to come down from its high level perch and police its own, ensuring that respectable, moral, and positive mentorship is constantly being applied and that synergy and harmony is enforced within and between units. Executive Leadership needs to promote within management that no decision or action should be taken without moral, sound judgement and good cause. And, of course, to terminate Management that insists on bad-mouthing and lying, even when it is only done behind Leadership's back and to subordinates of Management."

"UCLA Health",",Fun job and provided great training on learning Epic system. Medical center is huge so navigating the complex can be challenging. Get their early trust with hopes that they would work with us."
"UCLA Health",",I developed great Administrative skills and provided a quality work environment for staff and patients.  I maintained the hospitals core values and demonstrated leadership on a daily basis."
"UCLA Health",",Top notch health system rated #3 in the nation and best in the West, the IT organization has Stage 7, Most Wired and Meaningful Use status.  Great place to work place to work with nation's top leaders in healthcare."
"UCLA Health",",The work environment is diverse.  I learned about my coworkers' cultures and backgrounds.  Because of that, I  got along well with my team fast.  I learned how to listen actively, identify the problems and offer helps.  I also learned how to deal with difficult patients by using above mentioned skills."
"UCLA Health",",Event though leadership says they support ""just culture"" employees are afraid to come afront and report near misses thus preventing improvement in process. God forbid you complain or voice an opinion, you will be under the radar for suspension.    Almost impossible to grow higher in the position due to management being there for 20 or 30 years. UCLA is concidered one of the best hospital in the nation but sure enough only employees can justify otherwise."
"UCLA Health",",Day to day operations at a Family Health center include all agenda items from patient check-in to scheduling follow up appointments, insurance verification, referral/authorization processing and medical record correspondence."
"UCLA Health",",The daily workload is directly correlated with the number of employees that arrive each day.  This is the hardest part of the job as well as maintaining good standing relationships with poor leadership/management staff."
"UCLA Health",",The best part of this job is that every healthcare worker really does change the life of some individuals and help patients overall."
"Snap-on","Working at snap-on tools was a good experience, the training was long days and a lot of tool information, so you can be prepare, to deal with your end users..."
"Snap-on",",Overall I would recommend working here if you live in the Milwaukee area. Otherwise it's a long commute. Great pay, friendly co-workers, great benefits, always room for advancement."
"Snap-on",",Great job, ownership of franchise was a great learning experience and moving into management was a good choice. Greta way to learn customer relations"
"Snap-on",",This job required an individual to be self-motivated or else you couldn't be very successful at it. I learnt how to deal with customers and help them make decisions on items they may need to help them make their work easier. Also learnt a lot about how to keep financial records and budget myself when keeping inventory on my route truck. The customer interactions were very enjoyable and made a lot of new friends in the time there. Downside of the job would have to be the hours one would have to put in to be successful. A typical day would start at 5 a.m. and not end til around 6-7 p.m. This job didn't offer much of a social life during the week. But in that regard your success depended on how motivated you were to being successful."
"Snap-on",",Manage logistics of service technicians. Ongoing training of employees including new products, proper repair procedures and cost control.  Respond to customer complaints and inquiries. Assist in budgeting, pay increase and monitor service levels."
"Snap-on",",I worked their for a year and i enjoyed most of my time their.  the jobs arent hard and moving up in the company is easy and open to anyone willing to learn what they can."
"Snap-on",",I really liked snap on I was only using it to gain skills in selling but I deff would own my truck the tools are top notch u worked for a man named larry he was a really cool dude taught me a lot about cosing deals fast"
"Snap-on",",The tools are the best, hands down, but other areas of the company leave much to be desired.  Snap On is life, there is no balance, and not in a good way."
"Snap-on",",It was simple work but if someone decided not to carry their load it could make things hard on everyone else.  It required full team work to endure all work was completed but sometimes that presented to be an issue."
"Snap-on",",Snap on is an awesome job to have. The hardest part is probably working in the warehouse stocking and restocking the shelves. While on the truck driving from shop to shop the tools the mechanics and other need/use are mainly selling themselves."
"Snap-on",",I owned four Snap-On-Tool franchise and Snap-On Tools was such an amazing company to work for.

"Snap-on",",a typical day at work consists of: going to ones work station and preparing for the day. bending sheet metal and operating machines. combining parts to make a completed toolbox. lastly: sanding and sending it on to the paint line. the co workers were amazing and friendly. fun and unfiltered in a very comfortable environment."
"Snap-on",",these days were spent looking for new companies to try to make tool  sales.  We were given a new tool truck for customers to shop in, but the territories were too limited so growth was also limited."
"Snap-on",",When I arrive to the snap on truck in the morning the first thing I do is check if customers orders have came in put the orders in the days box(meaning if it's a monday customer put it in the monday box). Drive to automotive shops on the days route. Handing out flyers and new sales ads showing customers new tools to make there job easier. Bring customer's ordered tools or find a specific tool customer needs, if I don't have that tool order it for customer after finding it in the catalog. Charge customer for tool thats needed and apply payment to there truck account or snap on credit account. Print a receipt of payment which shows new account balance. At the end of the day close the day by counting till, blanacing till, print out end of day paperwork, file paperwork, check inventory sold to replenish, or order tool to replenish stock on the truck, turn lights off, set alarm and lock up truck."

"Snap-on",",Very busy fast pace, learned to deal with a diverse group of people. Management delegates me power and authority to get job done. Co-workers coexist me in getting the job done in a team oriented fashion. the hardest part of job is multi tasking. Most enjoyable part of day is when the job is finished and there are no complaints"

"Cigna",",Good place to work. Good place to have an opportunity to advance. Good trainers teach you their way of doing things in a 3 month time period."
"Cigna",",CIGNA is great at developing talent - going above and beyond for high performers in terms of advancement opportunities, raises and educational aspirations. Corporate culture is quite relaxed for such a highly regulated industry. You will learn a lot on the job - training is well done and thorough. When they closed the office in the city I worked in, they went all out in making sure that the displaced employees could move on in their careers, helping with job searches, resume redevelopment, relocation to other offices, generous severance packages, etc."
"Cigna",",Thoroughly enjoyed my daily work.  As a risk manager it was never the same and fascinating as I worked with almost all of the corporate departments.  I was provided opportunities to use my discretion to resolve claims working with our legal department I also had opportunities to reach out to plaintiffs.  "
"Cigna",",The culture changed over the past few years particularly due to the mergers and acquisitions within the industry.  I was provided an opportunity to take a lay off and thus my departure worked out great."
"Cigna",",Good Place to work , employment with Cigna has given me the opportunity  that is needed to further my career in the medical field"
"Cigna",",This initially was a great company to work for however management changed and then the company went down hill.  Not so pleasant place to work for- they don't care about the employees and the company's mission does not actually match how you are treated as an employee."
"Cigna",",I process insurance claims after the pharmacists approve them.  My job is to close them out.  I also work in IRE, which are out of compliance cases.  Once cases expire they are packaged and sent to another company to process.  My job is to get the files together.  I've learned a great deal about insurance, the processes, requirements, and time frames.  Management is there, but not active in technicians day-to-day duties.  The culture is very lax.  We can have cellphones,music, jeans.  I like that part very much.  The hardest part of my job is tolerating some of my team members who are not professional and caring.  Also, getting pulled in several different directions (being taken off an important task to do another task that is not as important) is stressful.  Overall, my job is enjoyable.  There is always work to be done, but sometimes the OT can be overwhelming, because they want so much of it."

"Cigna",",Have a very welcoming vibe , great people to work with . Always something to do & a nice moving pace . Company gives you $6 to buy your meal for a lunch brake everyday . Also they provide you with work shoes and uniform.  They teach you , how to do things probably,  if you don't know . Occasionally , the stuff to stock up can be little hard  to find at times . But once you know where it is , it gets easier ."

"Johnson Matthey",",very bad management.. you need to work like a slave otherwise they won't care about you. not good at all! dirty place etc..."
"Johnson Matthey",",The company is great, people are nice and friendly, a lot stayed for 30+ years. Currently moving from a small to a big scale operations and making IT changes."
"Johnson Matthey",",Business unit metrics controlled by detached CEO.  Operations has no morals or compassion. They only care about promoting themselves.  There is absolutely no advancement opportunities.  Hard work is rewarded with additional responsibilities."
"Johnson Matthey",",They are NOT SAFETY conscious at ALL!!! When something happens, it is all hush hush. There is NO learning that comes out of it. Surprised OSHA does NOT come down on them harder. Also, people are NOT valued. The head of HR has affiliation with the township in a HIGH RANKING capacity, so, some of what is done is for show! This is a union shop, but, HR runs the show. If you are NOT in the click with them, FORGET IT! Some harassment goes on, but, if you are in the CLICK, it is all swept under the rug! They are out to get you like scavengers. Will make up lies to get you! People are allowed to say and do what they want if they are in the click. If you are NOT in the click, you are treated like garbage until your need has been fulfilled and then you are thrown out on the street like trash without a can! Would totally recommend checking into things before starting working there, unless you are TOTALLY desperate!"
"Johnson Matthey",",Working at Johnson Matthey helped me gain knowledge and experience of catalytic converters in the car and diesel industry."
"Johnson Matthey",",Like working in a shark tank, everyone is out to throw people under the bus, no training, poor engineering, often buying the lowest priced equipment"
"Johnson Matthey",",Productive workplace. There are a lot of projects to be done to better the workers and production time. 12 hour shifts on a 2-2-3 schedule. Co-workers are generally nice. They try to hire young to keep workers for a while. Turnover rate is a little on the high side."
"Johnson Matthey",",It was a good job and I had good coworkers with great benefits but it didn't work out although I did get sent to Hazardous materials training which was very useful."
"Johnson Matthey",",If you want job security then this is a job for you. It is horrible to work here, even boring. There is zero culture and hardly any of the employees talk to each other. This makes for a horrible work environment and the only thing that is on your mind is when you can have your first drink or when you can go home."
"Johnson Matthey",",Well documented work flows and processes. Very friendly work environment and people are encouraged to improve their knowledge and to learn other department's processes."
"Johnson Matthey",",Company keeps up on the latest software/technology and allows for you to train to learn the new software. Typical day consists of password resets, machine rebuilds and software upgrades."

"Johnson Matthey",",I loved my job here and was often praised for my work and quality.  There were postings for advancement but often were filled from outside sources. Other than the advancement and job security, as I was layed off, this was a great place to work."
"Johnson Matthey",",I have been treated very well my entirety of employment. They have developed a great culture for the employees and are willing to teach any employee anything they want to learn. Everyone is very kind and safety in number one."
"Johnson Matthey",",Large company with tremendous growth, good benefits and workplace. Good training capacity, sorry the NJ office closed down, I had excellent managers at the office and wonderful dealing with the UK head office."
"Johnson Matthey",",Busy environment and fully work schedule; implementation of a new system almost completed, while previous one was terminated at the same time. "
"Johnson Matthey",",Great working environment and relationship. "
"Johnson Matthey",",Work under pressure and time restriction due to changes in monthly close and new system."
"Johnson Matthey",",When first working here, I was optimistic about the company. But, as the many years progressed, especially recently, the scales seemed to have fallen off my eyes and I see everything differently. I’m not sure about the other Johnson Matthey sites, but the West Deptford Chemicals and Refining plant is a very callous environment and because of no accountability paired with upper management’s lack of knowledge of what truly happens, there is always someone pointing a blaming finger and that usually leads to someone being let go or even forced to early retirement. Don’t count on your many years/seniority working there, because if one mistake is made they are very spiteful and will dismiss you (unless you have close ties with people like HR, you can essentially get away with murder.)"
"Johnson Matthey",",There is very unhealthy treatment to the people they should be valuing, especially to the union employees: health insurance is not as comprehensive as salary’s; as of currently, when first working there, they are not given paid vacation until after working there a full year and only given 5 days of which you are forced to use 3 of the 5 days for the company’s yearly shutdown/maintenance; the safety aspect is truly disappointing (there is a belief that many areas of the plant are safe, but if you take a closer look, you realize that it’s all an illusion); and they work in extreme temperatures (they have no system to effectively cool or heat up the plant).  The only benefit for union is you have the potential of a higher pay, usually more than the wage of salary employees.  Due to lack of dispensing"
"Johnson Matthey",",  "
"Johnson Matthey",", proper knowledge to those in training, as well as employee shortages, has forced many salary workers to put in a considerable amount of hours over the 40 hour work week without those extra hours being paid (this is common practice in departments, such as engineering or IT where usual work weeks consist of 50-60+ hour work weeks).  With all the money this company makes, you would think working hard has its benefits, but raises are not given to deserving employees and some past salary employees have been forced into early retirement."
"Johnson Matthey",",HR does little in helping the employees and many feel they cannot truly confide in the department without any repercussions (more like the Department of Corrections).  They should stop focusing on what new food event (wing off, bake off, meatball challenge, etc) they can come up with and start focusing on why many departments have high turnover (union production workers, quality control lab, security, etc). Honestly, times were better with the previous HR manager."
"Johnson Matthey",",As mentioned previously, Upper Management really requires more knowledge as to what is truly occurring in their site rather than just sitting at their desks strategizing- the best way is to immerse themselves in every department’s environment. If they want to make safety a priority, they need more involvement because as of now, although there is talk of safety being top priority there is inadequate action to improving it. "
"Johnson Matthey",",Those with little knowledge base/experience are placed into decision making roles, such as supervisors/managers, and their choices usually are not the best.  Overall, there is insufficient training for most of the departments."
"Johnson Matthey",",The pros working at this company- some of the benefits and if you are fortunate to have a good team you work with of which I am very grateful for. "
"Johnson Matthey",",In closing, it’s very interesting that several employees just this past year, have left. But, with all the problems that have evolved, I am not at all surprised."
"Johnson Matthey",",  "
"Johnson Matthey",",Great benefits, lousy place to work, no care about employees, Look anywhere else. Senior management looks to take credit for all improvements, but accepts no responsibility for lack of support or EHS. Human resource department is unprofessional and only there to back Senior Management in any decision, not create a good work environment"
"Johnson Matthey",",no real room for advancement.  Pay is subpar also. great place to start and get experience and then you should move on quickly."
"Johnson Matthey",",Overall a good company to work for. Great benefits for the family and a family atmosphere with fellow employees. I enjoyed my 20 years of service to our employees."
"Johnson Matthey",",Good for college grads , to get some GMP under belt . then move on.Poor management here in Pharma group ( unless your in the CLICK ) very little advancement.."

"System One","Pros-if I had a question about my pay, or Benefit coverage, the support staff in payroll and benefit  manager always answered my question, and willing to help at corporate. "
"System One",",Cons-work/life balance - never had the opportunity to use my vacation time as the workload and short staffing in my area required us to work 60+ hours a week just to get the job done, with no thank you.  It took a toll on my health and family life, which is why I left.  I hope someone will look at their internal staffing model for all areas as they have great hardworking people, but do not recognize the mid level individual who comes in and does their job everyday without any recognition."
"System One",",sucks was let go with no explanation"
"System One",",favors some that dont work to expectations"
"System One",",i learned that if you dont work hard for the company and play petty games you get to keep your job but if you work to a high potential and do more then expected you get let go!"
"System One",",During a typical work week, one of my biggest tasks is checking in on my staff and assessing their progress on various projects. I like to meet first thing on Monday to discuss our priorities for the week, then meet again in the middle of the week to check progress, and meet once at the end of the week to discuss goal setting for the next week. I meet with smaller groups of my staff during the middle of the week to troubleshoot any issues. For example, during a recent mid-week meeting, I noticed one team was a few days behind on a long-term project. I met with the team and, together, we came up with a strategy for increasing efficiency among the team. Along with constant interaction with my team, I also attend a weekly board meeting where I present my department’s progress to the executive board. On Fridays, once all these tasks are completed, I make sure I have completed all necessary communication for the week via email and in person, and create a list of priorities for next week."
"System One",",Supervisor not a personable individual, hard to work with, sometimes a hostile work place. supervisor allows personal issues to affect performance on job site, plays favorites, jumps to wrong conclusions, and does not back up employees (no support for field personnel)."

"System One",",Sys1 will place you at a customer site and you will be trained for that customers needs. Sys1 will bill the customer and pay you as their employee. You wont have any benefits as a contracting employee. Your co-workers will mostly be the customers but you may be placed with other SYS1 employees."
"System One",",I personally have trained half a dozen Techs for sys1 at my current customers location and the hard part for me is I make as much as my co-system1 workers make."
"System One",",I personally enjoy the people I work with both customer and sys1 but you have to remember they are the customer and not a friendly face."
"System One",",We worked long hard days, but I loved every minute of it.  You spent weeks on the road, but the job was very rewarding.  Working in the alternative energy field is something everyone can't say they have done and I have."
"System One",",Management structure seems very disorganized. ""Too many Chiefs and not enough Indians"". Very hard to get in touch with immediate supervisor. They don't want to spend the money for quality equipment/tools. Work trucks onsite were over 10 years old and in very poor condition. Work/Life balance is WAY OFF-balance!!!.  You go to work before the sun comes up, and you usually do not get home until around 6:30pm. So, you can never get your personal business done before 5pm.....which usually requires you to take off work early to get any personal business done. I was contract only, so absolutely NO benefits whatsoever. Hourly and overtime only. THAT'S IT. No per diem. No medical. No dental. No vision. No 401K. NOTHING. Upper management never seemed to know what was going on."
"System One",",Fun work place, Good communication, Great learning skills, and awesome teamwork. Good starting pay, better pay once you're rolled over. At times it could be a lot of layoffs due to the lines breaking down in the warehouse. Once you start working good its guaranteed to work 40hrs and over with overtime pay."

"System One",",The bought out the company I was working for so I did not work for them long enough to give a good review. The did offer a benefits package but I did not need it because I already had insurance. I did not have much interaction with the company. Everything from my previous employer's contract stayed the same when they took ownership."
"System One",",Thorough and always communicative.  Enjoyed my time with this company and would be willing to work again for them. Each person I spoke with was professional and responded timely."
"System One",",i loved the job it was just to far away for me and my ride to get up and be there on time the people where really nice and great i just couldn't take then ride to and from there"
"System One",",System One has been a very good place to work because what I most needed was flexibility.  I returned to work after being a stay-at-home parent and still needed to be available to my young children.  they offered the flexibility I needed at a competitive salary.  I have worked for them for over 13 years.  The Management was always available if I needed any assistance."

"Priceline.com",",Great place to work. I learned a lot collaborating with the other QAs in the department. The commute from the train by shuttle made it easy to get to work without having to drive."
"Priceline.com",",Priceline is a great company to work for. They offered great benefits that didn't take up half your check. They had great incentive bonuses for attendance, QA, and customer comments. During a huge Ice Storm if you had made it in to work you were given a $100 visa gift card, they catered in food and drinks. We got to meet several celebrities such as William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy."
"Priceline.com",",The most impressive aspect of Priceline that I saw was the infrastructure.  There was a well-developed, thoroughly-tested infrastructure, in terms of software, hardware, and even personnel and policy.  The software infrastructure was not always well documented, but that was less problematic than usual, as there was a better than ninety percent chance that the developer who built any arbitrary component was still around to ask about it."
"Priceline.com",",Hours were flexible, telecommuting was frequently an option (and heavily recommended in inclement weather), and vacation time was plentiful (as a new employee, I accrued 18 days of vacation a year, anyone who stayed six years would receive 24 days).  There were some snags, developers could expect calls at three in the morning if their code broke, the noise level in the office became problematic on occasion, and there were known bugs in intra-office communication.  All in all, though, these issues were minor, and the company was actively working to remedy the last two (the first rather comes with the territory when coding for high-availability web services and pages)."
"Priceline.com",",The only factor that drove me away is completely beyond the company's control: snow.  If one is accustomed to frequent and heavy snowfall, this likely won't be a factor at all.  If, however, one hails from a warmer climate, it can be most troublesome."
"Priceline.com",",I feel the team as a whole is great and motivated, I think the company model is fun to operate in. The only turn off was during their growth it felt reactionary instead of planned. I would certainly refer people to work for Priceline/Booking because they are a stable growing business with high aspirations."
"Priceline.com",",not a bad place to be for a few years but don't look to advance here."

"Priceline.com",",I absolutely loved working at this company, met some great friends, had lots of fun working there. There is lots of favoritism at this company though, they were promoting employees who did not deserve it and were high on the job. What a joke. I loved that there was so many different nationality's working in the same building, I learned so much about so many different people. However, it also caused lots of problems, there is so much harassment that goes on in that company and no one in management does a thing about it."
"Priceline.com",",I really enjoyed my position with Priceline.com as a Business Development Manager. I was able to travel nearly 70% of the time and sharpen my sales skills with extensive outside sales and tele-prospecting. I worked with a strong group of professionals who offered support and training with a common desire to achieve success for the company and optimize revenue. Internally, we celebrated both small and big victories while pushing each other to achieve both professional and personal goals."
"Priceline.com",",I enjoyed working for different customers around the world. I tried my best at providing the best customer service to all customers. I enjoyed working on the computer and conversating over the phone."
"cars.com","I really like this company. It has a great product and place in its industry, a great spirit and corporate culture, excellent benefits, and they really work to care about their employees. Since I am not based in their main office, I unfortunately do not get to benefit from a lot of what they offer their employees, but they try to keep us involved. Originally coming from the publishing world, I have learned a lot about selling advertising and marketing services in the digital space. I am much more adept at technology-related tasks and appreciate much more what exposure on the internet can do for a business and my role in all that. I have also learned a ton about the industry they serve, which is much different from my past experiences and quite fascinating."
"cars.com",",The problem is that they are growing fast, so they are making changes to what they expect us to do besides sell their products effectively. Some are just a nuisance and some have been very disruptive. Often I have to spend an additional 3 or more hours a night after dinner, just to try to keep up with all the required training, research, record keeping, etc. Plus, they are adding sales staff to do what I do at a lower rate. They seem focused on those newbies at the exclusion and at times determent of the more seasoned staff. They have restructured the company so they have taken very lucrative accounts away from me without leaving me much opportunity to make back that revenue. And, there is really no other job at this company that I want to do, that I can do without moving to their main office."
"cars.com",",So, all in all, I am sad to"
"cars.com",",  "
"cars.com",", have to leave this company but I feel like it is time to move on. I look forward to finding another great company to produce for and learn from."

"cars.com",",Milwaukee Tool is a great place to work and learn! They have a fast pace environment that allows you to grow your learning and career."
"cars.com",",I've been with the organization since 2009, and the company has always been a great place to work. Management always encouraged feedback from its employees to understand our needs and wants to successful results."
"cars.com",",Decent job. Awful work life balance, no room for advancement, management is not always qualified for their job. Long hours, not great benefits at all."
"cars.com",",Typical day starts with scrum, meetings, regression and testing the product."
"cars.com",",Learned a lot of new features."
"cars.com",",Co-workers are ok."
"cars.com",",management:  fair"
"cars.com",",Hardest part of the job: Manager was outsourced in Delaware/New Jersey area.  Not very accommodating.  Never there to help the team."
"cars.com",",Enjoyable part of the job:  Happy to be part of Cars.com Company."
"cars.com",",Challenging work environment, great team, excellent opportunity to learn new technologies and advancement. Fun place to work"
"cars.com",",Cars.com is a very nice company located in the downtown Chicago area.  As with all jobs there are good times and there are bad times."
"cars.com",",As long as the job get done."
"cars.com",",I best thing about Cars.com is they leave you alone to manage your own territory. Yet, they select the wrong people for the most part to manager you. This leads to failure."
"cars.com",",There's the saying- the people make the company and I think that is true. I was surrounded by amazing coworkers when I started working for the company, but as I was promoted and the culture shifted following the purchase and some key leaders leaving, I was surrounded by arrogant closed minded alcoholics, who were more concerned with going to happy hour than doing their work. If you are looking for a company to start with, this is great- but for any professionals farther into their career, I advise to keep looking. Unless you are in sales- then this is a great place for you- the sales team is amazing and treated they should be, as that department is ran by some of the best managers I've ever seen. Anything outside of sales and operations- such as marketing, do yourself a favor and keep looking."
"cars.com",",The company was at one point in time a fun easy going company, it made me proud to say I worked for this company and was happy to promote the business even considering the low starting salary.  However after the company was bought out and then it's parent company was restructured the company's culture has changed from a work hard play hard company to work hard and work harder, and get less benefits and incentives to work.  There use to be a lot of office parties, game nights, cereal and cartoon days, etc. now there barely is birthday celebrations for the team I worked for.  The company cater more to the sales teams and not as much to other departments. Sure they try to promote that they are a company that values their employees and want to help them with career paths by allowing them to transition to other departments, however there is a lot of office politics that are in place that would keep you from getting the position you want because someone else has the ear of the hiring manager and want someone else in that position."
"cars.com",",good company to work for, for entry level. work life balance is great management is good with coaching new hires. cars.com is the leading third party provider for cars sales"
"cars.com",",It is a good company to start your working career. Good experience and good people around you to help you grow. Pay is low however but that is in part due to the work life balance. The benefits are great also."
"cars.com",",Great place to work. Industry is very crowded, but leadership keeps us ahead of the curve. Would recommend for prospective employers."
"cars.com",",Cars.com is a great company for young people to begin their careers. There is a lot of growth opportunities for data or product driven people. There is also a lot of career development options for those that want to do be propelled to leadership or management. "
"cars.com",",There is a lot of micro-management at times to drive big business practices and low communication between departments. There is also a lot of reliance on individual contributors, which is a great opportunity for people to learn. The culture is also very young and fun. People make life long friends here, and you have the ability to interact with senior leadership openly and your opinions are valued. Overall, I recommend starting your career here."
"cars.com",",Cars.com has changed a lot since being bought by Gannett.  The culture and people are great, and they provide a decent work-life balance. The people are the only reason I lasted as long as I did there. However, there is not much opportunity for promotions, and a lot of talent and top management has recently left the company. Pay is definitely under market, but it is a good place to start out to get your foot in the door."
"cars.com",",I am currently working with the Integrated Marketing Education (Honors Marketing) program at DePaul University to conduct various marketing tests for Cars.com"
"cars.com",",The people here are great. I've met many, if not most, of my friends here and have had some great experiences. However, in the last 18 months the culture has changed so dramatically it was not a fun or positive place anymore. Now that Gannett has bought them out and they've moved their management and work style into the culture it's even worse than ever before. I'd suggest only recent college graduates to come here and gain some experience but if you are looking to advance your career I would highly suggest looking elsewhere. Also keep in mind that the compensation is WAY BELOW every other digital or even start-ups in Chicago. I was speaking with recruiters who were offering me ranges $10K more than what Cars was giving me. I spent 4 years here and it was 2 years too long. "
"cars.com",",Pros: People and Work/Life balance"
"cars.com",",Cons: Poor compensation, shift of company culture, power-hungry upper management, close-minded management to any idea not their own, no room for growth and advancement, and poor department alignment and communication of responsibilities."
"cars.com",",I have learned a lot a Cars.com. It is a great culture with wonderful people. The people make the job wonderful and a joy to come to work everyday."
"cars.com",",Cars.com believes in empowering its employees but giving them the right tools and directions to take charge and make any project successful."
"cars.com",",As an IT Vendor Analyst, I was responsible for managing the relationships between our internal business owners and our IT vendors, ranging from staffing, hardware, software, etc."
"cars.com",",Each day was different, which was challenging and exciting, yet I chose to leave because eventually I wasn't learning anything new."
"cars.com",",The company runs on fairly old technologies and I wanted to keep my skills sharp."
"cars.com",",While a great organization to work for, with great people, products and innovative/learning environment, the compensation levels were on the lower end relative to similar companies."
"Life Time Fitness","I worked in aquatics, for starters you're a team member and you're expected to be one at all times, this alone has its pros and cons. "
"Life Time Fitness",", In the summer: The lifeguards are expected to watch 100+ people at a time while rotating for 20 minutes from stand to stand for hours in extreme heat without a break because of a bad seed who didn't show up to work and did not call and the manager will not fire for a nonsense reason, all for a whooping 10$/hour. So the hardworking team has to deal with the consequences for the actions of  that bad seed. Sometimes, when you do finally get a ""break"" you need to clean, work with members, and fold towels instead of being able to use the bathroom, get a snack, etc. For the most part the pool attendants will do the a lot of the cleaning and towel folding if they're hard working. However, if you get a lazy pool attendant that day, the rest of the team will be picking up that persons slack. When short handed, on top of sitting non stop for hours, you maybe manipulated into staying an hour or more longer because they may pull the team player card. In the winter, it is way more laid back, it's a smaller group as most of the staff is seasonal, breaks to eat a meal and use the bathroom are more common, there are less people around, and it's a great place to work. "
"Life Time Fitness",",Occasionally communication can be poor and they will schedule you for shifts you did not know about because the schedule was put up very last minute, or you are randomly scheduled for shifts before and after the time you were supposed to be there without being told. Other than the management,"
"Life Time Fitness",",  "
"Life Time Fitness",", the lifeguards and instructors are great and very friendly with each other and the free membership/discounts are unbeatable."
"Life Time Fitness",",  "
"Life Time Fitness",",They are a wonderful work family, good to their employees and a great place to workout and meet good people. Clean and great equipment the only reason i left was because i moved out of state."
"Life Time Fitness",",Lifetime was by far the best place I worked for and I enjoyed every moment I spent there. I met so many wonderful people and I highly recommend this gym to anyone."
"Life Time Fitness",",There is no opportunity for advancement or increased compensation.  Going above and beyond is not recognized or valued. On the other hand, the work environment is very flexible especially if you have a family and need a more flexible schedule.  Obviously a healthy way of life is an easy message to stand behind as well."
"Life Time Fitness",",I worked in the operations department. Generally your tasks are super easy & don't require a lot. However, mgmt constantly moves your target. Every manager does what they want. There's little to no consistency and communication for overall standards/expectations. Club culture is healthy overall, but inside drama kills any will to work."
"Life Time Fitness",",Been there 2 years. I moved up in the company within a month of working there. Management is professional and the kids are a joy. Love my work family!"
"Life Time Fitness",",Managing strategies are exciting and the environment is perfect for individuals who are looking for the healthy way of life. "
"Life Time Fitness",",-Keep facility clean"
"Life Time Fitness",",-Healthy work culture"
"Life Time Fitness",",-Inviting service"
"Life Time Fitness",",-Cleaning tasks"
"Life Time Fitness",",Very energetic, high paced environment. You are around kids all day so make sure you are prepared for the daily difficulties that may come with that. I enjoyed my time."
"Life Time Fitness",",Management was solid.  One of my first customer service jobs so it taught me a lot about making the most of a customers experience.  Nothing too difficult about the job."
"Life Time Fitness",",Love the environment and scheduling but needs better compensations. members are great staff and management okay, wish there was better opportunities."
"Life Time Fitness",",LifeTime Fitness was a fun Company to work for when initially beginning, although there is not much room to advance. Minimum wage for a prolonged period of time (near 2.5+ years) is a norm with lunch breaks (by Law) that do not occur. This is a good place to start for a second job but nothing too serious should be expected from the Company unless you give 70 hours a week to them to prove your loyalty; even then nothing is guaranteed. Networking is the most important part of joining this company because it will help you out in the long run once you decide to part ways."
"Life Time Fitness",",A typical day at the salon included a multitude of things. "
"Life Time Fitness",",Opening procedures included reviewing the batches of the night before and setting the system up for the current day. Throughout the day setting up appointments and making confirmation calls were key. Maintaining a clean and professional environment was another component to the job."
"Life Time Fitness",",My review on LifeTime Fitness is good.  Walking into the facility was always bright.  The members at the front desk were always welcoming me in, the sales representatives and i had great relationships, and the general manager and i got along very well.  I learned a lot while working there as being a team member, supervisor, and assistant department head.  I learned great values on how to run a team and my customer services abilities are through the roof."
"Life Time Fitness",",The turnover rate was so high and management constantly has issues keeping workers staffed. No one want to do this job because they pay you minimum wage while having ridiculous expectations. Management did a poor job of keeping employees accountable so we would usually have to do their job as well. On a daily basis it was my supervisor and I cleaning the entire building, doing the job of the front desk, being security, and all that while trying to keep members happy. The worst part was management did a very poor job of defending their employees when any situation came up."
"Life Time Fitness",",LT is a great temp job. DO NOT DO SALES. As long as i was there, sales was good for the money, but be prepared to have no social life outside of work."
"Life Time Fitness",",While I working in 3 different lifetime locations I can confidently say that the job absolutely offers security and are flexible with your work schedule. While teaching can bring some unexpected surprises I LOVED every relationship i made with my students and co-workers there"
"Life Time Fitness",",Awesome company to work for the environment was great and the staff was awesome! They treat there employs fair and with respect< i enjoyed working for lifetime a lot!"
"Life Time Fitness",",Providing an educational, entertaining, friendly and inviting, functional and innovative experience of uncompromising quality that meets the health and fitness needs of my students. I am currently still employed with Life Time Fitness and teach classes in the evenings. I have been a team member for 5 years and wouldn't dream of going elsewhere."
"Life Time Fitness",",Life Time Fitness is an active and rewarding experience, with days consisting of sports and fitness, yoga and wellness, arts and crafts, etc. The management is respectful and always willing to work with employees' schedules."
"Life Time Fitness",",A typical day consisted of teaching everyone from infants to adults the mechanics of swim. I learned that teaching adults was actually more difficult than teaching children; I overcame this challenge by asking adults to make small goals for every lesson. Management at Lifetime was excellent. Workplace culture was filled with active and happy employees. The hardest part of the job was encountering students with a fear of water, or putting their head underwater. I overcame this hard part by telling students to do sporadic jumps in the water in order to get used to getting their head and ears wet. From there, we would work on blowing bubbles. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my students happy about their swimming improvements and asking to learn more. There was satisfaction in knowing that my students desired to learn more from me and found class to be an enjoyable experience."
"Life Time Fitness",",The management lacks the most. It is difficult to get a raise at all if you work here. You are typically by yourself most of the time, which gets diffcult when the spa is busy and it would be benefical to have two coordinators at the same time working."
"Wayfair","Overall it's a good company. Although, compensation plan changes continuously. Compensation paid on shipped and not ordered/sold. Only 23% of the Business Account Managers, among the various locations, reached their shipped quota during the last quarter of 2015. Continuous sales games geared at reaching the metrics/numbers, takes away from customer management and relationship building, B2B Sales managed the same way as B2C Sales. Needs diverse marketing strategy. Leads need to be improved, small percentage are real business accounts.  "
"Wayfair",",Easy job, don't need college education."
"Wayfair",",I love my job here at Wayfair. I have learned a lot from being employed with this company. I have learned to be a better listen and to pay attention to detail. You are on the phone 95 percent of your day. They do take care of their employees. The hardest part of the job is dealing with an upset customer that you want to help but they are mad from the very start of the call, I let them vent and then tell them what I can do to help them."
"Wayfair",",Wayfair has some incredible people but most of those people jump ship when they see the direction the company is headed. HR is a disaster and upper management plays favorites."
"Wayfair",",very busy "
"Wayfair",",easy to learn within a matter of a day how the processes go "
"Wayfair",",loved the employee drawings "
"Wayfair",",holidays are highly acknowledged"
"Wayfair",",Learned a lot working here, very innovative culture. Lots of change during my experience here, definitely have as culture and vibe of being a start up"
"Wayfair",",I really enjoyed wayfair. The only issue for me was scheduling. There is no set schedule giving. It changes everyday but more on a perminet level which I couldn't accommodate"
"Wayfair",",friendly people. Your coworkers and bosses are always there to lend a helping hand and want to see you succeeding. Everyone works together to get through the work day."
"Wayfair",",Working at Wayfair can be very rewarding.  The company is rapidly growing and provides opportunities to get in on initiatives at the ground lever and lead to great opportunities for career growth.  Management is open to listen to ideas from and level member and take pride in the collaborative approach."
"Wayfair",",Most enjoyable part of the job is the diverse crowd you work with. What amazing folks work in the Ogden location. Co-workers were amazing and very talented. A typical day did not exist. It was a fast paced environment that required flexibility. Something new everyday."
"Wayfair",",Needed to write a review for this. It was fine. Students were chill and it wasn't hard to do. I liked helping my peers. Lots of mundane tasks from day to day."
"Wayfair",",great place to work, good benefits and close to home.  I have learned to work in a call center environment with management intertwined. I enjoy the ability to work independently in a team environment"
"Wayfair",",Very nice company to work with.  I learned a lot on all the years I worked for them.  I have nothing but good memories about this company.  I would still be with them if they haven't laid me off due to the economy crises few years ago."
"Wayfair",",A+ company! Would highly recommend Wayfair to all my friends and family, especially creatives looking to advance their careers."

"Wayfair",",Nice employee engagement presence."
"Wayfair",",Wayfair was an amazing place to work with fabulous training and awesome people. There is a relaxed environment with supervisors and employees that truly care about the customers and company!"
"Wayfair",",This was a very fun company at the beginning of my employment, however due to company growth and corporate driven decisions it lost everything that made it once cool.  It is no longer about the people that work there, it is about the performance and the idiotic metrics that they wish to track and pursue.  The management is headed steadily downhill."
"Wayfair",",Wayfair is an amazing place to work and a very fun advirment. There is always something happening and it will keep you on your toes. Working at wayfair will always be a great memory."
"Wayfair",",if u r on visa dont join. bad work life balance. only fixing bugs no feature development. management doesnt care about you. they will get rid of you in 3 months or 6 months if u r not exceptional. "
"Wayfair",",its a place where fun goes to die. they have a program called labs. that they hire college grads and get rid within 3 months. if you are experienced developer and hired on visa you are left with no employer after 3 months. dont join unless you are exceedingly confident you can perform. if you are on visa donot join. after 4 hours of interview they still evaluate you till 6 months and will fire you any moment. constant change in your department will make you very nervous"
"Wayfair",",Offered a variety of flexible shift schedules to meet the needs of all employees. A very fast paced environment with heavy incoming call flow. Monthly one on one reviews with supervisor. Constant potential to move up in the company. Very friendly atmosphere with a nice group of diverse co workers."
"Wayfair",",Worst company in Boston, underpaid, bro culture, disorganized management. They need to focus in hiring quality employees and investing in them and not just hiring for headcount. Would not recomentd"
"Wayfair",",Great place to work for anyone who likes a call-center environment. Mgmt means well and sincerely tries to assist the salespeople in meeting their goals, but the overall corporate future is very uncertain and so mgmt is forced to deal with and adapt to new major business challenges all the time. Mgmt also tries to keep morale strong with positive employee interactions and perks. Best compensation pkg I've ever heard of for call-center work."
"HELIX","Great environment, good people, positive attitude, hard work, safety is always an issue, but other then that supervisors, leads, and safety leads, security are good."
"HELIX",",Helix is undoubtedly a great place to work. "
"HELIX",",Apart from perks such as free food, direct shuttles, unlimited PTO, flexible work/life balance, amazing benefits, you know your work matters and the people make each day enjoyable."
"Kaiser Permanente","I was a temp and everyone treats you as an actual employee. I learned a lot. Management is very professional. Helping patients is very rewarding. The culture is all about customer service."
"Kaiser Permanente",",Busy, fast paced. Downfall it's only seasonal with no benefits.  I learned to micro manage my time. I love talking to KP customers and learning about medicare. Management is great but it's very corporate and that's what makes the job difficult, were human not robots!"
"Kaiser Permanente",",kaiser permanente is one of the leading health care in the country , i am fortunate to be one of their employee .

"Kaiser Permanente",",Some cons are micro managers, daily changes to work flows. Can be hard to keep up with"

"Kaiser Permanente",",its a verey good environment, the employees do not really let you do anything only because everything is confidential. I got to play with some kids that were there and it has really been a fun time."
"Kaiser Permanente",",Worked independently all day.   A very detail oriented  and structured environment.   Loved contact with physicians and the balance of computer work with other responsibilities.  The hardest part of the job was leaving when my husband found work out of state."
"Kaiser Permanente",",Great place to work. Great workplace culture. Great best practices workplace environment. Up to date technology used in patient care."
"Kaiser Permanente",",All companies should strive to be like Kaiser, dynamic, forward thinking, and full synergy.  Never the same work day which made for a quick workday!  The benefits were outstanding!"
"Kaiser Permanente",",I worked in 2 Urgent care locations in Maryland transfering from one to another due to poor management and felt like I went from the frying pan into the fire! Loved the pay and benefits but the management was so poor it caused a fearful work environment for all the staff. I couldn't work in such a toxic environment."
"Kaiser Permanente",",Each day at Kaiser we focused on finding new ways to continue being the top health care provider. This allowed for an environment  to be able to express yourself. As well as, room for improving the company. I learned about the importance of team work, and being able to work well with other. There way a big difference in the departments that recognized this. The management were excellent. They have always been their for me with person matters, education leave, or whatever was going on. As well as personable. Kaiser is very multicultural. I love to learn, so working with many different cultures opened my eyes to many things that I was not aware of. The hardest part of the job was reminding myself I am human. I hate making mistakes. I take it very personal by being hard on myself. I love food. Everyone at the job loved food just as much as I do. So everyday we found new places to eat."

"Hotels.com",",Hotels.com cares about their employees advancement and work-life balance. I was given excellent opportunities for job growth and learning of additional skills. If I ever move back to Missouri, I would definitely try to go back to work for them."

"Hotels.com",",In two weeks, I sold over $100k in hotels, closed over 52% gross and averaged about $400/sale.  Now...because of cancellations-which you can't control- my commission check was $0.00.  those same numbers in march would have earned me around $1,200.  "

"Bayer",",Bayer is a company filled with managers that only look out for their own. Half of the company is contractor employed and are not able to participate or be recognized by this company. The personal advancement in this company is based on what is most convenient for the company, not based on who most deserves or is most qualified for the position. As a contractor (which 90% start out as), you will not feel valued or taken care of."

"Idaho Department of Health & Welfare","When Working in Child Protection there is no typical day.  Every family that has their children removed and brought in to the foster care system have multiple and unique needs.  Case managers need to understand community resources, child development, alcohol and drug treatment, homelessness, jail/prison systems, court process and testimony, working with challenging individuals and families, understanding needs of infants/ toddlers/youth/and children who may be aging out of the foster care system.  These are some of the topics that come up on a daily basis.  Case managers spend a majority of their time on the phone, visiting with parents and foster parents, observation of visitation with families and children, documentation of everything that happens for a particular case."
"Idaho Department of Health & Welfare",",I have learned that there is no 'typical' family and there is no formula to working with families to help them to reunify with their children.  The key is that judgments can wait, because some people will work very hard to accomplish their Court-ordered case plans.  And of course there is the exact opposite where families cannot or will not be able to work the service plan to reunify with their children."
"Idaho Department of Health & Welfare",",Management at the Department is difficult to understand. There are multiple levels of people and their roles are confusing.  However, the direct line supervision is very good.  The individuals who work at the Department are some of the hardest working people i have ever met, and who are able to keep their sense of humor in a job that is very negative. "

Since the case management job is to help families become stable and safe, if the parents are not cooperative then there is no choice but to accurately reflect this lack of progress regarding parental protective capacity. "
"Idaho Department of Health & Welfare",",The best part of the job is when parents reunify with their children because they have determined for themselves that if they work their case plan as ordered, their children will likely be returned to the family unit.  That is a great day, and helps to offset the times when as a Case manager one is required to present an unfavorable report to the management at CPS."

"Idaho Department of Health & Welfare",",The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is a good place to work. Decent management, great people, and job security if you're into that sort of thing. The downside, the state legislature hates state employees and - since the legislature is responsible for setting pay - state employee pay lags ~18% behind the private sector in Idaho. With Idaho being a low wage state anyway, that's saying something."
"Idaho Department of Health & Welfare",",While Idaho government is one of the less horrible governments to work for, it is still government and you must be able to handle a stupendous amount of bureaucracy to work here."

"Parkland Hospital",",This is the worst place I have worked in almost 17 years of nursing.  Blame & shame culture, no accountability.  Layout of the hospital & nursing units is an absolute nightmare for anyone attempting efficient use of time.  Unsafe staffing leading to unsafe care of patients.  The only positive I can say is my coworkers were great although from what I understand many have left just as I did.  It's a ""we're all in this sinking ship together"" mentality which helps you make it thru the day."

"MIT Broad Institute",",While working at the Broad Institute I was really able to see how amazing the culture of intellectual discovery is at the Broad.

There are very nice chairs on every floor, as well as white boards in multiple locations. On many of my visits, I witnessed many scientists discussing cutting edge research in the common areas. The staff and management were very friendly and created a good sense of community. The hardest part of the job was commuting from Newton to Lowell for school during the day and commuting to Cambridge at the end of the day to conduct experiments, then commuting back to Lowell to drop off scientific supplies before going home. The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of community and togetherness that the Institute prides itself on. The Institute is also home to some of the most advanced machinery and equipment known to mankind and it instills a sense of awe at the sheer magnitude of the intelligence that went into creating everything that is in there."

"Cambia Health",",Life at Cambia Health Solutions/Regence BlueShield was an ever evolving experience.  I was hired by Regence and then a parent company was created several years later called Cambia which my department moved under.  Just like any given day in the office, you go in one day thinking you will finally get to expense reports and when you leave at the end of the day you may have never completed the expense reports as there were hotter fires to handle that day.  I enjoyed this aspect of the company.  There were constant learning opportunities from new software, equipment, company policies, etc. which allowed me to grow throughout my time at the company.  In addition to my department responsibilities, there were plenty of opportunities to volunteer for other company events and assist with other departments.  There was never a reason to be idle as you could always find someone who needed help with something.  The teamwork and collaboration amongst the admins made it a pleasure to go to work each day."

I come in and go straight to do what I have to, then start to help out on others,what else needs to get done , management is o.k., I just don't understand on why they keep changing on anything, their rules changing almost every two to three weeks,hard to keep tract on anything like that.The workplace is alright, I get along with everyone. The very hardest part is having your name being called out from 5 different areas on what is needed.

I do registrar and front desk clerical work all day long. I sit behind a desk, in front of a computer ALL DAY LONG! To top it all off: This is also a ""FLOATER"" position, which was also never discussed during the interview or job offer. Management is very unorganized. The response I get for all of my questions is, ""That's the way we've always done things, so that why we do it like that"". I get many dismissive responses to most of my questions."

"Mount Sinai Health System",",The surgery department is a very demanding work place but you learn how to multitask and work quick on your feet. Management is always on-call to support staff members while maintaining good connection with out patients. The hardest part of the job is keeping the clients comfortable until their appointment time and the most enjoyable part is when they leave my office feeling better then which they came."

"Finicity",",Finicity was a great place to work. It had a relaxed atmosphere, the pay was good, and everyone at the office were wonderful. Even though it was fast paced, I loved the job. I really made a difference by  helping individuals with their budgets. The hardest part of the job was the constant emotional stress as well as dealing with the people who didn't know how to use their own computers. It was a great first job out of college, but there is no room for advancement. They also laid off about 1/4 of their staff. It is and was a great job, but don't count on always having a position in the down months."

"American Institutes for Research",",American Institutes for Research is a boring place to work at with almost no career advancement opportunities.  With two distinct office locations, miscommunication is a norm."
"American Institutes for Research",",Pay and benefits are good if you can climb the ladder. Climbing the ladder mostly requires you to sacrifice work-life balance and focus heavily on bringing in business and dollars.

"American Institutes for Research",",Recently, AIR laid off over 30 employees within less than 24 hours time without any sort of warning. Several of the people who were laid off had been with the company for over 10 years, yet their career at AIR was over in an instant. Even worse, many project directors and staff managers had no idea what was happening and had to scramble to get the leftover work done when the employees who were laid off suddenly disappeared without being able to turn in their deliverables...The whole thing was a management nightmare, and the employees left behind are now unsettled, demoralized, and live in constant fear that another round of layoffs will occur whereby they'll lose their jobs. In addition, AIR hires people based on a certain area of expertise or skill set that individuals have that they think will be put to use. Though once most people land a job there, they immediately find out that their job security and stability depends on getting a certain percentage of their time covered on numerous projects, many of which may be completely unrelated to their skill set.  "
"American Institutes for Research",",Promotions only occur for individuals based on cronyism and favoritism from upper management, and has little to do with whether a person has been there for a long time or actually does their job well. I honestly am surprised to see so many people on here are stating that AIR provides a pleasant and collaborative working environment--it doesn't!!! Overall, it's a very toxic work environment with a serious lack of diversity among upper management, which is both shameful and ironic given that the so-called mission of the"
"American Institutes for Research",",  "
"American Institutes for Research",", company is to improve the lives of the ""disadvantaged"". On the whole, the only people that get help improving their lives at AIR are well-educated, well-connected individuals from historically advantaged groups who find their ways into cliques with upper management. "
"American Institutes for Research",",The best advice most employees, particularly those from historically underrepresented, marginalized groups, is to stay for a short while while learning all that you can, and do your best for as long as you're able to deal with the constant lack of upward mobility, belittlement, and consistently biased treatment from upper management. And if someone is abusive or treating you poorly once you land a job there, don't even think about going to HR for help. Almost everyone in the company knows that HR is a joke primarily built to protect upper management no matter how egregious their behavior."

"American Institutes for Research",",My supervisor and co-workers were excellent people too work with. Great team players always available to lend a helping hand. Never complained and all our projects wee turned in on time."

"American Institutes for Research",",Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount"
"American Institutes for Research",",I worked as temporary stuff for the assessment department in this non-profit organization. Because of my temporary status, I didn't have my own office as other formal employees. Although my title for the position was research assistant, my daily duty and responsibility didn't seem to have much relationship with research or analysis. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed my job working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. I made a really good friend from this job and had a excellent and intelligent leader."
"American Institutes for Research",",This is a fast paced, collaborative environment with the opportunity to work on many projects across various sectors, primarily government."
"American Institutes for Research",",Fun place to work with. Teammates are helpful. Good work life balance. No politics. Project profile is very interesting and job profile too."
"American Institutes for Research",",A typical day involves working 8:00am-4:30pm, training small groups of scorers on rubrics for scoring assessments. Management provides a relaxed atmosphere and lots of schedule flexibility. The compensation is also adequate. The only downside is that scoring projects aren't always happening, so there will often be weeks, even months at a time where no work is available. This job is best for people looking for supplementary income, or who are between jobs and need temporary income."
"Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center","Management is incompetent. Makes decisions best on favoritism. When discussing concerns management will become defensive. Important infuriation is spread by word of mouth as management lacks common sense to send out memos unless they are pertaining to irrelevant information forwarded from higher ups."
"Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center",",Overall, the hospital and benefits are awesome. There are lots of opportunity for education and advancement. However I found the work environment unfriendly,  management uncaring and uninvested in new staff. The unit I was working on was chaotic, disorganized, and had no true leadership. If there was an emergency situation, all staff would rush to help but, many different people were doing the same simple task, no one clear leader was established, taking twice as long to get things accomplished. This was not a professional environment I wanted to be apart of."
"Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center",",Difficult to get time approved to go to the dentist, and you need to say where you are going why and how long you will be gone. Not sure why they give you so much time off but make it nearly impossible to take it. Very fast paced and never had enough staff. Management seemed to have different sets of rules for certain people."
"Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center",",Run if you are planning on working there' fast paced and the bottom line is it's all about the dollar. Work you to the bone and treated bad unless you are  nursing or a doctor, tech service is horrible and some departments mandate everyday. Most  departments understaffed unless you are looking to be in management. Then you will be tripping over each other.Pay is okay ,but each year the increase in health benefits goes up and your small pay increase is not enough to even cover that."

"Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center",",A typical day is long and hard work. I learned that you must keep to yourself or you will lose your job. Management is very friendly, but does not have a handle on it's employees. Co-workers have a nice demeanor, but will stab you in the back at first chance. The hardest part of the job is keeping to yourself, and a lot of walking. I was not able to find out the most enjoyable part of the job, because I did not get a chance to work there for very long."

"Care Resource",",Care Resource is not a great place to be working for the managers don't care and work well with others in the office. The Dental office is a department that I wouldn't recommend for people to work in the company.  The work day varied from day to day depending on the clients and how there mood is and the manager is feeling for that day and will not make you feel welcomed to be there.  The HR department in the company is so unprofessional and needs a complete restructuring in the company.  The management could be a lot better than what is there right now or be retrained about how to manage the employees and make them feel valuable.  My co-workers who I worked with in Case Management and other departments I enjoyed working with for the time that I was there.  I learned many things over the years from the people who came through the agency and as a volunteer."

"Care Resource",",a typical day at work was very miserable, I wasn't able to learn anything due to the fact that I was always helping others catching up with their caseloads.

Work location (convenient commute) and opportunities for career advancement and continuing education are of primary importance to me.

"Mitchell/Martin Inc.","Mitchell/Martin was a great contract company to work for!!  I had difficulty securing employment when I was moving to NYC.  MMI was recommended by an Occupational Therapist who had positive experiences with them.  MMI placed me at a great hospital in the Bronx with a full time position that started as soon as I moved.  In addition, my contact at MMI was always quick to respond to questions and I always got paid on time!!"
"Mitchell/Martin Inc.",",they are good reliable company very professional, give your chance to grow. I am able to communicate with staff and very good customer service  and very helpful"
"Mitchell/Martin Inc.",",Overall, it is usually, fun, challenging, pleasant and busy.  The management was very informational, the staff was a pleasure to work with and the company always provided employment with companies that I was able to learn from yet provided what was needed to the team."
"Mitchell/Martin Inc.",",They offered good compensation for contract work and good benefits, but were of little assistance with finding a position when this contract was finished."
"Mitchell/Martin Inc.",",I worked for them just over a month and from day one of my assignment everything was a mess! My original start date got delayed 2 days because of my cubicle and computer not being ready, and when I do finally start it still wasn't ready because of a ""mix-up"". I also had to meet with security to get an additional background check and drug test completed for the client I was working for and they didn't even have any idea that I was coming! Training was horrible and inconsistent and didn't even have any work to do for weeks when I started! Then finally I was let go with a few other people with no reason given at all! The only thing that was good was the hourly rate. I would never work for this company or their client again!"

"Mitchell/Martin Inc.",",their pay rate is average."
"Mitchell/Martin Inc.",",Unprofessional people. I was told about the placement and resigned from my job. I have submitted all the requirements and forms needed, even the physical exam that I have to shoulder. Suddenly, they became so quiet and didn't bother to follow up on what's going on. Until such time that I didn't hear from them completely."

"Mitchell/Martin Inc.",",By working with MItchell Martin I learned that patience is in fact a virtue when dealing / working with others. Management in my opinion from a scale of 1-10(10 being the highest) will be a 7, As far as my co-workers I would have to give them a 5. I honestly can not pin point a ""hard part"" of the job I would say that every part of the job was just a learning experience. The most enjoyable part of the job for me would have to be actually working with the patients hands on I really enjoyed that part.

"ZOLL","it was ok for the most part. The manager and supervisors really should teach the line leads a thing about professionalism. Line leads are very disrespectful towards co-workers."
"ZOLL",",Fast Pace..Enjoyed working with all. Great environment, bosses are good and very willing to assist in all matters. Great friends made here. still in touch"
"ZOLL",",Lead was so bad, she would finish your sentence for you. Her way or the High Way. All  co-worker said they had it worse with her. How can thus be. She's so BAD."
"ZOLL",",Good company to be employed by the management is flexiable to the employees need. Helpful coworkers and a easy atmosphere makes the day seem short."
"ZOLL",",ZOLL was a great place to work, relaxed atmosphere and relaxed dress code. Co-workers were great to work with and teamswork is very encouraged."
"ZOLL",",I worked midnight.  Zoll was a clean friendly environment. Zoll treated its employees fairly.  I would recommend Zoll to anyone."
"ZOLL",",In tech support, many people call in and complain about various issues. There is no continuity regarding policies and procedures. Things can change with no notification. The job is not for people who like to think. It is droning and mundane but the employees made the job work. Awful shifts and very limited potential to actually change your shift."
"ZOLL",",Start the day with what was not finished the day before if any, if so follow up with patient or Insurance company or Co-worker doing a different job. Once that is done, follow up on appeals, work 0-75 day old accounts to get balances paid by either the patient or the insurance company. In between answering phones call take about 100 calls a day"
"ZOLL",",The department I was in lacked leadership, and fair treatment to workers"
"ZOLL",",As a PSR, we have the opportunity to work closely with patients and families in a learning environment. This job is both rewarding and often fun."
"ZOLL",",This is a company that is patient focused and has a caring staff in all aspects.  The research department is top notch."
"ZOLL",",There are only a few careers that allow you to save a Life if some one believes in your passion and your message. Most have MD. after their names. This is a sales position that the end user is a patient but your call point is a physician or mid level."
"ZOLL",",wow....it gets you out of bed in the morning....350,000 people a year die because a product like this is unavailable."
"ZOLL",",I learned to become a buyer. My immediate supervisor was very patient and understanding."

"ZOLL",",Work was good and busy all the time pay and benefits weren't great"
"ZOLL",",A typical day at work was spent on the telephone with patients and other medical personnel explaining how to use wearable defibrillator devices."

"S&P Global Market Intelligence","The staff is young and has a lot of turn around. Pay can seem to low unless you recieve promotions quickly. High expectations are expected with a small staff"
"S&P Global Market Intelligence",",Too much work for reimbursement.Too many layers on management, but still all responsibility is on developers. bonuses going down, workload going up for developers."
"S&P Global Market Intelligence",",This company is an extremely challenging place to work if you are an administrative professional. You are required to jump through hoops just to accomplish simple goals. The majority of the tasks that you are pressured to accomplish should be handled by HR, not an admin. Another downside is employees here seem generally unhappy. There is a sense of gloom and trepidation that is palpable. I would say the work/life balance was decent, but I couldn't personally benefit from this because of the intense workload associated with my department. It really depends on the manager you have. My manager was afraid to rock the boat and go against the status quo, so this caused a lot of undue stress on the employees beneath her. Many of the admins currently there are mature and have been with the company since they were out of high school or in their early 20s. I think they have stayed this long because they honestly don't know how great it can be outside of this company. They are rooted where they are and have become complacent. That is unfortunate."
"S&P Global Market Intelligence",",A good work life balance, insightful leadership with strong vision, friendly hard working people, competitive culture and overall a good place to start your career."
"S&P Global Market Intelligence",",The company lost its brand recognition after numerous acquisitions. There are a lot of changes at senior levels which may be a cause for concern."

"Ecolab","With a multitude of customers and responsibilities, every day is different. There is always an opportunity to learn and grow as a manager, person, and professional. I have learned a lot from both my management team and my coworkers and have fostered an environment of teamwork that I had not experienced in the past."
"Ecolab",",The most challenging aspect of the job is balancing the Sales, Service, and logistical responsibilities of the position. It is extremely rewarding helping and having an intregal part in the success of so many restaurants and food service establishments."
"Ecolab",",The management was amazing and listened to its' employees. You had the opportunity to move up all the time. Compensation was good, and has gotten better since I left, and you got paid overtime if you worked it. It was easy to get along with coworkers; everyone was friendly and helpful. The actual job could sometimes be frustrating, but what call center job isn't?"
"Ecolab",",Good company to work for however work was slow and not enough to compesate for a full pay check. There were plenlty of learning experiences to enhance my skills."
"Ecolab",",I have found that this place of work was very easy to work for and it was all about safety and making sure that everyone was alright when they worked. Everyone got along with each other. The management was really nice when you had a problem they worked with you to fix it."
"Ecolab",",Great wage and benefits however work life balance needs improvement. A typical workday is filled with challenges you have to be mentally prepared to handle. I enjoy working with good people."
"Ecolab",",Days can be long but you can depend on fellow employees for support . The have great benefits and bonus structure .Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help and support your team on achieving goals and targets."
"Ecolab",",I learned a lot from Ecolab from top to bottom, sales to customer service. They have a deep and extensive training program the covers all bases. I built a lot of long lasting relationships with customers and within Ecolab."
"Ecolab",",I was contracting there. So I wasn't there long enough to make a determination. Beautiful campus, with walking paths, full service cafeteria, and company store to buy products at discounted prices."
"Ecolab",",Company has changed alot in the last 10 years.  Work/life balance is difficult.  Increasing your income very difficult.   Hardest part of the job is balancing service with sales.  Territories cover large areas so alot of time is spent driving.  The best part was a company car.  Used to be a great culture.  Not so much anymore."
"Ecolab",",Don't waste your time. Management is HORRIBLE. every supervisor thinks they own you so as soon as you mess up once, especially if you're a temp, you're gone! Everybody in the building wants you fired and will snitch on you for anything. it's a he said/she said company, for example if somebody doesn't like you and just randomly say that you said that you didn't like the job or something along the lines to a supervisor then you're gone. All they care about is how much money they make and could care less about their employees. I could write soooo much more. there is a ridiculous amount of drama in the building and everyone trash talks each other behind their backs their including the supervisors. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME"
"Ecolab",",When I first started this company was amazing!! The culture was fantastic and everyone seemed to love the job. Fast forward a year later and things changed. There were still amazing days but the bad outweighed the good. "
"Ecolab",",Depending on the market you get, the DMs can be wonderful and the techs even better. It is VERY REWARDING, you talk to very popular companies and build relationships with them. They say you are a ""super hero"" which is kind of true. You help mom and pop companies get their kitchen equipment up so they don't lose anymore revenue. "
"Ecolab",",THE MANAGERS ARE FANTASTIC!! It was very hard to leave because of my direct manager. They are so supportive, and this includes the director. They care so much it is very refreshing + their attitudes make the job mostly okay."
"Ecolab",",A few bad things to list, you have to meet certain SLA times or your market gets red barred, which means you just have a bad rating for that certain account. The CAMS are extremely hard to deal with, shoot first ask questions later type of thing. "
"Ecolab",",I will say, if you are already a good dispatcher and have good organization skills this job would be great for you. Just be aware, it is a lot of HARD WORK. A lot."
"Ecolab",",There is a great R&D facilitate that really helps with the new product development. "
"Ecolab",",There are some highly intelligent people that work here."
"Ecolab",",Its a large company so many opportunities to find different types of jobs."
"Ecolab",",I was fast paced. it was an in bound call center in fishers, in. I sat at my desk for 7 hours a day. I was ok to work at. I had to drive 30 min to get there. They worked with Commercial kitchens."
"Ecolab",",I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Ecolab.  I learned so much about the restaurant kitchen equipment repair industry.  I was able to do billing and customer service."
"Ecolab",",My day starts at 4 am because I have to drive to my territory."
"Ecolab",",I get to my first customer at 730 am most of the time. I do not get home till around 5am to 6pm."
"Ecolab",",They have spread out our territories to far I live in Gwinnett County I no longer have any customer in Gwinnett County my customers in Gwinnett County are not happy with what corporate is doing."
"Ecolab",",Management Does not care what we think about our new territories."
"Ecolab",",Most of my co-workers are looking for other more advanced opportunities."
"Ecolab",",The hardest part of my job is getting to my territory."
"Ecolab",",We make our own schedule."
"Ecolab",",That's what Ecolab talks about is that our opinions and our voice matters but it doesn't matter what our opinion is."
"Ecolab",",This is a fast paced sales and service company with a focus on Sales.  A typical day is visiting customers, servicing company machines and up-selling products."
"Ecolab",",Ecolab is very product line oriented.  While the field, in some areas, work together across product lines, internally there seems to be some disconnects. "
"Ecolab",",Management, at some levels seem frozen in making decisions or going after opportunities."
"Ecolab",",I clock in when I get into my service vehicle. I drive to my first account which is usually a quick service account. I inspect the building and check all exterior and interior traps. then I go back through in the interior and spray a residual, dust, and bait. I usually have about 6 average accounts a night but you can work ahead. I learned a lot about how to inspect different restaurant buildings and learned how to get rid of unwanted pests. My co-workers are very laid back and will offer to help you. hardest part is we don't get paid what we used to anymore to put up with customers and upper management we put up with. the most enjoyable part is having a service vehicle to go from place to place and having a fuel card."
"Ecolab",",mainly worked by myself. company focuses on numbers and not on people. keeping employees has been an issue the entire time i worked for them. was hard to get any help from management when needed."
"Ecolab",",Ecolab offered relevant and engaging hands on training, they are also a safety conscious company, placing your safety above anything else. The pay and benefits are very good."
"Ecolab",",i like the work environment its very friendly and the fact its different cultures amongst each other with great personalities"
"Berico Technologies","The company has good management and they work at a fast pace to interview and hire personnel, the company has a good health care plan for a good price but it is a high deductible plan, to make up for this the company offers its employees a master card with 6k every year to cover expenses. A bad thing about the the comapny is that it has sunpeded it's 401k program, but other than that this company is great."
"Berico Technologies",",Berico is a company which is very good at marketing to their employees, but is marginally competitive."
"Berico Technologies",",Leadership is engaged but holding an empty hand."
"Berico Technologies",",This company has great potential, but will only be truly succesful if they align employee interests with ownership interests. Otherwise, steer clear."
"Berico Technologies",",Additionally, company will likely be sold if they win a few big contracts."
"Berico Technologies",",If this company were employee owned, I would give them five stars and actively encourage bright people to work there."
"Berico Technologies",",Enjoyed my time with the company. Medical benefits are the best i have had. training was non existant."
"Berico Technologies",",Berico is a defense contracting company which is always growing. They take of their people with a great benefits package and very good management. On my project I work with a group of people who really gel together well and our boss is very involved (not in a micro-management manner, but in a servant-leadership manner). Although the company is spread out among many projects, the corporate office attempts to keep us all together as one company. I enjoy working for Berico, and I know it will continue to do well."
"Berico Technologies",",Company was fast-growing and innovative to provide solutions to the warfighter."
"Blackbaud","Lots of potential to grow with the organization.  Management does a good job of running the business and help promote from within."
"Blackbaud",",Exciting environment at first but wears off fast.  Management is very hit or miss and the culture is a little too one sided."
"Blackbaud",",People are wonderful to work with.  Charleston is a great place to work.  It is always nice to be involved with helping companies help people.  Clients are world wide"
"Blackbaud",",Blackbaud is a company that is dedicated to helping non-profits achieve their mission by providing solutions that will keep track of how funds are raised and the relationship the non-profits have with their constituents."
"Blackbaud",",The company is based out of Charleston, SC, and has grown from a small company, to a large one which has become the leading provider of CRM Software for the non-profit sector."
"Blackbaud",",Though it is a public company, it has done a good job of maintaining its (or restablishing in some cases) its culture of fun, customer-focus, and employee appreciation."
"Blackbaud",",The culture and the people that work there are all very passionate, caring and fun people to be around.  The people around you are invested in helping you become better at your role."
"Blackbaud",",The hours required to support multiple data-centers worldwide was a challenge that met but not rewarded. The opportunity for career growth and promotion was not possible."
"Blackbaud",",Everyday was different. Something fun happened everyday, as well. Great team oriented atmosphere. Corporate feel but also one big family."
"Blackbaud",",As a Luminate Online project manager, I was dismayed that we sold customers services we could not actually provide.  Management seemed to be ok with collecting for 140 hours a month, then only delivering 120.  On the flipside, when demanding customers forced project teams to bring 160 for only 140 reserved, project managers who pushed back on customer, got zero support from upper level management"
"Blackbaud",",Blackbaud is an example of everything that is wrong in the tech industry, where ""services"" try to become a profit center and project managers are sacrificed by upper management, unwilling to stand behind them OR make decisions to change policies."
"Blackbaud",",Blackbaud is such a great company for which to work.  I've never felt so fulfilled by the work I was/am doing or so motivated to go to work.  I look forward to connecting with both my co-workers and clients each day."
"Blackbaud",",I generally like working at Blackbaud.  The people in other departments seem to like it a lot more than I do though.  "
"Blackbaud",",I'm in Operations, and we're definitely expected to never stop working.  Things like work-life balance, and quality of life improvements are mentioned, but don't seem to be priorities.  The only thing we seem to accomplish is to stamp out a fire long enough to get it down to coals; then its off to the next, larger fire."
"Blackbaud",",That said, I really like the people I work with.  It will be a shame when I leave to not work with them anymore."
"Blackbaud",",Great place to work, but management / project management is all over the place. If you find the right job path, you can move up in the company."
"Blackbaud",",Fun place to work with a great culture team always focusing on the employees. Great location in the middle on the domain, lots of fun things to do just a few steps out the door."
"Blackbaud",",Blackbaud is a good company and I would recommend to others.  Fasted paced and good energy. Focus is on growth and outside sales is the place to be."

"Blackbaud",",My team assists internal analysts with client issues. We build and maintain virtual testing machines that analysts will use to troubleshoot critical issues with company software. We will server as a tier 2 point of contact for case resolution. We primarily work everyday with Windows administrators to make sure our database software is working properly. We troubleshoot SQL related issues that clients may have on a daily basis."
"Blackbaud",",Fun place too work and lots of great people but the products are old, unstable, and use very old technology. Company has spent a lot of money to acquire other companies but does very little to integrate them. Compensation is based on the job market in Charleston, which is typically lower than most other tech cities."
"Blackbaud",",Typical day"
"Blackbaud",",Monitor 40 saas database servers everyday"

"Chubb","Very sociable workplace. great work/life balance. very slight window of advancement after company was purchased. learned about state regulations regarding account upkeep."
"Chubb",",Typical day at work was hectic to say the least. The hardest part about the job was not being familiar with the line of business; but I was lucky to work with a great team that helped me learn the ropes very quickly.  Thanks to such group of professionals, I'm a better version of me today!"
"Chubb",",Chubb was a company that focused greatly on investing in its people. This included investing in training and developing talent, rather than hiring talent."
"Chubb",",Unorthodox.  Innapropriate.  Mismanaged.  Just an all around horrible place to work.  The worst job (Underwriting Associate) I have ever had in my life."
"Chubb",",Chubb is one of the largest insurers in the United States. Chubb offers commercial, specialty and personal insurance services."
"Chubb",",Overall I think Chubb is a great company. Some members of management not so much. But the company has great benefits and some great co-workers. But do not make friends."
"Chubb",",In the interview process I was advised that it would be only 4-5 claims per day and eventually bodily injury claims would be assigned later down the road with appropriate training. I had two informal weeks of training and was thrown out on the floor. One week after being assigned claims I was given bodily injury and premise claims with NO TRAINING AT ALL! About three weeks in we began to get 7-10 claims a day!! We were basically sold something in the interview to get us in the door and now we're stuck until we find something else."
"Chubb",",Strong company focused on underwriting discipline and internal advancement of employees. Nurturing culture for growth."
"Chubb",",Great benefits, very diverse culture. Co-workers were great to work with. Gained a lot of knowledge and experience in the insurance industry.  Department was flexible with work/life balance."
"Chubb",",Company medicare people stay to themselves for most part company doesn't offer and glitz and glamour come to work and produce they don't care about anything else. Managers aren't really friendly which makes the employee standoff is . Keep track of your work and attendance will fire you with no notice or warning"
"Chubb",",I was the international liaison between USA underwriters and our foreign offices when a customer needed an insurance policy anywhere outside of the USA.  I negotiated with our foreign offices for the customer, from start to finish, when the policy was issued. I was very self-sufficient, a great problem solver and had an excellent rapport with my superiors.  I worked with awesome colleagues around the world.  I was entrusted to work from home the last several years of my employment, and, my productivity was even greater, not having the interruptions and noise of the office.  I won awards for ""Best Service in the World"" twice after I began working from home.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with my colleagues and customers."
"Chubb",",Good Work environment, good compensation.  Management is very technical and knowledgable.   Many ongoing changes for the good.  Challenging environment but very satisfying"
"Chubb",",Chubb had a progressive culture that supported high morale with low turnover.  The challenge will be integrating ACE in such a way as to continue this trend.  Hopefully the transitioned company will emerge on the other side stronger and not weaker."
"Chubb",",I am grateful to Chubb for the incredible opportunities they afforded me during my tenure. It is a highly professional and high stressed environment. However, to whom much is given much is expected and that certainly is the case at Chubb. Again, I am grateful for the time I spent there."

"Chubb",",When one enjoys what ago and likes the more difficult it becomes in the more easy to respond to any problems that may occur. Every day that I wake up is to submit many viscicitudes work but when one arrives with a mood of work everything will be only a setback."
"Chubb",",Everything I do in my job I enjoy it because what I learned by vocation not by obligation and I like what I do."
"Chubb",",I worked at this company for almost 2 years.  I came in with experience in the Workers compensation industry, so I was very familiar with jurisdictional and typical claims practices. I was hired to cover NC, VA and SC. Once I got there, I was given a totally different jurisdiction. This is not an issue, as I am up for learning new states, but I was given takeover claims from another TPA in the amount of 200 files! With no formal training of the systems and with no time to get familiar with the new jurisdiction!  It all went downhill from there. Management is very unprofessional. You have to be in the 'cool kid's' circle to get anywhere. I ultimately was given option to leave with severance and I took it.  This the most unprofessional place (and ethically questionable) I have ever encountered. Stay away if you value your career in WC."
"Chubb",",Wells Fargo is a really great place to work. You get to help so many people with their finances, Learned a lot about customer service and many banking services."
"Chubb",",Chubb is now ACE and with that comes a change in culture to the ACE environment. In acquiring Chubb, ACE not only sought to expand it's operations into the agency market and high end personal lines, but they also bought the Chubb name. ACE had developed a poor reputation among experienced insurance professionals due to the culture that derives from the highest level of leadership through claims management in PA and NJ. ACE claims management is beset with technically incompetent mangers concerned more with their own political positioning with Sr. Management than results and integrity when dealing with their subordinates. This is primarily at the AVP level and above. There are many recent positive reviews of the company which coinciding with ACE's desire to change their brand name may warrant some degree of skepticism regarding the their authenticity. "
"Chubb",",ACE has made a concerted effort to recruit new entrants into the workforce who are unaware of their culture. "
"Chubb",",Claims managers are much more concerned with appearance and things that do not add value to the process. For example, be prepared to have a claims manager focus more on grammatical errors in reserve/authority request than the accuracy of an interpretation of a jurisdictional issue and analysis of exposure in general."
"Chubb",",ACE provides decent compensation and a good benefit package due to the scope of their operations but the cultural issues are still the albatross for this organization."
"Chubb",",I worked for Chubb for 6 years, and it was a great experience, as I've worked with many different people there doing a lot of different functions. The experience and learning opportunity was well appreciated, as I love learning and doing different things."
"Chubb",",Multi billion dollar world wide company with great financial strength. The company has had large acquisitions in recent years and will take over the insurance market in the coming years. Great people to work with and a great number of long term employees."
"Chubb",",Learned a lot about a variety of people. I acquired a lot of business education and worked with a great bunch of people. I started int mail room and worked my way up to an agent booking about 3 million dollars."

"SOSi",",I enjoy working at SOSi very much; the team members are hard workers and fun to work with.  I am fascinated by the diversity of the members and the mission that we all shared."
"SOSi",",I like the challenge of sourcing and finding the uncommon language candidates and love explaining the job to them."
"SOSi",",The hardest part of the job is to find viable candidates in some hard to find uncommon indigenous Latin American candidates."
"SOSi",",SOSI takes care of their people very well. Honored to have had the opportunity to work for them!  Detailed in program management operations, transportation, training and human resource management."
"SOSi",",Flexible hours, good time management. Helpful peers; new and senior employees can always find assistance in work environment whatever the time might be, even after midnight."
"SOSi",",The only bad thing about this job was the contract basis, but other than that it was a fast pace and there was something different everyday."
"SOSi",",Avoid if you can continue to interview while your there. attrition is constant and never ending. No process or guidelines that resemble a professional company or effective process. Most new folks are still interviewing once they start."
"SOSi",",The poor rating in this review is specifically tied to a project I was a part of overseas, not SOSI corporate or SOSI in CONUS locations.  Without going into details, there was not much management support to the few contractors deployed forward, and the job itselt had no upward mobility or stablity.  Compensation was great but tied to danger pay due to location, rather than job performance or duties."
"SOSi",",I have been working for SOS International LLC for years and the company has provided me with an incredible amount of opportunity to work in a client driven environment focused on developing its staff to be the best they possibly can. Commitment to the mission and dedication to the work is the expectation from employees. An ideal place to develop your skills."
"SOSi",",I would go back there today if there were still around.  You have to be selected and qualify to do the job."
"SOSi",",My immediate supervisor were very nice and very understanding, you can make up your own hours according to the working hours."
"SOSi",",I can not recommend this company.  While there are some wonderfully talented individuals who have worked at this company the senior leadership chruns through managers in every department and the turnover is very high with each manager lasting an average of 1 year.  This is due to the ineffective top leadership.  There is no trust established among the senior and departmental leadership and at the time of my employment the company had failed to establish an effective ethics program or transparency in their financials which is key to doing work in the government contracting space."
"SOSi",",As a former manager in this company, reviews were conducted for every overhead employee but no direct individuals.  Once rated and reviewed the reviews went before a board of top management where the CEO often directed changes in the ratings (lowering them) for individuals under my supervision whom he had no day to day contact with.  Both merit increases and promotions were predicated on these reviews and I found the process discriminating and ineffective as it became an evaluation of how well the senior management team (specifically the CEO) liked the individual or not and not a fair assessment of performance.  I feel like this is the number one reason employees can not advance in this company or receive proper mentorship and development. "
"SOSi",",Before considering a position with this company it is advisable to talk to past as well as present employees before accepting a position and research their reputation in the industry by talking to teaming partners, former customers, etc. before making your decision."
"SOSi",",SOSI International is the Best Company.I had a great work Experience.I did learned a lots from the Job I was assigned to ."
"SOSi",",Fast-paced, high-energy proposal team. Opportunity to experience a variety of projects. Great support from other business units."
"SOSi",",A great display of teamwork, yet a fun environment to be in. "
"SOSi",",Learn daily all aspects of surgery and what it entails."
"SOSi",",no room for advancement, liked my co-workers a lot, not treated with respect at all, I learned a lot about sterile processing from this company."
"SOSi",",Mid-size company with ambitious and lofty goals - but the culture and feel of a smaller company.  Its an exciting, fun place to work."
"SOSi",",I enjoyed the employment, pay and benefits. Just unfortunate that the job ended for me."
"SOSi",",Great place good benefits... calm corporate culture."
"SOSi",",A little greedy when it came to pay cuts.. worst compensation but kept benefits at a good compensation. "
"SOSi",",Overall best experience!"
"SOSi",",A typical day at work consists of performing daily tasks in a timely, accurate, & quality manner. I have learned to maintain attention to detail in this job at all times in which case an error is not an option. My co-workers have great personalities, are friendly, and are a great people to work alongside. However, there were several that lacked integrity, and some of us found ourselves picking up extra workload of others.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with its instability, and not being able to grow or promote. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of knowing that I am performing my best for a greater cause."
"SOSi",",Great work environment.  Very individualized (contract).  Great mid-level management.  Unfortunately I just do contract work.  Would work full time if the opportunity presented."
"SOSi",",These days its hard to really find close knit work places but this is sure one."
"SOSi",",Overall a good company.  They are very diverse and capable.  As with any other company, expectations are high as with productivity.  I enjoyed working there."
"Millennium Health","This used to be a great company to work for but after several poor decisions the entire upper management is gone and the new management doesn't appear to care about employee satisfaction - only shareholders are important now. There have been layoffs and many have also left due to these unwelcome changes."
"Millennium Health",",They are very nice people. They work hard to keep you employed. They HR lady that called to let me know that she was having to let me go was very nice about it and let me know it wasn't because of me it was just that the volume of patients was not enough to keep me on with the company."
"Millennium Health",",Laboratory Services Assistant is required to be a stand alone position within the clinic atmosphere.  Was responsible for my own daily work flow.  Daily interaction with the staff and patients.  Responsible for dropping reports into clinic system thru EMR.  The staff was very helpful.  Enjoyed working with this group of providers immensly."
"Millennium Health",",If you're looking to start a career in biotechnology  this is a great start. The benefits are great. PTO accruals are extreme good. There is plenty of room for advancement."
"Millennium Health",",I learned A LOT through working for Millennium mostly on insurance and pharmaceutical terminology. Collection of specimens and processing, labeling specimens."
"Millennium Health",",I enjoyed most of my time working for this company except for the last few months of my employment. I did not receive my raise as promised. I was informed I would be laid off a week before the lay off which gave me no time to prepare. I was the senior lab assistant in the area but when I asked to move to another practice because of conflicts with the practice I was contracted to, I was told no. In result more conflicts happened and my supervisor did nothing to help."
"Millennium Health",",Productive workplace with helpful Human Resources.  Territory managers are very friendly & willing to help in any way needed.  I enjoy the Job very much, the Patients are pleasant."
"Millennium Health",",The management is awesome to work for! They take great care of you while employeed. If you ever had a problem, they took care of it the best way possible. Very understanding to all employees."
"Millennium Health",",casual setting was able to do overtime managers were great they offer a very nice lunch room and the co workers are helpful"
"Millennium Health",",Job is pretty simple but can be fast paced environment. And sometimes slow to. Depends on the day. Long lunch 1hr depends on the office some offices are 30mins. Benefits are good. Its just complicated to take time off you pretty much have to give a 3 week notice for vacation time"
"Millennium Health",",Millennium Health has been a great place to begin and learn from some of the Biotech industries best forward thinking professionals in a fast paced environment."
"Millennium Health",",I see myself being busy everyday and always engaging myself into some type of project."
"Millennium Health",",Constantly finishing up tasks to meet a certain deadline."
"Millennium Health",",Learning something new each day is something we strive for."
"Millennium Health",",I loved working at millennium. I like the busy environment and the fact that there was always something to do. I like working in a lab. especially since it was a healthcare lab."
"Millennium Health",",Healthy work environment, opportunity for professional growth, team spirit highly encouraged."
"Millennium Health",",I was able to learn medical software and database applications."
"Millennium Health",",Great management, great coworkers."
"Millennium Health",",Some deadlines were challenging yet I enjoyed the challenges and stood up for success."
"Millennium Health",",It did not work. I found out that my contract was over through a third party and still today I have no idea what happened. The company has made some changes since then in supervisory position. I hope it is for the better."
"Millennium Health",",They give plenty of paid lunch hours and employee appreciation days in the office. They are very accepting of casual dress attire, free coffee, and nice computers. They have an ergonomics person who can set you up with the right kind of chair and support items that ease discomfort. They have plants and lots of personalities around the office. "
"Millennium Health",",They do offer very good insurance coverage as well as PTO - but in return for all of the treats that they give the employees they expect top quality work and production numbers. The QA team and Auditing system is very forgiving. I would stay for 10 years if I didn't have to move."
"Millennium Health",",I was hired as a temp-to-hire in July and was not hired. I worked very hard and harder than the full time employee they hired in my immediate department. Supervisors rely on scare tactics and use favoritism as means as promotions. Director Clinical support is unqualified for her job title and does not have the ability to lead, she makes orders, snaps at employees, and talks in circles. Very shady place that takes advantages of temps and hard working employees. Lack diversity, they claim to promote within but bring people from the outside treating them better than their own. Dress code needs to be implemented, very odd that other employees dress up and others dress down. i.e, leggings and t-shirt."
"Millennium Health",",Co-workers are very interesting, their is a different vibe and ""culture"" in each department and you can tell who is important and not by their demeanor."
"Millennium Health",",TOP people like to hold redundant meetings to talk in circles and address ""rumors"" and update whats going on in the company. Company makes sporadic and irrational company decisions often and change back-forth with ideas."
"Millennium Health",",Poor upper management. Scary to think that a company that deals with such sensitive material (I.E. Pgt specimens, treatment center drug screens, etc.) Is so careless and has a lack of sop's. If you want to advance up the company food chain, you better be related to someone. Management does not listen to employee recommendations or suggestions. Long hours with poor compensation. Only positive about this place are all the hard working nice people who try to remain positive."
"Millennium Health",",My supervisors are the best! Very flexible, an organization that not only cares about the employees but patients as well."
"Millennium Health",",I worked 3 12 hour shifts. I was responsible to obtain blood sugars before all meals and treat as ordered. Administer daily and morning medications within a specified time period. I was also required to assess wounds and treat as ordered. "
"Millennium Health",",I was responsible for overseeing and discipline  as needed CNA's. That could be a difficult part related to the CNA's not fully understanding the impact on my nursing license if anything happened to the residents."
"Millennium Health",",My co-workers were usually LPN's, however some had more experience in the long term care setting. Of which I would  understand how to make my job more effective."
"Millennium Health",",I really enjoyed getting to know my residents on a personal level and be able to notice small changes to address them early before the resident's care became comprised."
"Millennium Health",",This was an amazing company to work for but ultimately I had to resign because what I thought I had been hired for and what I was actually doing were two separate things. The company was smaller at the time i started but quickly grew and they really knew how to take care of their employees and make them feel appreciated."
"SunTrust","I have been a branch manager for over 17 years, I really enjoyed it at first. Love developing a team, a business, and work outside developing business. Its difficult delivering bad news to a teammate or a client."
"SunTrust",",Many years I dedicated my time to SunTrust Bank and its customers. The time I spent there was very rewarding and educational as it was my first experience with banking, The training program taught me a lot."
"SunTrust",",SunTrust is well position Regional Bank with a South Eastern footprint stretching from Maryland to Florida to Tennessee."
"SunTrust",",Teammates are a pleasure to with and eager to help ensure that the job done right!"
"SunTrust",",client service and business development"
"SunTrust",",over the years I learned valuable skills that would be useful in any office/sales environment."
"SunTrust",",good and bad management."
"SunTrust",",competitive but team building."
"SunTrust",",not taking it home at the end of the day."
"SunTrust",",working with many interest clients"
"SunTrust",",Great Bank and a Company. very skilled employee minus the distractions."
"SunTrust",",everyone does what they are supposed too except the staffing agency's culture is little weird."
"SunTrust",",working at SunTrust should be about SunTrust and not of their staffing representatives."
"SunTrust",",Lack of concern for employees trickled down from management.  The main objective of the company was to hit sales goals.  Often, ethics were overlooked to achieve the numbers at the end of the day."
"SunTrust",",I love to work here. the people are great and the bosses are understanding but most of all SunTrust cares about others. When it comes to those parents that don't have any body that they can leave there children there it make's it hard for me because I don't have anybody else that can stay with my kids after 4pm."
"SunTrust",",One of the best companies I have worked for, very kind with their employees taught me alot on believing in me. I learned how to handle money and have more confidence with customer service."
"SunTrust",",worse part is the never ending pressure, during my training class we were rushed onto the phones not enough training or guidance. it is a good work environment and great place to work they just need to work out some kinks"
"SunTrust",",Good experience at times needs to improve with office culture. Management needs to be trained better. Respect should be shown to all walks of life not just to those who look the same."
"SunTrust",",Great place, good culture on a company level, good opportunity, good footprint throughout the country.  The benefits are good but expensive.  Compensation is adequate."
"SunTrust",",A typical day at work was keying in the data needed. I learned the inner workings of banks mailing system. The management was stern. The workplace culture was diverse as there were many different persons employed. The hardest part of the job was not making mistakes on your work. The most enjoyable was management treating you to lunch."
"SunTrust",",Great culture. Unsure as to what career advancements they offer for internal associates. Cafeteria needs some work and the company could benefit from a more diverse network."
"SunTrust",",This is a very corporate environment.  Change happens frequently with little insight or guidance to employees.  There is little flexibility and long hours required. It can be a good work environment for work stability but it can also be a very demanding job."
"SunTrust",",Executive level management/area manager have unreasonable expectations and apply pressure on a daily basis for sales production through constant conference calls or ""call nights.""  Because the environment is so sales driven, a constant cheater mentality is rampant with the retail banking side on all levels...teller, personal banker and branch manager.  The work/life balance is not obtainable and we're basically told that in order to produce and hit goal, it will take more than 40 hours of work to achieve this; the avg work week for a branch manager is 50 hours.  SunTrust has compromised ""the providing excellent service to the client"" to a sales driven, tremendous pressure, micro managing environment.  It was not a fun atmosphere to work under."
"SunTrust",",I enjoyed my position with SunTrust and would be willing to go back if the position was not downsized due to the economy. I enjoyed my position."
"SunTrust",",Time is of the essence. Time makes you start to dislike the way that things are going. I loved SunTrust in the begging and have my concerns about it now."
"SunTrust",",Understaffed and highly stressed environment.  Management will not support their staff and tell you what a good job you are doing but when push comes to shove, they will not back up or support their employees."
"SunTrust",",i love working at suntrust, it is a perfect job while i am in college.  they work around my schedule and the people are just amazing, hard working people."
"SunTrust",",They need to pay their current staff accordingly, so they don't have to leave to go to another competitor.  There are days when your left alone, so you must be a strong and versatile professional."
"SunTrust",",It has been a very long time since I worked for this company and I would not be fair to evaluate my wok experience against the company culture so long ago."
"Alion Science and Technology","I enjoyed my time here as an intern. The people I got to work with were great, but there seemed to be some problems with the management staff that led to the company not thriving as it should."
"Alion Science and Technology",",My experience with Alion was overwhelmingly positive. Each interaction with management was pleasant and made me feel like a valued member of the team."
"Alion Science and Technology",",When working for Alion, I was hoping to find a company that would adequately teach me the basics of Software Engineering. However, when I started, I placed in room largely by myself and forced to learn on the job. Because of this, I had great difficultly doing what I was asked to do. I do not recommend this position for someone just starting out."
"Alion Science and Technology",",A typical day at work is performing budgets, financial report and management reports."
"Alion Science and Technology",",I learned to work better with employee on financial work. I work effectively with  my co-worker and management. The hardest part of the job was analyzing employees issues to other employees, and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting management satisfaction."
"Alion Science and Technology",",A decent company.  Needs to improve on training options for all employees.  As a new employee, you're kind of thrown into the fire and having to figure out everything as you go.  No one is there to guide you or set you up with the proper training to be able to do your job. Great people to be around, just need better training options."
"Alion Science and Technology",",They will challenge you to provide real work for the company, and as a result, you will gain loads of experience to talk about in any job interview you encounter. It doesn't pay as much as others, but it certainly forces you to learn and contribute meaningful work that you will be proud of."
"Alion Science and Technology",",Working for Alion was a great experience. The only reason I left was the commute was a bit much for me at the time. Great staff. Family oriented..."
"Alion Science and Technology",",Job was excellent.Worked for 18 years. Transmitting and receiving messages for government. Updating equipment through the years, and applying security practice."
"Alion Science and Technology",",The company is now owned by a financial firm solely focused on revenue and low bids to win contracts.  Often salaries and benefits of current employees are reduced in order to stay employed on a new contract award."
"Alion Science and Technology",",Management sometimes makes it feel more like a staffing agency.  High turnover has been constant, management is more concerned with filling a billet for a low rate than anything else."
"Alion Science and Technology",",Employees treated like cattle.  All profits go into the pockets of the highly compensated 10%.  Questionable use of govt funding for company overhead expenses."
"Alion Science and Technology",",It pays the Bills- Other than that, I would avoid Alion at all costs.  Zero benefits and an imaginary advancement plan.  Not sure if this is twenty words or not."
"Alion Science and Technology",",Alion had a great health insurance plan for their employees. Unfortunately, over the 3 yrs. I worked their, out of pocket cost got higher and the match for putting away for retire went away, due to poor management in the corporate headquarters."
"Alion Science and Technology",",I was a telework employee, but everything at Alion made me feel part of the team.  All support staff were easy to get in touch with and any issues, when they did arise, were addressed quickly."
"Alion Science and Technology",",Collaborative work environment with both internal teams and Government customer. Excelling place to gain leadership skills and expertise in your domain."
"Alion Science and Technology",",Always a different challenge everyday. Work with amazing people. Personally rewarding due to the fact that we were able to help soldiers regarding fuel, and safety. Cutting edge of technology."
"Alion Science and Technology",",Overall, I would say that this job taught me how to stay on task, even when I did not enjoy the work every day."
"Alion Science and Technology",",A typical work day changed on a daily basis. It was the same type of work, but the parts that we worked on changed every couple of days. We assisted in building a radio system to place on the back of military vehicles. There were around 200 pieces that fit on each pallet so we were tasked with putting them together. "
"Alion Science and Technology",",The job tested my motivation but I was able to push through. My co-workers were good people that were pretty easy to work with. We did not develop any outside of work relationship. "
"Alion Science and Technology",",The hardest part of the job was doing the same thing about 200 times per day but I learned to persevere. The most enjoyable part of the day was that the day-to-day duties changed."
"Alion Science and Technology",",Everyone was focused on customer satisfaction, so there was good teamwork to do the job well.  Upper level management ran the ship aground."
"Alion Science and Technology",",The best part of the job was my contract work for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The work was interesting and provided for the acquisition of new techniques in my profession."
"Alion Science and Technology",",A great working environment full of intelligent professionals. But company leadership has made many bad choices over years, and this has led to hard times in the current industry environment. Two bad quarters and many lost recompetes have led to several hundred employees leaving the company, many involuntarily. Key management has been stripped out so critical thought leadership needed to grow the company is non-existant. Wait a couple of years before considering a job at Alion. They need to turn their ship around first."
"Alion Science and Technology",",I have been employed at this company for 11 years there is great opportunity for advancement I have been promoted 3 times in those 11 years, I started off as a temp for 1 year then hired permanently for the past 10 years nothing but growth there are some management who gave me the ability to learn new things I love everything about my position and manager. The most enjoyable thing about working at Alion is the ability to advance and free educational classes."
"Workbridge Associates","I worked at Workbridge Associates for a year and a half, and learned a lot about technical recruiting and account management. Young culture, fast-paced environment."
"Workbridge Associates",",Boiler room environment with ridiculous training. Micro managed. They watch your every move. You are constantly tested and expected to hit unattainable metrics."
"Workbridge Associates",",This is a cutting edge opportunity where you will be pushed and under pressure, but you will come out learning and honing in on skills you didn't know you needed for the real world. It's a great opportunity but you must be open to constructive criticism."
"Workbridge Associates",",Always learning, always improving.  This is a great place to find mentorship."
"Workbridge Associates",",Typical day starts with a team meeting, then straight into networking calls and placing candidates for jobs."
"Workbridge Associates",",It was a good place to work. All of us that worked their helped each other out and respected each other. All of us knew what we needed to get done and we all just did our best to make sure it got done."
"Workbridge Associates",",Liked the people that worked here for sure. Everyone is always really pleasant to be around. I didn't like the fact that to get additional help it meant that I had to request time to go out and drink with management until 8-8:30. The culture is built pretty heavily around drinking and after work activities which at times can be more exhausting than the actually work you do during the day."
"Workbridge Associates",",I worked at Workbridge Associates for over six months and LOVED it. Although recruiting just was not a god fit for me personally, I gained amazing skills that I will carry with me throughout my career."
"Workbridge Associates",",It seems like all these staffing companies (Workbridge, Robert Half, TekSystems) don't really have positions to fill as they keep circulating the same positions over and over again on their websites. Here is what happened:"
"Workbridge Associates",",I applied to what sounds like a legitimate IT position and the next day I get a call from a junior recruiter to discuss the opportunity. We go over skills, experiences, requirements, company location and size, salary requirements, and then set a face-to-face meeting with senior recruiters in their DC office. I was expecting an email to confirm meeting, location to discuss the position in more detail and here is what I got:"
"Workbridge Associates",",*****************************"
"Workbridge Associates",",Interview Preparation:"
"Workbridge Associates",",Please email me a copy of:"
"Workbridge Associates",",•  Three technical supervisory references."
"Workbridge Associates",",Additionally:"
"Workbridge Associates",",•   A list of any target companies that you would like to pursue. "
"Workbridge Associates",",•   A list of companies we should not contact on your behalf.  (This list should include the companies where your resume has been submitted and the companies where you have already interviewed.)  "
"Workbridge Associates",",Interview Details:"
"Workbridge Associates",",When you get here you and I will sit down for 15-20 minutes, talk about your recent projects and experience in a bit more depth. Then I’ll have you meet with my colleagues on the team here, where I and the team will do our best to answer any questions you might have about specific positions or the market in general. Any of the positions you approve, we’ll submit you to and get started marketing you to our clients."
"Workbridge Associates",",*****************************"
"Workbridge Associates",",NO Where in the above message states anything about"
"Workbridge Associates",",  "
"Workbridge Associates",", the position the junior recruiter and I discussed over the phone.....They want me to provide info for them to find jobs I can do myself."
"Workbridge Associates",",  "
"Workbridge Associates",",The work day was supposed to be from 8:30-5:30 but several people stayed until way late.  I learned how to recruit but management was not helpful. Coworkers were awesome, but that's about the only reason to stay."
"Workbridge Associates",",Excellent and detailed training program, but little to no work-life balance and constant micromanaging. My co-workers were all young, some friendly and hardworking people."
"Workbridge Associates",",You don't often find companies that are willing to invest in training their employees and give them the tools for a successful career in sales or recruiting"
"Workbridge Associates",",fast paced sales environment. I have not worked there since 2008 so I don't think my review is relevant as I'm sure a lot has changed."
"Workbridge Associates",",this company spent 20 minutes trying to get information out of me as to who was offering me a job. when I shared with them a particular company they advertise several days later as if they were the ones looking for that company. they have no clientele they will get clientele from job search candidate themselves by asking you who have you interviewed with and then advertising information you gave them as if they are the onesvrecruiting for that employer. they will ask you specifically for the names and phone numbers of people you interviewed with and then lie to you to say that is to make sure that they don't send your resume to companies who are their clients if you already interviewed for them. They have next to no clientele in Philadelphia, they get them from you, the unsuspecting candidate looking for a job. There is no prestigious university they are recruiting for, they got that information from me."
"Workbridge Associates",",there're always hireing and looking for more enployies but they never wanted to pay anybody more money that minimum wage for all the work that is required at this job."
"Workbridge Associates",",Not happy with the posting that advertised a great rate and was then informed that there were no positions for that rate!! The position continued to be advertised subsequently. "
"Workbridge Associates",",I spent my time and effort answering lots of basic redundant questions on a phone call only to be told the rate was not available but they had other lower rate contracts. "
"Workbridge Associates",",The obviously never read my resume well enough nor did they read the cover letter that clearly stated a minimum rate. "
"Workbridge Associates",",I really wish they didn't just follow the phishing principle!"
"Workbridge Associates",",good company for the recent grad. really low starting salary, but if you hustle you can work your way up and make good money."
"Workbridge Associates",",great place to start your career as a Sales and Tech Recruiter"
"Workbridge Associates",",Great training, great people, tough work, long days, a lot of sales, a lot of ups and downs, extremely challenging."
"Workbridge Associates",",Workbridge Associates is a very competitively run company.  My tasks included working on a top-notch team that had competitive sales goals.
