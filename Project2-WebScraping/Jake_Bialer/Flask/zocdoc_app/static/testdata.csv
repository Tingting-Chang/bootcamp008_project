,I have seen Dr. Chaboki for years and he is fantastic!  He is very efficient but takes time to explain what is going on and possible options.  The only negative is with his staff.  I tried to call today to ask a question and was put on hold for 15 minutes. I was then disconnected and never got to speak to a staff member.  The office definitely needs to fix their telephone system!  Even with the office issue I still highly recommend Dr. Chaboki! 
,I had a last minute problem and needed to be seen immediately.  ZocDoc and Dr. Chaboki's office made this possible.  

The service and process was excellent on both ends.  

I would not hesitate to go back in the future for other problems, procedures or routine check-ups.  ,Very thorough, competent, professional.  I would recommend him without reservation.,Dr. Chaboki immediately addresses challenges you are facing and is great about being in touch if you find yourself needing follow-up for some reason.  I am a big fan.,This is my second visit to Dr. Chaboki's office.  I had such a good experience last year visiting him, but especially communicating with him after the appointment via email while I traveled for work and was not responding to the prescription. He will continue to be my preferred ENT.,I really enjoyed my appointment with Dr. Chaboki. He was very informative, listened attentively and let me know my options for my problems as well as the risks and benefits of each option. For those looking for an ENT, I highly recommend Dr. Chaboki, he was wonderful,I give top marks to Dr. Chaboki.  He is highly knowledgable and experienced and his skills and ability will make you feel safe and at ease immediately.  He is also very patient and friendly and takes a great deal of time to answer all questions and cover all basis.  This was my first encounter with a plastic surgeon and I am delighted it was with Dr. Chaboki.  I recommend his unreservedly.   ,NO doubt this Doctor is brilliant and quite accomplished. He is also very kind and charming.
He saw me for severe ear pain and pressure in both ears, yet no infection was to be seen from looking at eardrum. I thought that the pressure of the ear can be measured with a special instrument...but it was not employed. I was relieved that there was nothing 'serious'; I felt quite perplexed as to how I could have such incredible ear and head pain. Helpfully, Dr.Chaboki explained other reasons that could cause my pain and gave me excellent referrals with which to follow up. ,This is a very brilliant and kind man who explains everything.,I was taken back within 5 min. and spoke with a doctor right away. Problem solved and out the door in less than 45 min. start to finish.,Dr. Chaboki is an absolute miracle worker. He is knowledgable, efficient, and gets right to the heart of the matter. I was especially pleased to be provided with long term solutions to my problem, which hadn't happened before with other Doctors. In short, he is outstanding. And that's sometimes hard to find in the medical profession.,Dr. Chaboki was very helpful and friendly.  He diagnosed and fully solved my problem very fast.  I was in and out of there in 30 minutes.,I have been to Doctor Chaboki before and he is always pleasant and answers all my questions.,NA,NA,NA,NA","5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0","Medical School - University of Illinois at Chicago,University of California San Francisco,Mount Sinai Medical Center","Aetna,Blue Cross Blue Shield,CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield,,",null,Facial Plastic & Reconstructive Surgeon,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/houtan-chaboki-md-3715,"NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient)","Speedy Response,Scheduling Hero",3715,3715,3715,5.0,5.0,4.61904761905,2017-02-11,1,,153,Doctor,/doctor/houtan-chaboki-md-3715,21,3816,16354,5215 Loughboro Road,Suite 210,None,Washington,DC,20016,(202) 741-3409,38.9357762,-77.1072771,-05:00:00,-18000,False,True,153,75,-1,-1

I feel comfortable though English is not my first language since sometimes those terminologies make me confuse. Highly recommended!,Dr. Grant is a WONDERFUL doctor, professional, SMART AND HUMAN.   She takes her time every single visit, she truly CARES about all of her patients, offers advice and/or suggestions for any/every medical condition I speak to her about. She ensures that I am paying attention to / addressing what I need to from a medical standpoint.  She is truly a Godsend, BEST doctor around in my book! ,I was seeing as associate of Dr. Grant's for over 30 years -- she left the practice, so I've been seeing Dr. Grant for the past 3 years.  Dr. Grant is a GREAT doctor, so very professional but yet has the HUMAN TOUCH.  She explains every single thing down to detail, will talk about any concerns including non-gyn issues.  She is the epitome of what all doctors should be like.  I absolutely love her! ,She is very nice and now she would be my future doctor too.,Dr Grant was very professional and lovely, too!
Seemed really interested in the the state of my health and asked me also fun questions about myself which helped diffuse the tension.
I will certainly go back! Great doctor!,She was very thorough in understanding my medical history, had clearly read materials previously submitted, and genuinely cared about me as a person - seems like that would not be something so outrageous to comment on, but in dealing with medical professionals, it's more rare than not!,She was amazing! Straightforward but gentle. I would definitely go back to her.,Bit of a wait upon arriving, but other than that I couldn't have a higher opinion of Dr. Grant.

She is very professional, very knowledgeable, and takes the time to explain things, engage you in a conversation about your health, answers any questions in a clear and simple to understand way, prompt about following up, makes your visit efficient but not rushed. ,I love that she is always very friendly, attentive to everything that is being said, and clear in all her explanations.
The staff is attentive and friendly.
The waiting room is clean and relaxing. ,The best! Dr. Grant is very professional and very compassionate.  She made a great effort to help me with managing payments for her services because I have no health insurance.  She takes the time to sit down with you to discuss results and to answer any questions.  ,I really appreciated her thoroughness.  As a first visit I left feeling confident she was the right choice of a doctor who would understand my needs.  ,.,Very comforting and very helpful. Took her time examining me and answering my millions of questions. Highly recommended. ,Dr. Grant is absolutely wonderful. I went to her for an emergency while I was visiting the city, and she was beyond comforting, professional and thorough. She listened to all of my questions and worries with understanding and patience and called me to check in on how I was doing. I am now switching from my former doctor to be her patient. ,I had an amazing experience with Dr. Grant. She is very thorough, takes her time with the patient, and she and the office staff are professional and friendly. ,She was great -- very warm and caring and professional. Very thorough in her examination and I felt very safe in her hands.,As usual, a very sweet person. Very dedicated, responsible and professional. I am very happy to be her patient. Thanks Dr. Susan!,Exceptional and thorough.  A true professional,Dr. Grant was very helpful. She was patient and took a thorough history before my physical exam. I was very nervous for the appointment, and by the end was feeling assured and confident. Despite the fact that I kept her for quite some time, I never felt rushed, which is refreshing. During the examination itself, she was sensitive and professional. 

If you do not already know, she does not deal with insurance companies, so be prepared to pay the full rate. However, you will not feel sorry or that it is a waste of money. Dr. Grant really earns the trust of her patients. NB not that it is avoidable, but be sure to mention you do not have insurance. She will prescribe generics and depending on the labs may provide a discount. ,She is awesome. She really makes my first  visit  comfortable. A very warm, nice doctor. I will surely recommend her to my friends.,Very friendly and professional,She is awesome ! Going to the gynecologist is never funny, but she makes it so much easier !
She is very sweet, explain you everything with simple words, she takes her time to get to know you. ,She was so personable and amazing I liked alot!!,Dr. Grant is one of the most caring doctors I have ever met. I only met her once (so far!) but she remembered me when I called. She also called and emailed me several times just to check up on me since I was having surgery. She is a knowledgeable and trustworthy doctor, and I will definitely be going back.,Even though the wait was a bit long(30mins), it was worth it. Dr Grant was very helpful and put me at ease straight away and tried to get me the best price for the tests available as I didn't have insurance. ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,NA,NA","Medical School - Drexel University, Philadelphia, Doctor of Medicine,Saint Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center (Internship),Saint Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center (Residency)",,null,OB-GYN,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/susan-grant-md-5180,"NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA","Rapid Registration,See You Again",5180,5180,5180,5.0,4.98039215686,4.27450980392,2017-02-11,0,,104,Doctor,/doctor/susan-grant-md-5180,53,60914,60914,315 West 57th Street,Suite 304,None,New York,NY,10019,(212) 769-0755,40.767087,-73.983908,-05:00:00,-18000,False,True,153,75,-1,-1

I would highly recommend Dr. Carter not only for being a wonderful compassionate physician but also for being a very REAL person.,Dr. Carter is the ONLY physician about whom I can say that I am ""highly satisfied"" with care and service. ,I have been seeing Dr Carter for about 8 years now.  He is wonderful.  He is extremely personable, patient and understanding.  I love that he remembers who I am and doesn't treat me like a number.  He even remembers items my husband had talked about at previous appointments (such as music and where he grew up).  Would highly recommend him to anyone.  In addition, his staff is Wonderful as well!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","Medical School - University of Minnesota, Doctor of Medicine,Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology",OB-GYN,null,OB-GYN,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/andrew-carter-md-16214,"(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","Rapid Registration,See You Again,Speedy Response",16214,16214,16214,5.0,5.0,4.71724137931,2017-02-11,1,,104,Doctor,/doctor/andrew-carter-md-16214,147,78967,78967,9500 E.

He is very thorough and also very pleasant. He takes his time to hear you out and tries to explain the medical concepts in a language that is understandable to the patient.  It was my first visitv there, but he was very friendly and spent at least 30 minutes examining, listening to me talking about three different problems. I do not see foctors often and I usually have more than one thing to ask my doctor when I go. With most of my previous doctors I felt like after they had done the first thing they were ready to show me out. Dr. Khazaeizadeh is different. He does not rush you and does not try to get rid of you or have you make another time. I get the feeling thst he really likes his job and is genuinely interested in your health. ,This was my first appointment for a general consultation.  Nurse who checked me in and did my blood pressure was really friendly.  Doctor seemed genuinely concerned with my medical history and concerns.  Even mentioned that if I ever have a gynecological issue or need a women's exam, the office's other, female doctor (his wife) is available if I prefer a female doctor.   ,Professional, knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. Staff and office setting are also very nice.,Wanted to switch my doctor from Newport Beach to somewhere a little closer.  Saw Dr. Ali had great reviews and decided to give him a try.  VERY impressed!  Took his time answering questions and really getting to know me.  The staff was great too.  I'll definitely keep him as my primary.,The staff and doctor were really great.

He is very thorough and also very pleasant. He takes his time to hear you out and tries to explain the medical concepts in a language that is understandable to the patient.  It was my first visitv there, but he was very friendly and spent at least 30 minutes examining, listening to me talking about three different problems. I do not see foctors often and I usually have more than one thing to ask my doctor when I go. With most of my previous doctors I felt like after they had done the first thing they were ready to show me out. Dr. Khazaeizadeh is different. He does not rush you and does not try to get rid of you or have you make another time. I get the feeling thst he really likes his job and is genuinely interested in your health. ,This was my first appointment for a general consultation.  Nurse who checked me in and did my blood pressure was really friendly.  Doctor seemed genuinely concerned with my medical history and concerns.  Even mentioned that if I ever have a gynecological issue or need a women's exam, the office's other, female doctor (his wife) is available if I prefer a female doctor.   ,Professional, knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. Staff and office setting are also very nice.,Wanted to switch my doctor from Newport Beach to somewhere a little closer.  Saw Dr. Ali had great reviews and decided to give him a try.  VERY impressed!  Took his time answering questions and really getting to know me.  The staff was great too.  I'll definitely keep him as my primary.,The staff and doctor were really great. Everyone was nice and calm. I was a new patient, they answered all my questions right away, and gave me correct information. The environment was nice. It went fast and was a stress-free visit. :),Very nice and equipped office, nice staff and a good doctor. ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,NA,NA","Medical School - Shiraz University of Medical Sciences,Yale University, Residency in Internal Medicine,Yale University (Internship)","Urgent Care Specialist,Internist",null,Internist,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/alireza-khazaeizadeh-md-17592,"NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA","Rapid Registration,Speedy Response,Scheduling Hero",17592,17592,17592,5.0,4.92857142857,4.52380952381,2017-02-11,1,,99,Doctor,/doctor/alireza-khazaeizadeh-md-17592,43,15189,41560,2507 Eastbluff Drive,None,None,Newport Beach,CA,92660,(949) 200-1655,33.639525,-117.8754871,-08:00:00,-28800,False,True,153,75,-1,-1

I liked talking about my personal problems in an office setting, where I didn't feel vulnerable or judged. After the office, I was brought back to the room where Dr. Hammer and the nurse did the routine. I've never been checked by two people, so at first I didn't feel any privacy. But, they both had great bedside manner and made sure I was comfetorable (as comfetorable as one could be in that situation). Because I don't have insurance, my prescription was resiculously high. They were very helpful and called in several different things to two different pharmacies to help me find what was affordable.   By far the best OBGYN I've ever been to! ,Dr. Hammer is absolutely fantastic! She was incredibly nice and always smiling. She made me feel at ease and I felt very comfortable talking to her. Definitely coming back to her! She's great. ,She was incredible! So nice and very caring. I will most definitely make her my permanent ob/gyn.

I will definitely go to her from now on!,She was awesome professional kind and caring just what you need from an Obg/yn,First time going to Dr. Hammer, nurses were friendly i didnt wait long before Dr. Hammer saw me. Dr. Hammer was friendly and very nice, she did not make me feel uncomfortable at all. ,I went on a day that was not very busy and I was seen right away. Jo Bess Hammer was highly recommended to me by a coworker and I will continue to be a patient of hers. I went for a routine visit but also discussed with her some more serious topics. She was compassionate and more than helpful. For a wonderful experience, you must go to Jo Bess Hammer. MUST! ,Dr. Hammer is an awesome individual.

Once you go there, you won't feel like going any where. May God bless her,She's very caring and very prompt.,I usually dont get time to come and drop any reviews; but this visit of mine was so pleasantly surprising that I wanted to come here and write down something for her. I have rarely seen doctors like Dr. Hammer; kind, smiling, considerate, great listner and like a soothing tonic. She took time to explain everything and her smile didnot leave her even on my stupid questions. I was much worried to visit her because there were no reviews here.

Would recommend. ,Dr Kosova is very detailed in the treatment he provides. The staff is very polite, the overall experience was excellent. I wpuld definitely recommend to anyone. It was my first time there today and from the beginning to end they treated me with extreme courtesy and politeness.,I am grateful that I found Dr. Kosova to treat my foot pain.  I was afraid he would treat me like any other doctor I have been to and I am so glad to say he went above and beyond.  Spent time explaining everything, asked if I had any questions, and didn't do the usual cortisone injection and send me on my way.,Excellent Doctor, has done several procedures over the years.  Excellent results.  I like the fact he listens and provides full explanations and of course love the fact his work is excellent and well done.,I felt that after a couple failed attempts at finding the right podiatrist, I was impressed with how I was treated. Hopefully this will be the start of a great patient/dr. relationship, and my feet will be happier for it! ,He is VERY humble, funny and polite and respectful!  He definitely seems to know what he is doing and listens and explains real well.  I am still going to him and believe I made the right choice.
I like the fact the office doesn't call u 3 or 4 times to remind u of the appointment, which I have often found annoying.  
He gives options for treatment and doesn't go to the initial regimen of shots like other podiatrists or ortho docs seem to.  He explains xrays and spends alot of time in the initial appointment.
The staff is also very polite.

,Would highly recommend Dr Kosova.  Very thorough.  Took the time and explained everything very well.  Office staff great as well.,Friendly office staff, quick check in for the first time in the office, and was very pleased with the outcome of my first visit with Dr. Kosova.  Very nice, professional and intelligent doctor. ,Dr. Kosova was very knowledgeable and made me feel at home in his office. My pain was quickly diagnosed and alleviated. I will be seeing him if I have any more problems in the future. ,Very professional and concerned.,I thought the doctor was very informed and professional. He explained everything and I was pleased with his treatment. ,First Doctor that I didn't feel rushed talking with.   They were short staffed due to an illness, yet I was taken in before my appt. time and seen immediately.  Both the Dr. And his staff had a wonderful demeanor and bedside manner.   I am moving ahead with the hyprocure stent with this doctor and feel very comfortable.,Dr. Kosova was very professional and approachable. He explained the situation well and asked several times if I had questions. He gave me options and did not pressure me to proceed toward surgery. ,Great very friendly, informative staff is friendly and office is clean and very comfortable ,He and his staff are so nice! They answered all of my questions and put my concerns at ease.,He's great. Really cares about his patients. I want a certain surgical procedure done to my feet, and he said if I went somewhere else they would do it, but he was going to wait- just because I've had too many health issues lately and he doesn't want to add to them. That tells me he actually cares about what's good for me.,It was great DR Kosova took me  right away . Explained everything I am very pleased,Very professional and thorough.,I thought he was very thorough. He was easy to talk to and listened carefully. I was able to feel relaxed with him as my doctor.

I was a little shocked by the fees ($395 initial consult for 1 hour and $195 follow-ups for a 1/2 hour) and no participation with insurance but in the end it was money well spent to get my diagnosis and start medication treatment which I've been putting off doing for far too long.,Very kind and helpful.

Listens patiently and is always available to make sure treatment is going well. ,Dr. Rokoske was empathetic and was immediate in putting together a treatment plan with which I was comfortable.,Very, very impressed to see how much dedication Dr. Rokoske showed towards the care of her patients. She took the time to develop a good medication plan for myself, and took the time to call my primary care physician to include him in it as well. She also called me the next day to follow up and even helped me get started on a treatment plan to get off of some of my meds. Most Psychiatrists I've ever visited will usually spend most of the time writing things down and staring at the clock until they just write a prescription with almost no questions asked so it's a huge relief to find one that actually cares enough to take a more personal approach in treating her patients. Dr. Rokoske's care is FAR beyond that level that I've experienced in the past. I would highly recommend her to anyone I know seeking a good Psychiatrist and I look forward to my next appointment with her!,Very thorough and professional.  She really made me feel at ease.,Unlike some other psychiatrist I have seen, Dr. Rokoske talked to me about my history and concerns for a full hour, rather than 15 minutes and out the door with a script. I left feeling both confident in the treatment plan we had decided on and comfortable that if I felt like it wasn't working, she would listen and take those concerns seriously. ,Very positive.  She is highly professional, asked a lot of questions, and seemed very competent.

I felt that Dr. Varghese will help me to get the right treatment over time.  All of the other staff were also kind and willing to listen to me.  The office is on the newer side and they have all the latest technology which was very nice.  I'm thankful for Dr. Varghese!  ,It was great! Very Clean place i love it! They told me exactly what they where going to do and how the process would be. The doctor showed me a video of my nasal cavity that he took with a long camera. He explained my situation and made follow up visits. ,Dr. Varghese is extremely passionate about his specialty and it shows in his confidence and care for the patient.  You know he's committed to getting you better and couldn't recommend anyone better.,Very attentive and informative. Awesome staff. Great doctor and services. ,Dr. Varghese was very knowledgeable, professional, and friendly. It was the best doctor experience I have had so far.,Dr, Varghese listens. He asks questions to help determine the issue and is very effective in his recommendations and prescriptions. He helped me when five other doctors could not.,After a referral from my ENT to visit this office, I was very pleasantly surprised by Dr. Varghese's impressive knowledge, passion for his specialty,overall empathetic and friendly manner in explaining how to get me on the path to feeling better from persistent allergies. Just as friendly and courteous were his nurses and staff. I highly recommend.,Their service was excellent and clear explanation for everything. I personally recommend to any one to visit Dr mathew m Varghese MD,Very informative and thorough to get to the bottom of what is going on with me and my 2 year old.,Before seeing Dr. Varghese, I was constantly sneezing with an itchy nose and watery eyes. I made an appointment with him after reading positive reviews online. At my first appointment, I was there for almost 3 hours. I have never been to a doctor who was so thorough and spent so much time with me. It is clear that Dr. Varghese is very passionate about his work and his patients. He and the nurses performed a slew of tests to determine what I was allergic to (turns out just about everything), as well as various breathing tests for my asthma and nasal issues. He also has a really cool video scope connected to an iPhone, so he showed me pictures and videos of what my nasal passages looked like. 
He prescribed me various eye drops, nose spray, inhalers, and a daily allergy pill to take, and they spent time showing me the proper way to use the inhaler and the nose spray (I had been doing it wrong all along). It’s a lot to take, but I was feeling significantly better within only a few days. I have also been doing the weekly allergy shots and am close to being on maintenance shots only (once a month). I feel infinitely better than I used to and am so happy to have found such a wonderful practice. 
His staff are WONDERFUL and also take a lot of time with you to explain things and listen. The practice can get very busy so make sure you allow yourself enough time when getting weekly shots and particularly on your first visit. They are open every Saturday now, which is very convenient for those who work during the week. 
,Dr. Varghese has been treating me for almost a year for my accute allergies. He is professional, caring and he truly listens to what you have to say.  I feel much better since being in his care. His STAFF is amazing from the receptionist to the medical assistant.,Dr. Varghese is an amazing doctor. He is very diligent and follows up constantly with my daughter's care. I am very thankful to have him as my daughter's doctor. ,My visit was educational and symptom relief started immediately. ,Excellent doctor, explained clearly all procedures being done, very friendly and his employees super professional and friendly.,Wonderful visit all around, Dr. Varghese is awesome he answered all my questions without feeling rushed. Lovely staff, they made me feel comfortable and were all very tentative.

His passion for his work is self-evident. The office uses modern and updated technology and all the staff are very friendly. I would highly recommend this doctor!,Dr. Varghese is amazing and so are his staff. I brought my 2 children tday one who is 4 years old and one who is 2 years old and he was amazing when checking them!!! They loved him and Stephanie was the best nurse.. I was given the answers I have been waiting for which is a big relief.  I also love that dr. Varghese explains everything. ,Very knowledgeable allergist. My son has been getting allergy shots for months now and it has helped tremendously! Will highly recommend this doctor to friends and family. ,Dr. Varghese is sent from above so to speak. Right of the bat he knows what's wrong and what's appropriate remedy. He not only love his craft but his patients as well. His very knowledgeable and have a lots of patient answering endless questions. Most of all, his not money hungry kind of Doctor. His a kind of Doctor with a very big heart. And, its hard to find now a days...,My visit with Dr. Mathew Varghese was great as usual and amazing. Over the weekend I was coughing, wheezing and I had shortness of breath and I could not get any sleep because whenever I would lie down it would get worse. I had also run out of my backup inhaler which I had purchased two weeks ago and I knew the pharmacist would not allow me another refill so soon, I then purchased a vicks vapor steam, vapor rub, mucinex expectorant/cough suppressant anything that I thought would help because it felt like if I had the flu and asthma at the same time but the things I purchased were only a temporary Band-Aid because they only helped me for a few minutes before I went back to my coughing fit and shortness of breath, I did not want go to the ER because I still was not sure if I was just coming down with the flu and I did not want to be charged 2000 + dollars at the ER just for a check up. On Monday I went to see the doctor and the nurses where doing their regular check up on me and when they finally did the test where they measure/check how much air I can blow out my lungs and how fast, that is when I went into a very bad coughing fit Dr. Varghese immediately came into the room and had the nurses give me a nebulizer a shot and oh my gosh I immediately felt better. He knew that my issue was not a flu.He also said that he was going to treat me in his office because if I went to the ER it would cost me a lot of money and since he knew I was not working he did not want me to incur that expense when he could just administer the same treatments without the expense a hospital would. I was in really bad shape and I did not even know it. He prescribed me an antibiotic and some other medication which he said I had to take immediately which I did. I was able to finally sleep and breathe that night. I have never met a doctor that knows how to take care of his patients as well he does and the nurses are just as caring and amazing as he is. 

Before I met Dr. Varghese I had gone to my primary physician and a pulmonary specialist because I had been coughing day and night 7 days a week for three months and neither doctor could diagnose or tell me what I had. The pulmonary specialist even had the nerve to ask me if I wanted an antibiotic or an inhaler. I told her both because I am not sure what was wrong with me but what I really wanted to tell her was "" I don't know you are the specialist aren't you supposed to tell me what I need or have"" but instead I kept that thought to myself. The only doctor that was able to finally help me and tell me what I was suffering from (Asthma due to allergies) was Dr Varghese.

I recently got laid off from my job and I was afraid that I would not be able to continue my allergy shots or keep him as my doctor but instead of letting me walk away because I didn't have insurance they said that they did not want me to stop my treatments just because of money that they would work with me and I was offered a reasonable price so I could continue my shots and my follow ups I have been with them for about two years and I am very lucky that I came upon such an amazing Dr. and staff.,He has a wonderful bedside manner. He is smart. He is through and he is a good listener. His staff is competent and efficient. ,He is an amazing doctor and I am so happy that I went for a second opinion and he gave me answers that I have been looking for ... highly recommended!!!! ,I have been at this office twice and I loved it, the waiting time was not very long.  Nurses/medical assistances were very polite and friendly.  The Doctor the best! very nice and friendly, he cares about his patients and make them feel very confortable.  I would highly recomend this doctor.,Yes an yes absolutely Dr Matthewsis a great doctor and I will recommend to everyone,Amazing,all went well,Dr. Varghese is a very thorough, caring Dr.  He took the time to listen to all my concerns, addressed each issue in detail.

I felt that Dr. Varghese will help me to get the right treatment over time.  All of the other staff were also kind and willing to listen to me.  The office is on the newer side and they have all the latest technology which was very nice.  I'm thankful for Dr. Varghese!  ,It was great! Very Clean place i love it! They told me exactly what they where going to do and how the process would be. The doctor showed me a video of my nasal cavity that he took with a long camera. He explained my situation and made follow up visits. ,Dr. Varghese is extremely passionate about his specialty and it shows in his confidence and care for the patient.  You know he's committed to getting you better and couldn't recommend anyone better.,Very attentive and informative. Awesome staff. Great doctor and services. ,Dr. Varghese was very knowledgeable, professional, and friendly. It was the best doctor experience I have had so far.,Dr, Varghese listens. He asks questions to help determine the issue and is very effective in his recommendations and prescriptions. He helped me when five other doctors could not.,After a referral from my ENT to visit this office, I was very pleasantly surprised by Dr. Varghese's impressive knowledge, passion for his specialty,overall empathetic and friendly manner in explaining how to get me on the path to feeling better from persistent allergies. Just as friendly and courteous were his nurses and staff. I highly recommend.,Their service was excellent and clear explanation for everything. I personally recommend to any one to visit Dr mathew m Varghese MD,Very informative and thorough to get to the bottom of what is going on with me and my 2 year old.,Before seeing Dr. Varghese, I was constantly sneezing with an itchy nose and watery eyes. I made an appointment with him after reading positive reviews online. At my first appointment, I was there for almost 3 hours. I have never been to a doctor who was so thorough and spent so much time with me. It is clear that Dr. Varghese is very passionate about his work and his patients. He and the nurses performed a slew of tests to determine what I was allergic to (turns out just about everything), as well as various breathing tests for my asthma and nasal issues. He also has a really cool video scope connected to an iPhone, so he showed me pictures and videos of what my nasal passages looked like. 
He prescribed me various eye drops, nose spray, inhalers, and a daily allergy pill to take, and they spent time showing me the proper way to use the inhaler and the nose spray (I had been doing it wrong all along). It’s a lot to take, but I was feeling significantly better within only a few days. I have also been doing the weekly allergy shots and am close to being on maintenance shots only (once a month). I feel infinitely better than I used to and am so happy to have found such a wonderful practice. 
His staff are WONDERFUL and also take a lot of time with you to explain things and listen. The practice can get very busy so make sure you allow yourself enough time when getting weekly shots and particularly on your first visit. They are open every Saturday now, which is very convenient for those who work during the week. 
,Dr. Varghese has been treating me for almost a year for my accute allergies. He is professional, caring and he truly listens to what you have to say.  I feel much better since being in his care. His STAFF is amazing from the receptionist to the medical assistant.,Dr. Varghese is an amazing doctor. He is very diligent and follows up constantly with my daughter's care. I am very thankful to have him as my daughter's doctor. ,My visit was educational and symptom relief started immediately. ,Excellent doctor, explained clearly all procedures being done, very friendly and his employees super professional and friendly.,Wonderful visit all around, Dr. Varghese is awesome he answered all my questions without feeling rushed. Lovely staff, they made me feel comfortable and were all very tentative.

His passion for his work is self-evident. The office uses modern and updated technology and all the staff are very friendly. I would highly recommend this doctor!,Dr. Varghese is amazing and so are his staff. I brought my 2 children tday one who is 4 years old and one who is 2 years old and he was amazing when checking them!!! They loved him and Stephanie was the best nurse.. I was given the answers I have been waiting for which is a big relief.  I also love that dr. Varghese explains everything. ,Very knowledgeable allergist. My son has been getting allergy shots for months now and it has helped tremendously! Will highly recommend this doctor to friends and family. ,Dr. Varghese is sent from above so to speak. Right of the bat he knows what's wrong and what's appropriate remedy. He not only love his craft but his patients as well. His very knowledgeable and have a lots of patient answering endless questions. Most of all, his not money hungry kind of Doctor. His a kind of Doctor with a very big heart. And, its hard to find now a days...,My visit with Dr. Mathew Varghese was great as usual and amazing. Over the weekend I was coughing, wheezing and I had shortness of breath and I could not get any sleep because whenever I would lie down it would get worse. I had also run out of my backup inhaler which I had purchased two weeks ago and I knew the pharmacist would not allow me another refill so soon, I then purchased a vicks vapor steam, vapor rub, mucinex expectorant/cough suppressant anything that I thought would help because it felt like if I had the flu and asthma at the same time but the things I purchased were only a temporary Band-Aid because they only helped me for a few minutes before I went back to my coughing fit and shortness of breath, I did not want go to the ER because I still was not sure if I was just coming down with the flu and I did not want to be charged 2000 + dollars at the ER just for a check up. On Monday I went to see the doctor and the nurses where doing their regular check up on me and when they finally did the test where they measure/check how much air I can blow out my lungs and how fast, that is when I went into a very bad coughing fit Dr. Varghese immediately came into the room and had the nurses give me a nebulizer a shot and oh my gosh I immediately felt better. He knew that my issue was not a flu.He also said that he was going to treat me in his office because if I went to the ER it would cost me a lot of money and since he knew I was not working he did not want me to incur that expense when he could just administer the same treatments without the expense a hospital would. I was in really bad shape and I did not even know it. He prescribed me an antibiotic and some other medication which he said I had to take immediately which I did. I was able to finally sleep and breathe that night. I have never met a doctor that knows how to take care of his patients as well he does and the nurses are just as caring and amazing as he is. 

Before I met Dr. Varghese I had gone to my primary physician and a pulmonary specialist because I had been coughing day and night 7 days a week for three months and neither doctor could diagnose or tell me what I had. The pulmonary specialist even had the nerve to ask me if I wanted an antibiotic or an inhaler. I told her both because I am not sure what was wrong with me but what I really wanted to tell her was "" I don't know you are the specialist aren't you supposed to tell me what I need or have"" but instead I kept that thought to myself. The only doctor that was able to finally help me and tell me what I was suffering from (Asthma due to allergies) was Dr Varghese.

I recently got laid off from my job and I was afraid that I would not be able to continue my allergy shots or keep him as my doctor but instead of letting me walk away because I didn't have insurance they said that they did not want me to stop my treatments just because of money that they would work with me and I was offered a reasonable price so I could continue my shots and my follow ups I have been with them for about two years and I am very lucky that I came upon such an amazing Dr. and staff.,He has a wonderful bedside manner. He is smart. He is through and he is a good listener. His staff is competent and efficient. ,He is an amazing doctor and I am so happy that I went for a second opinion and he gave me answers that I have been looking for ... highly recommended!!!! ,I have been at this office twice and I loved it, the waiting time was not very long.  Nurses/medical assistances were very polite and friendly.  The Doctor the best! very nice and friendly, he cares about his patients and make them feel very confortable.  I would highly recomend this doctor.,Yes an yes absolutely Dr Matthewsis a great doctor and I will recommend to everyone,Amazing,all went well,Dr. Varghese is a very thorough, caring Dr.  He took the time to listen to all my concerns, addressed each issue in detail.

I felt that Dr. Varghese will help me to get the right treatment over time.  All of the other staff were also kind and willing to listen to me.  The office is on the newer side and they have all the latest technology which was very nice.  I'm thankful for Dr. Varghese!  ,It was great! Very Clean place i love it! They told me exactly what they where going to do and how the process would be. The doctor showed me a video of my nasal cavity that he took with a long camera. He explained my situation and made follow up visits. ,Dr. Varghese is extremely passionate about his specialty and it shows in his confidence and care for the patient.  You know he's committed to getting you better and couldn't recommend anyone better.,Very attentive and informative. Awesome staff. Great doctor and services. ,Dr. Varghese was very knowledgeable, professional, and friendly. It was the best doctor experience I have had so far.,Dr, Varghese listens. He asks questions to help determine the issue and is very effective in his recommendations and prescriptions. He helped me when five other doctors could not.,After a referral from my ENT to visit this office, I was very pleasantly surprised by Dr. Varghese's impressive knowledge, passion for his specialty,overall empathetic and friendly manner in explaining how to get me on the path to feeling better from persistent allergies. Just as friendly and courteous were his nurses and staff. I highly recommend.,Their service was excellent and clear explanation for everything. I personally recommend to any one to visit Dr mathew m Varghese MD,Very informative and thorough to get to the bottom of what is going on with me and my 2 year old.,Before seeing Dr. Varghese, I was constantly sneezing with an itchy nose and watery eyes. I made an appointment with him after reading positive reviews online. At my first appointment, I was there for almost 3 hours. I have never been to a doctor who was so thorough and spent so much time with me. It is clear that Dr. Varghese is very passionate about his work and his patients. He and the nurses performed a slew of tests to determine what I was allergic to (turns out just about everything), as well as various breathing tests for my asthma and nasal issues. He also has a really cool video scope connected to an iPhone, so he showed me pictures and videos of what my nasal passages looked like. 
He prescribed me various eye drops, nose spray, inhalers, and a daily allergy pill to take, and they spent time showing me the proper way to use the inhaler and the nose spray (I had been doing it wrong all along). It’s a lot to take, but I was feeling significantly better within only a few days. I have also been doing the weekly allergy shots and am close to being on maintenance shots only (once a month). I feel infinitely better than I used to and am so happy to have found such a wonderful practice. 
His staff are WONDERFUL and also take a lot of time with you to explain things and listen. The practice can get very busy so make sure you allow yourself enough time when getting weekly shots and particularly on your first visit. They are open every Saturday now, which is very convenient for those who work during the week. 
,Dr. Varghese has been treating me for almost a year for my accute allergies. He is professional, caring and he truly listens to what you have to say.  I feel much better since being in his care. His STAFF is amazing from the receptionist to the medical assistant.,Dr. Varghese is an amazing doctor. He is very diligent and follows up constantly with my daughter's care. I am very thankful to have him as my daughter's doctor. ,My visit was educational and symptom relief started immediately. ,Excellent doctor, explained clearly all procedures being done, very friendly and his employees super professional and friendly.,Wonderful visit all around, Dr. Varghese is awesome he answered all my questions without feeling rushed. Lovely staff, they made me feel comfortable and were all very tentative.

His passion for his work is self-evident. The office uses modern and updated technology and all the staff are very friendly. I would highly recommend this doctor!,Dr. Varghese is amazing and so are his staff. I brought my 2 children tday one who is 4 years old and one who is 2 years old and he was amazing when checking them!!! They loved him and Stephanie was the best nurse.. I was given the answers I have been waiting for which is a big relief.  I also love that dr. Varghese explains everything. ,Very knowledgeable allergist. My son has been getting allergy shots for months now and it has helped tremendously! Will highly recommend this doctor to friends and family. ,Dr. Varghese is sent from above so to speak. Right of the bat he knows what's wrong and what's appropriate remedy. He not only love his craft but his patients as well. His very knowledgeable and have a lots of patient answering endless questions. Most of all, his not money hungry kind of Doctor. His a kind of Doctor with a very big heart. And, its hard to find now a days...,My visit with Dr. Mathew Varghese was great as usual and amazing. Over the weekend I was coughing, wheezing and I had shortness of breath and I could not get any sleep because whenever I would lie down it would get worse. I had also run out of my backup inhaler which I had purchased two weeks ago and I knew the pharmacist would not allow me another refill so soon, I then purchased a vicks vapor steam, vapor rub, mucinex expectorant/cough suppressant anything that I thought would help because it felt like if I had the flu and asthma at the same time but the things I purchased were only a temporary Band-Aid because they only helped me for a few minutes before I went back to my coughing fit and shortness of breath, I did not want go to the ER because I still was not sure if I was just coming down with the flu and I did not want to be charged 2000 + dollars at the ER just for a check up. On Monday I went to see the doctor and the nurses where doing their regular check up on me and when they finally did the test where they measure/check how much air I can blow out my lungs and how fast, that is when I went into a very bad coughing fit Dr. Varghese immediately came into the room and had the nurses give me a nebulizer a shot and oh my gosh I immediately felt better. He knew that my issue was not a flu.He also said that he was going to treat me in his office because if I went to the ER it would cost me a lot of money and since he knew I was not working he did not want me to incur that expense when he could just administer the same treatments without the expense a hospital would. I was in really bad shape and I did not even know it. He prescribed me an antibiotic and some other medication which he said I had to take immediately which I did. I was able to finally sleep and breathe that night. I have never met a doctor that knows how to take care of his patients as well he does and the nurses are just as caring and amazing as he is. 

Before I met Dr. Varghese I had gone to my primary physician and a pulmonary specialist because I had been coughing day and night 7 days a week for three months and neither doctor could diagnose or tell me what I had. The pulmonary specialist even had the nerve to ask me if I wanted an antibiotic or an inhaler. I told her both because I am not sure what was wrong with me but what I really wanted to tell her was "" I don't know you are the specialist aren't you supposed to tell me what I need or have"" but instead I kept that thought to myself. The only doctor that was able to finally help me and tell me what I was suffering from (Asthma due to allergies) was Dr Varghese.

I recently got laid off from my job and I was afraid that I would not be able to continue my allergy shots or keep him as my doctor but instead of letting me walk away because I didn't have insurance they said that they did not want me to stop my treatments just because of money that they would work with me and I was offered a reasonable price so I could continue my shots and my follow ups I have been with them for about two years and I am very lucky that I came upon such an amazing Dr. and staff.,He has a wonderful bedside manner. He is smart. He is through and he is a good listener. His staff is competent and efficient. ,He is an amazing doctor and I am so happy that I went for a second opinion and he gave me answers that I have been looking for ... highly recommended!!!! ,I have been at this office twice and I loved it, the waiting time was not very long.  Nurses/medical assistances were very polite and friendly.  The Doctor the best! very nice and friendly, he cares about his patients and make them feel very confortable.  I would highly recomend this doctor.,Yes an yes absolutely Dr Matthewsis a great doctor and I will recommend to everyone,Amazing,all went well,Dr. Varghese is a very thorough, caring Dr.  He took the time to listen to all my concerns, addressed each issue in detail.  He took the time to explain everything and has a wonderful bedside manner.  His office staff is very friendly and welcoming.  ,We will continue to go,It was great!

I've been suffering from severe allergy attacks and am living on allergy pills.  She immediately discussed treatment and testing options that would work for me.  I'm looking forward to my next appointment and the thought of getting my life back and not having to live on pills constantly.,Excellent doctor and incredibly polite staff! I'd highly recommend Dr. Schulte - she seemed really focused on trying to resolve my allergy-like symptoms.,I loved this doctor.  She was thorough, took the time needed to answer questions and assist and support my very nervous 11 year old regarding skin testing.  She was not only compassionate but knowledgeable.  She also has experience with EG (Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis which is rare) and connections to Cedars and other professional doctors who specialize with this condition.  I am thrilled I found her and appreciate the experience.  Which is why I'm taking the time to write this.  Highly recommend her, her staff, and her nice office suite.  ,The staff is very friendly and efficient. Dr Schulte is wonderful.

She made me feel comfortable, and was such a joy to have as a doctor! I wish all my doctors were more like her ,Dr. Schulte was engaging and thorough.  She explained the allergy testing process and the results well.  ,Fantastic physician. Takes time to explain everything and get to know you personally. Not a rushed appointment. Great nursing staff, very attentive, funny, efficient and knowledgable. ,Fantastic Doctor!,The doc is warm, caring and efficient.,Danica was AMAZING!!!!!! I've been to other allergists who keep you coming time and time again for a VERY obvious physical reaction and do nothing .... She took care of me like a mom and gave me a plan in one visit for a pretty complex issue, of course after lots of testing and whatnot ..... 10 stars!!!!!!!!,Danica was awesome!  I went in for severe congestion.  She listened to all my symptoms and explained a few plans for me that could work. I really liked how she took the time to explain certain prescriptions I would be taking and all its effects.   Its been a couple of weeks and I feel much better.  ,What a GREAT appointment! I can't remember the last time a doctor was busy and on time, she was very professional and listened to all of my needs. Also her staff were very on top of things and knew what they were talking about. All of my testing, shots plus results were done in the same visit! I start my weekly regiment of allergy shots next week and feel very at ease about it. Her hours fit mine and I am able to come in when it is convenient for me. I feel like I have been well informed about what to expect from my future appointment and I am looking forward to it. Thank you Southern CA Allergy! ,Thank you so much for the friendly office visit. You guys make it so simple and easy to get my shots, I can't thank you enough. 
Dr. Schulte and her highly trained nurses keep me coming back for my allergy shots, I would not do it if it were not so convenient. The hours, ease of the office and personalities of the team make doing this weekly more like a spa visit and less like a chore. Important to note that if you have kids they have an adorable playroom which makes getting seen by the doctor  a more enjoyable experience. I'll be back!!!,I could not be more impressed with Dr. Schulte and her excellent staff!!!  

I was able to be seen the same day, and even though the office was fairly busy, Dr Schulte took all the time that I needed to feel comfortable with the testing and next step procedures.  

Her patience with my questions, and ease with which we discussed my options made me very very comfortable with the further treatments, and she assures me that my sneezing and wheezing issues will be solved very soon.  I'm Excited!!

I would not hesitate to recommend her to my family and friends.,This is a the first time I'm dealing with an allergy specialist and it was an awesome experience. I would absolutely recommend this doctor to friends and family. She is very knowledgeable in what she's doing and keeping me comfortable was her main priority and I appreciated that. The office staff was great as well. I;m happy to say I have found a Doctor that I can officially say I;m sticking with or better yet she's stuck with me. Great doctors that are honest are hard to find. ,I loved my visit to Dr. Schulte's office. The entire staff was very impressive. I needed allergy testing and they were awesome, they explained the entire procedure to me. The procedure was painless. The good thing was that I walk away with an extensive amount of knowledge about my allergies.,Dr.Schulte is amazing!

A wonderful and warm pediatrician, incredibly gentle with my baby. Wait time is usually less than 5 minutes and the office staff is always ready and willing to address any issues. Even when my baby was ill, the staff directed me over the phone as to the treatment and medication. They also were willing to book me for an appointment immediately to get my baby checked out.

It proved difficult because it was one week before school began and no one had an appointment for us including her. But she went above and beyond to help me and came in an hour earlier than her clinic was scheduled to open just to see them so that I could get them into school. They were professional and very attentive to my needs and might I add she is very thorough and did not rush through my appointment. I love here and she is certainly going to remain the pediatrician for my boys!,This doctor is absolutely precious and very thorough with my two daughters.  She is never in a rush, and she has treated us so well.

Thank u ,Very good,One of the best doctor's office experiences I've ever had. Dr. Maslovaric and staff were extremely helpful and courteous.,Pleasant office and staff. Efficient online appointment scheduling was very convenient.,She is very professional and thorough.  I would highly recommend her to anyone who is looking for a good OBGYN.,Very knowledgeable Very happy with my appointment ,I really lucked out finding her.  I had to an emergency surgery.  I went in a a new patient.  The lady in the front already has all my paperwork I did online.  The nurse called me in right after.  Liz was very sweet and comforting.  She asks to being to water, tea, or coffee.  I was beyond impressed.  Dr. Maalovaric came in and explained in detail everything we were going to do.  I had to have an ultra sound, and it was the first time I had a doctor take the time to show me everything and answer all of my questions.  I had to go into surgery right away.  I was nervous and in pain, but the doctor made me feel so much better.  She is so kind and treated me as if I was her daughter.  Her I meet her that day and she does my surgery that day.  I have never felt so close to a doctor.  I am so glad I picked her over some of the other doctors in ZocDoc.  You can tell that she treats her nurses the same way because they love their job and working with her.  You don't have to look for any doctor.  Dr. MAslovaric will be my doctor for life!  ,She was very personal and seemed to truly care about my questions and well-being. I was impressed.,I can't remember a time when a doctor sat down with me in there office to have a conversation with me about my medical history and concerns that brought me in to see her in the first place.  Dr Maslovaric is personable,  professional and made me feel like my concerns where her concerns.  I feel very comfortable in recommending Dr Maslovaric to anyone looking for an ObGyn,I took a chance and made an appointment with Dr. Maslovaric without a referral and I'm so glad I did. The office staff couldn't be nicer. There was virtually no wait time. Dr. Maslovaric met with me in her office prior to doing my exam, and allowed me to ask any questions I had. I can highly recommend Dr. Maslovaric and her staff.,Being new to the OC area, I was looking for a female OBGYN to become my new doctor. I used ZocDoc to find Dr. Maslovaric and was able to be seen the very next morning. The facility in which her office is located is extremely upscale and technologically advanced. The doctor's suite itself was also very warm, comfortable and well furnished. The front desk receptionist Jamie was super sweet and made me feel very welcome. The medical assistant (forgive me for forgetting her name) was also very sweet, professional and did an overall outstanding job working with me as a new patient. The aspect of my visit that really set it apart from any visit with any doctor before was the meet and greet with Dr. Maslovaric before the examination. I met her beforehand inside her office and was able to discuss my medical history in detail- and in the comfort of my own clothes rather than laying on a cold, plastic bed covered in paper blankets. Furthermore, I could really tell that I was more than just patient #5 to her. Dr. Maslovaric expressed genuine sincerity and made me feel so at ease during the discussion- which made the transition to the exam room easy. Lastly, she listened to my questions and concerns and never pushed me to try a certain medication over another- which has happened to me in the past. I never once felt rushed or that I didn't have the opportunity to inquire more about anything. Overall, I would rate Dr. Maslovaric and her entire staff at 5 Stars and give them an A++ grade for everything! I will definitely continue to see Dr. Maslovaric for all of my needs and can genuinely say that when the time comes, I hope that she will be the doctor to deliver my babies!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,NA","Medical School - University of Southern California,Kaiser Permanente, Residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology,University of California, Irvine (Bachelor’s)","Aetna,Anthem Blue Cross,Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield,,",null,OB-GYN,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/marina-maslovaric-md-facog-54996,"NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA","Rapid Registration,Speedy Response,Scheduling Hero",54996,54996,54996,5.0,5.0,4.71428571429,2017-02-11,0,,104,Doctor,/doctor/marina-maslovaric-md-facog-54996,21,37791,37791,351 Hospital Road,Suite 207,None,Newport Beach,CA,92663,(949) 642-3780,33.626361,-117.929912,-08:00:00,-28800,False,True,153,75,-1,-1

I followed her from her practice at Lankenau, even though it's now close to an hour drive for me, because it is so hard to find a doctor who will really take the time to listen to you and talk to you.

She is not only extremely kind, she's honest in her practice and listens extremely carefully to what you are saying. I felt that she truly understood what I was experiencing and could identify a plan of how I could overcome those issues. ,She was fantastic. Easy to talk to, very thorough and flexible in developing a treatment plan. ,Phenomenal, warm, inviting, and insightful are the 3 words that resonate with me after my visit. She informed me that she wouldn't be able to see me for therapy, but psychiatry, and immediately sought to connect me with someone and encouraged me to call that same day. I appreciated her care and efficiency.,Dr. Turok is very personable and a great listener. Plus, her intake process is very quick and simple. She doesn't require you to jump through more hoops than necessary. ,I've lived in New York for just over a year, and recently began seeing Dr. Turok for ongoing treatment of a condition I have been dealing with for many years. I was concerned about transitioning to a new doctor and how the evaluation would go, but Dr. Turok was very reassuring and quickly put me at ease. We decided to continue the course of treatment that has been effective for several years now, so I'm very satisfied. I'm looking forward to continuing treatment with her!,I could not recommend Dr. Turok more highly.  She is clearly an excellent doctor but also an extremely nice person.  This was my first time at this kind of appointment and although I was a little nervous beforehand, she instantly put me at ease.  It was amazing how quickly she understood exactly how I was feeling and not only reassured me that this was completely ""normal,"" but also that there were so many different ways to go about treating it.  She really works with you to ensure that you are 100% comfortable with whichever option (even if no action) you choose.  She puts absolutely zero pressure on you and explains everything so thrououghly that you feel comfortable making this decision (with her help and guidance).  Considering it was my first time, I couldn't imagine a better experience, and will definitely be going back. ,Dr. Turok is professional and awesome.  I feel comfortable talking to her about the most intimate details of my life.  She really cares about her patients and has the right balance of talking vs. listening.  She really helps me work out my emotions and cope with stresses of life.,She is the bast. ,Amazing doctor. Would highly recommend to anyone! Very personable, very smart and extremely professional. Have had only the best experiences with Dr Turok!,I've been to a few different doctors in town, but Dr. Turok is by far the best doctor I've ever seen.  She really takes the time to listen and shines new light on situations that you might not have had before. She doesn't judge, she's there to help and you can tell.   Through all of my sessions, she was engaging and paid full attention to everything I said. This is a far cry from doctors I have seen in Manhattan who are simply there for the money. I would recommend her to anyone who is serious about getting help. She's amazing. ,Dr. Turok is now my full time psych and I wouldn't have it any other way. She's the best, so friendly and works really hard to help you find what treatment is right for you!,I've seen Dr. Turok twice.  On both visits she spent a great amount of time with me and asked many questions.  I felt well taken care of as to the medication she prescribed, as well to her professional approach to my problem.  I could tell she absolutely loves her work.  She was very knowledgeable, professional and friendly and therefore I would highly recommend her.,Exceptional care. She goes above and beyond to address concerns.,Dr. Turok is not only an attentive listener, but also facilitates engaging discussion in our session and offers insightful feedback to the questions and issues raised. I've been incredibly impressed by her depth of knowledge as well as her affable and professional manner.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,NA","Medical School - Nizhni Novgorod State Medical Academy, Doctor of Medicine,Beth Israel Medical Center, Residency in Psychiatry,Beth Israel Medical Center, Fellowship in Addiction Psychiatry",This doctor is not in any insurance networks.,null,Addiction Specialist,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/alisa-turok-md-59537,"NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","Rapid Registration,Speedy Response,Scheduling Hero",59537,59537,59537,5.0,5.0,4.81578947368,2017-02-11,0,,153,Doctor,/doctor/alisa-turok-md-59537,39,70068,70068,200 West 57th Street,Suite 1310,None,New York,NY,10019,(646) 679-7874,40.7655389,-73.9801001,-05:00:00,-18000,False,True,153,75,-1,-1

Dr. Bhatia is a knowlegeable physician with a conservative approach.

He examined my skin for the issue and asked a lot of questions and was able to tell me exactly what was going on, why it was occurring, and how we would fix it. He was super nice, professional, and mindful of the fact that I don't have health insurance currently. They set me up with a prescription and the nurse provided me with a bag of sample lotions that would help my symptoms as well. I can't recommend this office enough.

A doctor that actually cares about the patient. Very rare find!!!! ,Got right in...
everyone pleasant and I have seen the Dr and the PA. I would recommend both. Getting in on a Friday afternoon was perfect for me as well,Dr. Henwood is the best! She truly cares about my health and takes the time to answer my questions. ,Dr Henwood is thorough.She addressed all my questions and concerns. Professional yet personal. Great staff.

I would definitely recommend her to others. ,Great visit. I don't leave a lot of reviews, but this one was earned. I almost hate recommending them in case they get too popular and busy!

I've recently had a few poor experiences with doctors, when I saw the reviews left for Dr. Henwood I decided to give her a try despite being an hour drive from the practice. Totally worth it. She (and the whole staff) was easy to talk to, listened, and tried to explain things much better than my previous doctors. They were not rushing around, treating you like another appointment to get through. I have a LOT of anxiety about new places and new people, especially doctors where you have to talk about more personal matters, but they did a really great job from the beginning to the end of the whole appointment. I will continue to make the hour long hike to see them over the seeing the doctors again near me.,I like how nice Dr. Henwood is, but still at the same time very much on point, very straightforward and to the point.  She gave a brief explanation of what she was doing and why or how it correlated to something else and then did it.  She got her point across on an even keeled manner.  I like that she is not too high energy and not too much of a warm drink of water; she is perfect balance.  Things seem to get done immediately.,This is my 1st visit with Dr Henwood. She listens well and is thorough. Happy to find her. ,Wonderful visit!!!,Thorough, listens well, informative, enthused, and caring, as always.  Dr. Henwood-Dahdah is the best.  ,Excellent service.

,Everyone was super friendly and courteous. The office was impeccably clean. The wait time was not long at all. By far, the best doctor's office I've ever been to! And very convenient to my workplace so that's definitely another huge plus,Dr. Gohar was very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. His entire team was quick and efficient - highly recommend! ,Truly and honestly one of the greatest decisions I have ever made was to give this place a shot. I was in a dire search to find a gynecologist due to some personal issues (mind you, it's my first time ever going to an OB-GYN, so I had no prior experience.) I found this place through a co-worker who raved about her FABULOUS experience and how much she loved this place, and so I then gave it a shot. Why not!

I was a few minutes late because you have to take the Q23 bus towards Elmhurst, but I walked in and the ambiance was breath taking. SO NOT your typical mediocre/ehh clinics that are usually within Queens. Walking into this place was like walking into a spa-like entrance, very calm, very high tech, very NYC vibe. The receptionists was nice and situated me in right away. The bathroom, omg, it was so high tech with their Japanese toilet with heated seat lol. (can you tell I was just in complete awe? lol) Anyway, the ambiance, the amazing assistance, and the high tech machines are just a bonus added to THE amazing doctor Gohar. He was calm, straightforward, very detailed, and NON-judgmental! Everything that I was looking for in a gynecologist. He is a total opposite of what I had experienced with previous ob-gyns. Dr. Gohar does not push anything to you that you don't need or don't want to do, like I said, he is not judgmental at all. He lets YOU be in control and just guides you, that's what I prefer with my doctors. The wait took quite a long time due to the fact that the ultra sound technician was sick and so the doctor had to do it himself but I didn't mind because they check in on you and let's you be aware of the progress. Also the assistance were funny, they had me laughing! Give this place a shot, you won't regret it!

The office is also one of the nicest offices I've ever been to--very clean and modern.,Dr. Gohar is very empathetic, caring and nurturing - things that are incredibly necessary in a doctor, specially in this area of expertise. ,Very informative and caring.

He is a very thorough doctor and takes the time to learn about his patients. The staff there are pretty awesome.

Overall I had a good experience and I will be going back. ,The entire staff was very welcoming and friendly. They really take their time with you. Dr. Gohar was extremely comforting and really listened to me. I was not sure if switching from my doctor after 6 years was the right thing to do but after my visit I am 100% sure that I am making the right decision. I am very happy with Dr. Gohar and the the entire staff!,He's an amazing doctor ! He makes me feel

From the front desk receptionist whom was so nice and sweet, to the nurses and ultra sound techs, they were ALL sweet and made me feel very comfortable. I am not a fan of male ob-gyn but that have changed upon meeting Dr Gohar, his bedside manner is amazing, he spoke to me and my partner very warmly and made us feel very comfortable. he went over my full medical history in great detail, never did I feel rushed.

This is my first pregnancy and from the moment he walked into the examination room I felt very comfortable with him. He is friendly, has excellent bedside manner, is very thorough in his examination, and takes the time to sit with you and  go over everything you need to know and answer questions.   He does not rush. The office is very clean and it is also very sleek and modern.  The nurses were all very friendly and helpful. The office manager actually took the time to review my insurance plan the day that I booked my first appointment and called to follow up with me to confirm that they accepted my insurance and laid out all the details with my deductible and what each visit would cost me until my deductible was met. I've actually never had any doctor experience that was this transparent, and it was a breath of fresh air. I'm going to be spending a lot of time with Dr. Gohar and his staff in the next few months, and I know I made the right decision. I would highly recommend them. ,Dr. Gohar is a one of a kind!  He is extremely caring and attentive!  The office staff is also superb.  I delivered my son with him and I am extremely grateful for his support and expertise.  Dr. Gohar is one of those doctors that you rarely find nowadays!

His approach made what could have been an uncomfortable appointment very easy. Highly, highly recommend.,Absolutely amazing!!!! I usually don't comment on these rating reviews. But, anyone that needs a GYN doctor Here in queens well I'll say NYC area definitely has to experience what I experienced today.. Let me start by saying as u walk in, the office is totally clean and beautifully decor. As well as a pleasant place, while waiting and filling out all your paper work u can serve yourself some fresh cut strawberry & lime water (delish) nice and chilled... Oh wait and can I tell you ladies the bathroom has a heated toilet :D yes I said HEATed TOILET SEAT!!! I got there half hour prior to my appointment time and I was seen right after I finished all my paperwork... The staff starting from the receptionist to the nurse was just PERFECT.

Not to mention, he is very personable and is very easy on the eyes surprisingly a plus! ,The entire staff was friendly and courteous. Very modern office and equipment. Dr has great bedside manner and is very knowledgeable. Did not feel rushed at all, all of our questions were answered willingly. Parking is not so great in the area, that's the only downside, but we managed to find parking close by.,This is by far the best OBGYN office I have ever used.  The staff is polite and efficient.  I've been coming for a long time and Dr. Soukkary used to be my doctor.  Dr. Gohar is just as phenomenal - he always takes time to listen to my concerns, and takes strides to really involve me in my care.  I had been trying to concieve for a while, and just got pregnant with his help!!  If you also have fertility issues, please consider Dr. Gohar.  He is very knowledgeable, very organized and very thorough. ,By far the best Doctor that i have seen in a long time. We need more doctors like that, very understanding takes his time with you, doesn't make you feel just like another number. ,Dr. Gohar made me feel very comfortable. His bedside manner was excellent, very professional. I'm so happy I found such a great gynecologist. The staff was great and very friendly as well. From start to finish my appointment was very pleasant. I would definitely recommend Dr. Gohar. ,I came across Dr. Gohar after a friend of mine delivered with him and couldn't stop raving about him.   She would always say how lucky she felt with him.  After having a pretty brash and abrasive doc with my last pregnancy, I now see the difference.  My hubby and I are still trying to get pregnant again but after doing my annual with Dr. Gohar, I have no doubt who I'm doing it with.  He is sooo calm and knowledgeable.  There is the generic ""customer service"" you get at the big hospitals and clinics and then there is the truly truly personalized care that you get with Dr. Gohar! He not only calls you with any abnormal results but also makes it a point to email you normal labs so you don't have to worry!  That he delivers at one of the best rated hospitals in NY (Mt. Sinai Roosevelt) for delivering babies is like the final cherry on top!,Great doctor, easy to talk to, really cared and listened. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a doctor one the upper east side or in forest hills! ,Dr Gohar was very easy to talk to about a difficult situation and he made me feel at ease the whole time. He discussed a range of options with me and allowed me to choose the next step. I would highly recommend Dr Gohar.,One of the kindest and most thoughtful doctors I've ever seen in my life!,Very profession and very thorough. Listened to all of my concerns. Explained every step of the exam in detail and was very open for questions. ,What a find! I booked with Dr. Gohar after a friend told me what a great surgeon he was known to be.  I found his bedside manner to be incredible as well! I also found him to be very warm, patient and genuine, I was sold immediately and he didn’t disappoint.  His office seems to really make it a point to book things in a way so that patients don’t have to wait long.  I think I found the best ob/gyn in the city!  ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0","Medical School - Cairo University Faculty of Medicine, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery,Georgia Regents University, Residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology,Nassau University Medical Center, Internship in Obstetrics and Gynecology",,null,Gynecologist,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/james-a-gohar-md-76428,"(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","Rapid Registration,See You Again,Scheduling Hero",76428,76428,76428,5.0,5.0,4.50666666667,2017-02-11,1,,104,Doctor,/doctor/james-a-gohar-md-76428,72,47658,47659,20 E 74th Street,(& Madison Ave),None,New York,NY,10021,(212) 988-2111,40.7731663,-73.9648578,-05:00:00,-18000,False,True,153,75,-1,-1

,Everyone was super friendly and courteous. The office was impeccably clean. The wait time was not long at all. By far, the best doctor's office I've ever been to! And very convenient to my workplace so that's definitely another huge plus,Dr. Gohar was very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. His entire team was quick and efficient - highly recommend! ,Truly and honestly one of the greatest decisions I have ever made was to give this place a shot. I was in a dire search to find a gynecologist due to some personal issues (mind you, it's my first time ever going to an OB-GYN, so I had no prior experience.) I found this place through a co-worker who raved about her FABULOUS experience and how much she loved this place, and so I then gave it a shot. Why not!

I was a few minutes late because you have to take the Q23 bus towards Elmhurst, but I walked in and the ambiance was breath taking. SO NOT your typical mediocre/ehh clinics that are usually within Queens. Walking into this place was like walking into a spa-like entrance, very calm, very high tech, very NYC vibe. The receptionists was nice and situated me in right away. The bathroom, omg, it was so high tech with their Japanese toilet with heated seat lol. (can you tell I was just in complete awe? lol) Anyway, the ambiance, the amazing assistance, and the high tech machines are just a bonus added to THE amazing doctor Gohar. He was calm, straightforward, very detailed, and NON-judgmental! Everything that I was looking for in a gynecologist. He is a total opposite of what I had experienced with previous ob-gyns. Dr. Gohar does not push anything to you that you don't need or don't want to do, like I said, he is not judgmental at all. He lets YOU be in control and just guides you, that's what I prefer with my doctors. The wait took quite a long time due to the fact that the ultra sound technician was sick and so the doctor had to do it himself but I didn't mind because they check in on you and let's you be aware of the progress. Also the assistance were funny, they had me laughing! Give this place a shot, you won't regret it! 

,Dr. Gohar is very professional and makes you feel extremely comfortable. He explains everything thoroughly, so you can be sure to understand all of your options. The office is also one of the nicest offices I've ever been to--very clean and modern.,Dr. Gohar is very empathetic, caring and nurturing - things that are incredibly necessary in a doctor, specially in this area of expertise. ,Very informative and caring. Definitely concerned about patient's care above anything else.,At first I was a bit nervous about having a male doctor checking me but Dr. Gohar made me feel comfortable. He is a very thorough doctor and takes the time to learn about his patients. The staff there are pretty awesome. All very nice and respectable and make you feel more than comfortable while you are there! Also the office is very nice. Overall I had a good experience and I will be going back. ,The entire staff was very welcoming and friendly. They really take their time with you. Dr. Gohar was extremely comforting and really listened to me. I was not sure if switching from my doctor after 6 years was the right thing to do but after my visit I am 100% sure that I am making the right decision. I am very happy with Dr. Gohar and the the entire staff!,He's an amazing doctor ! He makes me feel
Comfortable!,The doctor and staff were extremely kind, professional, and thorough! I've been looking for a great GYN for a while now and I think I finally found one. ,the office is very comfortable and pleasing.

I honestly don't have one complaint which is really rare these days.,I was so impressed by my experience. Dr Gohar is now officially my ob/gyn,Very professional.,I have nothing but amazing things to say about Dr Gohar and his office staff. From the front desk receptionist whom was so nice and sweet, to the nurses and ultra sound techs, they were ALL sweet and made me feel very comfortable. I am not a fan of male ob-gyn but that have changed upon meeting Dr Gohar, his bedside manner is amazing, he spoke to me and my partner very warmly and made us feel very comfortable. he went over my full medical history in great detail, never did I feel rushed. He was even nice enough to translate to my partner when he didn't fully understand everything. A+ for that. This is an amazing Dr and am so glad that I found him. An office is nothing without the front desk, and the medical assistants etc, and they all went above and beyond. Amazing staff. Thank you everyone for making me feel comfortable.

This is my first pregnancy and from the moment he walked into the examination room I felt very comfortable with him. He is friendly, has excellent bedside manner, is very thorough in his examination, and takes the time to sit with you and  go over everything you need to know and answer questions.   He does not rush. The office is very clean and it is also very sleek and modern.  The nurses were all very friendly and helpful. The office manager actually took the time to review my insurance plan the day that I booked my first appointment and called to follow up with me to confirm that they accepted my insurance and laid out all the details with my deductible and what each visit would cost me until my deductible was met. I've actually never had any doctor experience that was this transparent, and it was a breath of fresh air. I'm going to be spending a lot of time with Dr. Gohar and his staff in the next few months, and I know I made the right decision. I would highly recommend them. ,Dr. Gohar is a one of a kind!  He is extremely caring and attentive!  The office staff is also superb.  I delivered my son with him and I am extremely grateful for his support and expertise.  Dr. Gohar is one of those doctors that you rarely find nowadays!  Highly recommended!,Staff was very nice, everyone explained everything thoroughly and made me feel comfortable, place was very clean, didn't have to wait at all, and the doctor was great! He was extremely thorough, asked questions to find out specific things, and went over everything with me! Great place! Would recommend to anyone. ,My first visit to Dr. G- awesome experience- friendly n warm staff . Minimal wait time n Dr. G was great,Great patient care. Immaculate office.

Dr. Gohar was great took his time to answer all my questions very professional.  You know when someone is good at what they do it shows,  everyone at this office is the BEST ., ,I was extremely inpressed by the quality if care i received. Dr Gohar has convient hours, and everything you need is already on hand at his office. His staff is polite and kind. I am the type to do background research before going to the doctor. He is the only doctor i have ever had that respected my intelligence and listened to what i thought and wanted. He gave good information without condescending or dumbing things down. His approach made what could have been an uncomfortable appointment very easy. Highly, highly recommend.,Absolutely amazing!!!! I usually don't comment on these rating reviews. But, anyone that needs a GYN doctor Here in queens well I'll say NYC area definitely has to experience what I experienced today.. Let me start by saying as u walk in, the office is totally clean and beautifully decor. As well as a pleasant place, while waiting and filling out all your paper work u can serve yourself some fresh cut strawberry & lime water (delish) nice and chilled... Oh wait and can I tell you ladies the bathroom has a heated toilet :D yes I said HEATed TOILET SEAT!!! I got there half hour prior to my appointment time and I was seen right after I finished all my paperwork... The staff starting from the receptionist to the nurse was just PERFECT. Professional to the T. And, last but not least Dr. GOHAR makes u feel so comfortable like if you knew him for years. I can't not complain of my first visit.. Definitely looking forward to my new GYN doctor experience... ,Great first visit. Beautiful, clean office, and very professional, kind doctor.

He is very through in his treatment and dont want to leave anything for a chance. my wifes delivery was smooth and without any hiccups. ,I was skeptical at first about having a male gynecologist, but Dr. Gohar is probably the most amazing gynecologist in the queens area. He was very easy to talk to and very understanding about my concerns. My visit went so well that I can definitely say I will be going back to him. Not to mention, he is very personable and is very easy on the eyes surprisingly a plus! ,The entire staff was friendly and courteous. Very modern office and equipment. Dr has great bedside manner and is very knowledgeable. Did not feel rushed at all, all of our questions were answered willingly. Parking is not so great in the area, that's the only downside, but we managed to find parking close by.,This is by far the best OBGYN office I have ever used.  The staff is polite and efficient.  I've been coming for a long time and Dr. Soukkary used to be my doctor.  Dr. Gohar is just as phenomenal - he always takes time to listen to my concerns, and takes strides to really involve me in my care.  I had been trying to concieve for a while, and just got pregnant with his help!!  If you also have fertility issues, please consider Dr. Gohar.  He is very knowledgeable, very organized and very thorough. ,By far the best Doctor that i have seen in a long time. We need more doctors like that, very understanding takes his time with you, doesn't make you feel just like another number. ,Dr. Gohar made me feel very comfortable. His bedside manner was excellent, very professional. I'm so happy I found such a great gynecologist. The staff was great and very friendly as well. From start to finish my appointment was very pleasant. I would definitely recommend Dr. Gohar. ,I came across Dr. Gohar after a friend of mine delivered with him and couldn't stop raving about him.   She would always say how lucky she felt with him.  After having a pretty brash and abrasive doc with my last pregnancy, I now see the difference.  My hubby and I are still trying to get pregnant again but after doing my annual with Dr. Gohar, I have no doubt who I'm doing it with.  He is sooo calm and knowledgeable.  There is the generic ""customer service"" you get at the big hospitals and clinics and then there is the truly truly personalized care that you get with Dr. Gohar! He not only calls you with any abnormal results but also makes it a point to email you normal labs so you don't have to worry!  That he delivers at one of the best rated hospitals in NY (Mt. Sinai Roosevelt) for delivering babies is like the final cherry on top!,Great doctor, easy to talk to, really cared and listened. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a doctor one the upper east side or in forest hills! ,Dr Gohar was very easy to talk to about a difficult situation and he made me feel at ease the whole time. He discussed a range of options with me and allowed me to choose the next step. I would highly recommend Dr Gohar.,One of the kindest and most thoughtful doctors I've ever seen in my life!,Very profession and very thorough. Listened to all of my concerns. Explained every step of the exam in detail and was very open for questions. ,What a find! I booked with Dr. Gohar after a friend told me what a great surgeon he was known to be.  I found his bedside manner to be incredible as well! I also found him to be very warm, patient and genuine, I was sold immediately and he didn’t disappoint.  His office seems to really make it a point to book things in a way so that patients don’t have to wait long.  I think I found the best ob/gyn in the city!  ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0","Medical School - Cairo University Faculty of Medicine, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery,Georgia Regents University, Residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology,Nassau University Medical Center, Internship in Obstetrics and Gynecology",,null,Gynecologist,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/james-a-gohar-md-76428,"(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","Rapid Registration,See You Again,Scheduling Hero",76428,76428,76428,5.0,5.0,4.50666666667,2017-02-11,1,,104,Doctor,/doctor/james-a-gohar-md-76428,72,47658,47658,108-16 63rd Road,None,None,Forest Hills,NY,11375,(718) 897-5331,40.7342579,-73.84952,-05:00:00,-18000,False,True,153,75,-1,-1

On the very day of my appointment, I got an automated call reminding me that it was time to schedule an appointment......ridiculous!!!,I was taken in within a few minutes.

Also very thorough. ,I have never had such a caring, informed, thoughtful, sensitive, intelligent doctor consultation in 47 years. ,Dr. Boroniec was super friendly and a great listener. She provided me with excellent care and I felt very comfortable with her.,I really like Dr. Boroniec and her staff and would recommend her to anyone.  Very friendly and willing to listen.  Unfortunately, I had to move to Denver, CO and have to try to find another doctor :(,She talks to you like a friend would. Very good advice too. I'm a habitual mistruster of doctors so know that it means a lot when I say I trust her completely.,Dr. Boroniec was friendly and helpful.  I would definitely visit her again.,Dr. Boroniec was wonderful. Sympathetic, patient, optimistic, a great listener and communicator. I was very pleased with my appointment.

However, the intake process was quite painful. I was told to stand next to a phone to wait for a phone call from a pre-registration staff member, and ended up waiting for 15 minutes. When I finally got the call, the staffer was confused about why I was supposed to speak with her (how was I supposed to know?). The wait was also too long.,Jillian was very attentive and thorough. She took the time to listen to my concerns and made me feel comfortable.,Dr. Jillian Boroniec was very friendly, patient and genuine. She listened carefully to my concerns and answered all my questions. I feel like I can trust her even though today was only my first visit. ,My visit with Dr. Boroniec was great, she made me feel comfortable.  ,I've been looking for a new primary care physician for a while, and I'm so glad I found Dr. Boroniec.  Her bedside manner is impeccable, she's funny, kind, and personable, and most important, she's extremely compassionate and competent.  Some doctors can make you feel rushed during an appointment, but she takes the time to make you really feel cared for.  I've already recommended her to several of my friends!,It was a good visit. She had a nice medical student shadowing her and I believe it is positive to want to mentor others. I did not feel rushed by the doctors, but I did cut our time short because I had to wait so long to be seen.,Compassionate, knowledgeable, accommodating and overall wonderful!  ,All of the office staff, from the receptionist, to nurse, to the doctor, were all extremely welcoming and calming. They took their time during my appointment, answered all my questions and asked relevant ones without judgement. She was then very thorough in her follow through and was clear with what I had to do next.

After my husband's appointment, I went in.  This was my first visit with a Chiropractor.  Dr. Triandos started off with explaining what Chiropractors do, and asked me why I was in to see him.  I explained my back story (no pun intended), and without interrupting or presuming to know why I was in there, he told me what he suspected was the issue, and showed it to me using a model spine.  He then put me at ease and asked me along the way if I was comfortable and if I had any questions or concerns.  I didn't have any, but if I did, I would have felt comfortable asking him.  He was very personable, with excellent bedside manner.  While he was doing the adjustments, he explained what he was doing, why he was doing it, and what I would feel afterwards.  He's a magician - I felt like a whole new person afterwards!  I set up a follow up appointment and I'm looking forward to a treatment that will work for my back issues.,He diagnosed and fixed a shoulder injury that I didn't know I had.  I have previously dislocated my left shoulder, but didn't realize it hadn't set properly.

Dr. Arash really evaluated me and gave me some exercises to work on strengthening my mid-back and bettering my posture. Really nice guy and knows what he's doing - took his time making sure i was even and aligned. Will definitely be back!,Dr. Noor was excellent, I could barely walk when I came in and when I left, I was feeling great.  He diagnosed the problem, explained what could be causing the problem, did some corrections and showed me so exercises that could help.  I would recommend him to anybody.,Dr. Arash is by far the best chiropractor I have been to.,My first visit with Dr. Noor couldn't have been better! His office was nice and his staff was super friendly. Dr. Noor was very informative and I felt he cared about my health. He is most definitely someone I will continue to work with and someone I highly recommend! When I left his office, I felt like a million bucks. ,I am typically not a huge fan of Chiropractors but Dr Noor completely changed my perspective on them today.  The visit was easy and I didn't feel like he gave me the generic mumbo jumbo script most doctors without personalities give because they do not know how to socialize with humans. 

It was also not a turn and burn, he took his time and fully explained to me everything that I wasn't too sure about.  

Overall great experience and I highly recommend him.   ,Very knowledgeable and wasted no time in getting straight to the point. Even the after treatment treatment was over and above. Love that massage chair. 
,Excellent experience with Dr. Noor.  He is welcoming, attentive and professional.  The office is efficient and courteous.  While waiting for your appointment you can use two massage chairs which are terrific.  ,I have been treated by several Chiropractors before and this was my first visit with Dr. Noor. After a thorough consultation and the recommended treatments for my ailing concern Dr. Noor proceeded to work on my body. He used his hands on me to administer full body adjustments as well as applying his contemporary accessories. Soon afterward,  I did find satisfying relief and felt much better. I realize it's going to take several treatments to improve and to help manage my problems.  I found Dr.Noor to be extremely good with his practice and highly recommend him to anyone whom is seeking to find an excellent, knowledgeable and talented Chiropractor.   Needless to say without hesitation, I scheduled my next appointment. ,I've been coming to Dr. Noor for a little over a year. I've gone to many other doctors, and Dr. Noor was the only one to figure out what was wrong with my hips. 

Not only does he provide chiropractic treatment, he also does physical therapy to make my hips stronger and prevent my hip injury from happening again. I don’t usually write reviews because I’m a professional athlete, but Dr. Noor deserves one! 

The doctor also has amazing massage chairs that he puts me in to make sure I'm comfortable while I'm waiting and is always making sure I am okay. 

Sometimes Saturday's are busy, but what other doctor is open on Saturday's? I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Noor because he took his time with me and will do whatever it takes to get my back to how it used to be. 
,Very impressed! ,Best doctor ever. Super knowlegable, understanding, listens, and addresses the issue at hand. 

He also has amazing massage chairs to sit in while you wait to be seen. The office is really cool.,Dr. Noor is awesome!,Arash is great!  I showed up a little early and was seen straight away, and I left feeling better... Both physically because of the adjustment and also mentally because of the exercises he taught me.  I'll be coming back after completing the exercises to continue progressing towards a straight back!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0","Cleveland Chiropractic College, Los Angeles,California State University, Northridge (Bachelor’s),California State University, Northridge, Master’s in Biology",,null,Chiropractor,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/arash-noor-dc-89728,"(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient)","Rapid Registration,Speedy Response,Scheduling Hero",89728,89728,89728,5.0,5.0,4.88888888889,2017-02-11,1,,153,Doctor,/doctor/arash-noor-dc-89728,24,53341,53341,12304 Santa Monica Blvd,#322,None,Los Angeles,CA,90025,(310) 207-2020,34.0390002,-118.4652064,-08:00:00,-28800,False,True,153,75,-1,-1

Upon my first visit he quickly diagnosed exactly what was wrong with my back, and took the time to explain it to me using books and graphs in the office. Throughout the last 3 months of me attending his office he has always been prompt, efficient and thorough. Additionally, he is a warm, genuine person who puts me at ease as he goes through my adjustments. My pain level has decreased ENORMOUSLY. I went from being in tears because of the constant and intense neck pain down to nearly zero.

The office staff are all incredibly nice and efficient in scheduling. The office itself is bright, clean and spacious. A few days of the week Dr. Wong brings in a massage therapist as an added extra bonus for his patients. 

I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Wong to anyone suffering any kind of pain!,It was excellent! Dr. Wong is very personable, knowledgeable, and was able to alleviate some of my extreme lower back pain during my first visit. I continue to see him now because of his great skills and bedside manner. Four visits in and my back has improved extraordinarily. He even had Tempur-pedic pillows in stock 
(that he didn't pressure me to purchase), which improved my neck and shoulder pain immediately.,Dr. Wong is a thorough, friendly, knowledgeable and caring doctor!,Very comfortable,Very knowledgable, patient,professional and explained conditions in details. Felt that he understood my problems and I looked forward to next treatment with him.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,NA","New York Chiropractic College, Doctor of Chiropractic Medicine,National Naval Medical Center (Fellowship),State University of New York, Buffalo (Bachelor’s)",,null,Chiropractor,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/james-wong-dc-90792,"(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA","Rapid Registration,See You Again,Speedy Response",90792,90792,90792,5.0,4.97297297297,4.95945945946,2017-02-11,1,,153,Doctor,/doctor/james-wong-dc-90792,72,53819,53819,115 W 45th St.,Suite 301,None,New York,NY,10036,(212) 922-9200,40.75731,-73.9831997,-05:00:00,-18000,False,True,153,75,-1,-1

I was supposed to be her first patient and they scheduled 3 ahead of me.,Dr. Langenburg was wonderful, the wait time over 1.5 hours was to long, when my appointment was booked they did not book me for a new visit, so she didn't get to spend as much time with me as typical, however she was thorough in the time alotted.The office broke Hippa violation by contacting my work, at a desk phone I never use and told one of my co-workers a had an appointment for Friday, please press one if you plan to keep that appt.? So my co-worker pressed one and came over to tell my I have an Dr. Appointment with Dr. Langenburg. I never gave anyone that number nor have I ever called Dr. Langenburg on that phone so....not sure the connection.,Dr. Langenburg explains everything to me so that I can really understand my health and options. She has a very pleasant manner and is very considerate.,She is pleasant, cheerful and very, very honest about treatment options.  ,Amazing doctor that makes you fell like you are her only patient!  ,She listened intently and was very kind, thoughtful and understanding. ,I was very disappointed with the wait time but the doctor was excellent she explained everything to me very well and so I could understand what she was saying.,My visit was great. My health care provider is professional and kind and knowledgeable. I know that she is considerate and makes sure she gets all your concerns and questions answered which may be why her visits take so much time.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0","Medical School - University of Virginia,Centra, Residency in Family Practice,University of Detroit Mercy (Bachelor’s)","Aetna,Blue Cross Blue Shield,Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan,,",null,Family Physician,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/lisa-langenburg-md-91878,"NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA","Rapid Registration,See You Again,Speedy Response,Scheduling Hero",91878,91878,91878,5.0,5.0,3.77142857143,2017-02-11,0,,153,Doctor,/doctor/lisa-langenburg-md-91878,32,54175,54175,37399 Garfield Rd.,Suite 203,None,Clinton Township,MI,48036,(586) 228-2911,42.571813,-82.951972,-05:00:00,-18000,False,True,153,75,-1,-1

Would recommend her to use!,I think Dr. Pychynski, is an excellent neurologist, caring and works really hard to listen to those that come into her office.  I'm excited to have her as a physician.,Very friendly, she listens and takes her time., The doctor is very friendly and kind and compassionate .  I have search for a long time to find a Doctor Who really really cares that means so much when you were Ill.,Dr. Pychynski was one of the best doctors I've ever been to. She listened to me for as long as I wanted to talk and asked all the right follow-up questions. She provided me with multiple options for treatment, and even while suggesting one to start with, she took the time to make sure that I was comfortable with it before proceeding. Her physical exam was very thorough, and she went over my MRI results with me very carefully. She was kind and caring, and I felt like she was open to my input as well. I would strongly recommend her!,She was very thorough in addressing my health, good at listening and describing processes, and very considerate.,She's amazing!!!  She actually discusses the best course of treatment for you with you!!!! ,very nice very friendly very helpful great doctor,Dr. Pychynski was very friendly and professional. She listened to what I had to say and that meant a lot. When she explained things to me, she did so in a manner that I could understand. I didn't feel like she was rushing through my appointment, trying to get me out of the door.

My only complaint - I used Zoc Doc and filled out the lengthy paper work online. When I arrived at the office I was told that my paperwork didn't come through. I felt that the front desk should have contacted me so that I could have arrived a bit earlier (and I was 15 minutes early). There were two front desk employees and one seemed like she had an attitude when I told her that I had already filled out the paperwork.

Anyway, I liked the doctor. I would recommend her so far. I have nerve testing soon.,Dr. Pychynski was professional, friendly, and actually allowed me to talk.  I live two hours from her office, so she is scheduling several tests with her on the same day!  I am so thankful for this.  I was a nurse for 25 years, and know a great Dr. when I see one.  I can't tell how worth driving two hours to see her is.,I felt respected, listened to, cared about and even when I had questions Dr. Pychynski tried very hard to explain.  I feel she was concerned after learning many of the initial screening tests had never been done on my entire body.  I did not understand many things she was asking me to perform during the initial neurology consultation but she was willing to explain in as much detail as possible the reasoning behind the task.  I felt her front office staff was caring, understanding and willing to assist me make corrections on my patient record.  I can not wait to find out more about my neurological concerns upon my next appointment.  Thanks!!,It was great she was really understanding more helpful then my other doctor that I had she's actually trying to help me get my headaches under control instead of my other doctor that was just giving me medicine and say just try these out with I was on the same medication for four years and didn't do anything so yes I would most defently go back to doctor Phchynski she is a wonderful doctor ,Dr. Pychynski was very professional. She was able to efficiently and effectively diagnose my issue and was quite helpful. ,Great! She is the best neurologist I have ever seen! ,Dr. Pychynski was very thorough and warm. She really cares and knows her stuff. Very attentive to the problem and offered multiple solutions. I recommend her services! ,Thorough and knowledgeable. ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0","Medical School - Xavier University School of Medicine, Aruba,Norwalk Hospital, Residency in Internal Medicine,Georgia Regents University, Residency in Neurology",,null,Neurologist,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/dagmara-pychynski-md-94971,"(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient)","Rapid Registration,Speedy Response,Scheduling Hero",94971,94971,94971,5.0,4.90476190476,4.66666666667,2017-02-11,0,,153,Doctor,/doctor/dagmara-pychynski-md-94971,21,55505,55505,6830 Hospital Dr,Suite 104,None,Baltimore,MD,21237,(410) 918-0111,39.347842,-76.475442,-05:00:00,-18000,False,True,153,75,-1,-1

,He is a great doctor very thorough and good clinical judgment. Being a doctor having seen many specialists myself he reminds me of some of the strong physicians I had the opportunity to learn from and work with. Recommend him highly!,It was a first visit of general exam. The process was smooth and questions were answered well.,He is so kind and thoughtful. It was a pleasure to go see him for a checkup. ,His staff is very friendly and he is hilarious! Very good service! 100% recommend!,Dr. Ooi was very kind and professional ophthalmologist. He was very friendly and explaining everything clearly and patiently. Highly recommend him.,He's a very smart doctor, and very personable.,Dr. Ooi is fantastic. Very professional, friendly, and takes time to explain every aspect of the exam. His office staff was less than pleasant, unfortunately. The staff member who did the pre-exam tests didn't explain what she was doing, which put me on edge, and she seemed rushed and irritated. Dr. Ooi made up for any customer service issues at the beginning of the appointment, though.,Spent about 5 mins filling in missing info and being ushered into an exam room. After finishing up there I sat for less than 5 mins for the Doctor to see me. His bedside manner was exceptional. At one point I asked him about an issue in my family history and he gave an excellent and thorough explanation for my risk factors, prevention, and warning signs that I should be aware of. He didn't rush me through like some other doctors have in the past. Both he and the staff were personable and professional, and I would highly recommend them.,Professional and fine person,I did a eye exam for contact lens today with Dr. Heo-Jeng Ooi. He is a professional ophthalmologist. During the eye exam, he gave me lots of suggestions and also let me know some basic eye protection info.  ,Very friendly and time punctual.

I will definitely go back.,I had vers good ans clear explanations.,Professional, careful, patient, and attentive!,This is a great office. The team is very helpful and went out of their way to help me with my insurance. The doctor and Becca are great at explaining everything that is going on during the exam and the results. The office is attractively decorated and super clean. ,Extremely friendly and informative staff. The doctor was really nice and explained everything that was happening very clearly.

I've only seen him a few times but my back and neck are finally releasing the stress they've been holding for years, and those areas feel freer and looser. His colleague, Dr. John, and the rest of the care team are also amazing. I plan on seeing them regularly to properly maintain everything in good health!,A friend referred me to Dr. T because of his distinct ability to help people improve using unique and natural techniques. His office is very welcoming, as are his staff--Unisha (sp?), the receptionist is just delightful. My sessions never lasted more than 30 minutes, which is perfect for a lunch time appointment, but I got so much out of them. Unfortunately, I could only afford to see him about four or five times, but my body improved from day one and is still benefiting from those sessions weeks later. His chiropractor, Dr. John, is magical as well. All aspects of my experience were exceptional. Thanks to Dr. Trigiani and Dr. John for helping me.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,NA","Pacific College of Oriental Medicine,New York College of Health Professions (Bachelor's),Pacific College of Oriental Medicine (Master's)",,null,Acupuncturist,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/philip-trigiani-lac-dac-97849,"(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA","Rapid Registration,See You Again",97849,97849,97849,5.0,5.0,5.0,2017-02-11,1,,153,Doctor,/doctor/philip-trigiani-lac-dac-97849,21,56786,90299,32 N Division Street,Ground Floor,None,Peekskill,NY,10566,(917) 514-2833,41.2912052,-73.9200332,-05:00:00,-18000,False,True,153,75,-1,-1

I highly recommend her!   ,She is great and super friendly,She is great and really informative, she does not withhold information,It was informative.,Excellent Doctor, real nice, very attentive an seems to know her job!,Dr. Huffman was great she was highly knowledgeable and I felt so much better after consultation. I would recommend her without hesitation! ,Dr Mary Huffman cares about you and your body. How rare is that? I first met Dr. Huffman back in October, I came in late, exhausted, and stressed. I had a chronic sinus infection that was really getting me down and to top things off I had recently gotten fired from my job and my employer had withheld my paycheck. Needless to say my body was a wreck.

Despite my unraveled disposition, Dr Huffman was sincere and listened to my problems. Before adjusting me she provided a facial massage that really relaxed me. Not only that but she assured me that I wasn't crazy and that I should to go to the Department of Labor to report my employer. After following her business advice, I was able to get what I was owed!

She intuited on the spot that I might have some sort of auto-immune disease. Which, after getting sicker and dealing with medical doctor after medical doctor, I am thinking she is right. 

She sent me home with a list of referrals and while the process of discovering what is exactly wrong with me is exhausting and feels hopeless at times, whenever I work with Dr Huffman my spirits are lifted and I feel like I get actual results. She really does care about your whole system! When I get into a dark place with this mystery illness, seeing her gives me the validation that I am not alone, that people are there to help (advice the medical community should consider). 

Currently, I have been seeing her for acupuncture - and the results are amazing! I have more energy and I am hopeful to be able to get back into to working out and keep my symptoms at bay.,I can speak highly enough abut Dr. Huffman.  
She is extremely professional and will always get you in for an appointment.  She does excellent work and ALWAYS helps me feel so much better!,Dr. Huffman is, without question, one of the most gifted physicians I know and one of the most enjoyable people I have met in any context. I highly recommend Dr. Huffman as an exceedingly competent, skilled doctor that treats patients with dignity and respect.,Dr Huffman is a gifted physician.  She checks everything, asks tons of questions and has great technique.  I have benefited greatly from her treatments and post-appointment exercises to keep me as flexible as I can be.  I strongly recommend Dr Huffman for both muscular and skeletal concerns.

~Ann,Dr. Huffman is a great doctor. She is very professional and extremely sweet! She takes the time to listen to her patients and address their concerns. She is very good at her job and has helped me with countless medical issues. I highly recommend her and have recommended her to all of my friends and family. They have nothing but good things to say about her and the quality of care she provides. ,She was very friendly and showed great concerned for my health. I liked how quickly I was helped and that her appointment schedules varied in timing so I am able to continue seeing her even though I have a tight schedule. ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0","National University of Health Sciences,National University of Health Sciences (Bachelor’s)",,null,Chiropractor,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/mary-huffman-dc-101321,"NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient)","Rapid Registration,See You Again,Speedy Response,Scheduling Hero",101321,101321,101321,5.0,5.0,4.96052631579,2017-02-11,0,,153,Doctor,/doctor/mary-huffman-dc-101321,73,58243,58243,820 W.

He was professional  and seemed genuinely interested.  I highly recommend him.  ,This was my first appointment and I felt so comfortable with Dr Graebe. He truly listened and understood my questions and concerns and I left feeling at ease. ,I'm very pleased I decided to schedule my visit with Dr. Graebe. He is very professional. I didn't feel rushed and my health problems were not dismissed. I'm hopeful that he will be able to help with my problems. This is just the first step so I'm hoping for the best. His staff are wonderful. Highly recommended!,Despite the long wait, Dr. Graebe took the time to sit down with me and discuss any concerns I had in his office before even entering the exam room. As a new patient, I really appreciated this opportunity to warm up to him before the exam. Good personality and talked to me about my health status in lay terms, which is always appreciated. ,Great doc- very nice office staff and office environment, too!  He spends a good amount of time asking questions, listening and providing input.  Highly recommended!,I moved to NJ three years ago and Dr. Graebe has been my third OB/GYN.  Third time's the charm.  His office staff was very sweet and accommodating, the only reason I wasn't seen right away is because I was a new patient and had to fill out paperwork.  Once I was taken back, my BP was taken along with a few more questions and then I went into Dr. Graebe's office where he talked to me about my family history, any concerns I had, etc.  He made me feel very comfortable and had a great bedside manner.  Definitely recommend him!!,Excellent experience.  The Dr. was extremely thorough and quick.  Very happy I found him and plan on staying with him as long as possible.  Highly recommend.,Dr. G  is amazing. So happy I found an OBGYN I can trust. He sits you down in his office for awile and talks to you before your exam. I did not have to wait and he's very patient and understating. The whole staff is really friendly. Please book you will not regret!,It was a great experience!
Dr. Graebe is a great, the staff is excellent too!,Dr. Graebe was great.  We spoke in his office before I stepped foot in his exam room. He was informative and did not rush.   He addressed my concerns and made me feel completely at ease.  I highly recommend. ,By far exceptional service!  Dr Graebe is very thorough and took his time to explain everything.   ,He really listen to me and gave me reassurance. He really took care of me. ,What a surprisingly nice experience! From the friendly nature of the secretary to comfort I felt with Dr. Graebe, I would HIGHLY recommend him anyone. It's no secret that the annual gyno exam can leave one feeling... well, awkward. Most of us want to leave as soon as we can. However, I have to say, I left the office feeling like I had just met a new friend. 
Dr. Graebe is one who will take the time to understand and listen to his patients; providing just the right sense of humor to put his patients at ease. By far my best experience with not only an OB-GYN, but any doctor. :) ,Moved and needed new GYN doctor. Dr. Graebe is just the ticket!,He was very friendly and easy to talk to. He seemed very knowledgable about what he does and answered all my questions very well.,Dr. Graebe had me in and out!

She may well have had a huge, ugly scar, but it looks like his repair will allow her realize the very best outcome we could have hoped for with minimal scaring.,I am so happy I found Dr. Blechman on ZocDoc. I was looking around for a plastic surgeon for about a week and none of them worked out for me. I arrived early for my appointment and didn't have to wait long.

I'm very happy that I made the switch.,Since my doctor retired I feel like I have been floating trying to find the right doctor that had the same ethics, and care for their patients the way he did. I finally feel I found that today with Dr. Russell. She took her time to get to know what was going on, and how to best help me. She was professional, empathetic, and had a wonderful bedside manner. I am so grateful to my friend for referring me to her. I finally feel that I am in good hands again!! ,She,My first visit.. I am impressed!!,She is AMAZING. I couldn't recommend her more!!,Once I was seen, she was very thorough and efficient.  She was personable and made you feel at ease very quickly.  All blood work was done in the office so it made for simple one stop shopping. I was relieved to hear at the end off the appointment (she is out of network) that the office submits medical insurance to your health insurance for you which is another little detail that made my experience the most enjoyable. ,Shereen Russell is a blessing in a field of obgyns who have zero empathy or knowledge.

He clearly knows what he's doing, he minimized the pain as much as possible for the procedure I had to have done, he's extremely competent, and EXTREMELY personable and genuine.  When I've had this done elsewhere, not only did the ingrown return, but other doctors have had to use double the amount of shots to achieve the same numbing effect before beginning the procedure, and those shots are VERY painful because of where they are administered.  He managed to accomplish the same numbing effect with only 4 shots instead of 8, used a cooling spray to minimize that pain as much as possible, and once the actual procedure began (procedure is painless because you are numb), I watched him do it and his work was very neat, efficient, and accurate.  He understands the importance of keeping in mind how the end product will look as well as feel (because I had the procedure done where they permanently remove the side of the nail by killing the root so that it won't grow back as in in-grown again).  This guy knows what he's doing.  He even offered me water while we were waiting for the numbing effect to kick in so that he could begin the procedure.

He will work with your schedule and base your treatment around your specific needs. He doesn't unnecessarily give X-Rays and tends to plan according to how well you respond to treatment versus having a set criteria for everyone. ,I've been twice so far for horrible sciatic pain. The first time, Dale reached out and offered me an earlier appointment so I wouldn't have to wait three more days, and when I arrived I literally did not have to wait at all. The other patients leaving seemed happy, and I see why. I felt very well taken care of, he explained why I have pain and what he was doing to help, and gave me a very reasonable timeline for what to expect. I've left my two appointments with less pain and honestly, he's so friendly and kind and it's very refreshing.By his interactions with other patients, he seems to show interest in their lives. I realize this all sounds like it is too good to be true, but it isn't! So glad I found him, I would trust him anytime with my chiropractic needs. ,Great experience!  This was my first visit to a Chiripractor. Dr. Zuehlke got me right in, performed a consultation, a treatment to alleviate my back pain, and immediately started a corrective program to get my back in alignment.
My back already feels much better!   ,Dr. Dale Zuehlke is absolutely great! I made the appointment through ZocDoc after injuring my lower back, and he was able to get me in that day and even contacted me saying I could come early. He is very personable and truly cares about his patients, so much so he gave me a follow up call to make sure everything was getting better the next day. Overall, really great and glad I found him! ,Dr. Zuehlke was great! He saw me due super last minute over a weekend after I hurt my lower back exercising. He gave me an adjustment and electric stim which almost immediately made the pain decrease. He also gave me his mobile number to contact him if anything should go wrong between then and my next appointment! He comes highly recommended from me.,Never been to a chiropractor before. Great Experience. Felt great leaving the office. ,Dale is very personable and caring, you will not only enjoy your visit but also walk out of there feeling much improved! ,My previous doctor in SF was the team doctor for Saudi Arabian Olympians and I have been having a hard time to fine a good doctor in Chicago. Needless to say that Dr. Zuelker took care of my serious neck pain right away, he was really listening and attentive. I like his nice, cozy office and that I can see the doctor right away, not through a receptionist. It is very important for me to meet a doctor who enjoys his profession and Dr.Zuehlker is the one.,Awesome very personable and experienced ,I have been going to Chiropractors for over 14 years and was a personal Chiropractic assistant for two and a half years, and can easily say that Dr. Zuehlke is one of the best Chiropractors I have ever been to. It is very important for me to find a Chiropractor who understands my body and its needs, and Dr. Zuehlke clearly has an expansive knowledge, experience and expertise in Chiropractic care that he uses to identify your most troubled areas and find the best solution to treat them. ,Dr. Zuehlke is a total pro. He efficiently made adjustments to my back, telling me the whole time what he was doing and why it would be helpful. He is also very friendly and thoughtful--we had gotten to talking about making bread at our first appointment and the next time I went in, he had brought the recipe we had discussed. I would totally recommend Dr. Zuehlke to a friend. ,Dr. Dale was great! He was able to see me right away. Very professional and knowledgeable. He solved my issues right away. I would definitely recommend him to everyone. ,First appointment was great. He started by asking questions to learn more about my situation, gave me an adjustment, and then finished with electric stim. My back literally feels 10x better today. He has a massage therapist that will stretch you out which I'm also looking forward to. ,Dale is excellent. Very great communicator, and his only goal is to get you the best care out there. Very accommodating schedules, and will work with your insurance to make sure that you are getting exactly what you ask for. I had never worked with a chiropractor before, but it is making all the difference. ,No wait time for treatment, walked in and went through process. Very informative on what he was doing and why, filled me in on what his opinion was and made me feel comfortable. Overall good experience and timely on the process. Definitely would recommend if looking for a chiropractor.,Very friendly and personable. Provided thorough explanations of his methodology and practices. All-around a great experience. ,FANTASTIC! CANNOT WAIT TO WORK WITH HIM!,He is so positive, gentle and fun to be with.,Super friendly and helpful,He greeted me as soon as I walked in. He is great! Very professional.,I arrived to my appt a few minutes as early, as I was a new patient, & was greeted by the doctor immediately. He even knew my name before I could tell him! Instantly, the comfort level was there. He asked all of the right questions, and was attentive to me the entire time. A great first experience, and I look forward to having Dale as my new chiropractor. ,Dr. Dale has been great to me! He saw me on very short notice, and his experience shows as he was very quick to figure out my back issue and get me progressing quickly towards a pain free day. He has been a joy to see and work with, and I highly recommend him. ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA","5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0","National University of Health Sciences, Doctor of Chiropractic Medicine",,null,Chiropractor,https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/dale-zuehlke-dc-125710,"(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),(Verified Patient),NA,NA,(Verified Patient),NA,(Verified Patient)","Rapid Registration,See You Again,Speedy Response,Scheduling Hero",125710,125710,125710,5.0,5.0,4.97872340426,2017-02-11,1,,153,Doctor,/doctor/dale-zuehlke-dc-125710,36,68167,68167,561 W Diversey Pkwy,None,None,Chicago,IL,60614,(773) 871-7766,41.9326442,-87.6433802,-06:00:00,-21600,False,True,153,75,-1,-1

He was very thorough and and he has mannerisms that make one quite comfortable as soon as he introduced himself. I would also like to add that I made a 5:00 pm appointment. I called at around 9:50 am and asked for an earlier appointment if they had any cancellation. I was informed that they indeed had an 11:00 am canceling and was given that opening. That helped me with my day's  activities. I am truly thankful. ,Very nice.,She and her staff are very friendly and efficient....listens to your concerns and acts appropriately.,My visit was pleasant. The staff was nice, organized, and caring. She took the time to teach me patiently how to use and handle contact lenses. The appointment was right on time and the clinic is very clean.

My actual visit with the doctor was great. He didn't seem to be in a hurry nor did he rush me through any of the questions. He took the time to really get to know me and my medical history. I felt super comfortable the entire time and I'm really looking forward to returning to Dr. Sobral and his staff. I would definitely recommend this place! ,I wish Dr sobral was my pcp he was very smart, efficient and pleasant. I'm very pleased with the visit I had.I just wish he was my pcp.. 5 stars!,Very personable and extremely helpful.  Didn't feel rushed at all, and was actually quite funny which helped feel relaxed.,I have never had a doctor be so patient and personable before! Dr. Sobral was so kind and made me feel at ease right away, and he does a great job of explaining things in an easy to understand way. ,Super informative and extremely kind as well as caring. Highly recommend Dr. Sobral to anyone! ,Amazing and very thorough.,Dr. Sobral was great! I just went in for an annual exam and he was so friendly and had a good sense of humor while remaining professional.

I felt immediately at ease.  Very thorough consultation, relaxing atmosphere, no pushy high pressure sales pitches to buy produducts or book tons of back to back appointments-  just honest, thoughtful recommendations. I have already recommended the clinic to several coworkers.,Dr. Edwards is great!  The adjustments are fast and professional.  I would highly recommend her for chiropractic treatment.  The office is very clean and the staff is very friendly.,The visit was very professional.  I felt very comfortable with her.  She  did several adjustments and I felt so much better after.  I will see her again.,I loved her style and professionalism.,Dr. Edwards is so unbelievably personable. I had worked for a Chiropractor some years ago and it was a bad experience, so I avoided going to a chiropractor for years. After my husband saw her and raved about her, I thought I would take the plunge. I'm so glad I did. She isn't like other chiropractors. She doesn't order unnecessary x-rays. She doesn't create expensive treatment plans. She works with your insurance company and what it covers to determine the best treatment plan that is also wallet friendly. The service is dynamic in that it includes massage therapy and treatment with the tens unit and rolling table (my absolute favorite). I went it about my posture and she suggested a really low cost and highly effective way of keeping my posture in check that didn't require an uncomfortable back brace. I'm really happy my husband found her and I look forward to my visits with her each week. ,Very friendly and great bedside manner.  Looking forward to my neck and back not hurting anymore.,Very kind and patient. Sometimes wasn't clear about exactly what I was supposed to be doing next in treatments but definitely helped with my pain and discomfort.,She is fantastic! Very smart and very friendly. ,Nicole was super nice and easy to talk to, I'd definitely see her again!,Very satisfied service. My neck pain was improved already after first visit.,My experience was amazing. I have had dull low back pain for over a month now, and it came to a breaking point. So I scheduled a consultation here based on the ratings they had. My wait was not that long at all. I was taken for an evaluation, and she immediately had a plan to get me relief. She put me on Stem and the Rolly table that day, and then adjusted me and worked on some tight muscles. I was treated so well. I can't wait to continue my treatment here. ,She was perfect.

She took xrays of the area where I had pain to ensure there were no major issues.  She diagnosed my problem and explained it in a way that I fully understood and knew what to do to prevent it in the future.  In addition, she's just a very nice person.,Very pleasant and understanding professional.,The Doctors and staff were friendly and knowledgeable.  The office was well kept. I felt immediately at ease.  Very thorough consultation, relaxing atmosphere, no pushy high pressure sales pitches to buy produducts or book tons of back to back appointments-  just honest, thoughtful recommendations. I have already recommended the clinic to several coworkers.,Dr. Edwards is great!  The adjustments are fast and professional.  I would highly recommend her for chiropractic treatment.  The office is very clean and the staff is very friendly.,The visit was very professional.  I felt very comfortable with her.  She  did several adjustments and I felt so much better after.  I will see her again.,I loved her style and professionalism.,Dr. Edwards is so unbelievably personable. I had worked for a Chiropractor some years ago and it was a bad experience, so I avoided going to a chiropractor for years. After my husband saw her and raved about her, I thought I would take the plunge. I'm so glad I did. She isn't like other chiropractors. She doesn't order unnecessary x-rays. She doesn't create expensive treatment plans. She works with your insurance company and what it covers to determine the best treatment plan that is also wallet friendly. The service is dynamic in that it includes massage therapy and treatment with the tens unit and rolling table (my absolute favorite). I went it about my posture and she suggested a really low cost and highly effective way of keeping my posture in check that didn't require an uncomfortable back brace. I'm really happy my husband found her and I look forward to my visits with her each week. ,Very friendly and great bedside manner.  Looking forward to my neck and back not hurting anymore.,Very kind and patient. Sometimes wasn't clear about exactly what I was supposed to be doing next in treatments but definitely helped with my pain and discomfort.,She is fantastic! Very smart and very friendly. ,Nicole was super nice and easy to talk to, I'd definitely see her again!,Very satisfied service. My neck pain was improved already after first visit.,My experience was amazing. I have had dull low back pain for over a month now, and it came to a breaking point. So I scheduled a consultation here based on the ratings they had. My wait was not that long at all. I was taken for an evaluation, and she immediately had a plan to get me relief. She put me on Stem and the Rolly table that day, and then adjusted me and worked on some tight muscles. I was treated so well. I can't wait to continue my treatment here. ,She was perfect. The best chiropractor Ive ever been to.

Kudos to Dr. Awar. I Highly Recommend.,Dr. Awar is a fantastic cardiologist! He has been the only one to question why I have high blood pressure and wants to get to the root of the problem, rather than just handing me some medication and say hope this fixes it! I highly recommend him to everyone! ,The Doctor has a great ""bedside"" manner. He is easy to talk to and wasn't in a rush. I'm very happy with the whole experience and I will be using him going forward.

I highly recommend him.,Although I wasn't seen until 45 minutes past my scheduled appointment time, Dr. Lazarevic was one of the most thorough doctor's I've ever seen. He spent well over an hour with me - asking thoughtful and experienced questions about my condition. As someone who felt like she wasn't being heard by other doctors, Dr. Lazarevic made up for it in spades.

I went with my husband for the first time based on ZocDoc reviews and I was not disappointed. I was called in right away and the staff was very friendly. The Doctor was extremely informative and explained everything very nicely. She went above and beyond and l left her office with a smile on my face. She's very detailed and by the end of her informing me on what I needed to know I couldn't think of one question to ask her. Highly recommended. ,Awesome Doctor! made me feel very comfortable and answered all my questions without judgement.

He made me feel comfortable and at ease.  Explained everything and made it easy for me to ask questions.  I would highly recommend.,He is very sweet and gears your concerns thoroughly,  and answers them. ,He is great!  ,My appointment for Dr Brun was for a colonoscopy / endoscopy.
I waited for about 30 minutes then was prepared for the two procedures. I was done in about 30 minutes, then waited for the anesthesia to wear off.  Meanwhile Dr. Brun discussed the results with me, then I was on my way. HIs professional staff also made the visit pleasant.
 ,Dr. Brun seems very knowledgeable and easily approachable. However, two hours is way too long of a wait for an 8:30 am appointment. 
Also, the restroom in the waiting/reception  area was ATROCIOUS!  It was unclean and there was no paper. Unacceptable for a doctor's office. ,Doctor is very good and I would definitely recommend him,Dr Brun is excellent doctor! Very pleasant, polite and professional. He responded to all my questions. It feels like he really love his job and his patients. Highly recommend him to everyone! 
The wait time was indecently long, but I guess it can happen everywhere and even that didnt spoil my visit to Dr Brun, because he was great. ,Dr. Brun is an excellent doctor who alleviated two problems I had effortlessly. He has an excellent bed side manner, explains everything coherently and takes the time out to answer any and all questions. ,Great Doctor. Explained well and takes the timeout to make you feel welcomed.,My first visit to Dr Alex Brun was a pleasurable one. Dr. Brun  was very attentive when I was talking about my issue. Responded to any and all concerns I had with care and detailed explanations.  Made me feel very comfortable to talk about things that normally are uncomfortable to talk about. He was very professional and well mannered. 
The staff at the reception area were very pleasant and professional as well.  The wait was about 15 minutes or so. 
Over all a five star experience.  I highly recommend Dr. Alexander Brun. ,The wait time was basically none and the was out fairly quickly  can't rush when it comes to your health. ,I had an endoscopy procedure. Dr. Brun Is definitely very knowledgable and professional! He is also  polite, conscientious and thorough in his work! The office is very clean and neat, the staff is very attentive and responsive. The  wait was only about 5-7 minutes. I am very happy with this experience, and would definitely recommend Dr Brun to all my friends. ,The whole staff was pretty nice. The wait time sucks a little, because you end up waiting about 30 mins or more. But Dr.  Brun was great. I would def recommend seeing him. ,Dr.Brun is excellent,He is really a good doctor.

-jason v,Dr. Poonawalla was excellent.  I'm sure it was good timing but I was able to be seen for a same-day appointment with the doctor.  I arrived a bit early and was taken before my appointment time even started.  I was in and out for my procedure in less than 20 minutes.  Dr. Poonawalla made great conversation, was extremely friendly and personable.  I felt confident in her clinical assessment of my condition and her treatment plan.  I felt no pain and was treated professionally my entire visit.  Highly recommend Dr. Poonawalla and her staff.,Dr Poonawalla was so friendly and down to earth, she put me right at ease! She helped me right away with what I came in for as well as discussed some options regarding related conditions that we can follow up on in the future. She ACTUALLY LISTENED to me instead of just brushing me off immediately with whatever she'd already decided, as medical professionals often do. I was so happy with actually going to the doctor and feeling like a human being. 5 stars for Dr Poonawalla!,The office staff were friendly and helpful.?Dr. Poonawalla was great! Addressed my main concern and saw me in a timely manner,I felt very safe and comfortable with her. ,Dr. Tasneem Poonawalla is amazing, very friendly and she knows what she is doing her staff is friend and her assistant was very kind as well.

Dr. Boguslavsky is originally from Russia and at  young age moved to New Jersey where he not only attended medical school but established his medical practice.  Dr. Boguslavsky received his medical degree from Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and completed his residency training at Somerset Family Practice, where he was presented with multiple Resident Teacher of The Year awards.  He underwent extensive additional training in Medical Acupuncture at the prestigious UCLA Helms Medical Acupuncture Institute in Berkley, California.  Dr. Boguslavsky is Board Certified in Family Medicine and in Medical Acupuncture, a unique achievement. At the root of Dr. Boguslavsky’ s holistic approach to medicine lies a belief that there is much more to being healthy than just preventing being sick. The doctor's function is to support the patient during his or her life journey, and to make sure that the patient is in the best physical, emotional and spiritual health they can be.  Dr. Boguslavsky practices the full spectrum of Family medicine and sees his patients for acute illness (such as headaches, sinus infections) as well for chronic conditions management (thyroid, hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol). Every patient of the practice benefits from his unique dual perspective, offered by Western and Eastern Medicine. Some patients walk away with a medication, whereas others leave reassured, and improved with some Chinese Herbal  Medicines or a few well-chosen acupuncture needles. Additionally, Dr. Boguslavsky specializes in treating patients with pain and functional disorders.   There is a great emphasis in the practice on preventative care and on early control of risk factors, vitamin and mineral deficiencies diet-related imbalances. Finally, it is important to stress how much PremierMD and Dr. Boguslavsky embrace the latest in medical technology. From using the state-of-the-art Electronic Medical Record (EMR), to digital prescriptions, to a user-friendly Patient Portal the patients reap the benefits of the technological advances in medical care. Despite adopting the modern approach to medical information, Dr. Boguslavsky continues the time-tested tenets of doctor-patient relationship: “Give every patient all the time that they need.” For example, new patients are allotted an hour to get to know the doctor and to share their medical history. Established patient visits are allotted 30 minutes. The office runs smoothly and there is rarely more than a few minutes that a patient spends in the waiting or an exam room.

I sadly have Medicaid and when I searched for ENT's who accept my type of insurance, many dr's come up, I found out upon arriving and handing the receptionist my insurance card that they do not accept my insurance. The doctor was kind enough to work with me and come to a solution which worked for me and her office. Thank you! A great ENT!,Was seen immediately. Dr. Reid was friendly and accommodating of my difficult schedule for my potential follow up procedure. 

I also greatly appreciated the ability to fill out my paperwork online and in advance. More doctors should allow for this. ,Dr. Reid was very thorough and knowlegeable! She customized my appt to my specific concerns, and let me know about her other recommendations. Excellent!,I've seen Dr. Reid before and I'm a returning patient. She a very thorough doctor and I can't imagine changing from her.,Very knowledgeable and helpful.

Caring, professional and took the time to really help diagnose me. ,Dr. Daniel is by far the best doctor i have seen litteraly in my life.. Explains every single thing to the T.  I recommend this to all my friends and family..,He is a true professional.,Friendly and approachable. Took a comprehensive approach to my situation. I really felt like he saw me as a whole person and treated me accordingly. I felt like I was working together with an expert, rather than being treated as a task to be completed. ,Best doctor ever! Caring, and comprehensive.,First of all, Dr. Murauski wants to know what is going on with you, not just your symptoms.  He spends time getting to know you and does a thorough intake himself, so you are not repeating the same things to a receptionist, nurse, then a doctor.  Secondly, he doesn't just prescribe a pill for the symptom, but wants to understand the root cause.  I have some digestive issues; one doctor prescribed a medicine to stop acid.  He wants to know why, the actual root cause.  Thirdly, I am not a fan of taking a daily cocktail of prescriptions.  I would prefer to take natural supplements, where possible, or adjust my diet.  Maybe when I am 90, I will have to take ""the daily med cocktail"", but am really trying to avoid until then.  He picked up on that and sent me away with supplements and natural remedies to relieve symptoms until we can do some more thorough testing.

I am a big huge fan of Dr. Murauski already!  What a difference!,Dr. Murauski is great. He takes a holistic approach to your health. Fitness, nutrition, supplements, and prescriptions are all a part of his approach.,I was the first person of the day so can't really judge the wait time, but Dr. Murauski was great. Very friendly and informative.,Dr. Murauski spent about an hour with me as I was a new patient and he was extremely thorough and exactly what I wanted in a Doctor as I am a young professional with good health and was looking to develop a good relationship with a primary care physician who uses integrative medicine and is  interetested in having healthy patients. ,Gave peace of mind..,It went well,Excellent as usual.  :-),Very friendly and articulate doctor.  I would recommend Dr. Dan to my friends, absolutely.  ,He's a great doctor that works with you on finding both conventional and holistic treatments to your medical issues. ,Dr. Dan is very knowledgeable and took the time to understand my health needs.,I felt like he cared about my issues instead of giving me just the standard doctor/patient routine. I've never had a doctor treat me with such care and understanding. Very satisfied with my visit and look forward to future ones.,My experience has been that the wait time is longer than the actual visit but I was very impressed with the amount of time he dedicated to my visit and explaining the different approaches available for my condition. He listened, was thorough, professional and very personable, a rare combination.,Dr. Dan was friendly, knowledgeable and direct. I felt like my concerns were heard and addressed. I appreciated his integrative medicine approach as well. I won't hesitate to return with any health concerns I may have. ,Dr. Murauski really takes his time with you, which this part of medicine is now nonexistent. I appreciate his sincere interest in your health both body and mind. It's a new clinic and growing but it has so much to offer. I hope through time he doesn't change, as the conventional western medical approach has lost its human touch. I don't see this happening as again he has a sincere I interest in your well being. ,Great bedside manner excellent doctor very caring take time and initiative to talk with the with you and I have a new primary care doctor now and he goes above and beyond great Dr 5 stars,Dr. Murauski is a caring, professional, and very well educated provider. He took more than an hour out of his schedule to address my concerns and assess the situation at hand. He was very engaged in my health status/history and covered all the basis. I left with knowledge of my current status and a plan for the future, along with suggestions for supplements and remedies to complement his health care.

Explains everything very well.,I highly recomend Dr. Paredes.  He sees + treats my entire family + we have the upmost respect and trust in him.  
,Wait time was long-ish but I was late to arrive and was grateful to be seen at all!  Knowledgeable, young and energetic was he.  Passionate about healing too.  He's not my regular doctor but one can usually see him the same day when my doc is well booked in advance.  I would be happy to have him as my primary care person if I were looking for one.,This guy is really very good. I had a possible serious medical problem today;- he saw me the same day, arranged scans at the local hospital an hour later, and then discussed the results with me by calling me that same evening.

His practice is always able to get me in last minute (including Saturdays) for illnesses that pop up out of the blue. He does not pressure me to get the flu shot, even when I know he gets in trouble with insurance companies for not administering it. 

This visit I was especially impressed with Dr. Paredes because I left a message right before they closed on a Friday to get my test results from that morning (I'M IMPATIENT!), and his staff called me back immediately and offered me the results that they had processed at that time. After business hours Dr. Paredes also called me with my remaining results and explained to me what they meant, and answered any questions I may have. 

I am very picky about my doctors and am very confident that this office is a family focused office looking to offer quality care. ,Typically the wait time is less than 10 minutes. They are very good about calling your pharmacy if needed, writing timely referrals, completing forms  and seeing you at the last minute if needed. Yet I never feel rushed. I am glad I found this office. Its clean, efficient, modern and Dr. Paredes is great. ,It was short & sweet.. great experience with the doc!,Dr. Peredez is wonderful.  He is very thorough and he takes time to listen and answer all of your questions.,I had my annual physical and Dr Paredes was very thorough  with his exam . He made sure all my questions were answered and made sure I had any refills I needed. I am very pleased with DrParedes as well as the staff! ,Doctor Paredes is a wonderful Doctor. Great with kids. ,Doctors are super honest and kind! Very warm and easy going! Receptionist are the best of all hospital I have ever been! Other places I have been treating me like the third class as I look like Asian and they don't bother to talk to me if they don't understand. So I am finally feel home in the clinic! So my caucasian husband and son will joined this group too! ,Dr Paredes was very personable; he even chuckled at my silly humor. Doctor took the time to review and explain my long list of ailments and provide the necessary prescriptions.
A young and very knowledgeable doctor. I was immensely impressed.  After following my doctors' instructions, I felt so much better almost immediately. He's the type of doctor I've been seeking.

I highly  recommend him!,Excellent service, very knowledgeable.,Absolutely wonderful day,Dr. Paredes always goes above and beyond for my family and I. Fed-up with my old primary physician's total lack of sincerity, urgency to rush me out of his office before I could even ask basic questions (such as, ""what kind of illness do I have?"") for the past several years of my life, I was looking for a new doctor. A friend of the family ranted and raved about Internal Medicine and Pediatrics of Bloomfield, so I thought I would give it a try. Upon my first visit, I IMMEDIATELY noticed the difference! Dr. Paredes took his time with everything about my visit, from start to finish, and would not conclude my visit until he made sure that all of my questions were answered! My wife IMMEDIATELY switched her doctor, too, after I came home ranting and raving about Dr. Paredes. We since then have had two beautiful children, who are now a part of the Bloomfield Med Ped family. 
While my wife was delivering our second baby, our first came-down with a fever and was clearly out of it. Despite being just before closing time, Dr. Paredes assured us that he would PERSONALLY STAY AFTER-HOURS to accommodate us so that a family member could rush our daughter to the office. Thank you, Dr. Paredes and team, for everything that you do for our family!,Usually seen immediately. Today was unusual.  I think he had an emergency to deal with.  Dr.  Paredes is the best.  Extremely patient and kind. ,Great visit! Dr. Paredes is quick and thorough with trying to hurry.

Was fit into the schedule due to the urgency of being ill and needing treatment. ,This was my first visit with this office, and Dr. P was very knowledgeable and and made me very comfortable.

He called with action plan when he had pathological reports. Awesome. God blessed him for this noble service.,My experience as always was great..Dr . Paredes  is a awesome doc ..he takes time to analyze all of his patients and makes great diagnosis to any issue..i would recommend him to anyone needing a primary care physician. .he takes pride in his work and makes u feel lke your his only patient. ..THANKS DR.P...,Doctor Paredes was unlike any other doctor I have worked with.  He allowed me to discuss multiple issues and came up with multiple solutions.  It was so good to be provided with options, not just told what medicine to take.  He was friendly, a great listener, and was easy to talk to.  He did not scold me which has been rare in my years.  I felt extremely comfortable chatting with him during my visit.  My pharmacy filled the medication he prescribed for me before I walked out of his office building.  His staff was genuinely friendly as well.  What a refreshing change!  Thanks again guys!,Dr Paredes is the best!!!  He's very knowledgable about many different areas of medicine as well as being up to date with current medical findings and medicines.

,Dr Baramore is just the best. I had a primary care physician for almost 20 years and her retired. When he retired she filled in at his old practice until her practice got set up. She set her practice up on the other side of town, and I don't mind at all making the commute. Her staff is kind, courteous and they make you feel at home. I would absolutely recommend this practice to my friends and family.,She was great very thorough with her patients! ,She clearly explained how manage Type II Diabetes. As a newly-diagnosed patient, I found it helpful.

I have already referred someone to get after my first visit.,Dr McGugins is a very attentive and caring physician. ,I haven't seen a GP in a few years--my husband and I have moved around a lot over the past few years for his job, and not are finally settled so I searched around and made an appointment with Dr. McGugins Hill.

Her office was easy to find and the staff was friendly and efficient.

I very rarely like doctors, let alone love them, but: I LOVED Dr. McGugins Hill. She was friendly and had an excellent bedside manor. My appointment didn't feel rushed, and she took the time to answer questions and address my concerns. She was incredibly thorough and extremely patient.

She ordered blood work and explained that their office doesn't make appointments for blood work, and that I could just come during certain hours to get my blood drawn. I was a bit nervous about this--I didn't want to sit there for an hour just to get blood drawn--so I called ahead before going in about a week later. It turned out to be no problem, and I was in and out of the office within 45 minutes or so. Dr. McGugins Hill called me the very next day with my results.
,You will not find a more thoughtful, thorough and caring Doctor than Dr. McGugins.  As my internist for many years, I am more than confident in putting my health in her hands.,Execellent doctor! Great practice, beautiful office ,Dr. McGugins Hill is awesome.  She is so nice.  She listened to me and really cares about what I came in there for.  I will definitely be using her again :),I would recommend her to anyone needing a doctor.,What a great experience. She was really thorough and listened carefully.

Her examination was thorough and she asked a lot of questions in order to formulate her opinion.  No shooting from the hip.   She genuinely wants to solve issues and peppers her comments with recommendations and advice.    ,Dr. McGugins Hill was a breath of fresh air after years of disappointing primary care doctors!

I was never left waiting and am very happy with my new prescription.  Will return to see her again!,Although we have been patients at TSO for several years, this was our first visit with Dr Hutchins.  She is very efficient, explains everything she does, and is friendly.  Great job!,First time with Dr. Hutchins and it was very pleasant. She assessed my status of my contact lenses and got me on my way quickly.,Dr.  Hutchins was very personable and friendly. She answered all of my questions clearly, and was able to get me in and out with no problems.  The office staff is excellent as well and took care of everything quickly and with a smile!,Had 3 kids in this week. Morning appointments were fabulous, quick and easy. Afternoon appointments were good but way overbooked. My 5 year old sat for an hour waiting to be seen. Once in, everything was great. I recommend Dr. Hutchins but only for morning appointments! ,Excellent service!! Very pleased with the personnel in this office!,Dr Hutchins is professional, friendly and relaxed.  She gave me a thorough exam, we went over the plans to deal with my cataracts.

I left feeling like I had been well taken care of and confident I was given a good exam and good advice.,Check with your insurance before making an appointment. I made an appointment and it turned out that I had to wait a few additional days before being seen. 

The staff is very professional. It took them a bit longer than estimated to retrieve my glasses but I believe they had reasons due to assisting other customers. 

Great office. Would recommend. ,She is always a delight - professional, compassionate and a good listener.  Highly recommend,She was very good. She was great with my son and she was explained everything.,Dr Hutchins was amazing! I was going to have to wait to see my regular doctor in the same office; she had a moment so she she took me in and treated me immediately! I had ripped and misplaced the contact in my eye. She located it, removed it, and ensured I was treated against infection. Truly amazing and a blessing to me! Thank you so much! ,I have a complaint, actually. I made this appt about 6mos ago. The girl on the phone gave me today at 8am. Imagine my surprise when I arrived to see that you guys didn't open until 9am. So I had to sit in my truck for an hour waiting to get inside. Once inside, I waited another 30mins, after checking in, before I was finally seen. I never once received an apology for the miscommunication. I was the ONLY patient there that whole wait. But...once we actually started the tests, all went along smoothly and efficiently.

First, I would be remiss if I did not mention Nicole, her medical assistant.  Nicole is such a joy -- she examined me before I met with Dr. Kelly and I was impressed by Nicole's level of knowledge!  It quickly became apparent that Nicole ""knows her stuff"" because Dr. Kelly was briefed by Nicole before entering the exam room and was not only comfortable with Nicole's assessment of my condition, but also in total agreement!  That says a lot about her trust in Nicole’s abilities!  When Dr. Kelly entered the room, her warm smile made me feel like an old friend.  She not only examined me once again but also took a keen interest in listening to me -- an important quality that some physicians seem to lack.  Afterwards, Dr. Kelly gave me her recommendations, which I readily accepted.  Her diagnoses were right on point and I left her office feeling as if I was her only patient – the quality of care I received was nothing short of phenomenal!  Lastly, I cannot leave out how professional and welcoming her front office personnel were.  They greeted me with a smile and both were very accommodating.  If I could give them a higher rating than the 5-star rating, I would!,Such a great doctor, she was very personable and helpful. She helped address my health concerns and she was probably the nicest doctor I've ever been to. Definitely will be putting her as my PCP!,Love her bedside manner. I think I'm going to like it there!,Dr. Kelly is an amazing doctor and im happy to have her as my PCP.  ,Dr.Kelly is extremely personable, friendly, and fun. She as well as her staff are all extremely warm and knowledgeable. ,Dr. Kelly is so nice! I came in and her staff and herself were so sweet. I felt like I had been coming to her for a while even though it was my first time. I plan on making her my primary care doctor and anyone else should too. ,She is great. Found it very good ,She is very personable. She listens. She makes you feel comfortable. Very very helpful. I love her bedside manners ,I had a great first visit. Dr Kelly and her staff were friendly, and welcoming ,She was AMAZING! She made me feel very comfortable! I will be coming back!,Dr. Kelly is great! She's very friendly and personable, and really listened to my concerns and took the time to explain things clearly.  ,Dr. Kelly is amazing, i wish more doctors were like her. She is so nice and easy to talk to, she knows her stuff and has great bedside manner. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a new primary care physician. ,Staff were expedient in helping me and had all of my documents on file. ,Dr.  Kelly is great.... she's very knowable...answered all my concerns . ,Awesome as usual. Office is clean, associates are friendly and knowledgeable, and Dr. Kelly is very easy to talk to which is always a great quality in a doctor!,Dr. Kelly is great! I'm glad I have found a new doctor in the DMV area.,Excellent! I love the fact she didn't rush my appointment. She answered all my questions and she LISTENED. You can't say that about to many doctors, just as fast as they're in they're out leaving you confused and unanswered questions.,She was very pleasant, and comforting. I felt like I was talking to someone I had known for a long time; which helped me feel more relaxed and comfortable explaining and relaying all my problems. 

I've been searching for a primary care doctor in MD for 2 years now, I'm glad I finally found Dr. Kelly! 

Office was super cute too :)
,Dr. Kelly was friendly, helpful, and took her time to walk through my history, offer options, and answer my questions. Her office staff was friendly as well - there was minor confusion about my insurance, but it was quickly and efficiently addressed. As someone new to the area, I did not yet have a general practitioner, and am so happy I found Dr. Kelly! I look forward to returning and recommending her to friends. ,Dr. Kelly and her team were AMAZING! They took their time to ensure that they had all of my information and specifics regarding my condition. Additionally, Dr. Kelly and her team provided me continuous updates regarding my treatment procedures and plan. Dr. Kelly, has equipment right in her office to run test and lab work which reduces the time to have to take off work and obtain referrals to other doctors.

I strongly, without hesitation recommend Dr. Kelly and her team.

Dr. Roepke spent time getting to know me as a new patient, which I really appreciated. My lab work also came back within 3 days and I received the call from Dr. Roepke himself letting me know everything was normal. I'll definitely be returning in the future. ,I highly recommend Dr. Roepke. This was my first time seeing him and I plan on making him my new primary care doctor.

I definitely would recommend her... I drive from all the way out in the suburbs to see her. ,The women at the check-in desk were very patient and easy-going. The woman I spoke to during check-out made me feel a bit rushed, but I think some might want to get out of their doctors' appointments quickly. Dr. James was very informative & answered all of my questions thoroughly. She had a warm & friendly personality that made me feel as ease. I asked about an IUD and she made sure I understood all my options. She was unbiased and gave me honest answers. I'm so glad I found her!,Loved her!  Kind, patient, and answered all my questions.  I highly recommend her!,Dr. James has a great bedside manner - very friendly and took the time to make sure she answered all my questions. In addition, the Chicago Women's Health Group has a very nice office and the entire experience, from arriving to leaving, was very smooth. Thanks!,I was a first time patient. Once I gave them the initial information, my wait was less than five minutes. The nurse was brusque but efficient, and the doctor came in soon after. I felt comfortable with her immediately. After the exam, she sent me down the hall for some blood work which took a little longer than anticipated, but all in all I was out of there by 10:20. I would absolutely recommend her!!,Dr. James listened with empathy and took note of everything I mentioned. I raised several issues and she was able to address them one by one and to connect the dots. In addition, even though I was anxious of pap test, she performed it carefully and didn't hurt. ,The office staff was very nice and welcoming. Dr. James-Hussain has an excellent bedside matter and is extremely knowledgeable which I appreciate! This was my first visit and I was extremely impressed with only a few minutes of wait time. I normally dread going to the obgyn specifically due to the long waits. ,I had PMB and Dr. James was simply amazing. She performed routine procedures including the easiest ""pap"" I have ever experienced. Further, she was able to get me an ultrasound within an hour (in the same office). The whole experience was amazing. She never stops smiling, listens and takes lots of time and asks good questions. Very, very professional; top notch, Would recommend her to anyone who is postmenopausal and needs a physician. ,Ultra professional, friendly, and the easiest to talk to doctor I've ever been to. I didn't feel rushed and she took plenty of time to answer all my questions. I couldn't be happier with my appointment.,She makes you feel very comfortable. She's smiley and easy to talk to. ,She is patient and a great listener. She doesn't hurry you; instead, makes you very comfortable and she just has an approachable and kind personality. ,She was honestly the best OBGYN I have ever been to. She made me feel so comfortable and was very quick when it came to the ever so uncomfortable PAP! ,I appreciated her attention, clarity and warm nature!

Highly recommended all around!,Excellent professional.,Dr Echenique was very professional and very pleasant.I.He listened to my concerns, examined me thoroughly and explained what was the problem and what the treatment would be.He is a very good doctor and I would recommend him  friends and colleagues.,He is very nice, kind and professional.  I would love to recommend you. ,So wonderful!  Definitely made me feel comfortable and answered all my questions. ,I can't possibly say enough great things about Dr. Echenique! I went into see him for chronic neck and back pain that I have been having, and I was very apprehensive about the visit because I was in a lot of pain and even more so because some doctors don't have the best bed side manner or are very quick and/or dismissive- however he couldn't have been more wonderful! Dr. Echenique put me at ease right away. He let me express all of my symptoms, concerns and questions. He was very patient, informative and excellent at explaining everything so I could understand it. He was also very comforting and thorough. I had a great experience with everyone being very kind and professional - from the front desk, to the x-ray technician, to his nurse/PA, to the doctor himself. Excellent experience all around. I know that I am in great hands there. ,Dr. Echenique had a great bedside manner, but more than that, he took the time to explain the parts of the knee and point out specifically in the X-Ray and sonogram photos what we were looking at and what we were looking for.

He was very thorough and patient with my questions as well.,I've been dealing with an ongoing knee issue for >10 years; orthopedic surgeons had referred me to rheumatologists, and vice versa. I even had a prior knee surgery that made matters much worse. Dr. Echenique was humble, intelligent, patient, and thorough, and most importantly (in my particular case) provided me with insight no other physician had. ,He was professional and made me feel comfortable ,I haven't seen a doctor since before college and Dr Echenique seemed more like a friend than the doctors of my childhood.,I was able to get a same day appointment, which for an orthopedist was a pleasant and unexpected surprise. There was a delay in being seen because the receptionist forgot to check me in. Other than that, everyone one was professional and courteous.  Dr. Echenique answered all of my questions and took the time to educate me about my options.  I highly recommend him and his practice., Dr. Echenique  is truly unique in the world of doctors, and I've been to plenty in my lifetime, in that he always conveys and authenticity  that for me as his patient is crucial to my trust in him as a diagnostician  as well as his very personable and rarely have I seen a more instantly likeable  physician that I knew I was in good hands. He was thorough regarding all aspects of my diagnose ,  treatment, and most importantly for me, because I ask a lot of questions as I am very curious being a teacher myself of biology and chemistry ,  he took the time to answer all of my questions without making me feel like I was taking up too much of his time, which is truly  rare in the majority of the medical profession. I would recommend him to anybody for anything regarding  any issues  with your body that require the specification  of an orthopedist and or surgeon. Everyone on staff is genuinely pleasant and  gives you the feeling that they are only there to serve you, and treat you like the most important person during the time they are with you. Awesome!,He was a very nice and answered all of my questions.  His PA was fantastic.  She gave me an injection into my joint and I didn't feel a thing.,Saw him for rotator cuff.  Very pleased with the visit.  Explained all the options and the treatment.  Very down to earth, and knowledgeable -   with no condescending attitude.,Professional, courteous & efficient but thorough.,He was the consumate professional, pleasant respectful and knowledgeable,Everything about my appointment was handled expertly.

I would recommend him to anybody for anything regarding  any issues  with your body that require the specification  of an orthopedist and or surgeon. Everyone on staff is genuinely pleasant and  gives you the feeling that they are only there to serve you, and treat you like the most important person during the time they are with you.

,Professional and very pleasant to speak with and she listens to all of my concerns. Definitely recommend her to other women!,She was easy to talk to and quite personable. I felt very comfortable which can be difficult for these kind of appointments. She didn't seem to pass any judgment and genuinely seemed to care about me as an individual and not just another code to bill. ,From her expertise to her bedside manner, I have never felt so heard or so sure a doctor understands the way my issues intertwine. Dr. Embry is incredibly knowledgable, attentive, thorough, and she treats the whole person. She is non-judgmental, and she actively listens to her patients. I'm recommending her to both of my sisters, and I have already scheduled a follow up. The wait might be a little longer than some offices, but there is a reason that no one in the waiting room is upset by it. Honestly, I'd wait much longer to see her if I had to.

She is nothing short of amazing. ,I felt very comfortable and learned a lot I was not aware of.

I highly recommend her to anyone, even if you are not located in the Mesa area- it is definitely worth the drive!,My visit was awesome! She really took the time to listen to my concerns and get to know me beforehand. I have actually already recommended her to my sister and mom. ,Never have I ever enjoyed a doctor visit like I did today. I left in tears, but they were happy tears! Jo Ellen Embry was able to accomplish in one visit, what a handful of doctors could not in over 10 years!
