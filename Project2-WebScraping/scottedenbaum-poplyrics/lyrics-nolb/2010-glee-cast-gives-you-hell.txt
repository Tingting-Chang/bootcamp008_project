I wake up every evening, with a big smile on my faceAnd it never feels out of placeAnd you're still probably working at a 9 to 5 paceI wonder how bad that tastesWhen you see my face, hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellWhen you walk my way, hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellNow where's your picket fence loveAnd where's that shiny car,And did it ever get you farYou've never seemed so tense loveI've never seen you fall so hard,Do you know where you areAnd truth be told I miss you (truth be told I miss you)And truth be told I'm lying(Ooh)When you see my face, hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellWhen you walk my way, hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellIf you find a man that'sWorth a damn and treats you well (treats you well)Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellTomorrow you'll be thinking to yourselfYeah, where'd it all go wrong, but the list goes on and onAnd truth be told I miss you (truth be told I miss you)And truth be told I'm lyingWhen you see my face hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellWhen you walk my way hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellIf you find a man that'sWorth a damn and treats you well (treats you well)Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hellNow you'll never see, what you've done to meYou can take back your memories they're no good to meAnd here's all your lies,You can look me in the eyesWith that sad sad look that you wear so wellWhen you see my face, hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellWhen you walk my way, hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellIf you find a man that'sWorth a damn and treats you well (treats you well)Then he's a fool, yeah you're just as well, hope it gives you hellWhen you see my face, hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellWhen you walk my way, hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellWhen you hear this song and you sing along ,oh you'll never tell (oh you'll never tell)Then you're the fool, I'm just as wellHope it gives you hell (gives you hell)When you hear this song, I hope that it will give you hell (gives you hell)You can sing along, I hope that it will treat you well
