Way back up in the country, back in the hillsDown in the hollows where the folks are realLivin' with the crazies and the old wildcatsSawed off shotguns and coonskin capsThat's where I'm from and I'm proud to sayI'm from the country and I like it that wayEverybody knows everybody, everybody calls you friendYou don't need an invitation, kick off your shoes come on inYeah, we know how to work and we know how to playWe're from the country and we like it that wayAll day long we work in the fieldsThen bring it on home to a home cooked mealWe love ya like Sunday, treat ya like Saturday nightAnd when the bed gets full we can sleep in the hay (hey)We're from the country and we like it that wayEverybody knows everybody, everybody calls you friendYou don't need an invitation, kick off your shoes come on inYeah, we know how to work and we know how to playWe're from the country and we like it that way
