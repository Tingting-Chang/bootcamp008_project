There's a place off Ocean AvenueWhere I used to sit and talk with youWe were both 16 and it felt so rightSleeping all day, staying up all nightStaying up all nightThere's a place on the corner of Cherry StreetWe would walk on the beach in our barefeetWe were both 18 and it felt so rightSleeping all day, staying up all nightStaying up all nightIf I could find you now things would get betterWe could leave this town and run foreverLet your waves crash down on meAnd take me away, yeah yeahThere's a piece of you that's here with meIt's everywhere I go, it's everything I seeWhen I sleep I dream and it gets me byI can make believe that you're here tonightThat you're here tonightIf I could find you now things would get betterWe could leave this town and run foreverI know somewhere, somehow we'll be togetherLet your waves crash down on meAnd take me away, yeahI remember the look in your eyesWhen I told you that this was goodbyeYou were begging me not tonightNot here, not nowWe're looking up at the same night skyWe keep pretending the sun will not riseWe'll be together for one more nightSomewhere, somehowIf I could find you now things would get betterWe could leave this town and run foreverI know somewhere, somehow we'll be togetherLet your waves crash down on meAnd take me away, yeah yeah
