I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymoreBefore you take a swingI wonder what are we fighting forWhen I say out loudI want to get out of thisI wonder is there anythingI'm going to missI wonder how it's going to beWhen you don't know meHow's it going to beWhen you're sure I'm not thereHow's it going to beWhen there's no one there to talk toBetween you and meCause I don't careHow's it going to be, How's it going to beWhere we used to laughThere's a shouting matchSharp as a thumbnail scratchA silence I can't ignoreLike the hammock by theDoorway we spent time in, swings emptyDon't see lightning like last fallWhen it was always about to hit meI wonder how's it going to beWhen it goes downHow's it going to beWhen you're not aroundHow's it going to beWhen you found out there was nothingBetween you and meCause I don't careHow's it going to beAnd how's it going to beWhen you don't know me anymoreAnd how's it going to beWant to get myself back in againThe soft dive of oblivionI want to taste the salt of your skinThe soft dive of oblivion oblivionHow's it going to beWhen you don't know me anymoreHow's it going to be, How's it going to beHow's it going to be
