Long were the nights when my days once revolved around youCounting my footsteps,Praying the floor won't fall through, againMy mother accused me of losing my mind,But I swore I was fine, you paint me a blue skyAnd go back and turn it to rainAnd I lived in your chess game,But you changed the rules every dayWondering which version of you I might get on the phoneTonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know whyDear John, I see it all now that you're goneDon't you think I was too young to be messed with?The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I should've knownWell maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blameMaybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it awayAnd you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understandAnd I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said "run as fast as you can"Dear John, I see it all now that you're goneDon't you think I was too young to be messed with?The girl in the dress, cried the whole way homeDear John, I see it all, now it was wrongDon't you think nineteen is too youngTo be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?I should've knownYou are an expert at sorry,And keeping the lines blurryNever impressed by me acing your testsAll the girls that you've run dryHave tired, lifeless eyes'Cause you burned them outBut I took your matches before fire could catch me,So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty townDear John, I see it all now that you're goneDon't you think I was too young to be messed with?The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home.I see it all now that you're goneDon't you think I was too young to be messed with?The girl in the dress wrote you a songYou should've known, you should've knownDon't you think I was too young? You should've known
