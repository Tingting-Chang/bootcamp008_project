And to love: a godAnd to fear: a flameAnd to burn a crowd that has a nameAnd to right or wrongAnd to meek or strongIt is known just scream it from the wallI've willed I've walked I've readI've talked I know I knowI've been here beforeHey now we won't be rapedHey now we won't be scarred like thatIt's the sun that burnsIt's the wheel that turnsIt's the way we sing that makes 'em dreamAnd to Christ: a crossAnd to me: a chairI will sit and earn the ransomFrom up here
