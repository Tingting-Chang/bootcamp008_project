Let me run with you tonightI'll take you on a moonlight rideThere's someone I used to seeBut she don't give a damn for meBut let me get to the point, let's roll another jointAnd turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proudYou don't know how it feelsYou don't know how it feels to be mePeople come, people goSome grow young, some grow coldI woke up in betweenA memory and a dreamSo let's get to the point, let's roll another jointLet's head on down the roadThere's somewhere I gotta goAnd you don't know how it feelsYou don't know how it feels to be meMy old man was born to rockHe's still tryin' to beat the clockThink of me what you willI got a little space to fillSo let's get to the point, let's roll another jointLet's head on down the roadThere's somewhere I gotta goAnd you don't know how it feelsNo, you don't know how it feels to be me
