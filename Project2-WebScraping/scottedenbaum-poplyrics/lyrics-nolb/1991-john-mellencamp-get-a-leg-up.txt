Don't look at me don't touch meKeep your mind straight aheadDon't get no funny ideas about weOr you'll wish you were deadThat's what I am thinking she must be thinkingThe girl I spent fifty three bucks on last nightShe give me a look from the corner of her eyeThat says, "Boy, keep acting right"How surprised was IWhen she leaned over and whispered in my earGet a leg upGet a leg over boyGet a leg upWhat's the matterAre you shy, shy, shy?I'm pretty good with first impressionsBut sometimes I'm not always rightI pulled the car to the shoulder of the roadTo see what she had in mindWant me to spend the nightHey lover boy you know I willAnd my best girlfriend lives down the roadTogether we will thrill yaAnd I'm thinking to myselfI could be lucky Pierre tonightIf I could get a leg upIf I could get a leg over boyYou know I ain't that handsomeBut you know I ain't shy, shy, shyThe rest of the night we went on and onAnd the moral to this songDon't go making hasty judgementsBecause sometimes they could be wrongNothing wrong with a good timeJust keep yourself protected make a listAnd you can bet your life that the women don't knowThe little girls are acting like thisSo the next time a young one moves upAnd she whispers in your earGet a leg upGet a leg over boyGet a leg upWhat's the matterNow don't you be shy, shy, shy?Get a leg upGet a leg over boyGet a leg upWhat's the matterNow don't you be shy, shy, shy?
