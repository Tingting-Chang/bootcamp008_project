Who can say where the road goesWhere the day flows, only timeAnd who can say if your love growsAs your heart chose, only timeWho can say why your heart sighsAs your love flies, only timeAnd who can say why your heart criesWhen your love lies, only timeWho can say when the roads meetThat love might be in your heartAnd who can say when the day sleepsIf the night keeps all your heartNight keeps all your heartWho can say if your love growsAs your heart choseOnly timeAnd who can say where the road goesWhere the day flows, only time
