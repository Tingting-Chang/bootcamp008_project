When I was youngerI saw my daddy cryAnd curse at the windHe broke his own heartAnd I watchedAs he tried to reassemble itAnd my momma sworeThat she would never let herself forgetAnd that was the day that I promisedI'd never sing of loveIf it does not exist, but darlin'You are, the only exceptionYou are, the only exceptionYou are, the only exceptionYou are, the only exceptionMaybe I know, somewhereDeep in my soulThat love never lastsAnd we've got to find other waysTo make it aloneBut keep a straight faceAnd I've always lived like thisKeeping a comfortable, distanceAnd up until nowI had sworn to myself that I'm contentWith lonelinessBecause none of it was ever worth the riskBut, you are, the only exceptionYou are, the only exceptionYou are, the only exceptionYou are, the only exceptionI've got a tight grip on realityBut I can't let go of what's in front of me hereI know your leaving in the morning, when you wake upLeave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, ohYou are, the only exceptionYou are, the only exceptionYou are, the only exceptionYou are, the only exceptionYou are, the only exceptionYou are, the only exceptionYou are, the only exceptionYou are, the only exceptionAnd I'm on my way to believingOh, and I'm on my way to believing.
