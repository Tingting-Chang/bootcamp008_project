I have days where I hate my jobThis little town, and the whole world tooLast Sunday when the Bengals lostLord, it put me in a bad moodI have moments when I curse the rainThen complain when the sun's too hotI look around at what everyone hasAnd I forget about all I've gotBut I know I'm a lucky manGod's given me a pretty fair handGot a house and a piece of landA few dollars in a coffee canMy old truck's still running goodMy ticker's ticking like they say it shouldI got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovingAnd one more day to be my little kid's dadLord, knows I'm a lucky manGot some friends who would be here fastI could call 'em any time of dayGot a brother who's got my backGot a mama who I swear's a saintGot a brand new rod and reelGot a full week off this yearDad had a close call last springIt's a miracle he's still hereBut I know I'm a lucky manGod's given me a pretty fair handGot a house and a piece of landA few dollars in a coffee canMy old truck's still running goodMy ticker's ticking like they say it shouldI got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovingAnd one more day to be my little kid's dadLord, knows I'm a lucky manMy old truck's still running goodMy ticker's ticking like they say it shouldI got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovingAnd even my bad days ain't that badYeah, I'm a lucky manI'm a lucky lucky man
