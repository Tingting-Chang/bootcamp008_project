Do you remember the nightsWe'd stay up just laughingSmiling for hours at anythingRemember the nightsWe drove around crazy in loveWhen the lights go out, we'll be safe and soundWe'll take control of the worldLike it's all we have to hold on toAnd we'll be a dreamDo you remember the nightsWe made our way dreamingHoping of being someone bigWe we're so young thenWe were too crazy in loveWhen the lights go out, we'll be safe and soundWe'll take control of the worldLike it's all we have to hold on toAnd we'll be a dreamWoah, woah, woah...Woah, woah, oh...When the lights go out, we'll be safe and soundWe'll take control of the worldLike it's all we have to hold on toAnd we'll beWhen the lights go out, we'll be safe and soundWe'll take control of the worldLike it's all we have to hold on toAnd we'll be a dream
