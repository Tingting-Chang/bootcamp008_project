Honey, why you calling me so late?It's kinda hard to talk right nowHoney, why are you crying, is everything okay?I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud[Chorus]Well, my girl's in the next roomSometimes I wish she was youI guess we never really moved onIt's really good to hear your voice saying my nameIt sounds so sweetComing from the lips of an angelHearing those words - it makes me weakAnd I never wanna say goodbyeBut, girl, you make it hard to be faithfulWith the lips of an angelIt's funny that you're calling me tonightAnd, yes, I've dreamt of you tooAnd does he know you're talking to me?Will it start a fight?No, I don't think she has a clue[Chorus]
