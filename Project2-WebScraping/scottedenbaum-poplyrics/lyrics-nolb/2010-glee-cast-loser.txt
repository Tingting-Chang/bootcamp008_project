In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkeyButane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkieWith the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetablesDog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhoseKill the headlights and put it in neutralStock car flaming with a loser and the cruise controlBaby's in Reno with the vitamin DGot a couple of couches, sleep on the love seatSomeone keeps saying, I'm insane to complainAbout a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirtDon't believe everything that you breatheYou get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeveSo shave your face with some mace in the darkSaving all your food stampsAnd burning' down the trailer parkYo, cut itSoy un perdedorI'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?Soy un perdedorI'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?The forces of evil in a bozo nightmareBanned all the music with a phony gas chamber'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flagOne's on the pole, shove the other in a bagWith the re-run shows and the cocaine nose jobThe daytime crap of the folksinger slopHe hung himself with a guitar stringI slap the turkey neck and it's hanging' from a pigeon wingYou can't write if you can't relateTrade the cash for the beef for the body for the hateAnd my time is a piece of wax, falling on a termiteWho's choking on the splintersSoy un perdedorI'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?Soy un perdedorI'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?Soy, soy, soyI'm a driver, I'm the winnerThings are gonna change, I can feel itSoy un perdedorI'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?Soy un perdedorI'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?Soy un perdedorI'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?Soy un perdedorI'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
