Got a baby girl sleepin' in my bedroomAnd her momma laughing in my armsThere's a sound of rain on the rooftopAnd the game's about to startI don't really know how I got hereBut I'm so glad that I didAnd it's crazy to think that one little thingCould have changed all of thisMaybe it didn't turn out like I plannedMaybe that's why I'm such, such a lucky manFor every stoplight I didn't makeEvery chance I did or I didn't takeAll the nights I went too farAll the girls that broke my heartAll the doors that I had to closeAll the things I knew but I didn't knowThank God for all I missed'Cause it led me here to thisLike the girl that I loved in high schoolWho said she could do betterOr the college I wanted to go toTill I got that letterAll the fights and the tears and the heartacheI thought I'd never get throughAnd the moment I almost gave upAll led me here to youI didn't understand it way back whenBut sittin' here right nowIt all makes perfect senseEvery stoplight I didn't makeEvery chance I did or I didn't takeAll the nights I went too farAll the girls that broke my heartAll the doors that I had to closeAll the things I knew but I didn't knowThank God for all I missed'Cause it led me here to thisOh I cried when my momma passed awayAnd now I got an angelLooking out for me todaySo nothing's a mistakeEvery stoplight I didn't makeEvery chance I did or I didn't takeAll the nights I went too farAll the girls that broke my heartAll the doors that I had to closeEverything I knew but I didn't knowThank God for all I missed'Cause it led me here to thisIt led me here to this
