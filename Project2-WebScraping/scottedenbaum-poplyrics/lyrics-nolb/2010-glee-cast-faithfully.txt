Highway runInto the midnight sun.Wheels go 'round and 'roundYou're on my mind.Restless heartsSleep alone tonight.Sendin' all my loveAlong the wire.They say that the roadAin't no place to start a family.Right down the lineIt's been you and me.And lovin' a music manAin't always what it's supposed to be.Oh boy, you stand by meI'm forever yoursFaithfully.Circus lifeUnder the big top worldWe all need the clownsTo make us smileOohThrough space and timeThrough space and timeAlways another show,Wondering where I amLost without you.And being apartAin't easy on this love affair.Two strangersLearn to fall in love again.I get the joy of rediscovering youOh girl, you stand by me.I'm forever yoursFaithfully.Oh, oh, oh, ohOh, oh, oh, oh, ohOh, oh, oh, oh, ohFaithfullyFaithfullyI'm still yours.Oh, oh, oh, ohOh, oh, oh, oh, ohOh, oh, oh, oh, ohI'm still yoursOh, oh, oh, ohOh, oh, oh, oh, ohOh, oh, oh, oh, ohI'm still yoursFaithfully.
