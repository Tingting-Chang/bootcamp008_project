Hear the sirens, hear the sirensHear the sirens, hear the circus all go foundI hear the sirens more and more in this here townLet me catch my breath to breathe then reach across the bendJust to know we're safe, I am a grateful manThis light is pit, alive and I can see you clearI could take your hand, and feel your breathFor feel that someday this will be overI pull you close, so much to loseKnowing that, nothing lasts foreverI didn't care, before you were hereA distant laughter, with the ever afterBut, all things change, let this remainHear the sirens covering distance in the nightThe sound, echoing closer, will they come for me, next time?For every choice, mistake I made, is not my planTo send you in the arms of another manAnd if you choose to stay, I'll wait, I'll understandIt's a fragile thing, this life we lead,If I think too much, I can't get overWhen by the grace, by which we liveOur lives with death over our shouldersWant you to know, that should I go,I always loved you, held you high above tooI studied your face, the fear goes awayIt's a fragile thing, this life we lead,If I think too much, I can't get overWhen by the grace, by which we liveOur lives with death over our shouldersWant you to know, that should I go,I always loved you, held you high above tooI studied your face, the fear goes away,The fear goes away, the fear goes away
