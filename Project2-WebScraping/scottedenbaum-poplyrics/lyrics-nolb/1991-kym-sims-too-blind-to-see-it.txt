I'm nobody's wife and I'm nobody's baby,I like it that way but then again, maybe.I'm nobody's valentine & I'm nobody's pearlWhen you get right down to it I always seem to always find justSome girl singin'There are monsters, there are angels.There's a peacefulness and a rage inside us all.There's sugar & there is saltThere's ice and there is fire.In every single heart, there are monsters, there are angels.I'm nobody's promise and I'm nobody's choreAnd I ain't got nobody that I feel I gottaLive for - nobody to live for.I'm nobody's work & I'm nobodys' companyAnd every time I turn around I always seem to findJust me singin'There are monsters, there are angels.There's a peacefulness and a rage inside us all.There's sugar, and there's salt.There's ice and there's fireIn every single heart there are monsters there are angels.I'm nobodys' wife, I'm nobodys' baby,I like it that way, but then again, maybe.Then again maybe.I'm nobody's valentine and I'm nobody's pearl.When you get right down to it I always seem to find justSome girl.Singin' there are monsters, there are angels.There's a peacefulness and a rage inside us all.There's sugar, and there's salt.There's ice and there's fire.In every single heart there are monsters there are angels.Singin' there are monsters, there are angels.Singin' there are monsters, there are angels.I'm nobody's wife, and I'm nobody's baby.*fade*
