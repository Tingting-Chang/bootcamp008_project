Ooh ooh oohOoh ooh oohCan you feel meWhen I think about you?With every breath I takeEvery minuteNo matter what I doMy world is an empty placeLike I've been wandering the desertFor a thousand days (oh)Don't know if it's a mirageBut I always see your face, baby[Chorus:]I'm missing you so muchCan't help it, I'm in loveA day without you is like a year without rainI need you by my sideDon't know how I'll surviveA day without you is like a year without rain (oh, whoa)Whoa, oh, whoaThe stars are burningI hear your voice in my mind (voice in my mind)Can't you hear me calling?My heart is yearningLike the ocean that's running dryCatch me, I'm fallingIt's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feetWon't you save me?There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me, oh, baby[Chorus]I'm missing you so muchCan't help it, I'm in loveA day without you is like a year without rainI need you by my sideDon't know how I'll surviveA day without you is like a year without rain (oh, whoa)Whoa, oh, whoa[Chorus]So let this drought come to an endAnd make this desert flower againI need you hereI can't explainBut a day without youIs like a year without rain(oooh)It's a world of wonder with you in my lifeSo hurry, baby, don't waste no more timeI need you here, I can't explainBut a day without you is like a year without rain (oh, whoa)[Chorus]Ooh ooh oohOoh ooh ooh
