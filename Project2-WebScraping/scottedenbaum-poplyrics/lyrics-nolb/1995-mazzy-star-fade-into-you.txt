I wanna hold the hand inside youI wanna take the breath that's trueI look to you and I see nothingI look to you to see the truthYou live your life, you go in shadowYou'll come upon and you'll go blackSome kind of night into your darknessClose your eyes with what's not thereFade into youStrange you never knewFade into youI think it's strange you never knewThe strange light comes on slowlyA stranger's heart is out of homeYou put your hands into your headAnd your smiles cover your heart
