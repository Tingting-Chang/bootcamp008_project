A diamond sun cuts down a frozen winter skyAs the world and I go screaming into the phantom nightIt doesn't matter where it leads, I got nowhere left to goIf there's any chance at all, it's somewhere down this roadTo be wild again, no one's child againYeah I wanna see those eyes in the mirror full of fire againOh to be wild againThe fading light is cold on the shoulders of the treesOh the star wind blows right through me, and I never felt so freeOh there had to be a crossroad, a place to draw the lineAnd it came down to the question, is this life I'm livin' mineHad to be wild again, no one's child againI wanna live every minute so hard that I wear it thinI wanna find the edge, risk it all to winI wanna see those eyes in the mirror full of fire againI wanna be wild againThere has to be a crossroad, a place to draw the lineAnd it comes down to the question, what is theirs and what is mineWild again, no one's child againI wanna live every minute so hard that I wear it thinI wanna find the edge, risk it all to winI wanna see those eyes in the mirror, burn with life again, yeahI wanna be wild, let the change begin, yeahI wanna find the edge, risk it all, yeahWanna burn with life againWanna be wild again, yeah, I wanna be wild againWild again
