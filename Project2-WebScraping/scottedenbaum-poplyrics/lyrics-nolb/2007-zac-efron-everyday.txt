Pair of boots and a sack of clothesFree and easy down the road I goHanging memories on the high line polesFree and easy down the road I goFree and easy down the road I goRagweed's rocking on the radioFree and easy down the road I goSo I keep rolling like an old banjoFree and easy down the road I goGot the sun shining on me like a big spotlightSo I know everything is gonna be alrightAin't no telling where the wind might blowFree and easy down the road I goLiving life like a Sunday strollFree and easy down the road I goFree and easy down the road I goIf you only get to go around one timeI'm gonna sit back and try to enjoy the rideI could make a million or wind up brokeFree and easy down the road I goCan't take it with you when you go, soFree and easy down the road I goSomeday I know it's gonna take me home, soFree and easy down the road I goFree and easy down the road I go
