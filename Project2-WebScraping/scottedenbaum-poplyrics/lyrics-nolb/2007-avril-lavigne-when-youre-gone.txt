I always needed time on my ownI never thought I'dNeed you there when I cryAnd the days feel like years when I'm aloneAnd the bed where you lieIs made up on your sideWhen you walk awayI count the steps that you takeDo you see how much I need you right now?When you're goneThe pieces of my heart are missin' youWhen you're goneThe face I came to know is missin', tooWhen you're goneThe words I need to hearTo always get me through the dayAnd make it okayI miss youI've never felt this way beforeEverything that I doReminds me of youAnd the clothes you left, they lie on the floorAnd they smell just like youI love the things that you doWhen you walk awayI count the steps that you takeDo you see how much I need you right now?When you're goneThe pieces of my heart are missin' youWhen you're goneThe face I came to know is missin', tooWhen you're goneThe words I need to hearTo always get me through the dayAnd make it okayI miss youWe were made for each otherOut here foreverI know we wereYeah, yeahAnd all I ever wanted was for you to knowEverything I do, I give my heart and soulI can hardly breathe; I need to feel you here with meYeahWhen you're goneThe pieces of my heart are missin' youWhen you're goneThe face I came to know is missin', tooWhen you're goneThe words I need to hearWill always get me through the dayAnd make it okayI miss you
