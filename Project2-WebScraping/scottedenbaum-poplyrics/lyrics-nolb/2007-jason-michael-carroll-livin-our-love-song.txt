Baby, when I look at you with your hair fallin' down and your baby bluesStanding there across the room, I get so lost in the way you moveIt makes me reminisce back to years ago on a night like thisTeary eyed as you took my hand, and I told you that I'd be your manSo many have come, so many things have goneOne thing that's stayed the same is our love is still growing strong[Chorus]Baby, just look at us: all this time, and we're still in loveSomething like this just don't existBetween a backwoods boy and a fairy tale princessPeople said it would never work outLiving our dreams has shattered all doubtsIt feels good to prove 'em wrongLiving our love songOh darling, would you look at meWith my heart beating fast and my shaking kneesIt's pretty hard to believe after all these years I still need you this badlyYou're dancing in my arms with a spotlight moon in a sea of starsGirl, we've come so far; everything I want is everything that you areI just want to lay you downSay I love you without a soundI think you know what I'm talking about[Chorus]
