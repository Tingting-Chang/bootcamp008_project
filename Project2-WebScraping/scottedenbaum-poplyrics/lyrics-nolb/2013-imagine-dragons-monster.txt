Ever since I could rememberEverything inside of meJust wanted to fit in (oh oh oh oh)I was never one for pretendersEverything I tried to beJust wouldn't settle in (oh oh oh oh)If I told you what I wasWould you turn your back on me?And if I seem dangerousWould you be scared?I get the feeling just becauseEverything I touch isn't dark enoughIf this problem lies in meI'm only a man with a candle to guide meI'm taking a stand to escape what's inside meA monster, a monsterI've turned into a monsterA monster, a monsterAnd it keeps getting strongerCan I clear my conscience,If I'm different from the restDo I have to run and hide? (oh oh oh oh)I never said that I want thisThis burden came to meAnd it's made it's home inside (oh oh oh oh)If I told you what I wasWould you turn your back on me?And if I seem dangerousWould you be scared?I get the feeling just becauseEverything I touch isn't dark enoughIf this problem lies in meI'm only a man with a candle to guide meI'm taking a stand to escape what's inside meA monster, a monsterI've turned into a monsterA monster, a monsterAnd it keeps getting strongerI'm only a man with a candle to guide meI'm taking a stand to escape what's inside meA monster, a monsterI've turned into a monsterA monster, a monsterAnd it keeps getting stronger
