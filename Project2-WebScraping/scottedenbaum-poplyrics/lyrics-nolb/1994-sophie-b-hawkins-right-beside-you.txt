I'm dancing in the shadows of lifeAnd death is all around me tonightI miss you making love to me rightBeside myself I'm holding you tightSomeone is waiting for me to riseAnd dive into the ocean I criedAnd I cried and I cried my baby to sleepBeside myself my soul to keepRight beside you I seeRight beside you I stayRight beside you I'll beRight beside you alwaysWe're dancing in the shade of the summer sunThe drums are playingThe change to come was yesterdayIn the heat beside myself I need to keepRight beside you I feelRight beside you I amRight beside you I kneelRight beside you I standRight beside you I seeRight beside you I stayRight beside you I'll beRight beside you alwaysDriving into town with the top downSun sinking low into the water I can feel your speedOne hand on the wheel one hand on my kneeI can tell you what I want you can do what you needDarling nights are getting cooler in the city so closeThere's a place we can do it somewhere right along the coastWe'll arrive on time just a little bit lateIt's not a matter of style just a lesson in tasteI remember when I was your childYou made me up to be your loverNow I'm standing right beside youOther people still exsistI don't pretend to love them less but darlingWhen you drive this way I lose my breathRight beside you I feelRight beside you I amRight beside you I kneelRight beside you I standRight beside you I seeRight beside you I stayRight beside you I'll beAlwaysRight beside you I feelRight beside you I amRight beside you I kneelRight beside you I standRight beside you I seeRight beside you I stayRight beside you I'll beRight beside you always
