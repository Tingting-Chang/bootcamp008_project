Rising high, in the morning and the nightFeeling low, never knowing where you'll fallHypnotized, nothing can make you feel this wayNo way out, cause now your trapped and can't go backWhy couldn't you come to meKnowing I'll be there for youIs love so strong why can't you turn aroundAnd look for me my babyI love you[Chorus]Don't do the things you doMy fallen angelMy heart will loveMake your body turn awaySo give it up baby (so give it up baby)So look at yourself nowCan't speak true wordsOnly deception looks your wayDeception looks your wayAnd so your alone nowTurned away from friendsLook in the mirror and can't you seeSo now can't you see my baby[Chorus]Why couldn't you come to meKnowing I'll be there for youIs love so strong why can't you turn aroundAnd look for me my babyI love you[Chorus: x2]
