Sundown all aroundWalking through the summer's endWaves crash, baby, don't look backI won't walk away againOh, baby, anywhere you go,We are bound togetherI begin, baby, where you endSomethings are foreverCircle in the sandRound and roundNever ending love is what we've foundAnd you complete the heart of meOur love is all we needCircle in the sandCircle in the sandCold wind, tide moves inShivers in the salty airDay breaks, my heart achesI will wait for you right hereOh baby when you look for meCan you see forever?I begin, baby, where you endWe belong togetherCircle in the sandRound and roundRising of the moon as the sun goes downAnd you complete the heart of meOur love is all we needCircle in the sandCircle in the sandBaby can you hear me?Can you hear me calling?Oh, baby, anywhere you go,We are bound togetherI begin, baby, where you endSomethings are foreverCircle in the sandRound and roundNever ending love is what we've foundAnd you complete the heart of meOur love is all we need(Circle in the sand)
