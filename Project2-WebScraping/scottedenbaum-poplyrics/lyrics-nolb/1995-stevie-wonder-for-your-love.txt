All the gold in all the worldIs nothing to possessIf all the things that it can bringCan't add up to one ounce of your happinessAnd for your loveI would do anythingJust to see the smile upon your faceFor your loveI would go anywhereJust you tell me and I'll be right thereA diamond that shinesLike a star in the skyIs nothing to beholdFor minuscule is any lightIf it can't like you brighten up my soulAnd for your loveI would do anythingJust to see the smile upon your faceFor your loveI would go anywhereJust you tell me and I'll be right thereI could have never fathomed thisSuch joy, love and tendernessThat you give to meFor the love I feel insideIt's so wonderful I can't hideAnd I glow, I glowWith just the thought of youI do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I doAnd for your loveI would do anythingJust to see the smile upon your faceFor your loveI would go anywhereJust you tell me and I'll be right there
