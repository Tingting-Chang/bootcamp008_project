Oh, send me off to warWith a gun in my handBut I won't pull the triggerOur destiny is hereBeneath the red, white and blueSo lead me to the slaughterNow don't be afraidCome and join the paradeFor the ultimate in sacrificeIt's an old-fashioned storyOf hope and of gloryA ticket for taking a life[Chorus:]I, I don't want to be a heroI don't want to die for youI don't want to be a heroOh send me off to warIn a far away landI never knew existedSubject me to the truthTo the horror and painUntil my mind is twistedAnd what if I failWill you put me in jailFor a murder I will not commit?'Cause you don't understandTill there's blood on your handsThat it's time to forget and forgive[Chorus]And those who returnCome back only to learnThat they're hated by those who they love'Cause you don't understandTill there's blood on your handsThat it's time to forget and forgive[Chorus]
