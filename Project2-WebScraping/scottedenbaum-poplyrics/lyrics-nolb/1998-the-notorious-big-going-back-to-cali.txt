I've been a bad, bad girlI've been careless with a delicate manAnd it's a sad, sad worldWhen a girl will break a boy just because she canDon't you tell me to deny itI've done wrong and I want to suffer for my sinsI've come to you 'cause I need guidance to be trueAnd I just don't know where I can beginWhat I need is a good defense'Cause I'm feeling like a criminalAnd I need to be redeemedTo the one I've sinned againstBecause he's all I ever knew of loveHeaven help me for the way I amSave me from these evil deeds before I get them doneI know tomorrow brings the consequence at handBut I keep living this day like the next will never comeOh help me but don't tell me to deny itI've got to cleanse myself of all these lies 'till I'm good enough for himI've got a lot to lose and I'm bettin' high so I'm begging youBefore it ends just tell me where to beginWhat I need is a good defense'Cause I'm feeling like a criminalAnd I need to be redeemedTo the one I've sinned againstBecause he's all I ever knew of loveLet me know the wayBefore there's hell to payGive me room to lay the law and let me goI've got to make a playTo make my lover staySo what would an angel say the devil wants to knowWhat I need is a good defense'Cause I'm feeling like a criminalAnd I need to be redeemedTo the one I've sinned againstBecause he's all I ever knew of loveWhat I need is a good defense'Cause I'm feeling like a criminalAnd I need to be redeemedTo the one I've sinned againstBecause he's all I ever knew of love
