Have you ever fed a lover with just your hands?Close your eyes and trust it, just trust itHave you ever thrown a fist full of glitter in the air?Have you ever looked fear in the faceAnd said I just don't care?And it's only half past the point of no returnThe tip of the icebergThe sun before the burnThe thunder before the lightningBreath before the phraseHave you ever felt this way?meaning byalli0423	These lyrics mean that humans feel all these emotions. These events are standard. Everyone remembers the breath before their first kiss. Everyone remembers…	See allHave you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?You're whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not aloneHave you ever been touched so gently you had to cry?Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside?It's only half past the point of oblivionThe hourglass on the tableThe walk before the runThe breath before the kissAnd the fear before the flamesHave you ever felt this way?La la la la la la la laThere you are, sitting in the gardenClutching my coffee,Calling me sugarYou called me sugarHave you ever wished for an endless night?Lassoed the moon and the stars and pulled that rope tightHave you ever held your breath and asked yourselfWill it ever get better than tonight?Tonight
