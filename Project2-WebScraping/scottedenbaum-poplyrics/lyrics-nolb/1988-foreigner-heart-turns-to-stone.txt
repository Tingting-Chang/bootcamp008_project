The days and nights you sit around wondering where can she beYou hope that she might appear, out of nowhereBut you fail to seeAll the hurt inside, the wounded prideOoh what she went through for youYou cheated and lied, as her love slowly diedAnd her heart just broke in twoWhen she was with you, all alongBehind you right or wrongShe tried to hold on, hold onBut you went too far, and she's goneAnd now it's over and her heart turns to stoneNo time for pity, when her heart turns to stoneShe cries a little as her heart turns to stoneShe's that kind of womanShe'll do fine on her ownWhat you thought was a gameA game you were winningWouldn't go your wayNow you've lost what you hadAnd your back to the beginningIt's the price you have to payWhen she was with you, all alongBehind you right or wrongShe tried to hold on, hold onBut you went too far, and she's goneAnd now it's over and her heart turns to stoneNo time for pity, when her heart turns to stoneShe cries a little as her heart turns to stoneShe's that kind of womanShe'll get by on her own
