I've been hit, I've been hit by your loveI've been hit, I've been hit by your loveI've been hit, I've been hit by your loveI've been hit, I've been hitCHORUS:I've been hit by your love and it's all that I seeSo much happiness now belongs to meI've been hit by your love for the very first timeAnd I know you're the one, baby you're mineIt turns out that we like the same moviesWe even like the same songsI can't believe that there is someone like youI can't believe I waited so longWhat we have is something so specialA connection I hope won't be broken too soonI just need you to tell me you love meSo I can be with youCHORUSI never thought that I needed anotherUntil the day I saw youEverything I said I didn't want wasIn front of me and so trueWhen you smiled I knew I was in for itYour sweet face told me all that I needed to knowFrom that moment I knew what love wasAnd I hope that you did tooCHORUSI'm hit, I'm hit by love, I'm hit,I'm hit by your love, babyI'm hit, I'm hit by love, I'm hit,I'm hit by your love, baby
