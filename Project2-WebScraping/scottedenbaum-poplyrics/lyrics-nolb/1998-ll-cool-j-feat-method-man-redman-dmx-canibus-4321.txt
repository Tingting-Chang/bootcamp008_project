Flowers and wine is what I thought I would findWhen I came home from working tonightWell now here I stand, over this frying panAnd you want a cold one againI bought these new heels, did my nailsHad my hair done just rightI thought this new dress was a sure betFor romance tonightWell it's perfectly clear, between the TV and beerI won't get so much as a kissAs I head for the door I turn around to be sureDid I shave my legs for thisNow when we first met you promised we'd getA house on a hill with a poolWell this trailer stays wet and we're swimmin' in debtAnd now you want me to go back to schoolI bought these new heels, did my nailsHad my hair done just rightI thought this new dress was a sure betFor romance tonightWell it's perfectly clear, between the TV and beerI won't get so much as a kissAs I head for the door I turn around to be sureDid I shave my legs for this?
