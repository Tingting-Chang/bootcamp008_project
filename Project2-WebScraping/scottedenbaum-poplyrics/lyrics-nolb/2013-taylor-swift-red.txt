Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end streetFaster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenlyLoving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fallLike the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it allLosing him was blue like I'd never knownMissing him was dark grey all aloneForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never metBut loving him was redLoving him was redTouching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of youMemorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite songFighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answerRegretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strongLosing him was blue like I'd never knownMissing him was dark gray all aloneForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never metBut loving him was redOh redBurning redRemembering him comes in flashbacks and echoesTell myself it's time now, gotta let goBut moving on from him is impossibleWhen I still see it all in my headBurning redBurning it was redOh losing him was blue like I'd never knownMissing him was dark gray all aloneForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met'Cause loving him was redYeah, yeah redWe're burning redAnd that's why he's spinning 'round in my headComes back to me, burning redYeah, yeahHis love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
