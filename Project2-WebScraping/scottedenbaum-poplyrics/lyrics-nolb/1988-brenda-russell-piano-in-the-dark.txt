When I find myself watching the timeI never think about all the funny things you saidI feel like it's deadWhere is it leading me nowI turn around in the still of the roomKnowing this is when I'm gonna make my moveCan't wait any longerAnd I'm feeling stronger but ohJust as I walk through the doorI can feel your emotionIt's pullin' me backBack to love youI know I'm caught up in the middleI cry just a littleWhen I think of letting goOh no, gave up on the riddleI cry just a littleWhen he plays piano in the darkHe holds me close like a thief of the heartHe plays a melodyBorn to tear me all apartThe silence is brokenAnd no words are spoken but ohJust as I walk through the doorI can feel your emotionIt's pullin' me backBack to love youI know I'm caught up in the middleI cry just a littleWhen I think of letting goOh no, gave up on the riddleI cry just a littleWhen he plays piano in the dark
