The real me is a southern girl with her Levis on and an open heartWish I could say the save the world, like I was super girlThe real me is to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about loveBut lately I've been jaded life got so complicatedI'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was likeDo you know what it feels like?'Cause with youI can let my hair downI can say anything crazyI know you'll catch me right before I hit the groundWith nothing but a T-shirt onI never felt so beautifulBaby as I do nowNow that I'm with youWith youNow that I'm with youYou speak and it's like a songAnd just like that all my walls come downIt's like a private joke just meant for us to knowI relate to you naturallyEverybody else just fades awaySometimes it's hard to breatheJust knowing you found me'Cause I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was likeDo you know what it feels like?'Cause with youI can let my hair downI can say anything crazyI know you'll catch me right before I hit the groundWith nothing but a T-shirt onI never felt so beautifulBaby as I do nowNow that I'm with youWith youCome and take meLove you save meLike nobody elseNow I can be myselfWith you
