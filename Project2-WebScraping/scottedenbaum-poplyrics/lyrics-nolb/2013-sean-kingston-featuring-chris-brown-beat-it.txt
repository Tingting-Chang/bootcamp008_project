Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohSaid goodbye, turned aroundAnd you were gone, gone, goneFaded into the setting sun,Slipped awayBut I won't cry'Cause I know I'll never be lonelyFor you are the stars to me,You are the light I followI will see you again, ohThis is not where it endsI will carry you with me, oh'Till I see you againOh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohI can hear those echoes in the wind at nightCalling me back in timeBack to youIn a place far awayWhere the water meets the skyThe thought of it makes me smileYou are my tomorrowI will see you again, ohThis is not where it endsI will carry you with me, oh'Till I see you againSometimes I feel my heart is breakingBut I stay strong and I hold on 'cause I knowI will see you again, ohThis is not where it endsI will carry you with me, yeah yeahI will see you again, ohThis is not where it endsI will carry you with me, oh'Till I see you againOh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh'Till I see you again (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)'Till I see you again yeah yeah yeah whoa'Till I see you againSaid goodbye turned aroundAnd you were gone, gone, gone.
