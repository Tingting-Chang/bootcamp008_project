Starin' out into the wild blue yonderSo many thoughts to sit and ponder'Bout life and love and lack ofAnd this emptiness in my heartToo old to be wild and free stillToo young to be over the hillShould I try to grow up?But who knows where to startSo I justSit right here and have another beer in MexicoDo my best to waste another daySit right here and have another beer in MexicoLet the warm air melt these blues awaySun comes up and sun sinks downAnd I seen 'em both in this tourist townUp for days in a rageJust tryin' to search my soulFrom the answers and the reasons whyI'm at these crossroads in my lifeAnd I really don't knowWhich way to goSo I justSit right here and have another beer in MexicoDo my best to waste another daySit right here and have another beer in MexicoLet the warm air melt these blues awayMaybe I'll settle down, get marriedOr stay single and stay freeWhich road I travelIs still a mystery to meSo I justSit right here and have another beer in MexicoDo my best to waste another daySit right here and have another beer in MexicoLet the warm air melt these blues awayDown in Mexico
