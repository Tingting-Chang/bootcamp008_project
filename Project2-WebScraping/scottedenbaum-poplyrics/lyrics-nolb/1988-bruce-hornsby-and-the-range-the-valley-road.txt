Just when I believed I couldn't ever want for moreThis ever changing world pushes me through another doorI saw you smileAnd my mind could not erase the beauty of your faceJust for awhileWon't you let me shelter youHold on to the nightsHold on to the memoriesI wish that I could give you something moreThat I could be yoursHow do we explain something that took us by surprisePromises in vain, love that is real but in disguiseWhat happens nowDo we break another ruleLet our lovers play the foolI don't know howTo stop feeling this wayHold on to the nightsHold on to the memoriesI wish that I could give you something moreThat I could be yoursWell, I think that I've been true to everybody else but meAnd the way I feel about you makes my heart long to be freeEvery time I look into your eyes, I'm helplessly awareThat the someone I've been searching for is right thereHold on to the nightsHold on to the memoriesI wish that I could give you moreHold on to the nights
