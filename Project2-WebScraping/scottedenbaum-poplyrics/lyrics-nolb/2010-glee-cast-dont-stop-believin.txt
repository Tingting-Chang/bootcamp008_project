Just a small town girlLivin' in a lonely worldShe took the midnight train goin' anywhereJust a city boyBorn and raised in South DetroitHe took the midnight train goin' anywhereA singer in a smokey roomThe smell of wine and cheap perfumeFor a smile they can share the nightIt goes on and on and on and onStrangers waitingUp and down the boulevardTheir shadows searchin' in the nightStreetlights, peopleLivin' just to find emotionHidin' somewhere in the nightWorkin' hard to get my fillEverybody wants a thrillPayin' anythin' to roll the diceJust one more timeSome will win, some will loseSome are born to sing the bluesOh, the movie never endsIt goes on and on and on and onStrangers waitingUp and down the boulevardTheir shadows searchin' in the nightStreetlights, peopleLivin' just to find emotionHidin' somewhere in the nightDon't stop believin'Hold on to that feelin'Streetlights, peopleDon't stop believin'Hold on to that feelin'Streetlights, peopleDon't stop!
