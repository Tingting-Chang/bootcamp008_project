I can't tell ya baby what went wrongI can't make you feel what you felt so long agoI'll let it showI can't give you back what's been hurtHeartaches come and go and all that's left are the wordsI can't let goIf we take some time to think it over babyTake some time, let me knowIf you really want to goDon't know what you got till it's goneDon't know what it is I did so wrongNow I know what I gotIt's just this songAnd it ain't easy to get backTakes so longI can't feel the things that cause you painI can't clear my heart of your love it falls like rainAin't the sameI hear you calling far awayTearing through my soul I just can't take another dayWho's to blameIf we take some time to think it over babyTake some time let me knowIf you really want to goDon't know what you got till it's goneDon't know what it is I did so wrongNow I know what I gotIt's just this songAnd it ain't easy to get backTakes so longDo you want to see me beggin' babyCan't you give me just one more dayCan't you see my heart's been draggin' latelyI've been lookin' for the words to sayDon't know what you got till it's goneDon't know what it is I did so wrongNow I know what I gotIt's just this songAnd it ain't easy to get backTakes so longDon't know what you got till it's gone noDon't know what it is I did so wrongNow I know what I gotIt's just this songAnd it ain't easy to get backTakes so long
