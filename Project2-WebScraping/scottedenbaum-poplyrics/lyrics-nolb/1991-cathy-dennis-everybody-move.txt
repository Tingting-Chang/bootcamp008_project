Gold chains and shiny ringsAn eye opening sight in the fading nightShe knows they're watchingAs her hips breathe in for their second skinSomebody better get out a warningSomebody better start making roomDeep in the night I hear you callingTigers eyes can see you running[Chorus]Everybody move, let my love come throughThrough your body to mineEverybody move, there's no one but youAnd you're gonna be mineJust back from BombayThere are no frontiers now I know you're hereA telegram from a party manWe can dance all night 'cause it feels so rightSomebody better get out a warningSomebody better start making roomDeep in the night I hear you callingTigers eyes can see you running[Chorus]Got a feeling that he's looking at meThe people's idol and someone to envyI've gotta tell him the way I'm feelingThe way I'm feeling, so good, so goodSomebody better get out a warningSomebody better start making roomDeep in the night when I hear you callingTigers eyes can see you running[Chorus: x4]Everybody, everybody moveEverybodyEverybody, everybody moveEverybodyEverybody, everybody moveEverybodyEverybody, everybody moveEverybodyEverybody, everybody moveEverybodyEverybody, everybody moveEverybodyEverybody, everybody moveEverybody
