Some saw the sunSome saw the smokeSome heard the gunSome bent the bowSometimes the wire must tense for the noteCaught in the fire, say ohWe're about to explodeCarry your world, I'll carry your worldCarry your world, I'll carry your worldSome far awaySome search for goldSome dragon to slayHeaven we hope is just up the roadShow me the way, Lord, 'cause I, I'm about to explodeCarry your world, I'll carry your worldCarry your world, I'll carry your worldCarry your world, and all your hurt(Carry your world, carry your world)
