Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while,Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies.Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst,Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?Let us die young or let us live foreverWe don't have the power, but we never say neverSitting in a sandpit, life is a short tripThe music's for the sad man.Can you imagine when this race is won?Turn our golden the faces into the sun,Praising our leaders, we're getting in tuneThe music's played by the, the madman.Forever young,I want to be forever young.Do you really want to live forever?Forever, and everForever young,I want to be forever youngDo you really want to live forever?Forever young.Some are like water, some are like the heatSome are a melody and some are the beatSooner or later they all will be goneWhy don't they stay young?It's so hard to get old without a causeI don't want to perish like a fading horseYouth's like diamonds in the sun,And diamonds are foreverSo many adventures given up today,So many songs we forgot to play.So many dreams swinging out of the blueOh let it come true.Forever young,I want to be forever young.Do you really want to live forever,Forever, and ever?Forever young,I want to be forever young.Do you really want to live forever,Forever, and ever?Forever youngI want to be forever youngDo you really want to live forever,Forever young
