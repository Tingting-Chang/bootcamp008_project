She walks down the street a-knockin' 'em deadStore window dummies even turn their headsSho' 'nuff, powerful stuffWhen I saw her I burned my black bookMade a blind man take a second lookSho' 'nuff I think I'm in loveAnd that's Powerful StuffNaugahide skirt, black stacked heelsRed copper hair, dig the wig it's unrealSho' 'nuff, powerful stuffOle man Atlas holding up the worldHe'd drop everything for that girlSho' 'nuff. I think I'm in loveAnd it's Powerful StuffHer hip shakin' whip snakin' cooked my gooseI tell you that babe she's a fine papoose.I love her mind, but here's the dealShe's got the kind of girl who rides the manmobileShe opens up her eyes and turns on the juicePullin' like a magnet and she don't turn looseSho' 'nuff, powerful stuffWhen she starts rockin'don't touch that dialShe's a hundred-mega-kilowattWoman childSho' 'nuff I think I'm in loveThink I'm in love-I think I'm in loveAnd that's powerful stuff
