In my daughter's eyes,I am a hero,I am strong and wise,And I know no fear,But the truth is plain to see,She was sent to rescue me,I see who I want to be,In my daughter's eyesIn my daughter's eyes,Everyone is equal,Darkness turns to light,And the world is at peace,This miracle God gave to me,Gives me strength when I am weak,I find reason to believe,In my daughter's eyesAnd when she wraps her hand around my finger,How it puts a smile in my heart,Everything becomes a little clearer,I realize what life is all about,It's hanging on when your heart is had enough,It's giving more when you feel like giving up,I've seen the light,It's in my daughter's eyesIn my daughter's eyes,I can see the future,A reflection of who I am and what will be,And though she'll grow and someday leave,Maybe raise a family,When I'm gone I hope you'll see,How happy she made me,For I'll be there,In my daughter's eyes
