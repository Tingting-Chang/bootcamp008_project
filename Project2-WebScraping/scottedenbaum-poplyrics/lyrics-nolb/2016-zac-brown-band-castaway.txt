Pour me another oneMake it a strong oneWe're gonna have some fun tonightI wanna be a castawayAnd leave the world behindTake a tropic holidaySay goodbye to keeping timeWasting away down by the coastPacifico and chasing limeEasy living down in paradisePour me another oneMake it a strong oneWe're gonna have some fun tonightJust like the other oneMake it a double rumWe're gonna castaway tonightI'm in an island state of mindDon't think I'm ever gonna leaveI'd rather stay and watch the wavesMove the sand beneath my feetReggae on the radioLaying low and feeling highEasy living down in paradisePour me another oneMake it a strong oneWe're gonna have some fun tonightJust like the other oneMake it a double rumWe're gonna castaway tonightCastawayRide the waves like we're young'Cause time flies by and soon we'll be olderIt's better to live in the momentThan stuck in the pastFast asleep as the world passes byAy ay yoWhere reality is historyOh yo ehCome and castaway with meAy ay yoThe good times are free andNobody can take that awayOh yo ehCome and castaway with mePour me another one(Smiling in the islands, I've been)Make it a strong oneWe're gonna have some fun tonight(For a little while I'll be a castawayGonna let the sun shine in)Just like the other one(Smiling in the islands, I've been)Make it a double rumWe're gonna castaway tonight(For a little while I'll be a castawayGonna let the sunshine in)Pour me another oneMake it a strong oneWe're gonna have some fun tonightJust like the other oneMake it a double rumWe're gonna castaway tonight
