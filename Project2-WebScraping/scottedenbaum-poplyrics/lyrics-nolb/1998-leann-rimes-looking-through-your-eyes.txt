Look at the skyTell me what do you seeJust close your eyesAnd describe it to meThe heavens are sparklingWith starlight tonightThat's what I seeThrough your eyesI see the heavensEach time that you smileI hear your heartbeatJust go on for milesAnd suddenly I knowMy life is worth whileThat's what I seeThrough your eyesHere in the nightI see the sunHere in the darkOur two hearts are oneIt's out of our handsWe can't stop what we have begunAnd love just took me by surpriseLooking through your eyesI look at myselfAnd instead I see usWhoever I am nowIt feels like enoughAnd I see a girlWho is learning to trustThat's who I see through your eyesHere in the nightI see the sunHere in the darkOur two hearts are oneIt's out of our handsWe can't stop what we have begunAnd love just took me by surpriseLooking through your eyesAnd there are some things we don't knowSometimes a heart just needs to goAnd there is so much that I'll rememberUnderneath the open sky with you foreverHere in the nightI see the sunHere in the darkOur two hearts are oneIt's out of our handsWe can't stop what we have begunAnd love just took me by surpriseLooking through your eyesLooking through your eyes
