I told you I was sorry I told you I was wrongI said it was an accident and don't tell anyone.But you love to circle round and round you're so misunderstood.Yeah you love to circle round and round & you know that we shouldForget about itLet's forget about itYou lied about how much you knew I thought you were my friend.You lied upon the mattress c'mon tell me where you've been.You lied about this night apart, you lied about the room.If you're gonna have to lie to me thenLet's forget about itLet's forget about itI'll stop crying on the mountain that we made from a molehill where weSpilt the milk.So you say this never happened, perhaps not the way I thought.Did I throw this out of focus - or was it just the way we fought?That is seemed to me you this girl, but you swear to God it's not.Let's forget about itLet's forget about itI'll stop crying, if you'll stop.I'll stop crying, if you'll stop.I'll stop crying, if you'll stop lying to me.
