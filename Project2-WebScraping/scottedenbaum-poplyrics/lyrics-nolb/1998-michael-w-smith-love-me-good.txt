Sometimes I feel like this worldIs just one big gigantic merry-go-roundYou gotta hold on tight or you get hurled through the airYeah, life is a three-ring circusWith clowns and freaks and camels and suchAnd you never know when you might be attacked by the bears[Chorus]Give me love, give me love, love me goodSometimes I feel likeI'm afraid of my own shadow and thenSometimes I can feel as bold as Genghis KhanBut I could never live in a yurtOn a diet of Mongolian barbecueI conquer the world for a moment, then the moment is goneChorusBridge:Let us take a moment now to bow our heads and prayIf only to give thanks for making it through another daySometimes I wish I was in a movieOr some 70's TV thingWhere everything gets neatly wrapped by the end of the showYeah, but this ain't HollywoodAnd this sure ain't the Brady BunchAnd how this plot's gonna all pan out, I don't really knowChorus
