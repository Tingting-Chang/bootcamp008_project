Over MountainsOver TreesOver OceansOver SeasI'll be thereIn a whisper on the windOn the smile of a new friendJust think of meAnd I'll be thereDon't be afraid, oh my loveI'll be watching you from aboveAnd I'd give all the world tonight,To be with youBecause I'm on your side,And I still careI may have died,But I've gone nowhereJust think of me,And I'll be thereOn the edge of a waking dreamOver RiversOver StreamsThrough Wind and RainI'll be thereAcross the wide and open skyThousands of miles I'd flyTo be with youI'll be thereDon't be afraid, oh my loveI'll be watching you from aboveAnd I'd give all the world tonight,To be with youBecause I'm on your side,And I still careI may have died,But I've gone nowhereJust think of me,And I'll be thereIn the breath of a wind that sighsOh, there's no need to cryJust think of me,And I'll be there
