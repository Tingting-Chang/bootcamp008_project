Running with the streetlights,Laughing in the graveHe swears he's gonna give it up, it's never gonna be enoughI just wanna be there when you're all alone, thinkin' 'bout a better day,When you had it in your bonesThis could be the endThis could be the endThis could be the endThis could be the endI see you in the evening, sitting on your throne.Prayin' with a fireball, and posted up against the wallI just wanna hold you, take you by your hands and tell you that you're good enough,And tell you that it's gonna be toughThis could be the endThis could be the endThis could be the endThis could be the end'Cause I ain't got a homeRunnin' from the streetlightsShinin' on a graveOnce you had the good stuff, never gonna fill you upI wanna be the one who gives them all the worldAnd gives em all the feelin' of it, just a little taste of itThis could be the endThis could be the endThis could be the endThis could be the end'Cause I ain't got a homeI'll forever roam, no I ain't got a homeOut there all aloneI ain't got a homeI'll forever roamNo I ain't got a homeI'll forever roamI ain't got a home
