Every night it's the sameI hear you callin' my nameYou're lyin' next to meI give into your charmsYou disappear in my armsI realize it's just a dream, but[Chorus]Desperately, I long to feel your touchBut you left me all alone in loveAnd now IShake the sleep from my headAnd try to crawl out of bedToday is just another dayI make the coffee for oneI turn the radio onPretend that everything's ok, but[Chorus]And now IKnow there's no reason to smileIt's gonna take me awhile'Cause I still love you desperately[Chorus]And now IWatch the sun goin' downThere ain't nobody aroundI feel a night in the breezeI keep on tellin' myselfI don't need nobody elseAnd I can do as I please, but[Chorus]And now I[Chorus]And nowEvery night it's the sameI hear you callin' my nameI still love you desperatelyI still love youI still want youI still love you desperately
