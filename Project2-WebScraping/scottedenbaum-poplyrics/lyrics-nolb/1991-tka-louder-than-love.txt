Remember when we said goodbyeI wiped my tears, you didn't cryWe both said things we didn't meanReaching for the hope, but caught between the screamsAnd I would try to calm you downBut you wouldn't listenAnd now I find you're not aroundAnd its your love I'm missin'[Chorus]Louder than loveLouder than loveThat's what we were, we wereLouder than loveAnd we couldn't make things betterLouder than loveLouder than lovethat's what we were, we wereLouder than loveAnd we couldn't stay togetherIf we could both go back in timeBack to the days when you were mineWe vowed to try, but who's to sayThat the love we shared would ever be the sameMaybe someday we'll both learnJust how fragile love isThe mind forgets, while the heart still burnsAs it longs for your kiss[Chorus]Through the things that we saidAnd the dreams that we shared, love stayed(We never let it fade)But we both went too farWe're both left with the scars of loveOh, oh, ohNow we must go our separate ways, my loveOh,[Chorus]
