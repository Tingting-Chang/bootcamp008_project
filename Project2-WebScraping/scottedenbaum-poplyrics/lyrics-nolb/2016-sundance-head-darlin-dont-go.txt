Darlin' don't goAnd leave me all by myselfI don't thinkI can make it without youWell I know it was wrongTo ever treat you that wayWill I promise, I will never do it againLord I know what they say it's true, babyI could never live one day without youPlease come homeMy heart is on the floorWhen I walk in circles over youAll I know is I was wrongTo ever treat you that wayWell I'll promise I will never do it againLord I know what they say it's true, babyAnd I could never live one day without youPlease come home
