Listen to the song here in my heartA melody I start but can't completeListen to the sound from deep withinIt's only beginning to find releaseOh the time has come for my dreams to be heardThey will not be pushed aside and turnedInto your own, all 'cause you won't listen[Chorus]ListenI am alone at a crossroadsI'm not at home in my own homeAnd I've tried and triedTo say what's on my mindYou should have known ohNow I'm done believing youYou don't know what I'm feelingI'm more than whatYou've made of meI followed the voice, you gave to meBut now I've gotta find my ownYou should have listenedI don't know where I belongBut I'll be moving onIf you don't, if you won'tListen to the song here in my heartA melody I start, but I will completeOH now I am done believing youYou don't know not what I am feelingI'm more than what you've made of meI followed the voice you think you gave to meBut now I got to find my ownMy Own
