Sparks flyIt's like electricityI might dieWhen I forget how to breatheYou get closer and there'sNowhere in this world I'd rather beTime stopsLike everything around meIt's frozenAnd nothing matters but theseFew moments when you open my mind to thingsI've never seen'Cause when I'm kissin' youMy senses come aliveAlmost like the puzzle pieceI've been trying to findFalls right into placeYou're all that it takesMy doubts fade awayWhen I'm kissin' youWhen I'm kissin' youIt all starts making senseAnd all the questionsI'm asking in my headLike are you the one should I really trustCrystal clear it becomesWhen I'm kissin' youPast lovesThey never got very farWalls upMade sure I'm guarding my heartAnd I promised I wouldn't do this'Til I knew it was right for meBut no one (no one)No guy that I met beforeCould make me (make me)Feel so right and secureAnd have you noticedI lose my focusAnd the world around me disappears'Cause when I'm kissin' youMy senses come aliveAlmost like the puzzle pieceI've been trying to findFalls right into placeYou're all that it takesMy doubts fade awayWhen I'm kissin' youWhen I'm kissin' youIt all starts making senseAnd all the questionsI've been asking in my headLike are you the one should I really trustCrystal clear it becomesWhen I'm kissin' youI've never felt nothing like thisYou're making me open upNo point in even trying to fight thisIt kinda feels like it's love'Cause when I'm kissin' youMy senses come aliveAlmost like the puzzle pieceI've been trying to findFalls right into placeYou're all that it takesMy doubts fade awayWhen I'm kissin' youWhen I'm kissin' youIt all starts making senseAnd all the questionsI've been asking in my headLike are you the one should I really trustCrystal clear it becomesWhen I'm kissin' you
