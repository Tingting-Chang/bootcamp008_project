I can feel her breathAs she's sleeping next to meSharing pillows and cold feetShe can feel my heartFell asleep to its beatUnder blankets and warm sheetsIf only I could be in that bed againIf only it were me instead of himDoes he watch your favorite movies?Does he hold you when you cry?Does he let you tell him all your favorite partsWhen you've seen it a million times?Does he sing to all your musicWhile you dance to Purple Rain?Does he do all these thingsLike I used to?Fourteen months and seven days agoOh, I know you knowHow we felt about that nightJust your skin against the windowOh we took it slowAnd we both knowIt should have been me inside that carIt should have been me instead of him in the darkDoes he watch your favorite movies?Does he hold you when you cry?Does he let you tell him all your favorite partsWhen you've seen it a million times?Does he sing to all your musicWhile you dance to Purple Rain?Does he do all these thingsLike I used to?I know love(I'm a sucker for that feeling)Happens all the time, love(I always end up feeling cheated)You're on my mind, love(Oh darling, I know I'm not needed)It happens all the time, love, yeahWill he love you like I loved you?Will he tell you every day?Will he make you feel like you're invincibleWith every word he'll say?Can you promise me if this was right,Don't throw it all away?Can you do all these things?Will you do all these thingsLike we used to?Oh, like we used to
