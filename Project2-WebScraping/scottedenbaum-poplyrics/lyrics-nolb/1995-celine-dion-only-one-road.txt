I'm looking back through the yearsDown this highwayMemories they all lead up to this one dayAnd many dreams lost along the wayHaunt me stillI guess they always willWhen love was too much to bearI just left it thereBut here I stand face to faceWith this heart of mineLivin' without you I only fall behindWe had a love most people never findAll this time I never realizedAnd the courage I finally foundHas made me turn around[Chorus]There is only one road I'm walkin'Only one lifetime one heart to guide meOnly one road I'm walkin'But I'm gonna run back, I'm gonna run back'Cause I need you right hereBeside meI can still hear the song of your laughterI can still taste the sorrow of your tearsWe said goodbye but our hearts did not hearNow my love there's nothing left to fearWith all my heart put me throughIt leads me back to you[Chorus: x2]But I'm gonna run back, I'm gonna run back'Cause I need you right hereBeside me
