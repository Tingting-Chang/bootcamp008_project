It's not easy saying this to youIt's the hardest thing I've ever had to doBut boy before you goI want you to knowI wish you strength,When times are hardOh I wish with all my heartYou find just what your looking forI wish you joyI wish you peaceAnd that every star you see is within your reachAnd I wish you still loved meI wish that things were different,You know thatBut I'm still happy for the times we hadYou mean the world to meOh baby please believeI wish you strength,When times are hardOh I wish with all my heartYou find just what your looking forI wish you joyI wish you peaceAnd that every star you see is within your reachAnd I wish you still loved meOh losing you is tearing me apartBut part of me will be with youNo matter where you areI wish you strength,When times are hardOh I wish with all my heartYou find just what your looking forI wish you joyI wish you peaceAnd that every star you see is within your reachAnd I wish you still loved meOh I wish you still love me
