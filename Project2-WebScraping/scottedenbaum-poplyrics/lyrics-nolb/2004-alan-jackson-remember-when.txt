Remember when I was young and so were youAnd time stood still and love was all we knewYou were the first, so was IWe made love and then you criedRemember whenRemember when we vowed the vows and walked the walkGave our hearts, made the start, it was hardWe lived and learned, life threw curvesThere was joy, there was hurtRemember whenRemember when old ones died and new were bornAnd life was changed, disassembled, rearrangedWe came together, fell apartAnd broke each other's heartsRemember whenRemember when the sound of little feetWas the music we danced to week to weekBrought back the love, we found trustVowed we'd never give it upRemember whenRemember when thirty seemed so oldNow lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stoneTo where we are, where we've beenSaid we'd do it all againRemember whenRemember when we said when we turned grayWhen the children grow up and move awayWe won't be sad, we'll be gladFor all the life we've hadAnd we'll remember whenRemember whenRemember when
