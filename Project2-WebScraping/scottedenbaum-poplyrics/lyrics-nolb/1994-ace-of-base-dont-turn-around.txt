If you want to leaveI won't beg you to stayAnd if you gotta go darlingMaybe it's better that wayI'm gonna be strongI'm gonna do fineDon't worry about this heart of mineJust walk out that doorSee if I careGo on and go now butDon't turn around'Cause you're gonna see my heart breakingDon't turn aroundI don't want you seeing me cryJust walk awayIt's tearing me apartThat you're leavingI'm letting you goBut I won't let you knowI won't let you knowI won't miss your arms around meHolding me tightAnd if you ever think about meJust know that I'll be alrightI'm gonna be strongI'm gonna do fineDon't worry about this heart of mineI will surviveI'll make it throughI'll even learn to live without youDon't turn around'Cause you're gonna see my heart breakingDon't turn aroundI don't want you seeing me cryJust walk awayIt's tearing me apartThat you're leavingI'm letting you goBut I won't let you knowI wish I could scream out loudThat I love youI wish I could say to youDon't goAs he walks away he feels the pain getting strongPeople in your life they don't know what's going onToo proud to turn around, he's goneDon't turn around'Cause you're gonna see my heart breakingDon't turn aroundI don't want you seeing me cryJust walk awayIt's tearing me apartThat you're leavingI'm letting you goBaby don't turn aroundDon't turn aroundJust walk awayIt's tearing me apartThat you're leavingI'm letting you goDon't turn around
