He was sitting there beside me throwing doubles downWhen he ordered up his third one he looked aroundThen he looked at meAnd said, "I do believeI'll have one more."He said, "I hate this bar and I hate to drink,But on second thought, tonight I think, I hate everything."Then he opened up his billfold and threw a twenty down,And a faded photograph fell out and hit the ground.I picked it up,He said, "thank you, bud."I put it in his hand.He said, "I probably oughta throw this one away'cause she's the reason I feel this way.I hate everything."I hate my jobAnd I hate my lifeAnd if it weren't for my two kidsI'd hate my ex wife.I know I should move on and try to start again,But I just can't get over her leaving me for him.Then he shook his head, looked down at his ring, said, "I hate everything."Said, "that one bedroom apartment where I get my mail,Is really not a home, it's more like a jail,With a swimming pool, and a parking lot view.Man, it's just great.I hate summer, winter, fall and spring.Red and yellow, purple, blue and green.I hate everything."I hate my jobAnd I hate my lifeAnd if it weren't for my two kidsI'd hate my ex wife.I know I should move on and try to start again,But I just can't get over her leaving me for him.Then he shook his head, looked down at his ring, said, "I hate everything."So I pulled out my phone and I called my house.I said, "Babe, I'm coming home, we're gonna work this out."I payed for his drinksAnd I told him thanksThanks for everything.
