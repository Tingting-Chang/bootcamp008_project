Somebody somewhere turns out the lightSomebody all alone faces the nightYou got to be strong when you're out on your own'Cause sooner or later we all sleep aloneNobody nowhere holds the key to your heartWhen love's a possession it'll tear you apartYou may have lovers wherever you roamBut sooner or later we all sleep aloneOh, the young and the young at heart waitBut the wait never ends in the soulWhen you feel like it's all blown awayIndependence has come and into the night I goDon't make no promises I can't keepI won't be no prisoner of somebody's needsYou know I have lovers wherever you roamBut sooner or later, oo, we all sleep aloneWe all sleep alone, yeah, yeahWe all sleep alone, we all sleep alone
