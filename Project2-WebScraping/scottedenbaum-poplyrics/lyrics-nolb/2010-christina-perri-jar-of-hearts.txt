No, I can't take one more step towards you'Cause all that's waiting is regretAnd don't you know I'm not your ghost anymoreYou lost the loveI loved the mostI learned to live, half aliveAnd now you want me one more timeAnd who do you think you are?Runnin' round leaving scarsCollecting your jar of heartsAnd tearing love apartYou're gonna catch a coldFrom the ice inside your soulSo don't come back for meWho do you think you are?I hear you're asking all aroundIf I am anywhere to be foundBut I have grown too strongTo ever fall back in your armsI've learned to live, half-aliveAnd now you want me one more timeAnd who do you think you are?Runnin round leaving scarsCollecting your jar of heartsAnd tearing love apartYou're gonna catch a coldFrom the ice inside your soulSo don't come back for meWho do you think you are?Dear, it took so long just to feel alrightRemember how to put back the light in my eyesI wish I had missed the first time that we kissed'Cause you broke all your promisesAnd now you're backYou don't get to get me backAnd who do you think you are?Runnin' round leaving scarsCollecting your jar of heartsAnd tearing love apartYou're gonna catch a coldFrom the ice inside your soulSo don't come back for meDon't come back at allAnd who do you think you are?Runnin round leaving scarsCollecting your jar of heartsAnd tearing love apartYou're gonna catch a coldFrom the ice inside your soulDon't come back for meDon't come back at allWho do you think you are?Who do you think you are?Who do you think you are?
