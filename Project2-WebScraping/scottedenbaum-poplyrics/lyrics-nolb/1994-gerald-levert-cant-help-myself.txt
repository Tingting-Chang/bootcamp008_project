There comes a time in a man's lifeWhen he's tired of the games messingAroundHe needs a good woman to settle downAnd I'm at that time in my lifeAnd I found what I needed in youI swear I'll always be trueAfter searching and searching andSearchingWhat treasure I found in youSo baby I'm ready say you'll be my ladyAnd I'll give my all to you[Chorus]I just can't help myselfI'll tell the world I love you I love youI don't want no one elseI just can't help myselfI want us to have a familyA girl for you a boy for meA great big old houseBaby just wait and seeI know you're wondering if I'm seriousOh girl it's for real this feeling I feelDo me a favor girl give me your trustI've had time to think it overAnd if you think that I'm letting you goBaby you must be crazy I'm gonna let youKnow[Chorus: x 2]I ain't trying to find nobodyTo take the place of you'cause there is no other girlIn the whole wide worldWho can do the things that you doOh baby I'll run around tellin all myFriendsThat I'll never find another like you againI just can't help myselfAnd I don't want to help myself[Chorus: x 2]
