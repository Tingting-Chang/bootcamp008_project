Well, the key to my survivalWas never in much doubtThe question was how I could keep saneTrying to find the way outThings were never easy for mePeace of mind was hard to findAnd I needed a place where I could hideSomewhere I could call mineI didn't think much about itTill it started happening all the timeSoon I was living with the fear everydayOf what might happen at nightI couldn't stand to hear theCrying of my motherAnd I remember whenI swore that, that would be theLast they'd see of meAnd I never went home againThey say time is a healerAnd now my wounds are not the sameI rang the bell with my heart in my mouthI had to hear what he'd sayHe sat me down to talk to meHe looked me straight in the eyesHe said:"You're no son, you're no son of mineYou're no son, you're no son of mineYou walked out, you left us behindAnd you're no son, you're no son of mine"Oh his words how they hurt meI'll never forget itAnd as the time, it went byI lived to regret itYou're no son, you're no son of mineBut where should I goPlease tell me what should I doYou're no son, you're no son of mineBut I came here for helpOh I was looking for youWell the years they passed so slowlyI thought about him everydayWhat would I do, if we passed on the streetWould I keep running awayIn and out of hiding placesSoon I'd have to face the factsWe'd have to sit down and talk it overAnd that would mean going backThey say time is a healerAnd now my wounds are not the sameI rang the bell with my heart in my mouthI had to hear what he'd sayHe sat me down to talk to meHe looked me straight in the eyesHe said:"You're no son, you're no son of mineYou're no son, you're no son of mineYou walked out, you left us behindAnd you're no son, you're no son of mine"Oh his words how they hurt meI'll never forget itAnd as the time, it went byI lived to regret itYou're no son, you're no son of mineBut where should I goPlease tell me what should I doYou're no son, you're no son of mineBut I came here for helpOh I was looking for you
