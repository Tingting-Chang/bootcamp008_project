The Southern wind sings again an island lullabyBaby powder beach under my feet has got me rollingAnd the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burningAnd the ship is off to seaAnd the wake it is a churningAs the Southern wind sings again an island lullabyYou can jump right inLet the music pull you inYou can jump right inOh and lose yourself againAs the Southern wind sings again a island lullabyThere's a place the locals go and no one knows where to find itAnd the river starts to flow inside the clouds of Misty MountainThe water from this stone below becomes a blue-green fountainAs the Southern wind sings again an island lullabyYou can jump right inLet the music pull you inYou can jump right inOh and lose yourself againAs the Southern wind sings again an island lullabyYou can find me where the music meets the oceanIf you get the notion, stop on by and play a whileSimple tune to get your love light glowingKeep your heart wide openDisappear just like the tideLet it roll on byAnd jump right inLet the music pull you inYou can jump right inOh and lose yourself againAs the Southern wind sings again an island lullabyThe Southern wind sings again an island lullabyIsland lullaby
