I'm really close tonightAnd I feel like I'm moving inside herLying in the darkAn' I think that I'm beginning to know herLet it goI'll be there when you callAnd whenever I fall at your feetYou let your tears rain down on meWhenever I touch your slow turning painYou're hiding from me nowThere's something in the way that you're talkingWords don't sound rightBut I hear them all moving inside youGo, I'll be waiting when you callAnd whenever I fall at your feetYou let your tears rain down on meWhenever I touch your slow turning painThe finger of blame has turned upon itselfAnd I'm more than willing to offer myselfDo you want my presence or need my helpWho knows where that might leadI fallWhenever I fall at your feetYou let your tears rain down on meWhenever I fallWhenever I fall
