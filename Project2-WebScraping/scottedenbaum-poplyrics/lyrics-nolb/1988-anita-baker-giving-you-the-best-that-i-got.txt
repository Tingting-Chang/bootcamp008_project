Ain't there something I can give youIn exchange for everything you give to meRead my mind and make me feel just fineWhen I think my peace of mind is outof reachThe scales are sometimes unbalancedAnd you bear the weight of all that has to beI hope you see that you can lean on meAnd together we can calm a stormy seaWe love so strong and so unselfishlyAnd I tell you now that I made a vowI'm giving you the best that I got, babyYes I tell you now, that I made a vowI'm giving you the best that I got, honeyEverybody's got opinionsAbout the way they think our story's gonna endSome folks feel it's just a superficial thrillEverybody's gonna have to think againWe love so strong and so unselfishlyThey don't bother me so I'm gonna keep onGiving you the best that I got, babyThey don't bother me, said I'm gonna keep onGiving you the best that I got, listen babySomebody understands meSomebody gave his heart to meI stumbled my whole life longAlways on my own, now I'm homeMy weary mind is restedAnd I feel as if my home is in your armsFears are all gone, I like the sound of your songAnd I think I want to sing it foreverWe love so strong and so unselfishlyAnd I made a vow so I tell you nowI'm giving you the best that I got, babyI bet everything on my wedding ringI'm giving you the best that I got,Givin' it to you baby
