This is the last time you sayAfter the last line you breakIt's not even a holidayNothing to celebrateYou give a hundred reasons whyAnd you say you're really gonna tryIf I had a nickel for every timeI'd own the bankThought that I was the exceptionI could reroute your addictionYou could've been the greatestBut you'd rather get wastedYou fall asleep during foreplayCause the pills you take are more your forteI'm not sticking around to watch you go downWanna be your lover, not your fucking motherCan't be your savior; I don't have the powerI'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drainWatch you circle the drainWatch you circle the drainYou say you have to write your rhymesWhatever helps you sleep at nightYou've become what you despiseA stereotypeYou think you're so rock and rollBut you're really just a jokeHad the world in the palm of your handsBut you fucking chokedShould've been my team mateCould've changed your fateYou say that you love meYou won't remember in the morningYou fall asleep during foreplayCause the pills you take are more your forteI'm not sticking around to watch you go downWanna be your lover, not your fucking motherCan't be your savior; I don't have the powerI'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drainWatch you circle the drainWatch you circle the drainYou fall asleep during foreplayCause the pills you take are more your forteI'm not sticking around to watch you go downWanna be your lover, not your fucking motherCan't be your savior; I don't have the powerI'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drainWatch you circle the drainWatch you circle the drainWatch you circle the drainWatch you circle the drainYou fall asleep during foreplayCause the pills you take are more your forteI'm not sticking around to watch you go down
