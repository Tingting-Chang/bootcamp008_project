I was so high, I did not recognizeThe fire burning in her eyesThe chaos that controlled my mindWhispered goodbye as she got on a planeNever to return againBut always in my heartThis love has taken its toll on meShe said goodbye too many times beforeAnd her heart is breaking in front of meI have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore, woah, woah, woahI tried my best to feed her appetiteKeep her coming every nightSo hard to keep her satisfiedOh, kept playing love like it was just a gamePretending to feel the sameThen turn around and leave againBut, oh, this love has taken its toll on meShe said goodbye too many times beforeAnd her heart is breaking in front of meI have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore woah, woah, woahI'll fix these broken thingsRepair your broken wingsAnd make sure everything is alrightMy pressure on your hipsSinking my fingertipsInto every inch of you'Cause I know that's what you want me to doThis love has taken its toll on meShe said goodbye too many times beforeHer heart is breaking in front of meI have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymoreThis love has taken its toll on meShe said goodbye too many times beforeMy heart is breaking in front of meShe said goodbye too many times beforeThis love has taken its toll on meShe said goodbye too many times beforeHer heart is breaking in front of meI have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
