I need a saving graceA hiding placeI don't have forever or time to wasteSo don't let me be lonelyI wanna shake this winter coat off my sleeveDust off a record and just be freeOh don't let me be lonelyNo don't let me be lonelyWhen you're youngYou can flyBut we trip on clouds 'cause we get too highWe grow upAnd then it's goneOh God only knows what we'll becomeSo don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonightWhile we're young and aliveTake the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just driveOh don't let me, let me be lonelyWell the night rolls on like a long lost friendTil the sunrise bleeds like the bitter endDon't let me be lonelyWell there's nothing to hide and nothing to proveGive me all that you areYou've got nothing to loseJust don't let me be lonelyNo don't let me be lonelySo don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonightWhile we're young and aliveTake the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just driveOh don't let me, let me be lonelyNoDon't let me beWhen you're youngLife's a dreamIt's a beautiful and a burning thingWe grow upAnd then it's goneBut the memory goes on and on and on and on and on and onDon't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonightWhile we're young and aliveTake the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just driveOh don't let me, let me be lonelyDon't let me be lonely
