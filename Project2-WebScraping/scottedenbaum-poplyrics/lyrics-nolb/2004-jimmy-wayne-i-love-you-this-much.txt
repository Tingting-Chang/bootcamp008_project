He can't remember the times that he thoughtDoes my Daddy love me probably notBut that didn't stop him from wishin' he didDidn't keep him from wanting or worshipping himHe guesses he saw him about once a yearAnd he can still feel the way he felt standin' in tearsStretchin' his arms out as far as they'd goAnd whisperin' Daddy I want you to knowI love you this muchI'm waitin' on youTo make up your mind, do you love me tooHowever long it takes I'm never givin' upNo matter what I love you this muchHe grew to hate him for what he'd doneWhat kind of father would do that to his sonHe said damn you daddy the day that he diedThe man didn't blink but the little boy criedI love you this muchI'm waitin' on youTo make up your mind, do you love me tooHowever long it takes I'm never givin' upNo matter what I love you this muchHalfway through the funeral while the choir sang a hymnHe looked up above the preacher and sat and stared at himHe said forgive me father when he realizedHe hadn't been unloved or alone all his lifeHis arms were stretched out as far as they'd goNailed to the cross for the whole world to knowI love you this muchI'm waitin' on youTo make up your mind, do you love me tooHowever long it takes I'm never givin' upNo matter what I love you this much
