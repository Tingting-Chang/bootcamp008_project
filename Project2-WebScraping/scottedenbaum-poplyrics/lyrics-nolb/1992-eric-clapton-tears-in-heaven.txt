Would you know my nameIf I saw you in heaven?Would it be the sameIf I saw you in heaven?I must be strong and carry on'Cause I know I don't belong here in heavenWould you hold my handIf I saw you in heaven?Would you help me standIf I saw you in heaven?I'll find my way through night and day'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heavenTime can bring you down, time can bend your kneesTime can break your heart, have you begging please, begging pleaseBeyond the door there's peace I'm sureAnd I know there'll be no more tears in heaven
