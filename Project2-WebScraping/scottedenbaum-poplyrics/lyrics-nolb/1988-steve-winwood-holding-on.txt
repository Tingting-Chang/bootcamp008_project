Used to live in the danger zoneAny day it could get too roughNow I'm glad I kept holding onNow I'm glad I had soul enoughYou turned night into dayAnd showed me how my soul could singYou took my hurt awayAnd showed me love conquers anythingWhen two hearts both feel the sameThere's a way to beat the gameHolding on now I'm standing in the lightHolding on and this time I"ll get it rightHolding on every day and every nightHolding onFall asleep in your lover's armsAnd it's just like it ought to beJust be thankful she keeps you warmIn a world where there's nothing freeGive her love every dayAnd pay attention when she dreamsAnd she'll be good to youCause sometimes love is just what it seemsWhen two hearts both feel the sameThere's a way to beat the gameHolding on now I'm standing in the lightHolding on and this time I'll get it rightHolding on every day and every nightHolding onSee the mountain water keep flowing downInto streamsNow it holds on foreverWe'll be holding on foreverPeople should searching all night longFor a reason to help them liveAnd I do hope they hear the songGet through take and you get to giveIt can be in a smileIt can be there in a touchIt warms the world a whileWhen it's love it can't be too much
