In this farewellThere's no blood, there's no alibi'Cause I've drawn regretFrom the truth of a thousand liesSo let mercy come and wash awayWhat I've doneI'll face myself to cross out what I've becomeErase myselfAnd let go of what I've donePut to rest what you thought of meWhile I clean this slateWith the hands of uncertaintySo let mercy come and wash awayWhat I've doneI'll face myself to cross out what I've becomeErase myselfAnd let go of what I've doneFor what I've doneI start againAnd whatever pain may comeToday this endsI'm forgiving what I've doneI'll face myself to cross out what I've becomeErase myselfAnd let go of what I've done(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)What I've done(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)Forgiving what I've done(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)(Na na na na)
