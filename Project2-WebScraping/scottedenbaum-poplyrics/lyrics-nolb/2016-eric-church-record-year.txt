Since you turned the tables on meI've been steady and learnin' lonelyKeepin' this turntable spinnin'Everything from Jones to JenningsSlowly plannin' my survivalIn a three foot stack of vinylSince you had to walk on outta hereI've been havin' a record yearI bet you thought before you leftI'd just sit in silence by myselfTurn this house into a jailDyin' slow in a livin' hellBut love's got a funny way of keepin' scoreAnd your leavin' lit up my scoreboardI usually make it through side a soberAll bets are off when I flip her overOne bourbon, one scotch, one beerI'm havin' a record yearQuarter notes and Hank's half timeAre poundin' on this heart of mineSong to song, I pass my timeWith these speakers on tenYour good and gone keeps me up all nightAlong with Songs In The Key Of LifeI'm either gonna get over youOr I'm gonna blow out my earsYeah, you're out there nowDoin' God knows how, and I'm stuck hereHavin' a record yearYour leavin' left me goin' crazyI'm countin' on a needle to save meI drop it in the grooveAnd we go 'round and 'roundAnd down in a spiralI guess I really oughta call and thank youI rediscovered Red Headed StrangerGot down with old James BrownAnd found New Grass RevivalIf you find your way back, I owe you a beerFor my record year
