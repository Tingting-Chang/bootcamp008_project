Queen of the nightLife of the partyIt's all an illusionYou can't hide that big heart acheSo stop the delusionWaitin' for someone's rescueMy arms are right here for you.[Chorus]Through the wind and the rainThrough the laughter and painCount on meAnd when life isn't fairAnd there's nobody thereI will beIn a world of pretendersI am your defenderAnd when it all comes downI'll be the last one standing.This is for lifeDon't ever doubt itYou've already fallenLove is aliveSo stand up and shout it'cause destiny's callin'The others who stand behind meThey don't look nothing like me[Chorus]Waitin' for someones rescueMy arms are right here for you[Chorus]Yeah yeahI'll be the last one standingThrough the wind and the rainThrough the laughter and painI'll be the last on standing.
