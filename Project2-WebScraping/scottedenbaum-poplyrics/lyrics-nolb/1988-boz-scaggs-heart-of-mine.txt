One day you may find true love that will last forever and ever'Till then you'll spend a lifetime wishing one togetherYou never thought she'd say goodbyeAnd you'll never understand the reasons whyHeart of mineHow will you keep from dyingStop reminiscing who is she kissing?Heart of mineOh what's the use in tryingNo one can mend you nowLove plays cruel gamesYou can't believe she's found another lover"Does she miss me?"Sometimes you just can't help but wonderNo, you can't hold the hands of timeAnd you'll always be the one she left behindHeart of mine, how will you keep from dying stop reminiscingWho is she kissing heart of mine,Oh what's the use in tryingNo one can mend you now
