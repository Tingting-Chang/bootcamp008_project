I couldn't wait to turn sixteenAnd drive all the boys aroundFoot on the gas and hands on the wheelWas all I could think aboutA little rust in the bed of that truckAnd a four speed on the floorFive hundred dollarsIt was mine all mineAnd I never wanted nothing moreI took Katie down by the riverWith a six dollar bottle of wineJust a fool tryin' to play it coolHopin' she'd let me cross the lineAnd I was prayin' that she couldn't tellI'd never been that far beforeThe first time's a one time feelingAnd I never wanted nothin' moreNo I never wanted nothin' moreWell, I'm what I am and I'm what I'm notAnd I'm sure happy with what I've gotI live to love and laugh a lotAnd that's all I needMy buddies all tried to change my mindBut I told them that I thought it throughWell Katie laughed and my momma criedWhen they heard me say I doHer little ring was a little thingBut it was all that I could affordNow shes mine all mineTill the day I dieAnd I never wanted nothing moreNo I never wanted nothing moreWell, I'm what I am and I'm what I'm notAnd I'm sure happy with what I've gotI live to love and laugh a lotAnd that's all I needOne Sunday I listened to the preacherAnd I knew he was preaching to meI couldn't help it I walked up frontAnd I got down on my kneeRight then and there I swearI changed when I found the LordGlory Hallelujah good God AlmightyI never wanted nothing moreNo I never wanted nothing moreWell, I'm what I am and I'm what I'm notAnd I'm sure happy with what I've gotI live to love and laugh a lotAnd that's all I needI never wanted nothing moreAnd I never wanted nothing more
