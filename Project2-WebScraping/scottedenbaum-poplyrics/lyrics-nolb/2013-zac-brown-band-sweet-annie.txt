I've been burning brightFor so long I can't rememberPretty girls and late night bars seem to be my line of workBelieve me when I say, I can't stay this high foreverThis man's had all he can stand, time to lay this body downSweet AnnieCan I stay with you a while'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart,Sweetheart I've been livin' in a fantasyBut one day lightning will strikeAnd my bark will lose its biteBut don't give up on meSweet AnnieSweet AnnieI know I promised you a lifeBut an empty bed and the words I said don't carry any weightIf I could take back yesterday, find a way to start it overTurn around, put that bottle down and pray I'd it's not too lateSweet AnnieCan I stay with you a while'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart,Sweetheart I've been livin' in a fantasyBut one day lightning will strikeAnd my bark will lose its biteBut don't give up on meWhat will be will beSweet AnnieTurn out the lightsThese hands alone to hold youFall all over youAll over againCome a little closer so I can show youMy heart still beats fast for youAll over, and over againSweet AnnieCan I stay with you a while'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart,Sweetheart I've been livin' in a fantasyBut one day lightning will strikeAnd my bark will lose its biteBut don't give up on meSweet Annie
