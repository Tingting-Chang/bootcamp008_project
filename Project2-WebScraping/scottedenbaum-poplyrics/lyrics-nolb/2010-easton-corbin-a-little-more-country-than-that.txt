Imagine a dirt road full of pot holesWith a creek bank and some cane polesCatching channel catI'm a little more country than thatPicture a small town with an old houndLaying out front of the court houseWhile the old men chew the fatI'm a little more country than thatI just want to make sure you know just who you're getting under, this old hatCause girl I'm not the kind of two time or play games behind your backI'm a little more country than thatThink of a hank song from days goneWith a steel ride that's so strongIt sends chills up your backI'm a little more country than thatIf you want a brick home in a school zoneWith the doors locked and alarms onGirl, you're way off trackI'm a little more country than thatI just want to make sure you know just who you're getting under this old hatCause girl I'm not the kind of two time or play games behind your backI'm a little more country than thatYeah, I'm sure that you've heard those three words from othersBut they fell flatBut this ring ain't something that I mean to give youAnd then take backI'm a little more country than thatI'm a little more country than thatI'm a little more country than that
