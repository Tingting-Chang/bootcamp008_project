The perfect words never crossed my mind'Cause there was nothing in there but youI felt every ounce of meScreaming outBut the sound was trappedDeep in meAll I've wanted just sped right past meBut I was rooted fast to the earthI could be stuck here for a thousand yearsWithout your arms to drag me outThere you are, standing right in front of meThere you are, standing right in front of meForced fear falls away to leave me nakedHold me close'Cause I need you to guide me to safetyNo, I don't wanna wait foreverNo, I don't wanna wait foreverIn the confusionAnd the aftermathYou are my signal fireThe only resolutionAnd the only joyIs the faint spark of forgivenessIn your eyeThere you are, standing right in front of meThere you are, standing right in front of meForced fear falls away to leave me nakedHold me close'Cause I need you to guide me to safetyThere you are, standing right in front of meThere you are, standing right in front of meForced fear falls away to leave me nakedHold me close'Cause I need you to guide me to safetyNo, I don't wanna wait foreverNo, I don't wanna wait foreverNo, I don't wanna wait forever
