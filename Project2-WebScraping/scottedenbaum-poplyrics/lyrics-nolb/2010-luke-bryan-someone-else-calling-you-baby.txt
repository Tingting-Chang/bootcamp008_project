I saw a truck backin' outa your driveYou were sitting in the passenger sideMessin' with the radio, you had your sun glasses onI pulled over 'cause I couldn't believeTwo weeks ago that was you and meRiding down these old back roads, singing our songsNow everybody 'round our towns been whisperin'A tear in your eye says I should have been listenin'Baby is someone else calling you babyIt's driving me crazyThis bein' in the darkGoodbye's ain't ever easySo break it to me hardIf you're over my love girlLay it on my heartDon't try to save meIs someone else calling you baby?You wanted time and you wanted your spaceSo I backed off, did whatever it takesNever really thought you were that ready for moving alongNow I ain't leaving 'till I hear you say what's goin' onIt'll be what it will be, it's either him or meGive me the word and girl I'm goneBaby is someone else calling you babyIt's driving me crazyThis bein' in the darkGoodbye's ain't ever easySo break it to me hardIf you're over my love girlLay it on my heartDon't try to save meIs someone else calling you baby?
