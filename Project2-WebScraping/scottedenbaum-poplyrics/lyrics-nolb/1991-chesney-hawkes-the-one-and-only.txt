I am the one and only, oh yeahCall me, call me by my name or call me by numberYou put me through itI'll still be doing it the way I do itAnd yet, you try to make me forgetWho I really am, don't tell me I know bestI'm not the same as all the restI am the one and onlyNobody I'd rather beI am the one and onlyYou can't take that away from meI've been a player in the crowd sceneA flicker on the big screenMy soul embraces one more in a million facesHigh hopes and aspirations, and years above my stationMaybe but all this time I've tried to walk with dignity and prideI am the one and onlyNobody I'd rather beI am the one and onlyYou can't take that away from meI can't wear this uniform without some compromisesBecause you'll find out that we comeIn different shapes and sizesNo one can be myself like I canFor this job I'm the best manAnd while this may be trueYou are the one and only youI am the one and onlyNobody I'd rather beI am the one and onlyYou can't take that away from meI am the one and onlyNobody I'd rather beI am the one and onlyYou can't take that away from me
