Some days it's tough just gettin' upThrowin' on these boots and makin' that climbSome days I'd rather be a no-show lay-low 'fore I go outta my mind.But when she says baby,Oh no matter what comes ain't goin' nowhereShe runs her fingers through my hair and saves me.Yeah that look in her eyes got me comin' aliveAnd drivin' me a good kinda crazyWhen she says baby.Oh and when she says baby.Some nights I come home fightin' madFeel like runnin' my fist through the wall.Is it even worth it what I'm fightin' for anymore feelin'Torn all the hell with it all.But when she's says baby,Oh no matter what comes ain't goin' nowhereShe runs her fingers through my hair and saves me.Yeah that look in her eyes got me comin' aliveAnd drivin' me a good kinda crazyWhen she says babyEverything gonna be alright.Just lay down by my side.Let me love you through this life.Yeah she's the perfect shot of faith.When every bit of mine is gone.Somethin' I can believe in a best friendA heaven sent love to lean on.But when she says baby,Oh no matter what comes ain't goin' nowhereShe runs her fingers through my hair and saves me.Yeah that look in her eyes got me comin' aliveAnd drivin' me a good kinda crazyWhen she says baby.Oh when she says baby.Yeah that look in her eyes got me comin' aliveAnd drivin' me a good kinda crazy.
