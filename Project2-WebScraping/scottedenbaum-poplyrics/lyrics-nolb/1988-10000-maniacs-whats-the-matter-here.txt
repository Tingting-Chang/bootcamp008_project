That young boy without a name I'd know his faceIn this city the kid's my favoriteI've seen him I see him every daySeen him run outside looking for a place to hide from his fatherThe kid half naked and said to myself "Oh, what's the matter here?"I'm tired of the excuses everybody uses, he's their kid I stay out of itBut who gave you the right to do this?We live on Morgan StreetJust ten feet between and his mother, I never see herBut her screams and cussing, I hear them every dayThreats like: "If you don't mind I will beat on your behind""Slap you, slap you silly"Made me say, "Oh, what's the matter here?"I'm tired of the excuses everybody uses, he's your kid, do as you see fitBut get this through that I don't approve of what you did to you own flesh and blood"If you don't sit on this chair straightI'll take this belt from around my waist and don't think that I won't use it!"Answer me and take your timeWhat could be the awful crime he could do at such young an age?If I'm the only witness to your madness offer me some words to balance out what I see and what I hearAll these cold and rude things that you do I suppose you do because he belongs to youAnd instead of love, the feel of warmth you've given him these cuts and sores won't heal with time or age
