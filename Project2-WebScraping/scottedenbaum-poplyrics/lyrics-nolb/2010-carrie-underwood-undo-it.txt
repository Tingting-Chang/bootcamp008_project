Should've known by the way you pass me byThere was something in your eyesAnd it wasn't rightI should've walked but I never had the chanceEverything got out of hand and I let it slideNow I only have myself to blameFor falling for your stupid gamesI wish my life could be the way it was before I saw your faceYou stole my happyYou made me cryYou took the lonely and took me for a rideAnd I wanna un un un un undo itYou had my heart now I want it backI'm starting to see everything you lackBoy you blew itYou put me through itI wanna un un un un undo itNa na na na naNa na na na naNa na na na na naNow your photos don't have a picture frameAnd I never say your name and I never willAnd all your things well I threw them in the trashAnd I'm not even sadNow you only have yourself to blameFor playing all those stupid gamesYou're always gonna be the sameOh no you'll never changeYou stole my happyYou made me cryYou took the lonely and took me for a rideAnd I wanna un un un un undo itYou had my heart now I want it backI'm starting to see everything you lackBoy you blew itYou put me through itI wanna un un un un undo itNa na na na naNa na na na naNa na na na na naYou want my future you can't have itStill trying to erase you from my pastI need you gone so fastYou stole my happyYou made me cryYou took the lonely and took me for a rideAnd I wanna un un un un undo itYou had my heart now I want it backI'm starting to see everything you lackBoy you blew itYou put me through itI wanna un un un un undo itYou stole my happyYou made me cryYou took the lonely and took me for a rideBoy you blew itYou put me through itI wanna un un un un undo it
