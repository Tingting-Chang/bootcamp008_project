She's taking her time making up the reasonsTo justify all the hurt insideGuess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyesEveryone's got a theory about the bitter oneThey're saying mamma never loved her muchAnd, daddy never keeps in touchThat's why she shies away from human affectionBut somewhere in a private placeShe packs her bags for outer spaceAnd now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to comeAnd she'll say to himI would fly to the moon and back if you'll be my babyGot a ticket for a world where we belongSo would you be my baby?She can't remember a time when she felt neededIf love was red then she was color blindAll her friends they've been tried for treasonAnd crimes that were never definedShe's saying love is like a barren placeAnd reaching out for human faith is like a journeyI just don't have a map forSo baby's gonna take a dive andPush the shift to overdriveSend a signal that she's hangingAll her hopes on the starsWhat a pleasant dreamI would fly to the moon andBack if you'll be my baby got a ticketFor a world where we belong repeat
