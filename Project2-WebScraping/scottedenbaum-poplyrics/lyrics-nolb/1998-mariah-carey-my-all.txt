I am thinking of youIn my sleepless solitude tonightIf it's wrong to love youThen my heart just won't let me be right'Cause I've drowned in youAnd I won't pull throughWithout you by my sideI'd give my all to haveJust one more night with youI'd risk my life to feelYour body next to mine'Cause I can't go onLiving in the memory of our songI'd give my all for your love tonightBaby can you feel meImagining I'm looking in your eyesI can see you clearlyVividly emblazoned in my mindAnd yet you're so farLike a distant starI'm wishing on tonightI'd give my all to haveJust one more night with youI'd risk my life to feelYour body next to mine'Cause I can't go onLiving in the memory of our songI'd give my all for your love tonight
