Each day I liveI want to beA day to giveThe best of meI'm only oneBut not aloneMy finest dayIs yet unknownI broke my heartFought every gainTo taste the sweetI face the painI rise and fallYet through it allThis much remainsI want one moment in timeWhen I'm more than I thought I could beWhen all of my dreams are a heartbeat awayAnd the answers are all up to meGive me one moment in timeWhen I'm racing with destinyThen in that one moment of timeI will feelI will feel eternityI've lived to beThe very bestI want it allNo time for lessI've laid the plansNow lay the chanceHere in my handsGive me one moment in timeWhen I'm more than I thought I could beWhen all of my dreams are a heartbeat awayAnd the answers are all up to meGive me one moment in timeWhen I'm racing with destinyThen in that one moment of timeI will feelI will feel eternityYou're a winner for a lifetimeIf you seize that one moment in timeMake it shineGive me one moment in timeWhen I'm more than I thought I could beWhen all of my dreams are a heartbeat awayAnd the answers are all up to meGive me one moment in timeWhen I'm racing with destinyThen in that one moment of timeI will beI will beI will be freeI will beI will be free
