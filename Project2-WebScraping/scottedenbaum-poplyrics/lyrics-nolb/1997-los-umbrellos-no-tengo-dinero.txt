You could have kissed meLike this wasn't gonna lastKept me from sayingSomething I'll never take backYou could've held me like there was no chance of me waking up where I amYou could have stopped short of every dream I ever hadSo help me girlYou've gone too farIt's way too lateTo save my heartThe way it feelsEach time we touchI know I've never been so lovedAnd I can't help myselfSo help me girlYou had to be there when that old sun came upMaking last night feel like a vision of things yet to comeYou just had to hold me like nobody elseNow look what you've gone and doneYou had to love me'Til I just can't get enoughSo help me girlYou've gone too farIt's way too lateToo save my heartThe way it's feelEach time we touchI know I've never been so lovedAnd I can't help myselfSo help me girlAnd I can't help myselfSo help me girl
