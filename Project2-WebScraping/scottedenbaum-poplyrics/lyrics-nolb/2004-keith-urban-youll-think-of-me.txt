I woke up early this morning around four a.m.With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstateI pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleepBut thoughts of us kept keeping me awakeEver since you found yourself in someone else's armsI've been tryin' my best to get alongBut that's okayThere's nothing left to say, butTake your records, take your freedomTake your memories I don't need 'emTake your space and take your reasonsBut you'll think of meAnd take your cap and leave my sweater'Cause we have nothing left to weatherIn fact I'll feel a whole lot betterBut you'll think of me, you'll think of meI went out driving trying to clear my headI tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions leftI guess I'm feeling just a little tired of thisAnd all the baggage that seems to still existIt seems the only blessing I have left to my nameIs not knowing what we could have beenWhat we should have beenSoTake your records, take your freedomTake your memories I don't need 'emTake your space and take your reasonsBut you'll think of meAnd take your cap and leave my sweater'Cause we have nothing left to weatherIn fact I'll feel a whole lot betterBut you'll think of meSomeday I'm gonna run across your mindDon't worry, I'll be fineI'm gonna be alrightWhile you're sleeping with your prideWishin' I could hold you tightI'll be over youAnd on with my lifeSo take your records, take your freedomTake your memories I don't need 'emAnd take your cap and leave my sweater'Cause we have nothing left to weatherIn fact I'll feel a whole lot betterBut you'll think of meSo take your records, take your freedomTake your memories I don't need 'emTake your space and all your reasonsBut you'll think of meAnd take your cap and leave my sweater'Cause we got nothing left to weatherIn fact I'll feel a whole lot betterBut you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeahAnd you're gonna think of meOh someday baby, someday
