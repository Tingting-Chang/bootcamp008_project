Right there's the high school where we metWe'd sneak out back for a couple kisses and a cigaretteAnd that parking lot was our first dateAnd her momma slammed the door when I dropped her off too lateShe's goneChasing that highway windShe's goneShe ain't coming back againThis ain't nothingNothing but a goodbye townThese streets are only bringing me downGotta find a way to finally get outOut of this goodbye townWe sat down on those courthouse stepsFourth of July those fireworks over our headsAnd they'd ring the bells of that little churchNo there ain't nowhere I can look that doesn't hurtShe's goneBut I still feel her on my skinShe's goneBut she ain't coming back againThis ain't nothingNothing but a goodbye townThese streets are only bringing me downGotta find a way to finally get outOut of this goodbye townI can't erase the memoriesAnd I can't burn the whole place downNo this ain't nothingNothing but a goodbye townTo hell if I'm sticking aroundGotta find a way to finally get outOut of this goodbye townOh yeahOut of this goodbye townI'm out of this townSo out of this townOh oh oh oh ohYou'll be just a memory in the back of my mindYou'll be just a memory yeahOh, somewhere in the back of my mindIn the back of my mind, yeahOne day you're gonna look back at what we hadYou're gonna think of meYou're gonna think of meWhen I'm long goneI'll be long gone
