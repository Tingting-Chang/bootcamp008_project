Yo, YoI want to dedicated this song to Philip Arthur HarrisonWord up'Cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a manSo as far as I'm concerned, he's my father cause my biologicalDidn't botherBiological father, left me in the cold, when a few months oldAa father's child was greater than gold but I guess notYou brought me into the world but your not my dadMess around with those drugs makes my moms madSo we left you with no remorsal pityTook the first bus from York to Jersey CityWomen and child alone now that's pressureMoms got to go to work, drop me off by ObesaMomma, Aunt DeDe, whoeverAunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck togetherA year went by and I could walk y'allMoms got that good ol job at city hallShe probably didn't trust men anymoreUntil Philip Harrison walk though the doorWent out a few times but what about ShaquilleMoms offered him a million dollar package dealShe said you want me you gotta take my sonOr else its like a hot dog but without the bunGuess what he accepted, responsibility he never left itHe kept it, he kept itHe took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father'Cause my biological didn't bother[Chorus: x4]He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father'Cause my biological didn't bother. (4x)January 5th Phil made a promise (what's that)He joined the army we moved to fort mamthHe disciplined me right from the get goAge 2 bottle and my Mom shaquille let goActin spoiled, rotten, trippinGot a butt whippin because I didn't listenBack then you see privates made no bucksHad to get another job driven trucksWorkin hard as hell didn't satisfy himHad to another job working at the gymHe wasn't 'Gone with the Wind' like Clark GableWork all them jobs to put food on the tablePhil's my father, daddy and that's the scoopCan I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoopsCome on he put me under his wingWas the ball boy for his little Arthur teamSometimes he even made me madBut it didn't matter cause I still wanted to be like dadBut a little bit betterEncouraged me to stay in school and to get then good lettersI wasn't a brainiac but I tried hardGot to watch the Knicks play if I had a good report cardAll types, all sortsDisobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sportsI learned to dribble from right to leftI couldn't do a damn thang with all them F'sAge 15 father and son confrontation that's nothinBut father and son trials and tribulationBack then I could under stand but I'm glad you did it'Cause now I'm a manHe took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my fatherCause my biological didn't bother[Chorus]Look at me now successful for surePhil raised me well, to be an entrepreneurAnd if your making big dope be materialistic'Cause you'll end up another statisticEverything's going well following my dreamsI dunked on Patrick EwingI won the ring like hakeemUh oh what do you knowBiological ones on the Ricky Lake showWhat does he want, does he want moneyWhat people do for money!!!It's kinda funny to meHe ain't gettin no check from me (check it)He can go on all the talk shows he wantPhil is my dad so don't even frontHe took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father'Cause my biological didn't bother(Chorus)
