We all have a weaknessSome of ours are easier to identifyLook me in the eyeAnd ask for forgivenessWe'll make a pact to never speakThat word again, yes, you are my friendWe all have something that digs at usAt least we dig each otherSo when weakness turns my ego upI know you'll count on the me from yesterdayIf I turn into anotherDig me up from under what is coveringThe better part of meSing this songRemind me that we'll always have each otherWhen everything else is goneWe all have a sicknessThat cleverly attaches and multipliesNo matter how we tryWe all have someone that digs at usAt least we dig each otherSo when sickness turns my ego upI know you'll act as a clever medicineIf I turn into anotherDig me up from under what is coveringThe better part of meSing this songRemind me that we'll always have each otherWhen everything else is goneOh, each other when everything else is goneIf I turn into anotherDig me up from under what is coveringThe better part of meSing this songRemind me that we'll always have each otherWhen everything else is goneOh, each other, sing this song, when everything else is goneOh, each other, when everything else is gone
