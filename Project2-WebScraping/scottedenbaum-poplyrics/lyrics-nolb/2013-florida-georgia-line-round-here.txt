A hammer and a nail, stacking them bailsI'm dog tired by the five o'clock hourBut I'm ready to raise some hellAnd Jesse's getting ready, I'm gassing up the ChevyI'm gonna pick her up at sixI hope she's gonna wear them jeans with the tearThat her mama never fixedThe moon comes up and the sun goes downWe find a little spot on the edge of townTwist off, sip a little, pass it aroundDance in the dust turn the radio upAnd that fireball whiskey whispersTemptation in my earIt's a feeling alright, Saturday nightAnd that's how we do it round here.Yeah that's how we do it round hereMud on the grips, wild cherry on her lipsI've been working and trying and flirting and dyingFor an all night kind of kissAnd country on the boom boxAnd candles on the tool boxI'm doing everything rightGot the country boy charm turned all the way on tonight.Yeah the moon comes up and the sun goes downWe find a little spot on the edge of townTwist off, sip a little, pass it aroundDance in the dust, turn the radio upAnd that fireball whisky whispersTemptation in my earIt's a feeling alright, Saturday nightAnd that's how we do it round here.Yeah that's how we do it round here.
