Hey your glass is emptyIt's a hell of a long way homeWhy don't you let me take youIt's no good to go aloneI never would have opened upBut you seemed so real to meAfter all the bullshit I've heardIt's refreshing not to seeI don't have to pretendShe doesn't expect it from meSo don't tell me IHaven't been good to youDon't tell me IHave never been there for youDon't tell me whyNothing is good enoughHey little girl would you like some candy,Your momma said that it's ok,The door is open come on outside,No I can't come out today,It's not the wind that cracked your shoulderAnd threw you to the ground,Who's there that makes you so afraidYou're shaken to the bone,And I don't understand,You deserve so much more than thisSo don't tell me whyHe's never been good to you,Don't tell me whyHe's never been there for you,And don't you know that whyIs simply not good enough,Oh, so just let me tryAnd I will be good to youJust let me tryAnd I will be there for you,I'll show you whyYou're so much more than good enough
