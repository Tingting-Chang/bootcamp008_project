One! Two! Three!To every broken heart in hereLove was once a part, but now it's disappearedShe told me that it's all a part of the choices that your makingEven when you think you're rightYou have to give to takeBut there's still tomorrowForget the sorrowAnd I can be on the last train homeWatch it pass the dayAs it fades awayNo more time to careNo more time, todayBut we singIf we're going nowhereYeah we singIf it's not enoughAnd we singSing without a reasonTo ever fall in loveI wonder if you're listeningPicking up on the signalsSent back from withinSometimes it feels like I don't really know whats going onTime and time again it seems like everything is wrong in hereBut there's still tomorrowForget the sorrowAnd I can be on the last train homeWatch it pass the dayAs it fades awayNo more time to careNo more time, todayBut we singIf we're going nowhereYeah we singIf it's not enoughAnd we singSing without a reasonTo ever fall in loveWell we sing if we're going nowhereYeah we sing if it's not enoughAnd we singSing without a reason to ever fall in loveBut we singIf we're going no whereYeah we singIf it's not enoughAnd we singSing with out a reason to never fall in loveTo never fall in love again
