Baby youTurned my world into something newNights are long when you're far awayHunger for you every night and dayWhisper softly to the windNeed you back in my arms againPassion calls from deep insideIt only happens when my love cries[Chorus]You make my heart sing [Repeat x6]When love cries, love cries, love criesAnd when I am blueClose my eyes and dream of youSilent echoes scream out your nameYou're the keeper of my flameI'll survive on desire'Til I'm closer to your burning fireRide a star across the skyI need you here when my love cries[Chorus x2]Ooh babyTo be near youJust to feel youBaby babyBaby babyYou do it to me, do it to meBaby babyBaby babyYou do it to meIn my heartI never felt it quite like this beforeAnd if I let it slipI might no hear it anymoreI look into your eyes, oohAnd I get a chillI hear your nameMy world comes to a stand-stillThe keeper of your flameI wanna beTwo hearts together'Til eternityHand in handSide by sideStride by strideWe'll be the one who hearWhen love cries[Chorus]
