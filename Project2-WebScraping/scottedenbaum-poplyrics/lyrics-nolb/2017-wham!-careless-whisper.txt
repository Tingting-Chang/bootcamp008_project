Time can never mendThe careless whisper of a good friendTo the heart and mindIf your answer's kindThere's no comfort in the truthPain is all you'll findI should have known better, yeahI feel so unsureAs I take your hand and lead you to the dance floorAs the music diesSomething in your eyesCalls to mind a silver screenAnd all its sad goodbyesI'm never gonna dance againGuilty feet have got no rhythmThough it's easy to pretendI know you're not a foolI should have known better than to cheat a friendAnd waste a chance that I'd been givenSo I'm never gonna dance againThe way I danced with youTime can never mendThe careless whisper of a good friendTo the heart and mindIf your answer's kindThere's no comfort in the truthPain is all you'll findI'm never gonna dance againGuilty feet have got no rhythmThough it's easy to pretendI know you're not a foolI should have known better than to cheat a friendAnd waste a chance that I'd been givenSo I'm never gonna dance againThe way I danced with youNever without your love What am I without your love?Tonight the music seems so loudI wish that we could lose this crowdMaybe it's better this wayWe'd hurt each other with the things we want to sayWe could have been so good together,We could have lived this dance foreverBut now, who's gonna dance with me?Please stayI'm never gonna dance againGuilty feet have got no rhythmThough it's easy to pretendI know you're not a foolI should have known better than to cheat a friendAnd waste a chance that I'd been givenSo I'm never gonna dance againThe way I danced with youNow that you're goneNow that you're goneNow that you're goneWhat I did that was so wrong?So wrong that you had to leave me alone?
