Just before our love got lost you said,I am as constant as a northern star and I said,Constantly in the darkness,Where's that at?If you want me I'll be in the barOn the back of a cartoon coasterIn the blue TV screen lightI drew a map of CanadaOh, CanadaWith your face sketched on it twice.You're in my blood, you're my holy wineYou taste so bitter and so sweet, oh ICould drink a case of you, darlingAnd I would still be on my feetOh, I would still be on my feet.I am a lonely painterI live in a box of paints.I'm frightened by the devilAnd I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid.I remember that time you told meLove was touching souls.But surely you touched mine, 'causePart of you pours out of meIn these lines from time to time.You're in my blood, you're my holy wineYou taste so bitter and so sweet, oh ICould drink a case of you, darlingAnd I would still be on my feetOh I would still be on my feetI met a womanShe had a mouth like yoursShe knew your lifeShe knew your devils and your deeds and she said,"Go to him, stay with him if you canBut be prepared to bleed."You're in my blood, you're my holy wineYou taste so bitter and so sweet, oh ICould drink a case of you, darlingAnd I would still be on my feetOh I would still be on my feet
