Sure I've been in love a time or twoBut in the end I still chose youNo one could ever make me feel this wayThat's why it's killing me what we're going throughSomehow thought 'tween me and youOur love would stand the test of time and never ever fadeBut we're not making love no moreWe're not even trying to changeTell me how it slips awayDoes it ever stay the sameWe don't even talk no moreWe've ran out of words to sayTell me it don't have to changeWon't it ever stay the sameGirl I know that things aren't going rightBut don't you think it deserves a fightA love like ours don't happen everydayAnd we're losing it right as we speakAnd if we don't wake up, it's a memoryA time gone past, a love that sailed awayBut we're not making love no moreWe're not even trying to changeTell me how it slips awayDoes it ever stay the sameWe don't even talk no moreWe've ran out of words to sayTell me it don't have to changeWon't it ever stay the sameI dream of lovers past andI see a girl so sad causeShe lost the only man she lovedHe went awayWell it's not too late for usTo changeBut we're not making love no moreWe're not even trying to changeTell me how it slips awayDoes it ever stay the sameWe don't even talk no moreWe've ran out of words to sayTell me it don't have to changeWon't it ever stay the same
