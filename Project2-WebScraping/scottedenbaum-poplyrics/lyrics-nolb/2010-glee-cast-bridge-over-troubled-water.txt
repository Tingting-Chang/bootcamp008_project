I'm on your sideWhen times get roughAnd friends just can't be foundLike a bridge over troubled waterI will lay me downLike a bridge over trubled waterI will lay me downWhen you're down and outWhen you're on the streetWhen evening falls so hardI will comfort youI'll take your partWhen darkness comesAnd pain is all aroundLike a bridge over troubled waterI will lay me downLike a bridge over troubled waterI will lay me downSail on Silver Girl,Sail on byYour time has come to shineAll your dreams are on their way
