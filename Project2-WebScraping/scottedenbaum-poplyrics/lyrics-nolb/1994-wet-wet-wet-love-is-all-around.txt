I feel it in my fingersI feel it in my toesThe love that's all around meAnd so the feeling growsIt's written on the windIt's everywhere I goSo if you really love meCome on and let it showYou know I love you, I always willMy mind's made up by the way that I feelThere's no beginning, there'll be no end'Cause on my love you can dependI see your face before meAs I lay on my bedI cannot get to thinkingOf all the things you saidYou gave your promise to me and I gave mine to youI need someone beside me in everything I doYou know I love you, I always willMy mind's made up by the way that I feelThere's no beginning, there'll be no end'Cause on my love you can dependI got to keep it movingIt's written in the windOh everywhere I goSo if you really love me, love meCome on and let it showCome on and let it showCome on and let itCome on and let it,Come on and let it showCome on and let it,Come on and let it,Come on and let it show,Come on and let it show,Come on and let it show
