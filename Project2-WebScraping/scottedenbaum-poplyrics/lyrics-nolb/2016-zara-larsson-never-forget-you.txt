I used to be so happyBut without here I feel so lowI watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go'Cause once upon a time you were my everythingIt's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thingIt's very deep inside me but I feel there's something you should knowI'll never forget youYou'll always be by my sideFrom the day that I met youI knew that I would love you till the day I dieAnd I will never want much moreAnd in my heart I will always be sureI will never forget youAnd you'll always be by my side till the day I dieTill the day I diemeaning byAmandaH	,  EditorOur boy MNEK features on Zara's hit single "Never Forget You."
