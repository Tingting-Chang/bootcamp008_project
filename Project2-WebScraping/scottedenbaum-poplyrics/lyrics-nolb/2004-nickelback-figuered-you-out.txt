Every time we lie awakeAfter every hit we takeEvery feeling that I getBut I haven't missed you yetEvery roommate kept awakeBy every sigh and scream we makeAll the feelings that I getBut I still don't miss you yetOnly when I stop to think about itI hate everything about youWhy do I love youI hate everything about youWhy do I love youEvery time we lie awakeAfter every hit we takeEvery feeling that I getBut I haven't missed you yetOnly when I stop to think about itI hate everything about youWhy do I love youI hate everything about youWhy do I love youOnly when I stop to thinkAbout you, I knowOnly when you stop to thinkAbout me, do you knowI hate everything about youWhy do I love youYou hate everything about meWhy do you love meI hateYou hateI hateYou love meI hate everything about youWhy do I love you
