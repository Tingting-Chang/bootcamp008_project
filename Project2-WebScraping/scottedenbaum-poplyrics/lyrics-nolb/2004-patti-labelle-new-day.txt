Seems my lifeIs finally coming togetherDon't think I've ever been betterIt's clear to meMy future will bringThe peace I've been living for will be mineForever more[Chorus]It's a new dayOpen my eyes and the path is clearerIt's a new dayPushin' ahead til my goal is nearerIt's a new daySpread my wingsI'm doin' things my wayIt's a new dayMade the same mistakesOver and againNow it's timeFor the illusion to endFor every door that shutsAnother opensTakin' a chance I'm gonna winCan't go back where I've been[Chorus]I'm excited for the thingsAhead of meI decided I can make itOn my ownEmbrace the good and badAnd let go of the pastI'm loving what's inside of me[Chorus]
