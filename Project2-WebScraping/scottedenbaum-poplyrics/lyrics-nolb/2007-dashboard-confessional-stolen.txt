We watched the season pull up its own stageAnd catch the last weekend of the last weekBefore the gold and the glimmer have been replacedAnother sun soaked season fades awayYou have stolen my heartYou have stolen my heartInvitation only grant farewellsCrash the best one of the best onesClear liquor and cloudy eyed, too early to say goodnightYou have stolen my heartYou have stolen my heartAnd from the ballroom floor we are a celebrationOne good stretch before our hibernationOur dreams assured and we are; we'll sleep wellSleep wellSleep wellSleep wellYou have stolen my, you have stolen myYou have stolen my heartI watch you spin around in the highest heelsYou are the best one of the best onesWe all look like we feelYou have stolen my, you have stolen myYou have stolen my heart
