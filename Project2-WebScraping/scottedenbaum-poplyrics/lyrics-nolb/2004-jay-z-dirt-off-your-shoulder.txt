The creek goes ripplin' byI been barefootin' all day with my babyBrown leaves have started fallin'Leadin' the wayI like it best just like thisDoin' nothin' all the waySo let's lay down in the tall grassDreamin' awayAnd all I want to do is let it beAnd be with you and watch the wind blow byAnd all I want to see is you and meGo on forever like the clear blue skySlowly, there's only you and IAnd all I want to do is watch the wind blow byGirl, you know you told me not so long agoTo let it come, then let it passAnd all your troubles and your sorrowsThey won't lastSo let me kiss you now little darlin'Beneath this autumn moonCold winds, another seasonWill be here soonAnd all I want to do is let it beAnd be with you and watch the wind blow byAnd all I want to see is you and meGo on forever like the clear blue skySlowly, there's only you and IAnd all I want to do is watch the wind blow by
