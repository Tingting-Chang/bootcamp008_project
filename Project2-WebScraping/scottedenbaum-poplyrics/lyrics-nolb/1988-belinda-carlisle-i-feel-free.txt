MmmMmmI feel freeI feel freeFeel when I dance with youWe move like the seaYou you're all I want to knowI feel freeI feel freeI feel freeI can walk down the street but there's no one thereThough the pavement's one huge crowdI can drive down the road but my eyes don't seeThought my mind wants to cry out loudYea my mind wants to cry out loudAhhAhhAhhI feel freeI feel freeI feel freeAs far as I can seeCeiling is the skyYou're the sun and as you shine on meI feel freeI feel freeI feel freeMmmMmmMmmI feel freeI feel free
