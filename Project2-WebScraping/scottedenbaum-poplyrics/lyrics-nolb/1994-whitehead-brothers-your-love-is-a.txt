There's too muchThat I keep to myselfAnd I turn my back on my faithIt's like glassWhen we breakI wish no one in my placeAnd I've seenYou don't need their seedsWhen their dirt goes in deepAnd I'm lost in sleepI can't stayIn this placeI can't standWhen the room turns roundOn my fateYou give no guaranteesThere's no promiseI can keepI can't standI can't see my wayI feel blindOn my feetI can't stay too longAm I wrong?Goodbye, lay the blame on luckGoodbye, lay the blame on luckGoodbye, lay the blame on luckGoodbye, lay the blame on luckGoodbye, lay the blame on luckGoodbye, lay the blame on luckI'm so tiredOf my moodAnd sleep comesWith a knife, fork and a spoonYou're so paleIn your faceYou let lifeGet in your wayAnd I've seenYou don't need their seedsWhen their dirt goes in deepAnd I'm lost in sleepAm I wrong?Goodbye, lay the blame on luckGoodbye, lay the blame on luckGoodbye, lay the blame on luckGoodbye, lay the blame on luck
