I got my old guitar and some fishin' polesSo baby fill that cooler full of something coldDon't ask just pack and we'll hit the road runnin'Honey what do you sayI got just enough money and just enough gasSo pick a place on the map we can get to fastWhere the white sandy beach meets water like glassAnd if the tide carries us awayBaby we'll roll with itWon't think about it too muchBaby let's just go with itGet out of this ordinary everyday rutAnd if we get swept away by one of those perfect daysWhen the sun is sinking low at duskAnd wind up a little deeper in loveBaby lets roll with itWe get so caught up in catching upTrying to pay the rent, trying to make a buckThat don't leave much time for time for usAnd ain't life too short for thatSo open up that bag of pig skins you boughtAt the Exxon station the last time we stoppedAnd you can kick back baby and dance in your socksOn the windshield to some radio rockAnd we'll roll with itWon't think about it too muchBaby let's just go with itAnd get out of this ordinary everyday rutAnd we get swept away by one of those perfect daysWhen the sun is sinking low at duskAnd wind up a little deeper in loveBaby we'll roll with itWon't think about it too muchSometimes you gotta go with itGet out of this ordinary everyday rutAnd it won't be no thing if it starts to rainAnd we have to wait it out in the truckWe might wind up a little deeper in loveSo baby lets roll with itBaby lets roll with itBaby we'll roll with itBaby we'll roll with it
