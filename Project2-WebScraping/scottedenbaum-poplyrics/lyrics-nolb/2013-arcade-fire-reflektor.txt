Trapped in a prism, in a prism of lightAlone in the darkness, darkness of whiteWe fell in love, alone on a stageIn the reflective ageEntre la nuit, la nuit et l'auroreEntre les royaumes, des vivants et des mortsIf this is heavenI don't know what it's forIf I can't find you thereI don't careI thought, I found a way to enterIt's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)I thought, I found the connectorIt's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)Now, the signals we send, are deflected againWe're still connected, but are we even friends?We fell in love when I was nineteenAnd I was staring at a screenEntre la nuit, la nuit et l'auroreEntre les voyants, les vivants et les mortsIf this is heavenI need something moreJust a place to be alone'Cause you're my homeI thought, I found a way to enterIt's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)I thought, I found the connectorIt's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor) Just a reflektorIt's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)It's just a reflektor (It's just a reflektor)reflektor (Just a reflektor)(Just a reflektor) just a reflektor(Just a reflektor) just a reflektor (reflektor)(Just a reflektor)(Just a reflektor)(Just a reflektor, just a reflektor)(Just a reflektor, just a reflektor)Just a reflection, of a reflectionOf a reflection, of a reflection, of a reflectionWill I see you on the other side?
