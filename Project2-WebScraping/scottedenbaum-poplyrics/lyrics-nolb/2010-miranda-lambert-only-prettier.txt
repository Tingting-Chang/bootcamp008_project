Well I've been saved by the grace of southern charmI got a mouth like a sailor and yours is more like a Hallmark cardIf you wanna pick a fight well I'm gonna have to say goodnightI don't have to be hateful, I can just say bless your heartAnd even though I don't belong with your high life friendsDoesn't mean we don't get together and try to make amendsIt's easier can't you see lets agree to just disagreeWe don't have to like each other but its sure fun to pretendSo lets shake hands and reach across those party linesYou got your friends just like I got mineWe might think a little differentlyBut we got a lot in common you will seeWe're just like you, only prettierEverybody says you gotta know your enemiesEven if they only weigh a hundred pounds and stand five foot threeIf you just smile and behave you could always get your wayIt's a universal plan that'll get you where you can in all societiesSo lets shake hands and reach across those party linesYou got your friends just like I got mineWe might think a little differentlyBut we got a lot in common you will seeWe're just like you, only prettierLets shake hands and reach across those party linesYou got your friends just like I got mineWe might think a little differentlyBut we got a lot in common you will seeWe're just like you, only prettierWell I'll keep drinkin' and you'll keep gettin' skinnierHey I'm just like you only prettierShe says just like you only prettier
