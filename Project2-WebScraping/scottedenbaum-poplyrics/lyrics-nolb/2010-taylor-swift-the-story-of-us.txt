I used to think one day we'd tell the story of usHow we met and the sparks flew instantlyPeople would say, "they're the lucky ones"I used to know my place was a spot next to youNow I'm searching the room for an empty seat'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're onOh, a simple complicationMiscommunications lead to fall outSo many things that I wish you knewSo many walls up I can't break throughNow I'm standing alone In a crowded roomAnd we're not speaking and I'm dying to knowIs it killing you like it's killing me yeahI don't know what to say since the twist of fateWhen it all broke down and the story of usLooks a lot like a tragedy now next chapterHow'd we end up this way?See me nervously pulling at my clothesAnd trying to look busyAnd you're doing your best to avoid meI'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of usHow I was losing my mind when I saw you hereBut you held your pride like you should have held meOh, I'm scared to see the endingWhy are we pretending this is nothing?I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know howI've never heard silence quite this loudNow I'm standing alone in a crowded roomAnd we're not speaking and I'm dying to knowIs it killing you like it's killing me yeahI don't know what to say since the twist of fateWhen it all broke down and the story of usLooks a lot like a tragedy nowThis is looking like a contestOf who can act like they care lessBut I liked it better when you were on my sideThe battle's in your hands nowBut I would lay my armor downIf you'd say you'd rather love than fightSo many things that you wish I knewBut the story of us might be ending soonNow I'm standing alone in a crowded roomAnd we're not speaking and I'm dying to knowIs it killing you like it's killing me yeahI don't know what to say since the twist of fateWhen it all broke down and the story of usLooks a lot like a tragedy now, the end
