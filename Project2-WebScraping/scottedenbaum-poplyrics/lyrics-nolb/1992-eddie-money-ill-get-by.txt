Give me one last lookAs you walk awayI, I don't know what to sayI start callin' out your nameBut I just can't find the wordsI know will change your mindI've tried a thousand timesBut I just can't make it rightSomeday I pray there will come a dayWhen I can open up my heart and love againUntil then I'll get bySomehow I'll get byI know I'll get byI take a look aroundI see this lonely roomI used to share with youNow I want to paint it blue'Cause everywhere I turnThere's something else I findThe notes you left behindWere you tryin' to be kindTell you somethin' baby, there will come a dayWhen I can open up my heart and love again'Til then I'll pretendI'll play the foolSomeday I'll find another someone just like you'Til then I'll get bySomehow I'll get byI know I'll get byMy heart don't own meCan't think about it any moreLove's just a memorySurrounded by these lonely wallsLately I've been thinkin'I should move awayNo reason left to stayThis house is haunted anywayI'll tell you something baby, there will come a dayWhen I can open up my heart and love againUntil then I'll get bySomehow I'll get byI know I'll get by...
