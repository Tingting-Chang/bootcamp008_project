When I fall in love it will be foreverOr I'll never fall in loveIn a restless world like this isLove is ended before it's begunAnd too many moonlight kissesSeem to cool in the warmth of the sunWhen I give my heart it will be completelyOr I'll never give my heartAnd the moment I can feel that you feel that way tooIs when I fall in love with you.And the moment I can feel that you feel that way tooIs when I fall in love with you.
