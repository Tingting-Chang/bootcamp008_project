I took a course in hallelujahI went to night school for the bluesI took some stuff they said would cool yaBut nothing seemed to light my fuseBut it's all in the pastLike a check that's in the mailShe was a tall whiskey glassI was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tailUntil I met a blind manWho taught me how to seeA blind manWho could change night into dayAnd if I canI'm gonna make you come with meBecause here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds awayI've had some lovers like a joy rideSome things are never what they seemMy heaven's turned into a landslideI thank God I woke up from the dreamBecause here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the cloudsThe way bees chase honeyAnd drink all the flowers dryWe'll be saving us a little moneyAnd if that don't do it, yeah, I know the reason whyDon't make no sense lightin' candlesThere's too much moonlight in our eyesBecause here comes the sunAin't no surpriseAin't no doubt about itGonna open up your eyes
