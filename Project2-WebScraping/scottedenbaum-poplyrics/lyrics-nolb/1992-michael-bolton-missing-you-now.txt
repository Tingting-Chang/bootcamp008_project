I talk to you but it's not the same as touchin' youAnd every time you whisper my name, I want to run to youWell be together, it won't be long, it won't be longBut it feels like forever, and it's hard to be strong[Chorus:]Baby 'cause I'm missing you nowAnd it's drivin' me crazyHow I'm needin' you babyI'm missing you nowCan't wait 'till I'm alone with youTo show you how I'm missing you nowWishin' you were here by my side is all that I can doGot my arms around my pillow at night, they should be holdin' youThought I was stronger, how could I know, how could I knowI can't take this much longerIt's so hard on my soul[Chorus]Baby I just can't waitTill I see your faceChase away this loneliness insideWhen you're close to my heartRight here in my armsThen and only thenWill I be satisfiedI'm missing you nowWe'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be longBut it feels like forever, and it's hard to be strong[Chorus]
