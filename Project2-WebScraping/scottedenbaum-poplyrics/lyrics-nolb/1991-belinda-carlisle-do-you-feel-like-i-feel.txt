I don't know how you do what you doI'm so shaken by you babyI can barely breathEvery time I see youI just want to break down and cryNo one's ever moved meJust the way you move me insideDo you feel like I feelOr am I all aloneIs this love really realBaby I've got to knowWhen you held me last nightWere your words really realAre you just using meOr do you feel like I feelDo you feel like I feelFrom that moment that I met you babyI just knewIt was so easy for me just to be with youWhen the sun comes shiningWill you still be lying by my sideTell me if I'm dreamingIs there deeper meaningFor me in your lifeDo you feel like I feelOr am I all aloneIs this love really realBaby I've got to knowWhen you held me last nightWere your words really realAre you just using meOr do you feel like I feelDo you feel like I feelI'm the one who wants youI'm the one who needs youI'm the one who won't let goYou've got all the powerI'm dying by the hourCome on baby let me knowWhen you held me last night were your words really realGod I'm so much in loveDo you feel like I feel, like I feel, like I feel
