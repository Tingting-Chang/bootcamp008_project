I can't figure you outBut a heart must be the one thing you were born withoutI've been wasting my timeI don't know where I'll sleep tonightYou say that you can do without meGo ahead now try and live without meBaby save up all your tearsYou might need them somedayWhen the tears start to fallI won't wipe them awayWhen you cry in the nightFor the love that you needBaby, save up your tears'Cause you'll be crying over me(Oh oh)You got used to my touchI got used to not, not feeling muchWinter set in your eyesTime will melt your castle of iceYou think that you won't feel the pain nowYour eyes will be crying like the rain nowBaby save up all your tearsYou might need them somedayWhen the tears start to fallI won't wipe them awayWhen you cry in the nightFor the love that you needBaby, save up your tears'Cause you'll be crying over meYou'll be cryingYou'll be crying over meYou don't know it nowYou don't know it nowYou don't know it nowYou don't know it nowYou don't know it nowBut some wounds get deeper with timeYou don't feel it nowTill the need burns, a knife turnsYour heart bleeds like mineBaby save up all your tearsYou might need them somedayWhen the tears start to fallI won't wipe them awayWhen you cry in the nightFor the love that you needBaby, save up your tears'Cause you'll be crying over me
