From the day we arrive on the planetAnd blinking, step into the SunThere's more to be seen than can ever be seenMore to do than can ever be doneSome say eat or be eatenSome say live and let liveBut all are agreed as they join the stampedeYou should never take more than you giveIn the circle of lifeIt's the wheel of fortuneIt's the leap of faithIt's the band of hopeTill we find our placeOn the path unwindingIn the circle, the circle of lifeSome of us fall by the waysideAnd some of us soar to the starsAnd some of us sail through our troublesAnd some have to live with the scarsThere's far too much to take in hereMore to find than can ever be foundBut the Sun rolling high through the sapphire skyKeeps great and small on the endless roundIn the circle of lifeIt's the wheel of fortuneIt's the leap of faithIt's the band of hopeTill we find our placeOn the path unwindingIn the circle, the circle of lifeIt's the wheel of fortuneIt's the leap of faithIt's the band of hopeTill we find our placeOn the path unwindingIn the circle, the circle of lifeOn the path unwindingIn the circle, the circle of life
