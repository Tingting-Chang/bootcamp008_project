I heard a song 'bout a ramblin' manBought a guitar and I started a bandI got a gig at the local Am VetI was gone and I ain't back yet'69 bored, out and jacked upA quarter mile, that was all it wasI burned the cool off of that CorvetteAnd I was gone and I ain't back yetLookin' back at the moments, black and whiteI wouldn't change a thing that changed my lifeFor the worse, for the betterMan, I was gone, gone foreverShe was a cut offs pepper sauce queenMan, we were matches and gasolineFirst taste of love, never will forgetI was gone and I ain't back yetI was gone, gone and I ain't back yetLookin' back at the moments, black and whiteI wouldn't change a thing that changed my lifeFor the worse, for the betterMan, I was gone, gone foreverThe laughs, the smiles, the trials, the tearsIt's hard to hate what got me hereWhat got me hereShe was a straight out of Hollywood smileWe missed it all by a country mileWent out one night for some cigarettesAnd I was gone and I ain't back yetI was gone, gone and I ain't back yetI was gone and I ain't back, ain't back, ain't back yetI was gone and I ain't back yetI was gone and I ain't back yetI was gone, gone and I ain't back yet
