I got home late on a Saturday nightAnd I knew right away something wasn't rightI knew she was goneShe took all I had but, left a hole in my heartShould've known it would go bad, right from the startWhat did I do wrong?I can't understand why she would leave me this wayWith nothing to sayThen I found the note on the doorIt said good-bye and she don't want me no more[Chorus]"Bye bye baby, bye bye....", She said in her letterAnd that was all she wroteGuess this is goodbye, guess this is foreverAnd that was all she wroteI called on the phone, but she wasn't thereShould've know all along that she just didn't careWhy did she have to go?Now I look at her picture and I wonder whyShe left me this way...-Why did she say goodbye?I guess I'll never knowI can't understand why she would leave me this wayWith nothing to sayI remember the note on the doorIt said good-bye and she don't want me no more[Chorus]
