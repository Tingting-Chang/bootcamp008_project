Ooh oh oh oh, ooh oh oh ohBe careful making wishes in the darkCan't be sure when they've hit their markAnd besides in the meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apartI'm in the details with the devilSo now the world can never get me on my levelI just got to get you out of the cageI'm a young lovers rageGonna need a spark to igniteMy songs know what you did in the darkSo light em up up up, light em up up up,light em up up up, I'm on fireSo light em up up up, light em up up up,light em up up up, I'm on fireOoh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)All the writers keep writing what they writeSomewhere another pretty vein just diesI've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could seeThat you're the antidote to everything except for meA constellation of tears on your lashesBurn everything you loveThen burn the ashesIn the end everything collidesMy childhood spat back the monster that you seeMy songs know what you did in the darkSo light em up up up, light em up up up,light em up up up, I'm on fireSo light em up up up, light em up up up,light em up up up, I'm on fireOoh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)My songs know what you did in the darkMy songs know what you did in the darkSo light em up up up, light em up up up,light em up up up, I'm on fireSo light em up up up, light em up up up,light em up up up, I'm on fireOoh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)Ooh oh oh
