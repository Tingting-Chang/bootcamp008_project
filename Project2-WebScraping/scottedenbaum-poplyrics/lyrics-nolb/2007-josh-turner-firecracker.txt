YeeeaaahhhhWhen I look in her eyesIt ain't no surpriseSparks start a flyin like the 4th of JulyShe gets me so hot, my heart starts a poppin'When we get to kissin, there ain't no stoppin'When it comes to loveShe ain't no slackerMy little darlin is a firecrackerWhen I light the fuseI gotta get back quickYou gotta be careful with a dynamite stickSon of a gun she fun to handleAnd she packs a punch like a roman candleShe a pack of black cats in a red paper wrapperMy little darlin' is a firecrackerWe might not ought to take a roll in the hayCause we'd burn the barn down one of these daysWere a match made in heavenAnd it ain't no joke.But id sure I hate to see it go up in smokeWe got a good thing goingAnd it feels so rightShes a firecrackerShes the light of my life.She goes off with a great big bangBoys I tell ya its a beautiful thingShe takes off you better hang on tightShes a blonde bottle rocketIn the middle of the nightWhen she makes love shes a heart attackerMy little darlin is a firecrackerWe might not ought to take a roll in the hayCause we'd burn the barn down one of these daysWere a match made in heavenAnd it ain't no joke.But id sure I hate to see it go up in smokeWe got a good thing goingAnd it feels so rightShes a firecrackerShes the light of my life.Uhhh haaaWe got a good thing goingAnd it feels so rightShes a firecrackerShes the light of my life.We got a good thing goingAnd it feels so rightShes a firecrackerShes the light of my life.Shes a firecrackerShes the light of my lifeFirecrackerFirecrackerWhooooo hooooFirecrackerFirecrackerBangFirecracker
