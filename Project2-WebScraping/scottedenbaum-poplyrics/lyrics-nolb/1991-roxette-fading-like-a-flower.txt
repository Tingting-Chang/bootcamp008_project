In a time, where the sun desends aloneI ran a long long way from homeTo find a heart that's made of stoneI will try, I just need a little timeTo get your face right out of my mindTo see the world through different eyesEverytime I see you oh I try to hide awayBut when we meet it seems I can't let goEverytime you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flowerTell me why, when I scream there's no replyWhen I reach out there's nothing to findWhen I sleep I break down and cryEverytime I see you oh I try to hide awayBut when we meet it seems I can't let goEverytime you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower
