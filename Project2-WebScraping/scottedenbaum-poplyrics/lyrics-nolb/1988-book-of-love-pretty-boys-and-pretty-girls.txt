When I'm aloneAnd you&'re awayI just close my eyesAnd I drift awayYour warm bodyIs what I'm withoutI just close my eyesAnd I dream aboutPretty boys and pretty girlsPretty boys and pretty girls(When I'm without)Pretty boys(I dream about)Pretty girlsStranges in the nightExchanging glancesBut sex is dangerousI don't take my chancesThe boys I meetSay I look lonelyBut I just walk on myBecause they're onlyPretty boys and pretty girlsPretty boys and pretty girls(when I'm without)Pretty boys(I dream about)Pretty girlsIn this day and ageIn a city full of fearWith you by my sideTogether we can show we careSpreading joy to the worldTo every boy and every girlPretty boys and pretty girlsPretty boys and pretty girls(what will we show?)Spreading joy(where will it go?)To the world
