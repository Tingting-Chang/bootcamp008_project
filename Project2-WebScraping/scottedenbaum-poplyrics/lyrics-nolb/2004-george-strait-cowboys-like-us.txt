I take off time to timeWith those crazy friends of mineHead out on steel horsesWith wheels and we rideWe burn up that road to old MexicoBlend in with the desertJust we amigosAnd we rollCowboys like us sure do have funRacin' the wind, chasin' the sunTake the long way around back to square oneToday we're just outlaws out on the runThere'll be no regrets, no worries and suchFor cowboys like usWe talk about livin', babies, and womenAll that we've lost and all we've been givin'We sing about true love, lie about things we ain't doneDrink one more cold one, come mornin' get upAnd we roll[Chorus: x2]Cowboys like us
