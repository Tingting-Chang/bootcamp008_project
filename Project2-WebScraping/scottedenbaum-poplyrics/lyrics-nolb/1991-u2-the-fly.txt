Oh, baby childIt's no secret that the stars are falling from the skyIt's no secret that our world is in darkness tonightThey say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by a moonYou know I don't see you when she walks in the roomIt's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you helpIt's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone elseThey say a secret is something you tell one other personSo I'm telling you, childA man will begA man will crawlOn the sheer face of loveLike a fly on a wallIt's no secret at allIt's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pestIt's no secret ambition bites the nails of successEvery artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thiefAll kill their inspiration and sing about their griefOver loveA man will riseA man will fallFrom the sheer face of loveLike a fly from a wallIt's no secret at allLove, we shine like aBurning starWe're falling from the skyTonightA man will riseA man will fallFrom the sheer face of loveLike a fly from a wallIt's no secret at allOh, yeah!It's no secret that the stars are falling from the skyThe universe exploded 'cause of one man's lieLook, I gotta go, yeah I'm running outta changeThere's a lot of things, if I could I'd rearrange
