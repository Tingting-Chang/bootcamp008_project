There's many a day I ache for you but we are oceans apartEven though my tears have dried there's an emptinessI feel in my heart called loveFrom the first time that I loved you I told you from the startOur love would come togetherIf we could stand to be apartI never mean to break your heart, oh, no!The days I count without you I feel so all aloneI see you in my dreams at nightI feel your touch so strongI feel your pain and tears miles awayI surrender my soul to you, dearLove youLove youLove youLove youMishale , what am I supposed to do?Mishale , I'll never get over youMishale Mishale, loving you is heavenLoving you is heavenMissing you is hell[Chorus]And I need for our love to be strongAnd as the love that goes into your tear, oh, yeahNo matter where I find myself you're always on my mind soul and eyes reveal my pain as my tears fall like November rainThe light is fading, I just miss you[Chorus]Mishale, what am I supposed to do?Mishale
