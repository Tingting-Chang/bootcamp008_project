You are the love of my lifeAnd you are the reason I'm aliveAnd baby baby babyWhen I think of how you saved meI go crazyI've never known love like thisAnd it fills me with a new tendernessAnd I know I know I knowYou're in my heart you're in my soulYou're all I can't resistAnd I need to tell youThe first time I held youI knew you are the love of my lifeI spent a lifetime waitingAlways hesitating until youI was lost so deep inside my shell'Til you came and saved me from myselfNow all I really knowIs I need youAnd you are the love of my lifeAll the joy and tears that I cryAnd baby baby babyYou don't have to say a wordI see it in your eyesAs we stand togetherI promise forever'Til the day that I dieYou are the love of my lifeI spent a lifetime waitingAlways hesitating until youI was lost so deep inside my shell'Til you came and saved me from myselfNow all I really knowIs I need youYou are the love of my lifeYou are the reason I'm alive
