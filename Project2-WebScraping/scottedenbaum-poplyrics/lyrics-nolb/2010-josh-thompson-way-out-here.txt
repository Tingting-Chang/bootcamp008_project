Our houses are protected by the good Lord and a gunAnd you might meet 'em both if you show up here, not welcome sonOur necks are burnt, the roads are dirt and our trucks ain't cleanThe dogs run loose, we smoke, we chew and fry everythingOut here, way out here[Chorus]We won't take a dime if we ain't earned itWhen it comes to weight, brother we pull our ownIf it's our backwoods way of living you're concerned withWell you can leave us aloneCause we're about John Wayne, Johnny Cash and John DeereWay out hereWe've got a fighting side, a mile wide but we pray for peaceCause it's mostly us that end up serving overseasIf it was up to me I'd love to see this country runLike it used to be, like it ought to be, just like it's doneOut here, way out here[Chorus]Way out here[Chorus]John Wayne, Johnny Cash, and John DeereWay out here way out hereOur houses are protected by the good Lord and a gunAnd you might meet 'em both if you show up here not welcome son
