He works way too much for way too littleHe drinks way too early till way too lateHe hasn't had a raise since new years dayIn eighty-eight gets trampled on by everyoneExcept when he comes in hereAnd he's the product of the Haggard generationHe's got a redneck side when you get him agitatedHe got the gold toothed look from a stiff right hookHe's proud he took for his right wing stand on VietnamSays he lost his brother thereHe yells out Johnny CashAnd the band starts to playA ring of fire as he walks upAnd stands there by the stageAnd he sayHell yeah! Turn it up! Right on!Hell yeah! Sounds good! Sing that song!Guitar man playing all night longTake me back to where the music hit meLife was good and love was easyShe's got an MBA and a plush corner officeShe's got a don't mess with me attitudeShe'll close a deal she don't reveal that she can feelThe loneliness the emptinessExcept when she comes in hereShe's the product of the Me generationShe's got a rock and roll side when you get her agitatedShe got the tattoo there on her derriÃ¨re from a spring break dareIn Panama where love was all she thought she'd ever needShe yells out to the bandKnow any Bruce SpringsteenThen she jumps up on the barAnd she, and she starts to screamShe sayHell yeah! Turn it up! Right on!Hell yeah! Sounds good! Sing that song!Guitar man playing all night longTake me back to where the music hit meLife was good and love was easyYeah, yeahCan or can't you get my mind off thinking aboutMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, ThursdayHey, hell yeahHell yeah! Turn it up! Right on!Hell yeah! Sounds good! Sing that song!Guitar man playing all night longTake me back to where the music hit meLife was good and love was easyHell yeah! Turn it up! Right on!Hell yeah! Sounds good! Sing that song!Guitar man playing all night longTake me back to where the music hit meLife was good and love was easy
