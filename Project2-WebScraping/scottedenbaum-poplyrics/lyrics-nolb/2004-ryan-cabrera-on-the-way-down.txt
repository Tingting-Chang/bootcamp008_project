Sick and tired of this worldThere's no more airTripping over myselfGoing nowhereWaitingSuffocatingNo directionI took a diveOn all the way downI saw youAnd you save me from myselfAnd won't forget the way you love meAnd on the way downI almost fell right throughBut I held on to youBeen wondering whyIt's only meHave you always been inside?Waiting to beIt's all rightSunlight on my faceWake up, yeahI'm alive'Cause on the way downI saw youAnd you saved me from myselfAnd won't forget the way you love meOn the way downI almost fell right throughBut I held onto youI was so afraidI'm going underBut nowWeight of the worldFeels like nothingNo nothingDown down downYou're all I wantedDown down downYou're all I needed nowDown down downYou're all I wantedYou're all I neededAh, ahAh, ahAnd won't forget the way you love meAhAll I wantedAll I needed nowOn the way downI saw youSave me from myselfAnd won't forget the way you love meAnd on the way downI almost fell right throughBut held onto youDown down downBut I held onto youDown down downBut I held onto youHeld onto youâ?¦
