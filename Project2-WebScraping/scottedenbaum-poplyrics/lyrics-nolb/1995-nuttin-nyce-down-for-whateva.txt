All of my life it seemed I waited for this dayAll this time I was searching cause I never knewYou could make me feel this waySo much loveYou captured my heart and my soulAnd baby I'm loosing control I don't ever want to let goOf what you give me[Chorus]Promise you'll never leave mePromise you'll always stayPromise you'll never run away from a lovePromise me, promise meIf you could grantee that what you say is trueEveryday you're my life ill be there threw the nightAnd I give my self to youSo much loveI cherish the moments we shareThe feelings that won't disappearThe magic you bring when you're nearSo take that from me
