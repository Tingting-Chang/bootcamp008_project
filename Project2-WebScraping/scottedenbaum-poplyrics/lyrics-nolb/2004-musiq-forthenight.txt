It was the summer 2001All before the drama begunWhen we first metI seen you sitting out on your stepsYou was broke down crying a messSo I interferedI asked what's the reason for tearsI was wishing you could tell me your fearsBut I'll start with ya nameYou told me how ya man playing gamesSo I said that it was time for a changeAnd you just laughedBut it looked like you ain't laughed in whileI was glad that I could give you a smileThen we both blushedBut really girl it ain't no rushI was thinking girl that we can discussA future for usCause homeboy just got you crushedYou need to leave that clown in the dustTrustI just want to talkI'm thinking I can give you a callAnd we can pick it upWhere we left offI'll holla tomorrowGirl I understand you loyal to ya manAnd that's alright aww babyBut that don't change the factThat you fine and you stay crying every night nah babyGirl you got to let him knowYou can't live like this no moreNah babyCan't seeTogether you and me could be so special ah babyOur feelings get greaterA million days laterTalking all night we stay up butHere comes ya exReturned with that drama and stressAll the nonsense that you just left but yetYou except and go back to try it againThen return with a broken heartThat I gotta mendThat's unfairI've only been your lover and friendAnd homey there he just front and pretendBut you don't care the life he leadsIs unsafeI would never place my hands to your faceBut still I chaseCat and mouseFirst you kick him outThen you at his houseWhat is that aboutI can't figure you outEven your friend said I was betterBut you listen to himNever like uh-uh whateverSo the next time hurt you againYou already knew where you should've beenAnd that's with meGirl I understand you loyal to ya manAnd that's alright aww babyBut that don't change the factThat you fine and you stay crying every night nah babyGirl you got to let him knowYou can't live like this no moreNah babyCan't seeTogether you and me could be so special ah babyAll the timesYou 2way telling meThat you miss meWanting me to come over and keep you busyRemember thatNow that you goneIt's been kinda hardCan't think, can't sleepCan't do nothing at allJust tell me why you had to go backSee you ain't have to go through thatMy babyYou could've been here right by my sideMe and you at the park taking walks outsideButInstead, I keep on having these dreamsWaiting for my phone to ringMy baby wishing that it would be you But I know that won't come trueGirl I understand you loyal to ya manAnd that's alright aww babyBut that don't change the factThat you fine and you stay crying every night nah babyGirl you got to let him knowYou can't live like this no moreNah babyCan't seeTogether you and me could be so special ah baby
