[Chorus]If I could change the way I live my life todayI wouldn't change a single thing'Cause if I changed my world into another placeI wouldn't see your smiling faceHoney don't you worry, there's nothin' to worry for'Cause if I didn't love you I wouldn't be here nowAnd if I didn't want you I would have turned around by nowYou've got to believe me babe, believe that I love you so'Cause if I didn't love you I would have turned aroundAnd if I didn't want you, then I would want you outThis love, this love has filled me upOoh my love I'll never give you up'Cause I'll always want your love[Chorus]Believing is the answer, the answer to all your fearsWhen I first said I loved you, I went in for the killNow when I say I love you, I mean I always willThis love, this love has filled me upOoh my love I'll never give you up'Cause I'll always want your love[Chorus]This love, this love has filled me upOoh my love I'll never give you up'Cause I'll always want your love[Chorus]
