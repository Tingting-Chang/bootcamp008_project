Your little hands wrapped around my fingerAnd it's so quiet in the world tonightYour little eyelids flutter cause you're dreamingSo I tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlightTo you, everything's funnyYou got nothing to regretI'd give all I have honeyIf you could stay like thatOh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow upJust stay this littleOh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow upIt could stay this simpleI won't let nobody hurt youWon't let no one break your heartNo one will desert youJust try to never grow upNever grow upYou're in the car on the way to the moviesAnd you're mortified your mom's dropping you offAt fourteen, there's just so much you can't doAnd you can't wait to move outSomeday and call your own shotsBut don't make her drop you off around the blockRemember that she's getting older tooAnd don't lose the way that you dance around in your p.j.s getting ready for schoolOh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow upJust stay this littleOh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow upIt could stay this simpleAnd no one's ever burned youNothing's ever left you scarredAnd even though you want toJust try to never grow upTake pictures in your mind of your childhood roomMemorize what it sounded like when your dad gets homeRemember the footsteps, remember the words saidAnd all your little brother's favorite songsI just realized everything I have is someday gonna be goneSo here I am in my new apartmentIn a big city, they just dropped me offIt's so much colder than I thought it would beSo I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight onWish I'd never grown upI wish I'd never grown upOh I don't wanna grow upWish I'd never grown upCould still be littleOh I don't wanna grow upWish I'd never grown upIt could still be simpleOh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow upJust stay this littleOh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow upIt could stay this simpleI won't let nobody hurt youWon't let no one break your heartAnd even though you want toPlease try to never grow upDon't you ever grow upJust never grow up
