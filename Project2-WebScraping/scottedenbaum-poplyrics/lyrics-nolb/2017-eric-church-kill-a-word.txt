If I could kill a word and watch it dieI'd poison never, shoot goodbyeBeat regret when I felt I had the nerveYeah, I'd pound fear to a pile of sandChoke lonely out with my bare handsI'd hang hate so that it can't be heardIf I could only kill a wordI'd take brokenness out backAnd break heartbreak, stand there and laughRight in its face while shootin' it the birdI'd put upset down in its placeI'd squeeze the life out of disgraceLay over under six cold feet of dirtIf I could only kill a wordGive me sticks, give stonesBend my body, break my bonesUse staff and rod to turn me black and blue'Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsayBut if were up to me to changeI'd turn lies and hate to love and truthIf I could only kill a wordI'd knock out temptation's teethI'd sever evil, let it bleedThen light up wicked, stand and watch it burnI'd take vice and I'd take vileAnd tie 'em up there with hostileHang 'em high and leave 'em for the birdsIf I could only kill a word
