I was sittin' there sellin' turnips on a flatbed truckCrunchin' on a pork rind when she pulled upShe had to be thinkin' this is where rednecks come fromShe had Hollywood written on her license plateShe was lost and lookin' for the interstateNeedin' directions, and I was the man for the jobI told her way up yonder past the caution lightThere's a little country store with an old Coke signYou gotta stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet teaThen a left will take you to the interstateBut a right will bring you right back here to meI was sittin' there thinkin' 'bout her pretty faceKickin' myself for not catchin' her nameI threw my hat and thought, 'you fool, that it coulda been love.I knew my old Ford couldn't run her downShe probably didn't like me anyhowSo I watched her disappear in a cloud of dustI told her way up yonder past the caution lightThere's a little country store with an old Coke signYou gotta stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet teaThen a left will take you to the interstateBut a right will bring you right back here to meIs this Georgia heat playin' tricks on meOr am I really seein' what I think I see?The woman of my dreams comin' back to meShe went way up yonder past the caution lightDon't know why, but somethin' felt rightWhen she stopped in and asked Miss Bell for some of her sweet teaMama gave her a big 'ol glass and sent her right back here to meThank God for good directions...and turnip greens
