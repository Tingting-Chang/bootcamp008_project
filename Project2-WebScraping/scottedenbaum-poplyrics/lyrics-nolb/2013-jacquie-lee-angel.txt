Spend all your time waitingFor that second chanceFor a break that would make it okayThere's always some reasonTo feel not good enoughAnd it's hard at the end of the dayI need some distractionOh beautiful releaseMemories seep from my veinsLet me be emptyOh and weightless and maybeI'll find some peace tonightIn the arms of the angelFly away from hereFrom this dark cold hotel roomAnd the endlessness that you fearYou are pulled from the wreckageOf your silent reverieYou're in the arms of the angelMay you find some comfort hereYou're in the arms of the angelFly away from hereFrom this dark cold hotel roomAnd the endlessness that you fearYou are pulled from the wreckageOf your silent reverieYou're in the arms of the angelMay you find some comfort hereYou're in the arms of the angelMay you find some comfort here
