All This timeI knew some day you'd need to findSomething that you left behindSomething I can't give youAll these tearsAnd like a night love disappearsMy heart's so good for souvenirsAnd memories are foreverAll This timeAll and all I've no regretsThe sun still shines the sun still setsAnd the heart forgives, the heart forgetsOh what will I do now with all this time?One more kissEven though it's come to thisI'll close my eyes and make a wishHoping you'll rememberAll This timeAll and all I've no regretsThe sun still shines the sun still setsAnd the heart forgives, the heart forgetsOh what will I do now with all this time?Say GoodbyeA bond will make another timeDon't be sorry if you cryI'll be crying tooAll this time...All This timeAll and all I've no regretsThe sun still shines the sun still setsAnd the heart forgives, the heart forgetsOh what will I do now with all this time?
