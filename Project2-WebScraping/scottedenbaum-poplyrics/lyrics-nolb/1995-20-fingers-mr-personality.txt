[Chorus]They call you mr personality because you're so uglyThey call you mr personality because you're so uglyYou're so uglyMr personality, you're so uglyMr personality, you're so uglyMr personality, you're so uglyWhen I look at you I go outta my mind,Its like I'm lookin' at someones behind.You make the children scream and babies cry,With your crusty teeth and your bloodshot eyes.You're so ugly, your dad hadda tie a porkchop around your neck just to get the dog to play witchaOoh that's ugly.[Chorus]No matter what you wear, your face doesn't match,I don't think you were born, you hadda be hatched.Everyone you meet gets one hell of a stare,They can't fall asleep cause your a walking nightmare.You're so ugly...i heard that when you were born, the dr slapped yo momma.Ooh man that's ugly.[Chorus]You make Frankenstein look like Johnny Depp,And when you cross the street you cause a major car wreck.You asked my grandma if she needed help with her bags,I've never seen an old lady run so fast.Jeez look at those glasses...are those coke bottles or something?Is that your face...or did your neck throw up something?[Chorus]You're so ugly
