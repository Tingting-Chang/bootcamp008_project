All of these lines across my faceTell you the story of who I amSo many stories of where I've beenAnd how I got to where I amBut these stories don't mean anythingWhen you've got no one to tell them toIt's true, I was made for youI climbed across the mountain topsSwam all across the ocean blueI crossed all the lines, and I broke all the rulesBut, baby, I broke them all for youOh because even when I was flat brokeYou made me feel like a million bucksYou doI was made for youFor youYou see the smile that's on my mouthIt's hiding the words that don't come outAnd all of my friends who think that I'm blessedThey don't know my head is a messNo, they don't know who I really amAnd they don't know whatI've been through like you doAnd I was made for youAnd all of these lines across my faceTell you the story of who I amSo many stories of where I've beenAnd how I got to where I amBut these stories don't mean anythingWhen you've got no one to tell them toIt's true, I was made for youIt's true that I was made for you
