Seventeen, the only way I had a carIs after I dropped my Momma off where she needed to goIt had four bald tiresWith the ceiling falling and the windows stuckBut the only thing I cared about was the radioWe turned it on, turned it up to 10And everybody would jump on inRidin' down the highwayWho wants to be the DJI'll find a spot on the side of the roadYou find something on the radioA real, real good songWe'll know it when it comes onWe had no money and no place to goAll we needed was a radioGrabbed my girlWe looked for somewhere to watch the starsA perfect place to put it park and take it slowShe sang alongTo even the ones that she barely knewStill sounded good, a little louder tooBut we didn't careI looked at her, she looked at meI'll never forget that melodyRidin' down the highwayWho wants to be the DJI'll find a spot on the side of the roadYou find something on the radioA real, real good songWe'll know it when it comes onWe had no money and no place to goAll we needed was a radioHey ya'll be quiet, that's my favorite songHey man, turn it up loudCome on, come on, come onRidin' down the highwayWho wants to be the DJI'll find a spot on the side of the roadYou find something on the radioA real, real good songWe'll know it when it comes onWe had no money and no place to goAll we needed was a radio
