Oh I betYou were a virgin'Til you let meOh I miss your kissWhen you are goneI was young and foolishDidn't know what I was doingDidn't know I'd lost you'Til you were goneOh I miss your lovingWhen you are goneNow I gotta get upEarly in the morningFind me another loverNow I've got to get up earlyEvery morning'Cause the early birdAlways catches the wormNow I've got to get up earlyEvery morningGot to make up for theLesson I learnedGot to find me a loverWho won't run for coverFind me a loverWho won't run for coverGot to get upEarly in the morningFind me another loverNow I gotta get upEarly in the morningFind me another loverI was young and foolishDidn't know what I was doingDidn't know I'd lost you'Til you'd goneShe had a pretty faceDrove me wildI even wanted her to have my child
