Smiles in the morning as warm as sunshineKisses when I lay down at nightAnd two loving arms to console meI should be scared it's so rightBut too much of a good thing is a good thingFeelings like this can't be wrongAnd too much of a good thing is a good thingAnd we've got a good thing going onYou look in my eyes and see my thinkingI know when you're happy, and when you're sadSome would say it's too perfectBut I don't think what we have is so badCause too much of a good thing is a good thingFeelings like this can't be wrongAnd too much of a good thing is a good thingAnd we've got a good thing going on
