At a diner down on Broadway they make small talkWhen she brings his eggs and fills his coffee cupHe jokes about his love lifeAnd tells her he's about ready to give upThat's when she says I've been there beforeBut keep on looking because maybe who your looking for isSomebody in the next carSomebody on the morning trainSomebody in the coffee shop that you walk right by everydaySomebody that you look at but never really seeSomewhere out there is somebodyAcross town in a crowded elevatorHe can't forget the things that waitress saidHe usually reads the paperBut today he reads a strangers face insteadIts that blue eyed girl from two floors upMaybe she's the oneMaybe he could fall in love withSomebody in the next carSomebody on the morning trainSomebody in the coffee shop that you walk right by everydaySomebody that you look at but never really seeSomewhere out there is somebodyNow they laugh about the moment that it happenedThe moment they both missed until that dayWhen he saws his future in her eyesInstead of just another friendly faceAnd he wonders why he searched so longWhen she was always there at that diner waitin' onSomebody in the next carSomebody on the morning trainSomebody in the coffee shop that you walk right by everydaySomebody that you look at but never really seeSomewhere out thereOh somewhere out there, is somebody.
