Now I've heard there was a secret chordThat David played, and it pleased the LordBut you don't really care for music, do you?It goes like thisThe fourth, the fifthThe minor fall, the major liftThe baffled king composing HallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahYour faith was strong but you needed proofYou saw her bathing on the roofHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew herShe tied youTo a kitchen chairShe broke your throne, and she cut your hairAnd from your lips she drew the HallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahYou say I took the name in vainI don't even know the nameBut if I did, well really, what's it to you?There's a blaze of lightIn every wordIt doesn't matter which you heardThe holy or the broken HallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahI did my best, it wasn't muchI couldn't feel, so I tried to touchI've told the truth, I didn't come to fool youAnd even thoughIt all went wrongI'll stand before the Lord of SongWith nothing on my tongue but HallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujah
