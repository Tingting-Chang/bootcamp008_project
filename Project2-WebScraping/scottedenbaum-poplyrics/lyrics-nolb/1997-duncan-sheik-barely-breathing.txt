I know what you're doingI see it all too clearI only taste the salineWhen I kiss away your tearsYou really had me going, wishing on a starBut the black holes that surround youAre heavier by farI believed in your confusionYou were so completely tornWell it must have been that yesterdayWas the day that I was bornThere's not much to examineThere's nothing left to hideYou really can't be seriousIf you have to ask me whyI say good-bye'Cause I am barely breathingAnd I can't find the airI don't know who I'm kiddingImagining you care, and I could stand hereWaiting a fool for another dayBut I don't suppose it's worth the priceWorth the price, the price that I would payEveryone keeps asking, what's it all about?I used to be so certain and I can't figure outWhat is this attraction? I only feel the painThere's nothing left to reason and only you to blameWill it ever change?'Cause I am barely breathingAnd I can't find the airI don't know who I'm kiddingImagining you care, and I could stand hereWaiting a fool for another dayBut I don't suppose it's worth the priceWorth the price, the price that I would payBut I'm thinking it over anywayI've come to find, I may never knowYour changing mind, is it friend or foe?I rise above or sink belowWith every time you come and goPlease don't, you come and go'Cause I am barely breathingAnd I can't find the airI don't know who I'm kiddingImagining you care, and I could stand hereWaiting a fool for another dayBut I don't suppose it's worth the priceWorth the price, the price that I would pay
