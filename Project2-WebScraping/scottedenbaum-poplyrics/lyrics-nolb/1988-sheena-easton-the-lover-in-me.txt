Talk about the love you're missin'Maybe then it's true when they say love is blindI can help you if you listenI can make you feel good if you just let my tryIf everlasting love is what you're waiting forThen that time for you just has arrivedSo here I am come walk right through my doorAnd be loved for the rest of your lifeChorus:If you talk about good lovin'Let's talk about the lover in me (shoo do wop)So don't go talk about no otherJust talk about the lover in me (shoo do wop)I can give you all the lovin'But I gotta know that you're there to receiveI can be your only womanBut I gotta feel that I'm all that you needI'll be your everything and I can give you so much moreAnd I'll never leave you lonely at nightSo here I am come walk right through my doorAnd be loved for the rest of your life(Chorus X 2)(Instrumental break)Talk about and dream about and think about your loverDon't talk about or dream about or think about no otherDon't run around all over town searchin' for some otherThe love we found won't let us down let's talk about the lover...I'll be your everything and I can give you so much moreAnd I'll never leave you lonely at nightSo here I am come walk right through my doorAnd be loved for the rest of your life(Chorus)If you talk about and dream about and think about your loverDon't talk about, think about or dream about no otherDon't run around all over town just searchin' for some otherThis love we found won't let us down let's talk about the lover in me(Chorus with ad-libs)If you talk about and dream about and think about your loverDon't talk about, think about or dream about no otherDon't run around all over town just searchin' for some otherThis love we found won't let us down let's talk about the lover in me(Chorus, fade)
