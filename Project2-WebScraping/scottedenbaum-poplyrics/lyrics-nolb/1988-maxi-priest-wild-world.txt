Now that I've lost everything to youYou say you want to start something newAnd it's breaking my heart you're leavingBaby I'm grievingBut if you want to leave take good careHope you find a lot of nice things to wearBut then a lot of nice things turn badOut there[Chorus]Oh baby baby it's a wild worldIt's hard to get by just upon a smileOh baby baby it's a wild worldI'll always remember you like a child girlYou know I've seen a lot of what the world can doAnd it's breaking my heart in twoBecause I never want to see you sad girlDon't be a bad girlBut if you want to leave take good careHope you find a lot of nice friends out thereJust remember there's a lot of bad airBeware[Chorus]You know I've seen a lot of what the world can doAnd it's breaking my heart in twoBecause I never want to see you sad girlDon't be a bad girlBut if you want to leave take good careHope you find a lot of nice friends out thereJust remember there's a lot of bad airBeware[Chorus]
