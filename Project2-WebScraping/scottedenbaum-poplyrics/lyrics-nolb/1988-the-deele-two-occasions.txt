I want to knowWhat you're thinkingThere are some things you can't hideI want to knowWhat you're feelingTell me what's on you mindHere i am in silence,Looking round without a clueI find myself along againAll alone with youI can see behind your eyes,The things that i don't knowIf you hide away from me,How can our love grow?I want to knowWhat you're thinkingThere are some things you can't hideI want to knowWhat you're feelingTell me what's on your mindI know i could break you down,But what good would it do?I could surely never knowThat what you say is trueHere i am in silence,It's a game i have to playYou and i in silenceWith nothing else to sayI want to knowWhat you're thinkingThere are some things you can't hideI want to knowWhat you're feelingTell me what's on your mindI want to knowWhat you're thinkingThere are some things you can't hideI want to knowWhat you're feelingTell me what's on your mindI want to knowWhat you're thinkingThere are some things you can't hideI want to knowWhat you're feelingTell me what's on your mind
