Keep drinking coffee, stare me down across the tableWhile I look outsideSo many things I'd say if only I were ableBut I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass byYou've got opinions, manWe're all entitled to 'em, but I never askedSo let me thank you for your time,And try not to waste anymore of mineAnd get out of here fastI hate to break it to you babe, but I'm not drowningThere's no one here to saveWho cares if you disagree?You are not meWho made you king of anything?So you dare tell me who to be?Who died and made you king of anything?You sound so innocent, all full of good intentSwear you know bestBut you expect me to jump up on board with youAnd ride off into your delusional sunsetI'm not the one who's lost with no directionBut you'll never seeYou're so busy making masks with my name on them in all capsYou got the talking down, just not the listeningAnd who cares if you disagree?You are not meWho made you king of anything?So you dare tell me who to be?Who died and made you king of anything?All my life I've tried to make everybody happyWhile I just hurt and hideWaiting for someone to tell me it's my turn to decideWho cares if you disagree?You are not meWho made you king of anything?So you dare tell me who to be?Who died and made you king of anything?Who cares if you disagree?You are not meWho made you king of anything?So you dare tell me who to be?Who died and made you king of anything?Let me hold your crown, babe
