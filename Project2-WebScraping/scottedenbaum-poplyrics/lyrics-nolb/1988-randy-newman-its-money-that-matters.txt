Of all of the people that I used to knowMost never adjusted to the great big worldI see them lurking in book storesWorking for the Public RadioCarrying their babies around in a sack on their backMoving careful and slow[Chorus)It's money that mattersHear what I sayIt's money that mattersIn the USAAll of these people are much brighter than IIn any fair system they would flourish and thriveBut they barely surviveThey eke out a living and they barely surviveWhen I was a young boy, maybe thirteenI took a hard look around me and asked what does it mean?So I talked to my father, and he didn't knowAnd I talked to my friend and he didn't knowAnd I talked to my brother and he didn't knowAnd I talked to everybody that I knew(Chorus]It's money that mattersNow you know that it's trueIt's money that mattersWhatever you doThen I talked to a man lived up on the county lineI was washing his car with a friend of mineHe was a little fat guy in a red jumpsuitI said "You look kind of funny"He said "I know that I do""But I got a great big house on the hill hereAnd a great big blonde wife inside itAnd a great big pool in my backyard and another great big pool beside itSonny it's money that matters, hear what I sayIt's money that matters in the USAIt's money that mattersNow you know that it's trueIt's money that matters whatever you do"
