You came on to me a house on fireOne look was all it took for my desireI'm still burnin'It's the middle of the nightI need somethin''That can make me feel alright as I goSkin deep-to the boneEvery time I see your face I goSkin deep-to the boneTellin' me that I'm in troubleS.O.S.I'm in distress -tonightKnock knock in the dark-what will I findYour eyes-hypnotize-but can they read my mindWatch your step nowWe're gettin' closer to the edgeThis is dangerousAnd all the lights are flashing red as I goSkin deep-to the boneEvery time I see your face I goSkin deep-to the boneTellin' me that I'm in troubleSkin deep-to the boneEvery time I hear your voice I goSkin deep-to the boneTellin' me that I'm in troubleToo far goneCan't hold on-tonight-not tonightI'm still burnin'It's the middle of the nightI need someoneWho can make me feel alright as I goSkin deep-to the boneEvery time I see your face I goSkin deep-to the boneTellin' me that I'm in troubleSkin deep-to the boneEvery time I hear your voice I goSkin deep-to the boneTellin' me that I'm in troubleToo far goneCan't hold on-tonight-not tonight
