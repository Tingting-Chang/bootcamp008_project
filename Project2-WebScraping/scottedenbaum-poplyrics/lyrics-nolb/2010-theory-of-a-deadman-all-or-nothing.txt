When I first saw you standing thereYou know it was a little hard not to stareSo nervous when I drove you homeI know being apart is a little hard to bare.Send some flowers to your work and homeSo that I will have you in my arms againWe kissed that night before I leftStill now that's somethingI could never forgetYou've got all that I needLooking at all or nothingBabe it's you and IWith you I know thatI am good for somethingSo let's go give it a tryWe've got our backs against the oceanIt's just us against the worldLooking at all or nothingBabe it's you and ILooking at all or nothingBabe it's you and ILet's take a chance go far away todayAnd never look back againSince I said I loved you in Las VegasIt's never been the same since thenYou've got all that I needLooking at all or nothingBabe it's you and IWith you I know thatI am good for somethingSo let's go give it a tryWe've got our backs against the oceanIt's just us against the worldLooking at all or nothingBabe it's you and ILooking at all or nothingBabe it's you and IThis is it nothing to hideOne more kiss never say goodbyeThis is it babe your all mineLooking at all or nothingBabe it's you and II know that I am good for somethingSo lets go give it a tryWe've got our backs against the oceanIt's just us against the worldLooking at all or nothingBabe it's you and IWith you I know thatI am good for somethingSo lets go give it a tryWe got our backs against the oceanIt's just us against the worldLooking at all or nothingBabe it's you and ILooking at all or nothingBabe it's you and IBabe it's you and I
