Sometimes we fall down and can't get back upWe're hiding behind skin that's too toughHow come we don't say I love you enough'Til it's too late, it's not too lateOur hearts are hungry for a food that won't comeAnd we could make a feast from these crumbsAnd we're all staring down the barrel of a gunSo if your life flashed before you, what would you wish you would've doneYeah gotta startLooking at the hands of the time we've been given hereThis is all we got then we gotta start thinkin' itEvery second counts on a clock that's tickin'Gotta live like we're dying ohWe only got 86 400 seconds in a dayTo turn it all around or to throw it all awayGotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,Gotta live like we're dying ohWell if your plane fell out of the skiesWho would you call with your last goodbyeShould be so careful who we left out of our livesSo when we long for absolution, there'll be no one on the lineYeah we gotta start lookin' at the hands of the time we've been given hereThis all we got then we gotta start thinkin' itEvery second counts on a clock that's tickin'Gotta live like we're dying ohWe only got 86 400 seconds in a dayTo turn it all around or to throw it all awayGotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,Gotta live like we're dyingLike we're dying ohLike we're dyingLike we're dying ohLike we're dyingWe only got 86 400 seconds in a dayTo turn it all around or to throw it all awayGotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,Gotta live like we're dying ohYou never know a good thing until it's goneYou never see a crash until it's head onWhy we think we're right when we're dead wrong,You never know a good thing 'til it's goneYeah we gotta start lookin' at the hands of the time we've been given hereThis all we got and we gotta start thinkin' itEvery second counts on a clock that's tickin'Gotta live like we're dying ohWe only got 86 400 seconds in a dayTo turn it all around or to throw it all awayGotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,Gotta live like we're dyingLike we're dying ohLike we're dyingLike we're dying ohLike we're dyingWe only got 86 400 seconds in a dayTo turn it all around or to throw it all awayGotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,Gotta live like we're dying oh
