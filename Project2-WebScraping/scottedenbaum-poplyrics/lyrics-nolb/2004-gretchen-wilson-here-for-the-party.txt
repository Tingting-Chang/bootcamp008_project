Well I'm an eight ball shooting double-fisted drinking son of a gunI wear my jeans a little tightJust to watch the little boys come undoneI'm here for the beer and the ball busting bandGonna get a little crazy just because I canYou know I'm here for the partyAnd I ain't leaving till they throw me outGonna have a little fun gonna get me someYou know I'm here, I'm here for the partyI may not be a ten but the boys say I clean up goodAnd if I give 'em half a chanceFor some rowdy romance you know they wouldI've been waiting all week just to have a good timeSo bring on them cowboys and their pick-up linesYou know I'm here for the partyAnd I ain't leaving till they throw me outGonna have a little fun gonna get me someYou know I'm here, I'm here for the partyDon't want no purple hooter shooter just some jack on the rocksDon't mind me if I start that trashy talkYou know I'm here for the partyAnd I ain't leaving till they throw me outGonna have a little fun gonna get me someYou know I'm here, I'm here for the partyYou know I'm here for the partyAnd I ain't leaving till they throw me outGonna have a little fun gonna get me someYou know I'm here, I'm here for the party
