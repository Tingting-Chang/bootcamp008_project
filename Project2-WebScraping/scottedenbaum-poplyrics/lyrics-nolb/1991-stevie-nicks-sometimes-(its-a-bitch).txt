Well I've run through rainbows and castles of candyI cried a river of tears from the painI try to dance with what life has to hand meMy partner's been pleasure, my partner's been painThere are days when I swear I could fly like an eagleAnd dark desperate hours that nobody seesMy arms stretched triumphant on top of the mountainMy head in my hands, down on my kneesSometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breezeSometimes love's blind, and sometimes it seesSometimes it's roses, and, sometimes it's weedsSometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breezeI've reached in darkness and come out with treasureI've laid down with love and I woke up with liesWhat's it all worth only the heart can measureIt's not what's in the mirror, but what's left insideSometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breezeSometimes love's blind, and sometimes it seesSometimes it's roses, and, sometimes it's weedsSometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breezeYou gotta take it as it comesSometimes it don't come easyI've run through rainbows and castles of candyAnd I've cried a river of tears from the painI tried to dance with what life had to hand meAnd if I could, I'd do it all over againSometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breezeSometimes love's blind, and sometimes it seesSometimes it's roses, and, sometimes it's weedsSometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breezeSometimes the picture just ain't what it seemsYou get what you want, but it's not what you needSometimes it's a bitch, sometimes, it's a breezeWell it's a breeze, it's a breeze, it's a breeze
