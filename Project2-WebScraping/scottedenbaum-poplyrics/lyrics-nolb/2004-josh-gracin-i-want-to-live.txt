Sometimes I feel like I needTo shake myselfTo wake myselfI feel like I'm just sleepwalkin'Through my lifeIt's like I'm swimmin' inAn ocean of emotionBut still somehow slowlyGoin' numb insideI don't like who I'm becomin'I know I've gotta do somethin'Before my life passes right by[Chorus]I want to cry like the rain,Cry like the rainShine like the sun on aBeautiful mornin'Sing to the Heavens like aChurch bell ringin'Fight with the devil and goDown swingin'Fly like a bird, roll like a stoneLove like I ain't afraid to beAloneTake everything that thisWorld has to giveI want to liveSometimes I wonderWhy I work so hard to guardMy heartTill I hardly feel anything at allI've spent my whole life buildingUp this ivory towerAnd now that I'm in it, I keepWishin' it would fallSo I could feel the groundBeneath meReally taste this air I'mBreathin'And know that I'm alive[Chorus]Somethin' deep insideKeeps sayin'Life is like a vaporIt's gone in just theTwinklin' of an eye[Chorus]I want to take everyBreath I can getI want to liveYeah, yeah
