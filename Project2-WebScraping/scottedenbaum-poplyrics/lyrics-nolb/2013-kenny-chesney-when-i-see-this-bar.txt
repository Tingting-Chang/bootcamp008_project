Well I see the souls of so many friendsAnd I see us all back here againWith sandy floors and ceiling fansA Rastafarian one-man band with songsThat fill my memories like a tip jarYeah, that's what I seeWhen I see this barI see tourists at Christmas timeAnd I taste beers with a hint of limeI feel lonely 'cause it's not the sameDifferent faces and different namesLiving like pirates out among the starsYeah, that's what I seeWhen I see this barPieces of our past slowly slip awayBut time just stands still when I walk in this placeAnd I see a kid coming into his ownAnd a man learning to move onSomehow trying to find his wayA dreamer betting on blind faithChasing that sun and following his heartYeah, that's what I seeWhen I see this barPieces of our past slowly slip awayBut time just stands still when I walk in this placeA few have moved on back to MaineJacksonville and Key BiscayneSome are still living the dreamStuck in still life it seemsNo matter where they've beenOr where they areYeah, I see 'em hereWhen I see this barWhen I see this barI wonder where we go from here(That's what I see when I see this bar)Life ain't over but it's always near(That's what I see when I see this bar)I think about all the good times that we had(That's what I see when I see this bar)Makes me happy and it makes me sad(That's what I see when I see this bar)How could we be so close, now so far apart(That's what I see when I see this bar)That's what I feel, that's what I seeYeah we were living like pirates and wannabe starsThat's what I see when I see this barThat's what I see when I see this bar
