You and I together in our livesSacred ties would never frayThen why can I let myself tell liesAnd watch you die every dayI think back to the timesWhen dreams were what matteredTough talking youth naiveteYou said, you never let me downOh, but the horse stampedes and ragesIn the name of desperationIs it all just wasted timeCan you look at yourselfWhen you think of whatYou left behindIs it all just wasted timeCan you live with yourselfWhen you think of whatYou've left behindParanoid delusions they haunt youWhere's my friend I used to knowHe's all alone, he's buried deep withinA carcass searching for a soulCan you feel me inside your heartAs it's bleedingWhy can't you believe you can be lovedI hear you scream in agonyAnd the horse stampedes and ragesIn the name of desperationIs it all just wasted timeCan you look at yourselfWhen you think of whatYou left behindIs it all just wasted timeCan you live with yourselfWhen you think of whatYou've left behindYou said, you never let me downOh, but the horse stampedes and ragesIn the name of desperationIs it all just wasted timeCan you look at yourselfWhen you think of whatYou left behindIs it all just wasted timeCan you live with yourselfWhen you think of whatYou've left behindThe sun will rise againThe earth will turn to sandCreation colors seem to fade to greyAnd you'll see the sickly hands of timeWill write your final rhymeAnd end a memoryI never thought you'll let it getThis far, boyI never thought, I never thought you'll let it getThis far, boy, oh no, ohI never thought, I never thought you'll let it getThis far, boy, noI never thought you'll let it getThis far, boy
