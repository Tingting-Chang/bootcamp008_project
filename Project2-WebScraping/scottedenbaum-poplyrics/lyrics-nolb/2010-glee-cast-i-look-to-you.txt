As I lay me downHeaven hear me nowI'm lost without a causeAfter giving it my allWinter storms have comeAnd darkened my sunAfter all that I've been throughWho on earth can I turn to?[Chorus]I look to you,I look to youAfter all my strength is goneIn you I can be strongI look to you,I look to youAnd when melodies are gone In you I hear a songI look to youAbout to lose my breathThere's no fighting leftSinking to rise no moreSearching for that open doorAnd every road that I've takenLed to my regretAnd I don't know if I'm go'n make itNothing to do but lift my head[Chorus]My levees are brokenMy walls are coming down on meMy rain is fallingDefeat is callingI need you to set me freeTake me far away from the battleI need youShine on me![Chorus]
