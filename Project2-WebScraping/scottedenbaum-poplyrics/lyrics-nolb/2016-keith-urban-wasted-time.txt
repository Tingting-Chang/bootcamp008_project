The rain is coming down tonightI'm smiling looking at this photographI hear that song and I'm flying right backTo when we had it madeEvery Friday night when the sun went downWe'd be running them streets like we owned the townAnd I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it goI wonder if you ever think about it like I doSeven kids on my two lane roadHad the guns on the radioAfter all this time it still feels so goodWhen I think about those summer nightsSinging out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of MineSipping on the local's spark of lightAin't it funny how the best days of my lifeWas all that wasted timeAll that wasted timeOut of nowhere, it slipped awayAnd the rope by the river hangs silentlyAnd the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to beAh, I can't explainThey took all the color from the picture frameAnd the days got sold to the greed and the gameBut I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it goI wonder if you ever think about it like I doSeven kids on my two lane roadWe had the guns on the radioAfter all this time it still feels so goodWhen I think about those summer nightsSinging out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of MineSipping on the local's spark of lightAin't it funny how the best days of my lifeWas all that wasted timeAll that wasted timeSwinging on the lineLiving all that wasted timeHey, hey, nowSummer dresses rained on the hood of the carOnly music that we had was out the left speakerWe were living every second 'til the time ran outWe had nothing but we had it allWhen I think about those summer nightSneaking out the window, running back roadsYour hand in mineWe were going nowhere, we were so aliveUh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my lifeWas all that wasted timeAll that wasted timeWe were swinging out on the lineLiving all that wasted timeHey, you know ohDon't you feel it coming on back now
