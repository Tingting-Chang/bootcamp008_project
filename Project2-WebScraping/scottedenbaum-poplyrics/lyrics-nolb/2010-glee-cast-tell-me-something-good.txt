You ain't got no kind of feeling insideI got something that will sure 'nuff set your stuff on fireYou refuse to put anything before your prideI got something that will knock all your pride aside[Chorus]Tell me something good (tell me, tell me, tell me)Tell me that you love meTell me something good (tell me, tell me, tell me)Tell me that you like it, yeahGot no time is what you're known to sayI'll make you wish there were 48 hours to each dayProblem is you ain't been loved like you shouldWhat I got to give will sure 'nuff do you good[Chorus]
