Let's go backBack to the beginningBack to when the earth, the sun, the stars all aligned'Cause perfect didn't feel so perfectTrying to fit a square into a circleWas no lieI defyLet the rain fall downAnd wake my dreamsLet it wash awayMy sanity'Cause I wanna feel the thunderI wanna screamLet the rain fall downI'm comimg clean, I'm coming cleanI'm sheddingShedding every colorTrying to find a pigment of truthBeneath my skin'Cause differentDoesn't feel so differentAnd going out is betterThen always staying inFeel the windLet the rain fall downAnd wake my dreamsLet it wash awayMy sanity'Cause I wanna feel the thunderI wanna screamLet the rain fall downI'm comimg clean, I'm coming cleanI'm coming cleanLet the rain fallLet the rain fallI'm coming cleanLet the rain fall downAnd wake my dreamsLet it wash awayMy sanity'Cause I wanna feel the thunderI wanna screamLet the rain fall downI'm comimg clean, I'm coming cleanLet's go backBack to the beginning
