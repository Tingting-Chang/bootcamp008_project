Notice meTake my handWhy are weStrangers whenOur love is strongWhy carry on without meEvery time I try to fly I fallWithout my wingsI feel so smallI guess I need you babyAnd every time I seeYou in my dreamsI see your faceIt's haunting meI guess I need you babyI make-believeThat you are hereIt's the only wayThat I see clearWhat have I doneYou seem to move on easyEvery time I try to fly I fallWithout my wingsI feel so smallI guess I need you babyAnd every time I seeYou in my dreamsI see your faceYou're haunting meI guess I need you babyI may have made it rainPlease forgive meMy weakness caused you painAnd this song's my sorryAt night I prayThat soon your face will fade awayEvery time I try to fly I fallWithout my wingsI feel so smallI guess I need you babyAnd every time I seeYou in my dreamsI see your faceYou're haunting meI guess I need you baby
