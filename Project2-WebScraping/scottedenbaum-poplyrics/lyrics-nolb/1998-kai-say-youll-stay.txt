Tonight we're all alone tonightThere's never been a momentThat trembled like tonightI read your eyes tonightI see a love I've always known from another timeThat once again is mine I need to knowAre you real?Do you feel the way I feel?Could you love like I love you?Say you can and say you doSay you'll stay say you're sureSay my heart was made for yoursLet our love lead the waySay you'll stayTonight, I've waited for tonightI've waited all my life to be here where we areWith you here in my armsI can't believe, how you shineIs this moment really mine?Could you love, like I love you?Say you can and say you do[Chorus]Say you'll stay, by my sideSay it's more than just tonightSay our love, would never let you walk away (never walk away)Say you'll stay, say you're sureSay my heart was made for yoursLet our love, lead the waySay you'll stay (say you'll stay)Say you'll stayForever in my armsAnd whenever tears are fallingGirl, I'll kiss them all awaySo if you want to be my lady, say you'll stay[Chorus]
