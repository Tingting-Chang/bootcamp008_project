I remember sayin' I don't care either wayJust as long as he or she is healthy I'm okayThen the doctor pointed to the corner of the screenAnd said "Ya see that thing right there, well you know what that means"And I started wondering who he was going to beAnd I thought heaven help us if he's anything like meHe'll probably climb a tree to tall and ride his bike too fastEnd up every summer wearin' something in a castHe's gonna throw a ball and break some glass, in a window down the streetHe's gonna get in trouble, he's gonna get in fightsI'm gonna lose my temper and some sleepIt's safe to say that I'm gonna get my payback, if he's anything like meI can see him right now, knees all skinned upWith a magnifying glass tryin' to melt a Tonka truckWon't he be a sight with his football helmet onThat'll be his first love til his first love comes alongHe'll get his heart broke by the time he's in his teensAnd heaven help him if he's anything like meHe'll probably stay out too late and drive his car too fastGet a speeding ticket he'll pay for mowing grassHe's gonna get caught skippin' class and be grounded for a weekHe's gonna get in trouble, we're gonna get in fightsI'm gonna lose my temper and some sleepIt's safe to say that I'm gonna get my payback, if he's anything like me
