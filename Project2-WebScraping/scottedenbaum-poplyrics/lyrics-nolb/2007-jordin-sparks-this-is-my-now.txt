There was a time I packed my dreams away.Living in a shell, hiding from myself.There was a time when I was so afraid.I thought I'd reached the end,But baby that was thenI am made of more than my yesterdays.This is my now, and I am breathing in the moment.As I look aroundI can't believe the love I see.My fears behind me, gone are the shadows and doubtThat was then, this is my now.I have to decide,Was I gonna to play it safe.Or look somewhere deep in side,Try to turn the tide,And find the strength to take that step of faith.This is my now, and I am breathing in the moment.As I look aroundI can't believe the love I see.My fears behind me, gone are the shadows and doubtThat was then, this is my now.And I have the courage like never before, yeah.I've settled for less now I'm ready for more,Ready for more.This is my now, and I am breathing in the moment.As I look around I can't believe the love I see.My fears behind me, gone are the shadows and doubtThat was then, this is my now.I'm living in the momentI look around I can't believe the love I see.My fears behind me, gone are the shadows and doubtThat was then, this is my now.This is my now.
