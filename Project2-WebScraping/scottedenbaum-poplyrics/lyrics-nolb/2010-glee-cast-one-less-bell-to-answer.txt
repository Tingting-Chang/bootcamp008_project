One less bell to answerOne less egg to fryOne less man to pick up afterI should be happyBut all I do is cry(Cry, cry, no more laughter)Oh, I should be happy(Oh, why did she go)I only know that since he left my life's so emptyThough I try to forget it just can't be doneEach time the doorbell rings I still runI don't know how in the worldTo stop thinking of him(I should be happy)'Cause I still love him soI end each day the way I start outCrying my heart outOne less bell to answerOne less egg to fryOne less man to pick up afterNo more laughterNo more loveSince he went away (Since he went away)Since he went awayOoh, A chair is still a chairEven when there's no one sitting thereWell, I'm not meant to live aloneTurn this house into a homeWhen I climb the stair and turn the keyOh, please be thereStill in love with me(One less bell to answer)Each time the doorbell rings, I still run(One less egg to fry)One less man (one less man) to pick up afterNo more laughter, no more loveSince he went away (Since he went away)Since he went awayAll I do is cry.
