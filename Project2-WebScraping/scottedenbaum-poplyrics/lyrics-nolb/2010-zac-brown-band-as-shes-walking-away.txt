We never spoke a wordBut every thought she had I heard from across the roomIf we were standing face to faceI couldn't find the words to sayGive me one more moveI don't even know her nameI guess foolish pride's to blameNow I'm falling in love as she's walking awayAnd my heart won't tell my mind to tell my mouth what it should sayMay have lost this battle, live to fight another dayNow I'm falling in loveAs she's walking awayWise man next to me did say'Bout the one that got awaySon I missed my chanceDon't you let regret take placeOf the dreams you have to chaseAsk her to dance, go on sonYou might fall down on your faceRoll the dice and have some faithAnd don't be falling in love as she's walking awayWhen your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should sayMay have lost this battle, live to fight another dayDon't be falling in loveAs she's walking awayYou might fall down on your faceRoll the dice and have some faithAnd don't be falling in love as she's walking awayWhen your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should sayMay have lost this battle, live to fight another dayDon't be falling, falling, falling in loveAs she's walking away
