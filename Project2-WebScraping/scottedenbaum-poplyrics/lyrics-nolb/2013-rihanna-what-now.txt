I just can't figure it outWhat now? I guess I'll just wait it outWhat now? Ohhhh what now?I found the one he changed my lifeBut was it me that changedAnd he just happened to come at the right timeI'm supposed to be in loveBut I'm not muggingWhatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirrorWhatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at meAnd I just wanna screamWhat now? I just can't figure it outWhat now? I guess I'll just wait it outWhat now? Please tell meWhat now?There's no one to call cause I'm just playing games with them allThe more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone'Cause I spent every hour just going through the motionsI cant even get the emotions to come outDry as a bone, but I just wanna shoutWhat now?
