Shoulder to the wheelFor someone else's selfish gainHere there is no choosingWorking the clayWearing their anger like a ball and chain.Fire in the fieldUnderneath a blazing sunBut soon the sun was fadedAnd freedom was a songI heard them singing when the day was doneSinging to the holy One.Lead me onLead me onTo a place where the river runsInto your keeping, oh.Lead me onLead me onThe awaited deliveranceComforts the seeking, lead on.Waiting for the trainLabelled with a golden starHeavy hearted boardingWhispers in the dark"Where are we going--is it very far?"Bitter cold terrainEchoes of a slamming doorIn chambers made for sleeping, foreverVoices like thunder in a mighty roarCry to the Lord.Lead me onLead me onTo a place where the river runsInto your keeping, oh.Lead me onLead me onThe awaited deliveranceComforts the seeking, lead on.Man hurts manTime and time, time againAnd we drown in the wake of our powerSomebody tell me why.Lead me onLead me onTo a place where the river runsInto your keeping, oh.Lead me onLead me onThe awaited deliveranceComforts the seeking, lead on.Lead me onLead me onTo a place where the river runsInto your keeping, oh.Lead me onLead me onThe awaited deliveranceComforts the seeking, lead on.
