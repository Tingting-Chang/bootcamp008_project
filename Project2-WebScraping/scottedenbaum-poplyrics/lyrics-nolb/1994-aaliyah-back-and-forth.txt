We used to talk, and laugh all night girlWhat happened to those daysDid they all just fade awayHolding you in my armsMade me feel so happyThen you said you had to goWhat's wrong? Baby I need to knowBut now is the day I wish you could come back to make us trueBut you're long gone away, now I'm missing youI'm missing you baby, I miss youI'm talking to you baby, I miss youI thought you'd be with me foreverBut I guess someone took my placeTook the place of me loving youMaking love to you all through the nightI wish you were still hereSo I could see your pretty face againPlease come back and rescue meFrom all this pain and miseryThere's nothing I wouldn't do to get back next to youI'm missing you every day (I'm missing you every day)I just can't go on this way (I just can't go on this way)Come back to me, I'm begging you pleaseI'm down on my knees, I'm begging you pleaseI miss you
