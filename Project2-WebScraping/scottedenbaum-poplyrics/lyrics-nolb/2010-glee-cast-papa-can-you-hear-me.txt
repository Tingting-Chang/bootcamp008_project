God our heavenly Father.Oh, God and my fatherWho is also in heaven.May the lightOf this flickering candleIlluminate the night the wayYour spirit illuminates my soul.Papa, can you hear mePapa, can you see mePapa, can you find me in the nightPapa, are you near mePapa, can you hear mePapa, can you help me not be frightenedLooking at the skiesI seem to see a million eyesWhich ones are yoursWhere are you now that yesterdayHas waved goodbyeAnd closed it's doorsThe night is so much darker.The wind is so much colderThe world I see is so much bigger now that I'm alone.Papa, please forgive me.Try to understand me.Papa, don't you know I had no choiceCan you hear me praying,Anything I'm saying,Even though the night is filled with voicesI remember ev'rything you taught meEv'ry book I've ever read.Can all the words in all the booksHelp me to face what lies aheadThe trees are so much tallerAnd I feel so much smaller.The moon is twice as lonelyAnd the stars are half as bright.Papa, how I love you.Papa, how I need you.Papa, how I miss youKissing me goodnight
