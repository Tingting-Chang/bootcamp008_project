Paper bags and plastic heartsAll our belongings in shopping cartsIt's goodbyeBut we got one more nightLet's get drunk and drive aroundAnd make peace with an empty townWe can make it rightThrow it awayForget yesterdayWe'll make the great escapeWe won't hear a word they sayThey don't know us anywayWatch it burnLet it die'Cause we are finally free tonightTonight will change our livesIt's so good to be by your sideBut we'll cryWe won't give up the fightWe'll scream loud at the top of our lungsAnd they'll think it's just 'cause we're youngAnd we'll feel so aliveThrow it awayForget yesterdayWe'll make the great escapeWe won't hear a word they sayThey don't know us anywayWatch it burnLet it die'Cause we are finally free tonightAll of the wasted timeThe hours that were left behindThe answers that we'll never findThey don't mean a thing tonightThrow it awayForget yesterdayWe'll make the great escapeWe won't hear a word they sayThey don't know us anywayThrow it awayForget yesterdayWe'll make the great escapeWe won't hear a word they sayThey don't know us anywayThrow it awayForget yesterdayWe'll make the great escapeWe won't hear a word they sayThey don't know us anywayWatch it burnLet it die'Cause we are finally free tonight
