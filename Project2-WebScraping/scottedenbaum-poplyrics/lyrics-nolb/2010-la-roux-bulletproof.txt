Been there, done that, messed aroundI'm having fun; don't put me downI'll never let you sweep me off my feetI won't let you in againThe messages I've tried to sendMy information's just not going inBurning bridges shore to shoreI'll break away from something moreI'm not turned on to love until it's cheapBeen there, done that, messed aroundI'm having fun; don't put me downI'll never let you sweep me off my feet[Chorus]This time, baby, I'll beBulletproofThis time, baby, I'll beBulletproofI won't let you turn aroundAnd tell me now I'm much too proudTo walk away from something when it's deadDo, do, do your dirty wordsCome out to play when you are heardThere's certain things that should be left unsaidTick, tick, tick, tick on the watchAnd life's too short for me to stopOh, baby, your time is running outI won't let you turn aroundAnd tell me now I'm much too proudAll you do is fill me up with doubt[Chorus: x2]This time babyI'll beBulletproofThis time babyI'll beBulletproof[Chorus: x2]
