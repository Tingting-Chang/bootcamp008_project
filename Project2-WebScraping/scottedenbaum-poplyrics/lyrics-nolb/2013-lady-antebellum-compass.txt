Yea it's been a bumpy roadRoller coasters high and lowFill the tank and drive the carPedal fast, pedal hardYou won't have to go that farYou want to give up cause it's darkWe're really not that far apartSo let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lostAnd you should follow it wherever it may goWhen it's all said and done you can walk instead of run'Cause no matter what you'll never be aloneNever be aloneNever be aloneForgot directions on your wayDon't close your eyes don't be afraidWe might be crazy late at nightI can't wait til you arriveFollow stars you'll be alrightYou want to give up cause it's darkWe're really not that far apartSo let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lostAnd you should follow it wherever it may goWhen it's all said and done you can walk instead of run'Cause no matter what you'll never be aloneNever be aloneNever be aloneYou want to give up cause it's darkWe're really not that far apartSo let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lostAnd you should follow it wherever it may goWhen it's all said and done you can walk instead of run'Cause no matter what you'll never be aloneNever be aloneNever be aloneWhen it's all said and done you can walk instead of run'Cause no matter what you'll never be alone
