I long for, the warmth of, days gone byWhen you were mineBut now those days are memories in timeLife's empty, without youBy my sideMy heart belongs to youNo matter what I tryWhen I get the courage to know somebody newIt always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to youYou're the one that makes me bow under ball and chainReminisce, think aboutAs I watch 4 seasons to changeHere comes the winter breezeThat chills the air and hits the snowAnd I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe (as springtime)As springtime makes it's way here, lilac blooms remind me ofThe scent of your perfumeReminisce inside of love,On summer nights, indeedI always get the hots for you (ooh)Go skinny dipping in the ocean where we used to doNo no chance the leaves of trees are bare, when you're not hereIt doesn't feel the sameIt doesn't feel the sameOhRememberThe nights when (remember the night)When we closed our eyes (when we closed our eyes)And vowed that you and I would be in love for all timeEvery time I think about these things I shared(Think about these things I shared)I'm not gonna cry, 'cause I get so emotional (I get so emotional)Underneath it makes me think I'm under ball and chainReminisce in our loveAs I watch 4 seasons changeHere comes the winter breeze thatThat chills the air and hits the snowAnd I imagine kissing you under the mistletoeThe springtime makes it's way here lilac blooms reminds me ofThe scent of your perfume (Ooh)On summer nights, indeedI always get the hots for youGo skinny dipping in the ocean where we used to doNo no chance the leaves of trees are bare when you're not hereIt doesn't feel the sameThis loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me baby)Please let me love again (just one more thing)Cause I'm devoted girl find me and ease my painBut 4 seasons will bringThe loneliness againHere comes the winter breeze thatChills the air and hits the snowAnd I imagine kissing you under the mistletoeWhen springtime makes it way here,Lilac blooms reminds me ofThe scent of your perfume (Summer nights)On summer nights, indeedI always get the hots for youGo skinny dipping in the ocean where we used to do(Go skinny dipping oh,oh)No no chance the leaves of trees are bare when you're not hereIt doesn't feel the sameRemember,The warmth of,Days gone by.
