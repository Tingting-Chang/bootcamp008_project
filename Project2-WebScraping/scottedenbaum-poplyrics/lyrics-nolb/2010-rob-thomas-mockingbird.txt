Here we standSomewhere in between this moment and the endWill we bend?Or will we open up and take this whole thing in?Everybody else is smiling and their smiles don't fadeAnd you don't even wonder why you just don't think that wayMaybe you and me got lost somewhere,We can't move or we can't stay hereWell maybe we've just had enough,Well maybe we ain't meant for this loveYou and me tried everythingBut still that mocking bird wont singWell man this life seems hard enoughWell maybe we ain't meant for this loveTake my handAnd I will lead you through the broken promise landYes I can, ah yes I canI can be there when you need it,I'll give it all till you can't feel it anymoreI don't wanna love you now,If you'll just leave somedayI don't wanna turn around,If you'll just walk awayMaybe you and me got lost somewhere,We can't move or we can't stay hereWell maybe we've just had enough,Well maybe we ain't meant for this loveYou and me tried everythingBut still that mocking bird wont singWell man this life seems hard enoughWell maybe we ain't meant for this loveMaybe you and me got lost somewhere,We can't move or we can't stay hereWell maybe we've just had enough,Well maybe we ain't meant for this loveYou and me tried everythingBut still that mocking bird wont singWell man this life seems hard enoughWell maybe we ain't meant for this loveMaybe we ain't meant for this loveMaybe we ain't meant for this love
