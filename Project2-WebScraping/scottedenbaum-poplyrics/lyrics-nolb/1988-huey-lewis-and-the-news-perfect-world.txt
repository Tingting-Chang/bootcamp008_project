If there was no tomorrowThen tonight would never endIf we could freezeThe hands of timeI would stay here in your armsAnd not go back againCause all I wantIs for you to hold me nowAnd we can make itThrough this night togetherAll I needIs for you to show me howCause nothing can stop thisFeeling of foreverI've never felt this close to loveLyin' here face to faceFar beneath the silver skiesThere's no one aroundTo chase this night awayCause all I wantIs for you to hold me nowAnd we can make itThrough this night togetherAll I needIs for you to show me howCause nothing can stop thisFeeling of foreverThe world is ours tonightAs long as we just believeThe feelings that we hold insideAre in every heart that beatsCause all I wantIs for you to hold me nowAnd we can make itThrough this night togetherAll I needIs for you to show me howCause nothing can stop thisFeeling of forever
