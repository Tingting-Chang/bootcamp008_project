One night not long agoI fell for youToo easy to let goShe was one from your pastOne of the fewYou said it didn't lastNow Romeo you know I can't believeYour tongue would slip so easilyI know you think I oughta let it beBut get it right, next timeThat's the end of me[Chorus]My name is not SusanSo watch what you sayIf you still need herThen be on your wayDon't want to hear about SusanShe's got nothin' on meSo show some respect for the love you receiveMy name is not Susan(No, no, no, no, no, get it right)Last night you were asleepDeep in a dreamI heard you call her nameThen you turned to embraceI froze in placeNever to be the sameNow Romeo you know I never knewMy heart would bust so easilyI know you think I oughta let it goBut get it right next timeSay good-bye to me boy[Chorus]I never want to be the girly that you "call" one and onlyYou know the kind of girly that you would call when you get lonelyI never should have let you in,A damn shame, forgot my name!Well, anyway[Chorus]Don't want to hear about SusanMy name ain't SusanMy name ain't SusanMy name ain't SusanYa better get it right!
