All he could think about was I'm to young for thisGot my whole life aheadHell I'm just a kid myselfHow'm I gonna raise oneAll he could see were his dreams going up in smokeSo much for ditching this town and hanging out on the coastOh well, those plans are long goneAnd he saidThere goes my lifeThere goes my future, my everythingMight as well kiss it all good-byeThere goes my lifeA couple years of up all night and a few thousand diapers laterThat mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigeratorOh yeah...he loves that little girl.Momma's waiting to tuck her inAs she stumbles up those stairsShe smiles back at him dragging that teddy bearSleep tight, blue eyes and bouncing curlsHe smilesThere goes my lifeThere goes my future my everythingI love you, daddy goodnightThere goes my lifeShe had that Honda loaded downWith Abercrombie clothes and fifteen pairs of shoes and his American expressHe checked the oil and slammed the hood, said your good to goShe hugged them both and headed off to the west coastHe criedThere goes my lifeThere goes my future, my everythingI love youBaby good-byeThere goes my lifeThere goes my life
