Every night in my dreamsI see you, I feel youThat is how I know you, go onFar across the distanceAnd spaces between usYou have come to show you, go onNear, far, wherever you areI believe that the heart does go onOnce more you open the doorAnd you're here in my heart and my heart will go on and onLove can touch us one timeAnd last for a lifetimeAnd never let go till we're goneLove was when I loved youOne true time I hold youIn my life we'll always go onNear, far, wherever you areI believe that the heart does go onOnce more you open the doorAnd you're here in my heartAnd my heart will go on and onYou're here, there's nothing I fearAnd I know that my heart will go onWe'll stay forever this wayYou are safe in my heart and my heart will go on and on
