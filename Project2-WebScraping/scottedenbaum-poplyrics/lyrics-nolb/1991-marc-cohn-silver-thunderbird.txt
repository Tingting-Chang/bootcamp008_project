Watched it coming up WinslowDown South Park BoulevardYeah it was looking good from tail to hoodGreat big fins and painted steelMan it looked just like the BatmobileWith my old man behind the wheelWell you could hardly even see himIn all of that chromeThe man with the plan and the pocket combBut every night it carried him homeAnd I could hear him sayin'...Don't gimme no BuickSon you must take my wordIf there's a God in heavenHe's got a Silver ThunderbirdYou can keep your EldoradosAnd the foreign car's absurdMe I want to go downIn a Silver ThunderbirdHe got up every morningWhile i was still asleepBut I remember the sound of him shuffling aroundThen right before the crack of dawnI heard him turn the motor onBut when I got up they were goneDown the road in the rain and snowThe man and his machine would goOh the secrets that old car would knowSometimes I hear him sayin'...
