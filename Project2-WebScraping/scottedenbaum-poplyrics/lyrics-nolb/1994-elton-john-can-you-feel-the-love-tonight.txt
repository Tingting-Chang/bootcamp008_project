There's a calm surrender to the rush of dayWhen the heat of a rolling world can be turned awayAn enchanted moment, and it sees me throughIt's enough for this restless warrior just to be with youAnd can you feel the love tonightIt is where we areIt's enough for this wide eyed wandererThat we got this farAnd can you feel the love tonightHow it's laid to restIt's enough to make kings and vagabondsBelieve the very bestThere's a time for everyone if they only learnThat the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turnThere's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoorsWhen the heart of this star crossed voyager beats in time with yoursAnd can you feel the love tonightIt is where we areIt's enough for this wide eyed wandererThat we got this farAnd can you feel the love tonightHow it's laid to restIt's enough to make kings and vagabondsBelieve the very bestIt's enough to make kings and vagabondsBelieve the very best
