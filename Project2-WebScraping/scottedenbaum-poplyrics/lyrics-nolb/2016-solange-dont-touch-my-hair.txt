Don't touch my hairWhen it's the feelings I wearDon't touch my soulWhen it's the rhythm I knowDon't touch my crownThey say the vision I've foundDon't touch what's thereWhen it's the feelings I wearThey don't understandWhat it means to meWhere we chose to goWhere we've been to knowThey don't understandWhat it means to meWhere we chose to goWhere we've been to knowYou know this hair is my shitRode the ride, I gave it timeBut this here is mineYou know this hair is my shitRode the ride, I gave it timeBut this here is mineWhat you say, oh?What you say to me?Don't touch my prideThey say the glory's all mineDon't test my mouthThey say the truth is my soundThey don't understandWhat it means to meWhere we chose to goWhere we've been to knowThey don't understandWhat it means to meWhere we chose to goWhere we've been to knowYou know this hair is my shitRode the ride, I gave it timeBut this here is mineYou know this hair is my shitRode the ride, I gave it timeBut this here is mineWhat you say, oh?What you say to me?
