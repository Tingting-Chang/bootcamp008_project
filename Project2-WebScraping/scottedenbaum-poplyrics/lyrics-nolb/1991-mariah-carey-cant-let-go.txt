There you are holding her handI am lostDying to understandDidn't I cherish you rightDon't you know you were my lifeEven though I try I can't let goSomething in your eyesCaptured my soulAnd every night I see you in my dreamsYou're all I knowI can't let goJust cast asideYou don't even know I'm aliveYou just walk on byDon't care to see me cryAnd here I amStill holding onI can't acceptMy world is gone, no noEven though I try I can't let goSomething in your eyesCaptured my soulAnd every night I see you in my dreamsYou're all I knowI can't let goDo you even realize the sorrow I have insideEveryday of my lifeDo you know the way it feelsWhen all you have just diesI try and try to deny that I need youBut still you remain on my mindNo I just can't get you out of my mindI never can say goodbye'Cause every nightI see you in my dreamsYou're all I knowI can't let you goEven though I tryI can't let goSomething in your eyesCaptured my soulAnd every night I see you in my dreamsYou're all I knowI can't let go
