I don't know whyI just know I doI just can't explainIn this language that I useSomething leaves me speechlessEach time that you approachEach time you glide right through meAs if I was a ghostIf I only could tell youIf you only would listenI've got a line or two to use on youI've got a romance we could christenAnd there's a word in Spanish I don't understandBut I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading manHe said it with devotion, he sounded so sincereAnd the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tearsA word in Spanish, a word in SpanishIf you can't comprehendRead it in my eyesIf you don't understand it's loveIn a thin disguiseAnd what it takes to move youEach time that you resistIs more than just a pretty faceTo prove that I exist
