Hello again, it's you and meKinda always like it used to beSippin' wine, killing timeTrying to solve life's mysteriesHow's your life, it's been a while?God it's good to see you smileI see you reaching for your keysLooking for a reason not to leaveIf you don't know if you should stayIf you don't say what's on your mindBaby just breatheThere's nowhere else tonight we should beYou wanna make a memoryI dug up this old photographLook at all that hair we hadIt's bitter sweet to hear you laughYour phone is ringin' I don't wanna askIf you go now I'll understandIf you stay, hey, I've gotta planYou wanna make a memory?You wanna steal a piece of time?You can sing the melody to meAnd I can write a couple linesYou wanna make a memoryIf you don't know if you should stayAnd you don't say what's on your mindBaby just breatheThere's nowhere else tonight we should be (We should be)(We should be)You wanna make a memory?You wanna steal a piece of time?You can sing the melody to meAnd I can write a couple linesYou wanna make a memoryYou wanna make a memory
