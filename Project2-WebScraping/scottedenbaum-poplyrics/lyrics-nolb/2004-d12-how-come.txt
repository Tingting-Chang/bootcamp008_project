So I changed huh?You got a phonePick it upCall me[Chorus]How come, we don't even talk no moreAnd you don't even call no moreWe don't barely keep in touch at allAnd I don't even feel the same love when we hug no moreAnd I heard it through the grapevineWe been beefin nowAfter all the year we been downAin't no way no howThis bullshit can't be trueWe familyAin't a damn thing changedUnless its you!We were so youngSo full of life and vibranceSide by side, wherever you was riding, I wentSo close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shitWhen Ronnie died you was right by my sideWith a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyesAnd a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it.You even had the same type of childhood I didSometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succumb to yoursAnd mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed itWe grew up, grew apart as time went by usAnd I blew up to both yours and mines surprises.Now I feel a vibe I just can't describe itMuch as your pride tries to hide it. your coldYour touch is just like ice.And your eyes is a look of resentment..I can sense it and I don't like it.[Chorus]It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verseOn my own album with a deal but shit got worseFore I came out I would of killed a nigga firstFor I let him disrespect me, or check me over someWorthless bitch that I wasn't withI would of hit it and quitBut you were fitting to talk with her and tell her she was the shitI told you don't get involved with herYou would smoke in the car with herComing outta the bar with herStumbling half drunkLike you were husband and wife or somethingBut me catching her fucking other niggas must of hurt your pride or somethingCause you were opening your mouth to people like you wanted with me.When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty.And every sister, fares and all the shit that I producedYou acting like I ain't your man and lying like she can't be loose.But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth.Don't hate the game or the playerThe one that's changing is you.[Chorus]Its gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stopNow we acting like I gotta live only for the block.And homies in the hood only see me on the tubeSo they gossip on the porchGet ta speaking all rude. fools I used to rap wit all expect magicLike my finger get to snappingAnd poof it just happen.But proof is just acting out the part he was thrown,Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home.See the devil in your glance,Since the ghetto we been friends, forever real intelligence,That's forever till the end.I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies,Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise.(How come) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?(And how come) It's my fault for what you did with your life?And every time I go to hear you play, you look away,We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face.[Chorus]
