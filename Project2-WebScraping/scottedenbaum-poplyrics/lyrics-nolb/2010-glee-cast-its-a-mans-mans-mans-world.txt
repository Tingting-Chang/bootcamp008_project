This is a man's world,This is a man's worldBut it wouldn't be nothing,Nothing without a woman or a girlYou see, man made the cars to take us over the roadMan made the trains to carry heavy loadsMan made electric light to take us out of the darkMan made the boat for the water, like Noah made the arkThis is a man's, a man's, a man's worldBut it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girlMan thinks about a little baby girls and a baby boysMan makes them happy 'cause man makes them toysAnd after man has made everything, everything he canDo you know that man makes money to buy from other man?This is a man's worldBut it wouldn't be nothing,Nothing without a woman or a girlHe's lost in the wildernessHe's lost in bitternessHe's lost, lost somewhere in this, in loneliness
