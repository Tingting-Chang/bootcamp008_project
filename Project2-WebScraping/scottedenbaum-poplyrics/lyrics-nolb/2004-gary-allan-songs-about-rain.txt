Well this town has closed down way too earlyAnd there's nothin' to doSo I'm drivin' around in circles and I'm thinkin' about youToday I heard you got a new last name,Sure didn't know it was gonna hit me this wayAnd the radio just keeps playin' all this songs about rain(Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain)Now there's all kinda songs about babies and love that goes right,But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight,Hey I hope it's sunny wherever you are,But that's sure not the picture tonight in my car,And it sure ain't easin' my pain all these songs likeRainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain,Here comes that rainy day feelin' again,Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain,They go on and on and there's no two the same,Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rainWell I thought I was over youBut I guess maybe I'm not,'Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got,Guess I'll never know what could have been,Sure ain't helpin' this mood that I'm in,If they're gonna keep on playin' these songs likeRainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain,Here comes that rainy day feelin' again,Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain,They go on and on,There's no two the same,Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rainRainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain,Here comes that rainy day feelin' again,Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain,They go on and on,There's no two the sameRainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain,Here comes that rainy day feelin' again,Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain,They go on and on,There's no two the same
