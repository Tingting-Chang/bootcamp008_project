Show me your companyCome and tell me who you beI'll try and take things easyI'll be loose I'll be carefreeI'm living for tomorrow not todayGotta make my plans so in caseI'll be prepared when I see you you smiling(Chorus) 'Cause I feel so when I'm reaching out for your skyI've boundless energy. I fell I could run a million milesI'm riding on the wheel of fortune taking me to places far and freeI feel so high when I approach your skyWhen I touch your sky, I want my joy to be discreetCan't seem to to hide the feeling that you knock me from my seatWhen I'm talking with my friends, you're the subject every timeI know I bore them but they do it to me sometimesI've seen you exposed your thoughts are nudeCome on take off your pride babyYou should wash your attitudeI'm sitting here watching you babyTrying to pretend your cool and calmCome on now you can tell me babyDid the gypsy read your palm(Chorus)I feel so high, when I'm touching your sky babyI feel so highI feel so high, when I'm touching your sky babyI feel so high yeah, yeahI feel so high, when I'm touching your sky babyI feel so high
