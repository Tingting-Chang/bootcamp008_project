I didn't have to turn my head whenever you walked inThe only one to let these chills roll down my skinMy heart beats faster, I hear your nameI feel my confidence slippin' awayChorus:Thought I was doin' fine'Bout to get you off my mineI see your face and then I'mWrapped around your pretty little finger againIt feels like ages since you laid down in my armsI see no good reason but still I'm tangled in your charmsMy God, you're smilin' and you catch my eyeMy heart is pounding deep insideRepeat ChorusAin't gonna let no man go down without a fight'Cause my stalls and walls look better in the bright day lightMy heart beats faster, I call your nameI feel my confidence slippin' awayRepeat Chorus x2Your pretty little fingerBaby, I'm wrapped around your pretty little finger againpretty little finger
