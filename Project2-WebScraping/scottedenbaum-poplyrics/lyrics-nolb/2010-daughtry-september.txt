How the time passed away, all the trouble that we gaveAnd all those days we spent out by the lakeHas it all gone to waste? All the promises we madeOne by one they vanish just the sameOf all the things I still rememberSummer's never looked the sameThe years go by and time just seems to flyBut the memories remainIn the middle of September we'd still play out in the rainNothing to lose but everything to gainReflecting now on how things could've beenIt was worth it in the endNow it all seems so clear, there's nothing left to fearSo we made our way by finding what was realNow the days are so long that summer's moving onWe reach for something that's already gone, yeahOf all the things I still rememberSummer's never looked the sameThe years go by and time just seems to flyBut the memories remainIn the middle of September we'd still play out in the rainNothing to lose but everything to gainReflecting now on how things could've beenIt was worth it in the endYeah, we knew we had to leave this town (we knew we had to leave this town)But we never knew when and we never knew how (we never knew how)We would end up here the way we areYeah, we knew we had to leave this town (we knew we had to leave this town)But we never knew when and we never knew how (we never knew how)Of all the things I still rememberSummer's never looked the sameThe years go by and time just seems to flyBut the memories remainIn the middle of September we'd still play out in the rainNothing to lose but everything to gainReflecting now on how things could've beenIt was worth it in the end
