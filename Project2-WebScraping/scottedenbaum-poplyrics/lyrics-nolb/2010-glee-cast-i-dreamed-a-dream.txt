I dreamed a dream in time gone byWhen hope was high and life worth livingI dreamed that love would never dieI dreamed that God would be forgivingThen I was young and unafraidAnd dreams were made and used and wastedThere was no ransom to be paidNo song unsung no wine untastedBut the tigers come at night(But the tigers come at night)With their voices soft as thunderAs they tear your hope apart(As they tear your hope apart)As they turn your dream to shameAnd still I dreamed that she'll come to meThat we will live the years togetherBut there are dreams that cannot beAnd there are storms we cannot weather
