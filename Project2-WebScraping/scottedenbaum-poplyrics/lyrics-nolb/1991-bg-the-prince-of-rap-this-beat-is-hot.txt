Here's another morning without youHere's another day; will I get through itWithout breaking down?Haven't seen the sun since you've been goneLike my heart, I lost it when you left meAnd it can't be foundHow can I go on?Baby, I'd be living on memoriesOf you and meAll the love we madeAll those tender nightsAnd those endless daysThey're all here insideBaby, can you stop the rain from falling?Won't you chase my clouds away?I'd give anything to see the sun againOnly you can stop these tears from fallingI can't face another dayBaby, can you stopCan you stop the rain?Ev'rywhere I go, I feel you thereFollowing my footsteps like a shadowOf my broken heartSometimes, it's a pair of passing eyesOr it's just the way someone is talkingAnd there you areAm I all alone?Don't you ever wake upAnd reach for meWhere I used to be?Is there any chance?I just can't believeYou're not lonely, tooJust for me and youBaby, can you stop the rain from falling?Won't you chase my clouds away?I'd give anything to see the sun againOnly you can stop these tears from fallingI can't face another dayBaby, can you stopCan you stop the rain?If you were here for only one nightBaby, I know you'd remember'Cause loving you once wasn't time enoughI know we can make it togetherTogetherBaby, stop the rainWon't you chase my clouds away?I'd give anything to see the sun againOnly you can stop these tears of mine from fallingI can't face another dayBaby, can you stopCan you, can you stop the rain?How can I live without you, baby?How could I let you go?
