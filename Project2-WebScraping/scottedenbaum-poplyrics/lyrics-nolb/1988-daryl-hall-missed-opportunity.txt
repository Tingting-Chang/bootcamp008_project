I was in love the moment thatI saw youI followed you through the crowd and I almost lost youI was dying to tell you but scared of your reactionBut I can't hold back because I'm rushedWith this thing called passion[Chorus:]You've got me knocked out turn me inside outIt's you that makes my heart beatYou've got me knocked outBaby there's no doubtYou swept me off my feetI walked your way hoping thatMaybe you noticedI don't want to move so fastI don't want to blow itNever did I think love could be so amazingBut the things that you're making me doIt's driving me crazy[Chorus: x2]I want us to be closer, boy I want to beStartin' something with you babyMy heart is steady knocking boy you've got my body rocking,Caught blow-by-blow, love T.K.O.[Chorus: x2]
