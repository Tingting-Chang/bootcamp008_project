Baby you're missing something in the airI got a name but it don't matterWhat's going on, it's cold in hereYou have a life but it's torn and tatteredMaybe you're losing pieces of your heartYou have a world but it stopped turningYou lose the day and gain the darkLove was a fire but it stopped burningSpare your heart, save your soulDon't drag your love across the coalsFind your feet and your fortune can be toldRelease, relax, let goAnd hey now let's recover your soulLazy old sunset sinking like a tearAlone at night in a losing battleThat perfect world is never clearYou have to fight for the things that matter
