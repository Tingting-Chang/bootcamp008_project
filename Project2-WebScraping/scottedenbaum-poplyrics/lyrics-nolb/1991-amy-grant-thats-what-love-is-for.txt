Sometimes we make it harder than it isWe'll take a perfect nightAnd fill it up with words we don't meanDark sides best unseenAnd we wonder why we're feeling this way.Sometimes i wonder if we really feel the sameWhy we can be unkindQuestioning the strongest of heartsThat's when we must startBelieving in the one thing that has gotten us this far.That's what love is forTo help us through itThat's what love if forNothing else can do it.Melt our defensesBring us back to our sensesGive us strength to try once moreBaby, that's what love is for.Sometimes i see youAnd you don't know i am thereAnd i'm washed away by emotionsI hold deep down insideGetting stronger with timeIt's living through the fireAnd holding on we findThat's what love is forTo help us through itThat's what love if forNothing else can do it.Melt our defensesBring us back to our sensesGive us strength to try once moreBaby, that's what love is for.Believing in the one thingThat has gotten us this farThat's what love is forTo help us through itThat's what love if forNothing else can do it.Round off the edgesTalk us down from the ledgesGive us strength to try once moreBaby, that's what love is forThat's what love if for.That's what love if forMelt our defensesBring us back to our sensesGive us strength to try once moreBaby, that's what love is for.That's what love if for.That's what love if for.That's what love if for.
