Inflatable pool full of dad's hot airI was three years oldSplashin' everywhereAnd so began my love affairWith waterOn a river bankWith all my friendsA big old rope tied to a limbAnd your a big old wussIf you don't jump inThe waterYeah when that summer sun starts to beatin' downAnd you don't know what to doGrab your swimming trunksIce up that old IglooDrive until the map turns blueDaytona Beach on spring breakEighteen girls up on stageWhite t-shirts about to be sprayedWith waterOh let'er go boysYeah when that summer sun starts to beatin' downAnd you don't know what to doJust go and grab someone you wanna see in a bathing suitAnd drive until the map turns blueYou can stay right thereWhen the daylight's gonePlay truth or dareAnd it won't take long'Fore you and her got nothin' onBut waterAll you really need this time of yearIs a pair of shadesAnd ice cold beerAnd a place to sit somewhere nearWater
