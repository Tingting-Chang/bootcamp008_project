It doesn't mean muchIt doesn't mean anything at allThe life I've left behind meIs a cold roomI've crossed the last lineFrom where I can't returnWhere every step I took in faithBetrayed meAnd led me from my homeSweet surrenderIs all that I have to giveYou take me inNo questions askedYou strip away the uglinessThat surrounds meAre you an angelAm I already that goneI only hopeThat I won't disappoint youWhen I'm down hereOn my kneesSweet surrenderIs all that I have to giveSweet surrenderIs all that I have to giveAnd I don't understandBy the touch of your handI would be the one to fallI miss the little thingsI miss everything, about youIt doesn't mean muchIt doesn't mean anything at allThe life I've left behind meIs a cold roomSweet surrenderIs all that I have to giveSweet surrenderIs all that I have to give
