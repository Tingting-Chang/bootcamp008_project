Here is a song from the wrong side of townWhere I'm bound to the ground by the loneliest soundAnd it pounds from within and is pinning me downHere is a page from the emptiest stageA cage or the heaviest cross ever madeA gauge of the deadliest trap ever laidAnd I thank you for bringing me hereFor showing me homeFor singing these tearsFinally I've found that I belong hereThe heat and the sickliest sweet smelling sheetsThat cling to the backs of my knees and my feetWell I'm drowning in time to a desperate beatAnd I thank you for bringing me hereFor showing me homeFor singing these tearsFinally I've found that I belongFeels like homeI should have knownFrom my first breathGod send the only true friend I call minePretend that I'll make amends the next timeBefriend the glorious end of the lineAnd I thank you for bringing me hereFor showing me homeFor singing these tearsFinally I've found that I belong here
