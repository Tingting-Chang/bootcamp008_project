Where did we go wrongWhere did we lose our faithMy brother is in needBut can he depend on meDo you think if one of you triedMaybe you could findA better friend than any otherIf you gave more than you tookLife could be so goodCome on and tryNow's the time[Chorus]'Cause you're freeTo do what you want to doYou've got to live your lifeDo what you want to doDo what you wantDo what you want to doAre we all strangersDoes anyone really careDeep down we're all the sameTrying to hide our painYou think you can never trust another'Cause they're all out to get yaWe have to live in this world togetherIf we open up our heartsLove can finally startCome on and tryNow's the time[Chorus]Bridge when you're down and you'reFeeling badEverybody has left you sadFeels like no one will pull you throughIt's your life whatcha gonna doMake that change let's start todayGet outta bed get on your wayDon't be scared your dream's right thereYou want it reach for it[Chorus]Do what you wantDo what you want to do
