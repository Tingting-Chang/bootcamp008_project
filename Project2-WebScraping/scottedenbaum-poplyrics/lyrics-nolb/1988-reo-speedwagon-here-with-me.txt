Maybe it's too lateBut this feelin' is runnin' through my soulI think I learned what love is, but I'm afraid I let it goMaybe it's too lateMaybe you've already changed your mindTurned lovin' into leavin'And I'm on the outsideYou can take these words to bed with youAnd hold on to them at nightThey can erase the emptinessAnd make everything alrightBut your laughter and your tendernessWill never disappearNo matter where you are tonightA part of you is here with meHere with meI don't know where you areAll I know is I need you to beHere with meI know it's not too lateto turn around and get it straightIt's my fate to have you here with meI can hear your voicePromising your love will never dieI can feel your golden skin on mineBeneath the desert skySo how can it be trueHow can you just turn and let me goLet the story of your life with mineForever go untoldI can take these words to bed with meAnd hold on to them at nightThey can erase the emptinessAnd make everything alrightCause your laughter and your tendernessWill never disappearNo matter where you are tonightA part of you is here with me[Chorus][Repeat Chorus]Here with me (are you here with me)I don't know where you are (don't know where)All I know is, I need you to be, ohohwhoaHere with meI know it's not too late (know it's not too late)To turn around and get it straightHere with me...
