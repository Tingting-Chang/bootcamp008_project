I stepped out into the blue, felt the wind hit my faceBefore my chute opened, I felt my heart raceI was fallin'Nope, that's just fallin'And off the coast of Australia I dove way down deepFor all that I saw of that Great Barrier ReefIt was nothin'; compared to you it was nothin'[Chorus]I got lightning in my veins and thunder in my chestAll tangled up with you and tryin' to catch my breathBeen chasing that sensation halfway 'round the worldAnd lookin' back on what we hadWell, I've done it all, and I've seen it allBut I can't find a feelin' like thatWell, I've wound up in some town in Spain runnin' with the bullsTryin' to catch another thrill with a thousand other foolsWe were runnin', aw, but that's just runnin'When I started pushin' thirty, it started pushin' backWell, how was I to know till now you'd be such a hard act to follow?Nothin' seems to follow[Chorus]It's like flyin' down some back road at midnightWith your eyes closed and the headlights offGirl, I've been searchin' everywhereCan't find that feelin' anywhereYou're all I want now, all I wantIt's that lightning in my veins and thunder in my chestAll tangled up with you and tryin' to catch my breathI been chasing that sensation halfway round the worldAnd lookin' back on what we hadWell, I've done it all and I've seen it allBut I can't find a feelin' like thatThat's right, I've done it all, and I've seen it allBut I can't find a feelin' like that
