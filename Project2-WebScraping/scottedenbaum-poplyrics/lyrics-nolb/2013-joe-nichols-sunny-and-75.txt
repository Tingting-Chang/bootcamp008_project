A yellow two piece, black Ray BansYour bare feet, covered in sandWhite jet trails across the blue skyYour pony tail showing off the sunshineLike a á¹—ost card, out of no whereYou get to me, you give me that smile andI'm somewhere, somewhere sunny and 75You and me on a beach chairYeah I'm so there every time I look in your eyesKissing you and the salt airI can taste it, I swearTake me somewhere, sunny and 75It doesn't take much for you to move meJust the way you're leaning in to meIt's a holiday when we're togetherI wanna stay with you foreverSomewhere, somewhere sunny and 75You and me on a beach chairYeah I'm so there every time I look in your eyesKissing you and the salt airI can taste it, I swearTake me somewhere, sunny and 75You're like the fast lane West boundYou feel like the window's rolled downI can't wait until we get there, somewhereSomewhere, sunny and 75You and me on a beach chairYeah I'm so there every time I look in your eyesKissing you and the salt airI can taste it, I swearTake me somewhere, sunny and 75Sunny and 75
