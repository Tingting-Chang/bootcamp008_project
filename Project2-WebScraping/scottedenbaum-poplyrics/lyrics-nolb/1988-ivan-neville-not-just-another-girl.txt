Every night that I held youMade heaven from hell, yeaI did it for loveLike the change of the seasonYou grew cold for that reasonI did it for loveAnd when it all went wrongAnd there's no use hanging onI turned and walked awayChorus:I did it, I did it, I did it for loveNow you want to knowWhy I let you goI did it for loveWell, I thought that I was toughWell, I guess I'm not tough enoughI didn't do it for the gloryI did it for loveWhen you were lost in the nightAnd you feared for your lifeI came running to youAnd as I held you so tightYou said forever you and IBut girl, I knewAnd now you stand and you sayHow could I walk awayI love you too much to stay(chorus)Oh, I remember how it startedAnd we felt so aliveAnd the passion was burning insideThere's a lesson in loveWhen the heart grows wildWell, I thought that I was toughWell, I guess I ain't tough enoughI did it for loveOh, OhI did it, I did it, I did it for loveNow you want to knowWhy I let you goI did it for love
