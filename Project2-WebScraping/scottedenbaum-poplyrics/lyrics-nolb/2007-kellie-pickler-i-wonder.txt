Sometimes I think about youWonder if you're out there somewhere thinkin' 'bout meAnd would you even recognizeThe woman that your little girl has grown up to beCause I look in the mirror and all I seeAre your brown eyes lookin' back at meThey're the only thing you ever gave to me at allOh, I hear the weather's nice in CaliforniaThere's sunny sky as far as I can seeIf you ever come back home to CarolinaI wonder what you'd say to meI think about how it ain't fairThat you weren't there to braid my hair like mothers doYou weren't around to cheer me onHelp me dress for my high school prom like mothers doDid you think I didn't need you here to hold my hand, to dry my tears?Did you even miss me through the years at all?Oh, I hear the weather's nice in CaliforniaThere's sunny sky as far as I can seeIf you ever come back home to CarolinaI wonder what you'd say to meForgiveness is such a simple wordBut it's so hard to doWhen you've been hurtOh, I hear the weather's nice in CaliforniaAnd just in case you're wonderin' about meFrom now on I won't be in CarolinaYour little girl is offYour little girl is offYour little girl is off to Tennessee
