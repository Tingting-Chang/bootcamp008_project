When the rain is blowing in your faceAnd the whole world is on your caseI could offer you a warm embraceTo make you feel my loveWhen the evening shadows and the stars appearand there is no one there to dry your tearsI could hold you for a million yearsTo make you feel my loveI know, you haven't made your mind up yetBut I would never do you wrongI've known it from the moment that we metNo doubt in my mind where you belongI'd go hungryI'd go black and blueI'd go crawling down the avenueNo, there's nothing that I wouldn't doTo make you feel my loveThe storms are raging on the rolling seaAnd on the highway of regretThe winds of change are blowing wild and freeYou ain't seen nothing like me yetI could make you happyMake your dreams come trueNothing that I wouldn't doGo to the ends of the earth for youTo make you feel my loveTo make you feel my love
