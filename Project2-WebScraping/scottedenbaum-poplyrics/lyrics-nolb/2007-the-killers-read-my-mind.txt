On the corner of main streetJust tryin' to keep it in lineYou say you wanna move on, andYou say I'm falling behindCan you read my mind?Can you read my mind?I never really gave up onBreakin' out of this two-star townI got the green lightI got a little fightI'm gonna turn this thing aroundCan you read my mind?Can you read my mind?The good old days, the honest manThe restless heart, the Promised LandA subtle kiss that no one seesA broken wrist and a big trapezeOh well, I don't mind, you don't mindCause I don't shine if you don't shineBefore you go, can you read my mind?It's funny how you just break downWaiting on some signI pull up to the front of your drivewayWith magic soaking my spineCan you read my mind?Can you read my mind?The teenage queen, the loaded gunThe drop dead dream, the Chosen OneA southern drawl, the world unseenA city wall and a trampolineOh well, I don't mind, you don't mind'Cause I don't shine if you don't shineBefore you jumpTell me what you findWhen you read my mindSlipping in my faith until I fallHe never returned that callWoman, open the door, don't let it stingI wanna breathe that fire againShe said, I don't mind, you don't mindCause I don't shine if you don't shinePut your back on mePut your back on mePut your back on meThe stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sunWhen you read my mind
