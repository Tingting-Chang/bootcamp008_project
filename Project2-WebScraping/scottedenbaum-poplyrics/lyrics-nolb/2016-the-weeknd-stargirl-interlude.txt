I had a visionA vision of my nails in the kitchenScratching counter tops, I was screamingMy back arched like a cat, my position couldn't stop you were hitting itAnd I shouldn't cry, but I love it, StarboyAnd I shouldn't cry, but I love it, (I love it), StarboyAnd I shouldn't cry, but I love it, StarboyAnd I shouldn't cry, but I love it, StarboyI just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a Stargirl
