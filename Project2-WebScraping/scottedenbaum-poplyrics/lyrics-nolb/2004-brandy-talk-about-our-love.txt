What ya hear this timeGo on and speak ya mindI know somebody's lyingIt's always somethingHer auntie told your cousinThen all your homies jumped inAnd now the whole hoods buzzingHe said, she saidDon't let it get in ya headBaby don't saySomething that you will regretI'm on your teamIt's us against them you'll seeHey, we ain't gon stopThey just want what we got[Chorus]The more they talk about our loveThe more they make it obviousThe more they seem so enviousHow can they talk about our loveWhen they don't know one thing aboutInstead they just running they mouthSo all we do is tune them outI swear they got some nerveSpreadin what they heardI cant give them no runI can't be concerned with all that talkI won't be involvedThat's my wordSee I'm not the oneThey got me confusedThey got me messed upDon't you think I've had enoughWhen it comes to what we doAll that matters is us twoDon't pay them no mindWe just goin' show and prove[Chorus][Kanye West]Here's a couple of things I can't honor manHow you listen to a girl who still wanna manTell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna ManI'm wondering why she red to go like Wanda VanWhen we met you was a V like manana manNow you went field running plays like DonovanKnick nav before you get in a cabI trade in my cabJust to take you back to last summer manYou don't remember when you was my sweetestYou don't remember I called you Reece's PiecesCause it's no wrong way to do you know whatShe turned around giggle said you so nutsBut nowadays we acting way too grown upBut how ya ex girl get that new numberThe rumors was so numerousFor sticking by me I had to give you two thumbs upAnd that's why[Chorus: x2]
