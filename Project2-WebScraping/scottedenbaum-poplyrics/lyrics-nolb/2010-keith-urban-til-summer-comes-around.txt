Another long summer's come and goneI don't know why it always ends this wayThe boardwalk's quiet and the carnival ridesAre as empty as my broken heart tonightBut I close my eyes and one more timeWe're spinning around and you're holding on tightlyThe words came out, I kissed your mouthNo Fourth of July has ever burned so brightlyYou had to go, I understandBut you promised you'd be back againAnd so I wander 'round this town'Til summer comes aroundI got a job working at the old park pierAnd every summer now for five long yearsI grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracksAnd I count the days til you just might come backAnd then I close my eyes and one more timeWe're spinning around and you're holding on tightlyThe words came out, I kissed your mouthNo Fourth of July has ever burned so brightlyYou had to go, I understandBut you swore you'd be back againAnd so I'm frozen in this town'Til summer comes aroundAnd it comes around
