She's gotta do what she's gotta doAnd I've gotta like it or notShe's got dreams too big for this townAnd she needs to give them a shotWhatever they areLooks like she's all ready to leaveNothing left to packThere ain't no room for me in that carEven if she asked me to tag alongGod I gotta be strongShe's at the starting line of the rest of her lifeAs ready as she's ever beenGot the hunger and the stars in her eyesThe prize is hers to winShe's waiting on my blessings before she hits that open roadBaby get readyGet setDon't goShe says things are fallen into placeFeels like they're fallen apartI painted this big old smile on my faceTo hide my broken heartIf only she knewThis is where I don't say what I want so bad to sayThis is where I want to but I won't get in the wayOf her and her dreamsAnd spreading her wingsShe's at the starting line of the rest of her lifeAs ready as she's ever beenGot the hunger and the stars in her eyesThe prize is hers to winShe's waiting on my blessings before she hits that open roadBaby get readyGet setDon't goShe's at the starting line of the rest of her lifeAs ready as she's ever beenGot the hunger and the stars in her eyesThe prize is hers to winShe's waiting on my blessings before she hits that open roadBaby get readyGet setDon't goDon't goDon't goShe's gotta do what she's gotta doShe's gotta do what she's gotta do
