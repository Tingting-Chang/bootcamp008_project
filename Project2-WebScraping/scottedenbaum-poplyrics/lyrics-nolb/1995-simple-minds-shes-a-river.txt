Shadow let goThere's something you should knowI just found my new directionAnd I hope you like the keyLike the air that led me to itShe's like the wind that sucked me through itShe's a river and she's turning there in front of meStand back, get backShe'll paint your blue skies blackShe gives bullet proof protectionGot a resurrection feelWhen I'm scared, and 'bout to loseShe gives me travelling shoesShe's a river and she's turning in front of meAnd I go blindWasting my timeWhile the rivers in front of meThat's where I'm goin' to beShine on, get onTwilight from dusk to dawnShe's the spirit of creationShe's the last chance guaranteeGot a myriad of posesSweet miracles and rosesShe's a river and she's turning in front of me'cause when I findMy state of mindThe river's in front of meThey say that every heaven's got a thousand roomsSo take me on that freedom rideMy heart is like a hunter's in the silent moonMy nerves just feel electrifiedMeet me on the staircaseOutside a darkened roomLight me like a naked flameThe voice of mother nature statesAll things must passAnd nothing can remainThey say that every heaven's got a thousand roomsSo take me on that freedom rideYou raise me like a building to the very topRush me to the end of timeYou fill me full of dangerYou give me future shockThen you leave me wasted dyingAnd I go blindWasting my timeThe river's in front of me
