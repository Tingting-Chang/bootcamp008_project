Broke my heartOn the roadSpent the weekendSewing the pieces back onFriends and thoughts pass me byWalking gets too boringWhen you learn how to flyNot the homecoming kindTake the top offAnd who knows what you might findWon't confess all my sinsYou can bet I'll try itBut you can't always win'Cause I'm a gypsyAre you coming with me?I might steal your clothesAnd wear them if they fit meI never made agreementsJust like a gypsyAnd I won't back down'Cause life's already bit meAnd I won't cryI'm too young to dieIf you're gonna quit me'Cause I'm a gypsy'Cause I'm a gypsyI can't hideWhat I've doneScars remind meOf just how far that I've comeTo whom it may concernOnly run with scissorsWhen you want to get hurt'Cause I'm a gypsyAre you coming with me?I might steal your clothesAnd wear them if they fit meI don't make agreementsJust like a gypsyAnd I won't back down'Cause life's already bit meAnd I won't cryI'm too young to dieIf you're gonna quit me'Cause I'm a gypsyI said hey youYou're no foolIf you say "no"Ain't it just the way life goes?People fear what they don't knowCome along for the ride oh yeahCome along for the ride ooh'Cause I'm a gypsyAre you coming with me?I might steal your clothesAnd wear them if they fit meI never made agreementsJust like a gypsyI won't back down'Cause life's already bit meAnd I won't cryI'm too young to dieIf you're gonna quit me'Cause I'm a gypsy
