Cue the music out the drivewaySlow summer on a FridayHere we go again, wild in the windMama knows she's gonna be lateHit the party just to watch her danceGood to go when she grabs your handLike a shot from a gun, it's a dead runThe first leg of a getaway planYou burn rubber when you smoke them tiresDay's gone and the night's on fireShe's telling you turn off the highwayThe sunset melts all the blue awayBlackbird watching on the telephone wireWhiskey on her lips and the night's on fireLittered with stars close enough to touchJuly promise in the back of that truckHer every move was taking you higherYou try to play it cool but the night's on fireShe's a seat laid back, a boy's dreamDrawin' hearts in the window steamShe's a gettin' you right, knows what you likeAnd pours it on like gasolineWhen you know what you're headed toWhat's a red blooded boy to doShe's telling you turn off the highwayThe sunset melts all the blue awayBlackbird watching on the telephone wireWhiskey on her lips and the night's on fireLittered with stars close enough to touchJuly promise in the back of that truckHer every move was taking you higherYou try to play it cool but the night's on fireYou try to play it cool but the night's on fireShe's telling you turn off the highwayThe sunset melts all the blue awayBlackbird watching on the telephone wireWhiskey on her lips and the night's on fireLittered with stars close enough to touchJuly promise in the back of that truckHer every move was taking you higherYou try to play it cool but the night's on fireYou try to play it cool but the night's on fireYou try to play it cool but the night's on fire
