It never really mattered too much to meThat you were just too damned old for meAll that really mattered was you were my boyfriendAnd baby that's all that matters to me[Chorus]Let me love you down, even if it takes all nightLet me love you down, you know it's got to be so rightRemember when you drove me home from work?I loved the way you only kissed me byeAll of your friends think I'm just too young for youSo tell them that I can do what girls their age can doAw babe[Chorus: x2]AwIt never really mattered too much to meThat they were just too damned blind to seeAs long as I can love you down baby just be my manThat's all that matters to me[Chorus]Let me love you downOohLet me love you down,I know, I know I couldLove you down, down, oohLove you down, down, no no no no no no noLet me love you, I want to love you, downLet me love you, I want to love you, down baby
