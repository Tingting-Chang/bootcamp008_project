Well I saw you with your hands above your headSpinning around, trying not to look downBut you did and you fell hard, on the groundAnd you stumbled around for a good ten minutesAnd I said I'd never seen anyone look so dumb beforeAnd you laughed and said I still know how to turn you on thoughYou're the only one whoDrags me kicking and screaming through fast dreamsAnd you're the only one whoKnows exactly what I meanAnd I probably forgot to tell you thisLike that time when I forgot to tell you about the scarRemember how uncomfortable that made you feel?See you're not what I expectedBut you're the only one who knows how to handle meAnd you're such a great kisser and I know that you agreeAnd you're the only one whoDrags me kicking and screaming through fast dreamsYou're the only one whoKnows exactly what I meanI hope you can forgive me for that timeWhen I put my hand between your legsAnd I said it was small, because its really not at allI guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you downJust to keep you around, because the day that you realiseHow amazing you are you're gonna leave meYou're the only one whoHolds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sickYou're the only one whoKnows exactly what I mean yeahYou're the only one whoDrags me kicking and screaming through fast dreamsAnd you're the only one whoKnows exactly what I mean, exactly what I meanWell I saw you with your hands above your headSpinning around, trying not to look downBut you did and you fell hard on the ground
