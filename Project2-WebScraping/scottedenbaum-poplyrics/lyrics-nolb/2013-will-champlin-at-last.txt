At lastMy love has come alongMy lonely days are overAnd life is like a songOh yeah yeahAt last, at lastThe skies above are blueMy heart was wrapped up in cloverThe night I looked at youI found a dream, that I could speak toA dream that I can call my ownI found a thrill to press my cheek toA thrill that I have never known, yeah yeahYou smiled, you smiledOh and then the spell was castAnd here we are in heavenFor you are mineAt lastOh you're mineMy lonely days are over, yeah, overAt last
