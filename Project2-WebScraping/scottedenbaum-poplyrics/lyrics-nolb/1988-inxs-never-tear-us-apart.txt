Don't ask meWhat you know is trueDon't have to tell youI love your precious heartII was standingYou were thereTwo worlds collidedAnd they could never tear us apartWe could liveFor a thousand yearsBut if I hurt youI'd make wine from your tearsI told youThat we could fly'Cause we all have wingsBut some of us don't know whyI was standingYou were thereTwo worlds collidedAnd they could never ever tear us apartII was standingYou were thereTwo worlds collidedAnd they could never tear us apartYou were standingI was thereTwo worlds collidedAnd they could never tear us apartII was standingYou were thereTwo worlds collided
