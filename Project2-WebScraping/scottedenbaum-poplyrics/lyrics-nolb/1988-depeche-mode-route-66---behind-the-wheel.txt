You walked in my lifeBut made me smileHow could I have knownHunger locked in timeWe can start a fire,But we can't control the flameAnd I just can't wait to feel the heat againIn the middle of the nightShe cry too much ain't enough love to satisfy me, yeahI said too much ain't enough love to satisfy meWell it just seems like yesterdayI was running aloneAnd I turn my back home loveBut baby I wasn't wrongDo I miss your touchOr tell myself on the lineThen I can't get enoughWhen I'm lying by your sideShe cry too much ain't enough love to satisfy me, yeahI said too much ain't enough love to satisfy meI gotta burn his heart babyDo I miss your touchOr tell myself a lieAnd I can't get enoughWhen I'm lying by your sideIn the middle of the nightShe cry too much ain't enough love to satisfy me, yeahI said too much ain't enough love to satisfy meI gotta burn it hard babyToo much ain't enough love to satisfy me, yeahBut I smoke as fire babyToo much ain't enough love to satisfy me hey
