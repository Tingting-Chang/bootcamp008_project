At lastMy love has come alongMy lonely days are overAnd life is like a song oh yeahAt lastThe skies above are blueOh my heart was wrapped up in cloverFirst night I looked at you oh yeahWell I found a dream, that I could speak toA dream that I can call my ownAnd I found a thrill to press my cheek toA thrill that I have never knownAt lastMy love has come alongOh my lonely days are overAnd life is like a song oh yeahWell I found a dream, that I could speak toA dream that I can call my ownAnd I found a thrill to press my cheek toA thrill that I have never knownWhen you, when you smiledOh and then the spell was castDarlin' here we are in heavenFor you are mineAt lastDarlin' here we are in heavenFor you are mineAt last
