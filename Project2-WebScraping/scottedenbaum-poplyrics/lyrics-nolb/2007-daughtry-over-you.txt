Now that it's all said and doneI can't believe you were the oneTo build me up and tear me downLike an old abandoned houseWhat you said when you leftJust left me cold and out of breathI felt as if I was in way to deepGuess I let you get the best of meWell, I never saw it comingI should have started runningA long, long time ago!And I never thought I'd doubt youI'm better off without youMore than you, more than you knowI'm slowly getting closureI guess it's really overI'm finally gettin' betterNow I'm picking up the piecesFrom spending all of these yearsPutting my heart back togetherCause the day I thought I'd never get through, I got over you!You took a hammer to these wallsDragged the memories down the hallPacked your bags, and walked awayThere was nothing I could sayAnd when you slammed the front door shutA lot of others opened upSo did my eyes, so I could seeThat you never were the best for meWell, I never saw it comingI should have started runningA long, long time ago!And I never thought I'd doubt youI'm better off without youMore than you, more than you knowI'm slowly getting closureI guess it's really overI'm finally gettin' betterNow I'm picking up the piecesFrom spending all of these yearsPutting my heart back togetherCause the day I thought I'd never get through, I got over you!
