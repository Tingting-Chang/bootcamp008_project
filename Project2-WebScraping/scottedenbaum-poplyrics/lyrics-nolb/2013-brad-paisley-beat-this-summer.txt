Like the Ferris wheel goes around and aroundWell the trouble with up is there's always a downFirst I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalkThere's heaven right here on these streets and these docksBut the sun keeps setting and the days go fastAnd the sand on the beach is like an hourglassAnd I can just feel it, I'm slipping awayAnd babe, I can already say thatAs long as I live, whatever I doAs great as it is you know what's a bummerI ain't never gonna beat this summer with youBaby, it's trueThe taste in your kiss is so bittersweetI ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with youBefore you know it it's all gonna stopThey'll be rolling up windows and putting up topsBe a cold wind blowing and leaves through the airAnd you won't find a tan line anywhereMaybe I know that it ain't over yetSo let's make the most of what we have leftBut it's hard living for this moment we're inKnowing it's all gonna endAs long as I live, whatever I doAs great as it is you know what's a bummerI ain't never gonna beat this summer with youBaby, it's trueThe taste in your kiss is so bittersweetI ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with youLooking at you, girl, standing there,Got your wayfarer's on and the sun in your hairAnd just like the song in a seashell, you'll be stuck in mindBouncing around in my headAnd baby, I can tellAs long as I live, whatever I doAs great as it is you know what's a bummerI ain't never gonna beat this summer with youBaby, it's trueThe taste in your kiss is so bittersweetI ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you
