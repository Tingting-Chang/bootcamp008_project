I can't remember the last time that we kissed goodbyeAll our "I love you's" were just not enough to surviveSomething your eyes never told meBut it's only now to plain to seeBrilliant disguise when you hold meAnd I'm freeI've been thinking and here's what I come to concludeSometimes the distance is more than two people can useBut how should I have know girlIt was time and not space you would needDarling tonight I could hold you and you would knowBut would you believeThere's a light in you eyes that I used to seeThere's a place in you heart where I used to beWas I wrong to assume that you were waiting for meThere's a light in your eyesDid you leave that burning for meCards and phone calls and photograph pictures of youConstant reminder of all the things you get used toIs there a chance in hell or heavenThat there's still something here to build onOr do you just pick up the pieces after they fallBut after allThere's a light in your eyes that I used to seeAnd a song in the words that you spoke to meWas I wrong to believe in your melodyThere's a light in your eyesDid you leave that light burning for meShould I keep on waiting or does love keep on fading awayFading awayIt's been a while since I've seen you so how have you beenDid you get my letter I wrote you, but I did not sendI tried to call your old numberBut the voice that I heard on the phoneI recognized but she told me the number was wrongThere's a light in my eyes but it's too bright to seeAnd a pain in my heart where you used to beGuess I was wrong to assume that you were waiting here for meThere is a light in your eyesDid you leave that light burning for me.
