All alone on a Sunday morningOutside I see the rain is falling, whoa-ohInside I'm slowly dyingBut the rain will hide my crying, crying, cryingAnd youDon't you know my tears will burn the pillow?Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lieAll I needed was a simple "hello"But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry(I) I gave you my love in vainMy body never knew such pleasureMy heart never knew such painAnd you, you leave me so confusedNow I'm all cried out, over youNever wanted to see things your wayHad to go astrayOh, why was I such a fool (why was I such a fool?)Now I see that the grass is greenerIs it too late for me to find my way homeHow could I be so wrong?Leaving me all alone(Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno?) (tears gonne 'cause an inferno, baby)Romance of the flames, why should I take the blame? (why should, why should I?)You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry baby)Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected(I) I gave you all of me (gave you all of me)How was I to knowYou would weaken so easily?(And I) I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)Over you(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)(I) I gave you my love in vainMy body never knew such pleasureMy heart never knew such painAnd youYou left me so confusedNow I'm all cried out (all cried out)Now I'm all cried out (all cried out)(I'm so sorry, baby)Over you(Please forgive me, oh, oh, ooh)(Please forgive me)
