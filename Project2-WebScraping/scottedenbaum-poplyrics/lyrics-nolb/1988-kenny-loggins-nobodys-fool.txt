"Maybe, just maybeNaughty girls need love too."I've been told time and time againThat you can't treat love like a gameBut I play rough with hearts that never mend'Cause some guys like you do the sameLove was just a four letter wordNever heard how absurd it could beBut now I can't believe this is realHow I feel now you stealMy heart away from meUsed to be so good and so badSex was just something I hadUsed to always know what to doNow you've got me confusedBaby don't let me be misunderstoodTemporary love's so bad but if feels so goodThen along came youNow I know its trueNaughty girls need love tooThen came you, then came youYes, it's trueI'm in love with youAnd believe it baby this timeYour love won't get awayStay here in the place to beWe can get busy my wayFor six forevers and a day-ay-ayOoh it's only you I adoreSo much more than my bodyWas asking forYes your love is breaking my chillEven still there's a thrillIn my heart."Samantha Fox was such a wild dameHuh but what's in a name(S-S-Samantha, S-S-Samantha)No more fun and games of the mindLet's get busy one more time."
