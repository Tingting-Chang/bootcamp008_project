Do you hear me,I'm talking to youAcross the water across the deep blue oceanUnder the open sky, oh my, baby I'm tryingBoy I hear you in my dreamsI feel your whisper across the seaI keep you with me in my heartYou make it easier when life gets hardI'm lucky I'm in love with my best friendLucky to have been where I have beenLucky to be coming home somedayOoh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oohThey don't know how long it takesWaiting for a love like thisEvery time we say goodbyeI wish we had one more kissI'll wait for you I promise you, I willI'm lucky I'm in love with my best friendLucky to have been where I have beenLucky to be coming home somedayLucky we're in love every wayLucky to have stayed where we have stayedLucky to be coming home somedayAnd so I'm sailing through the seaTo an island where we'll meetYou'll hear the music fill the airI'll put a flower in your hairThough the breezes through treesMove so pretty you're all I seeAs the world keeps spinning 'roundYou hold me right here, right nowI'm lucky I'm in love with my best friendLucky to have been where I have beenLucky to be coming home againI'm lucky we're in love in every wayLucky to have stayed where we have stayedLucky to be coming home somedayOoh ooh oohOoh ooh ooh, ooh
