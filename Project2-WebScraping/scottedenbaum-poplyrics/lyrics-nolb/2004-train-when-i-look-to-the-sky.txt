When it rains it pours and opens doorsAnd floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dryAnd in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we loveThat have to say goodbyeAnd as I float along this oceanI can feel you like a notion that won't seem to let me go'Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with meAnd you make everything alrightAnd when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with meAnd I can always find my way when you are hereAnd every word I didn't say that caught up in some busy dayAnd every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't dance beforeAnd every sunset that we'll miss I'll wrap them all up in a kissAnd pick you up in all of this when I sail awayWhether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overheadInstead it just feels like it is impossible to flyBut with you I can spread my wingsTo see me over everything that life may send meWhen I am hoping it won't pass me byAnd when I feel like there is no one that will ever know meThere you are to show me
