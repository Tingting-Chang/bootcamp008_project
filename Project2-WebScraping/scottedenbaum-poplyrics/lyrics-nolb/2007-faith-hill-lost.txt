Is it obvious to youWhen you walk into a roomYour face is all I seeAnd my heart races so fastI never knew a rush to feel like thatEvery time you're touching meI never did believe in anythingI couldn't hold between my fingersBut the way you make me feelIt's just so real the way it lingersI get lost inside your stareLost when you're not thereAnd everything I haveDoesn't mean a thing if it's without youIf it's a dreamDon't wake me upI'll scream if this isn't loveIf bein' lost means never knowin' how it feels without youI wanna stay lost foreverI wanna stay lost foreverwith you.No this feelin' doesn't endIt's with me everywhere I amHope it never goes awayIt's like defying gravityI'm losing all control in bein' freeAnd I always wanna stayI never thought that I'd let go long enoughTo fall for someone deeplyWho had the power to erase my fearsAnd find me so completelyI get lost inside your stareLost when you're not thereAnd everything I haveDoesn't mean a thing if it's without youIf it's a dreamDon't wake me upI'll scream if this isn't loveIf bein' lost means never knowin' how it feels without youI wanna stay lostDon't tell me where we're goin'I don't wanna knowI like the mysteryI can't believe we've come this farSo far away from where we started offYou found me when I wasn't lookin'You found meAnd now I'm lost inside your stareLost when you're not thereAnd everything I haveDoesn't mean a thing if it's without youWithout you..If it's a dreamDon't wake me upI'll scream if this isn't loveIf bein' lost means never knowin' how it feels without youYeahIf bein' lost means never knowin' how it feels without youOhIf bein' lost means that I'm never gonna be without youI wanna stay lost foreverI wanna stay lost foreverWith you
