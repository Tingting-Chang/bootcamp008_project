Anything for youThough you're not hereSince you said we're throughIt seems like yearsTime keeps draggin' on and onAnd forever's been and goneStill I can't figure what went wrongI'd still do anything for youI'll play your gameYou hurt me through and throughBut you can have your wayI can pretend each time I see youThat I don't care and I don't need youAnd though you'll never see me cryin'You know inside I feel like dyingAnd I'd do anything for youIn spite of it allI've learned so much from youYou made me strongBut don't even think that I don't love youThat for one minute I forgot youBut sometimes things don't work out rightAnd you just have to say goodbyeI hope you find someone to please youSomeone who'll care and never leave youBut if that someone ever hurts youYou just might need a friend to turn toAnd I'd do anything for youI'll give you upIf that's what I should doTo make you happyI can pretend each time I see youThat I don't care and I don't need youAnd though inside I feel like dyingYou know you'll never see me cryin'But don't even think that I don't love youThat for one minute I forgot youBut sometimes things don't work out rightAnd you just have to say goodbye
