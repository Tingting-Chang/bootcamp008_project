Love is a hungerThat burns in my soulBut you never notice the painLove is an anchorThat won't let me goI reach out to hold youBut you push me awayYou always convince me to stayAnd I wonder whyWe hold on with tears in our eyesAnd I wonder whyWe have to break down to just makeThings rightAnd I wonder whyI can't seem to tell you goodbyeYeah, I wonder whyI'm no angelWith my selfish prideBut I love you more every dayLove is an angerThat builds up insideAs the tears of frustrationRoll down my faceWhy does love always have to turnOut this wayI don't want to fight again tonightAbout the little things please babyI just want to find my wayBack to loveAnd I'll meet you there, baby
