Nobody believes me when I tell them that you're out of your mindNobody believes me when I tell them that there's so much you hideYou treat me like a queen when we go outWanna show everyone what our love's aboutAll wrapped up in me whenever there is a crowdBut when no ones aroundThere's no kindness in your eyesThe way you look at me, it's just not rightI can tell what's going on this timeThere's a stranger in my lifeYou're not the person that I once knewAre you scared to let them know it's you?If they could only see you like I doThen they would see a stranger tooDid I ever do anything that was this cruel to you?Did I ever make you wonder who was standing in the room?You made yourself look perfect in every waySo, when this goes down, I'm the one that will be blamedYour plan is working, so you can just walk awayBaby, your secret's safeThere's no kindness in your eyesThe way you look at me, it's just not rightI can tell what's going on this timeThere's a stranger in my lifeYou're not the person that I once knewAre you scared to let them know it's you?If they could only see you like I doThen they would see a stranger tooSuch a long way back from this place we are atWhen I think of all the time I've wasted, I could cryThere's no kindness in your eyesThe way you look at me, it's just not rightI can tell what's going on this timeThere's a stranger in my lifeYou're not the person that I once knewAre you scared to let them know it's you?If they could only see you like I doThen they would see a stranger tooThere's no kindness in your eyesThe way you look at me, it's just not rightI can tell what's going on this timeThere's a stranger in my lifeYou're not the person that I once knewAre you scared to let them know it's you?If they could only see you like I doThen they would see a stranger too
