It's a long trip alone over sand and stoneThat lie along the road that we all must travel downSo maybe you could walk with me a whileAnd maybe I could rest beneath your smileEverybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold'Cause it's a long trip aloneIt's a short piece of time but just enough to findA little peace of mind under the sun somewhereSo maybe you could walk with me a whileAnd maybe I could rest beneath your smileYou know we can't afford to let one moment pass us by'Cause it's a short piece of timeAnd I don't know where I'd be without you here'Cause I'm not really me without you thereYeah, yeahHallelujah, hallelujah, ohSo maybe you could walk with me a whileMaybe I could rest beneath your smileEverybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to holdSo maybe you could walk with me a whileMaybe I could rest beneath your smileMaybe I could feel right beside you till I'm home'Cause it's a long trip alone, a long trip alone
