Yeah,Lover I'm off the streetsGonna go where the bright lightsAnd the big city meetWith a red guitar, on fireDesireShe's the candleBurning in my roomI'm like the needleNeedle and spoonOver the counterWith a shotgunPretty soon, everybody got oneAnd the fever when I'm beside herDesire,DesireDesireDesireBurningBurning
