I remember well the day we wedI can see that picture in my headI still believe the words we saidForever will ring trueLove is certain, love is kindLove is yours and love is mineBut it isn't something that we findIt's something that we doIt's holding tight, lettin' goIt's flying high and laying lowLet your strongest feelings showAnd your weakness, tooIt's a little and a lot to askAn endless and a welcome taskLove isn't something that we haveIt's something that we doWe help to make each other all that we can beThough we can find our strength and inspiration independentlyThe way we work together is what sets our love apartSo closely that you can't tell where I end and where you startIt gives me heart remembering howWe started with a simple vowThere's so much to look back on nowStill it feels brand-newWe're on a road that has no endAnd each day we begin againLove's not just something that we're inIt's something that we doWe help to make each other all that we can beThough we can find our strength and inspiration independentlyThe way we work together is what sets our love apartSo closely that you can't tell where I end and where you startLove is wide, love is longLove is deep and love is strongLove is why I love this songAnd I hope you love it tooI remember well the day we wedI can see that picture in my headLove isn't just those words we saidIt's something that we doThere's no request too big or smallWe give ourselves, we give our allLove isn't someplace that we fallIt's something that we do
