Girl, you're every breath I takeOh baby,Your love rules every move I makeOh baby,And I know that you can't read my mindAnd baby, maybe I[Chorus: x2]Don't say it as often as I should But I really want it to be heardWhen I say I love you that's for goodYou have my wordThat day after day after allI will always be trueThat's a promise I make to youYou, you take this heart of mineAnd make it betterI need you toCome and walk with me through this lifeForeverAnd I know these words are long over dueAnd baby, maybe II may hold youI may need youI may want to[Chorus]
