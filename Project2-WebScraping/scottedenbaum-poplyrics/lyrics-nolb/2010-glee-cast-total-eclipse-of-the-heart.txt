Turn aroundEvery now and then I get a little bit lonelyAnd you're never coming 'round.Every now and then I get a little bit tiredOf listening to the sound of my tears.Turn aroundEvery now and then I get a little bit nervousThat the best of all the years have gone by.Every now and then I get a little bit terrifiedAnd then I see the look in your eyes.Turn around, bright eyesEvery now and then I fall apart.Turn around, bright eyesEvery now and then I fall apart.And I need you now tonight and I need you more than everAnd if you only hold me tight we'll be holding on forever.And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never be wrong.Together we can take it to the end of the line.Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time.I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark.We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks.I really need you tonight, forever's gonna start tonight,Forever's gonna start tonight.Once upon a time I was falling in love but now I'm only falling apart.There's nothing I can do, a total eclipse of the heart.Once upon a time there was light in my life but now there's only love in the dark.Nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart.Turn around, bright eyesEvery now and then I fall apartTurn around, bright eyesEvery now and then I fall apartAnd I need you now tonight and I need you more than everAnd if you only hold me tight we'll be holding on forever.And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never be wrong.Together we can take it to the end of the line.Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time.I don't know what to do I'm always in the dark.We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks.I really need you tonight, forever's gonna start tonight,Forever's gonna start tonight.Once upon a time I was falling in love but now I'm only falling apart.There's nothing I can do, a total eclipse of the heart.A total eclipse of the heart, a total eclipse of the heart.A total eclipse of the heartTurn around, bright eyes,
