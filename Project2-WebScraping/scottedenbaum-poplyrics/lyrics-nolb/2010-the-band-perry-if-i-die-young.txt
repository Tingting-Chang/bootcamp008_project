If I die young, bury me in satinLay me down on a bed of rosesSink me in the river at dawnSend me away with the words of a love song,Uh oh, Uh ohLord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my motherShe'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colorsOh, and, life ain't always what you think it ought to be, noAin't even grey, but sheburies her babyThe sharp knife of a short lifeOh well, I've had just enough timeIf I die young, bury me in satinLay me down on a bed of rosesSink me in the river at dawnSend me away with the words of a love songThe sharp knife of a short lifeOh well, I've had just enough timeAnd I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdomAs green as the ring on my little cold fingerI've never known the loving of a manBut it sure felt nice when he was holding my handThere's a boy here in town, says he'll love me foreverWho would have thought forever could be severed byThe sharp knife of a short lifeOh well, I've had just enough timeSo put on your best, boys and I'll wear my pearlsWhat I never did is doneA penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollarThey're worth so much more after I'm a gonerAnd maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singingFunny, when you're dead how people start listen'nIf I die young, bury me in satinLay me down on a bed of rosesSink me in the river at dawn'Send me away with the words of a love songThe ballad of a doveGo with peace and loveGather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocketSave them for a time when you're really gonna need them,The sharp knife of a short life ohWell, I've had just enough timeSo put on your best boysAnd I'll wear my pearls.
