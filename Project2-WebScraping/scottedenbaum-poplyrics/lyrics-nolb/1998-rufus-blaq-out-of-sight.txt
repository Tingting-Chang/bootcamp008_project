Electricity, eye to eyeHey don't I know youI can't speakStripped my sensesOn the spotI've never been defenselessI can't even make sense of thisYou speak and I don't hear a wordWhat would happen if we kissedWould your tongue slip past my lipsWould you run away, would you stayOr would I melt into youMouth to mouth, lust to lustSpontaneously combustThe room is spinning out of controlAct like you didn't noticeBrushed my handForbidden fruitRing on my fingerYou're such a moral, moral manYou throw it away, no questionWill I pretend I'm innocentWhat would happen if we kissedWould your tongue slip past my lipsWould you run away, would you stayOr would I melt into youMouth to mouth, lust to lustSpontaneously combustI struggle with myself againQuickly the walls are crumblingDon't know if I can turn awayWhat would happen if we kissedWould your tongue slip past my lipsWould you run away, would you stayOr would I melt into youMouth to mouth, lust to lustSpontaneously combust
