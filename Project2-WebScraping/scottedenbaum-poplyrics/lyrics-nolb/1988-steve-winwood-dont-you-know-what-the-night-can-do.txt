Hear the night music playing?Don't you know what it's saying?We should feel it togetherForeverFeel the beat and just hold onTo the sweet midnight flowingFeel the music inside youI'll be there tooNow's the time our dreams are finally coming trueFeels so good we're cryingNow's the time when it's down to me and youSpread these wings, we'll be flyingDon't you know what the night can do?Don't you know when it's touching you?Don't you know what the night can do?Time to show all your feelingsAll the night is revealingLet the rhythm enfold youLet me hold youNow we turn into musicNow we never will lose itWhen the rhythm and night rideNo heart can hideThere are times that never ever come againMemories there for the makingWhen the night calls, we better let it inAll this love for the takingDon't you know what the night can do?Don't you know when it's touching you?Won't you help me to let it through?Don't you know what the night can do?Don't you know what the night can do?Know what the night can do?Don't you know what the night can do?Don't you know what the night can do?Know what the night can do?Don't you know what the night can do?Don't you know what the night can do?Know what the night can do?Don't you know what the night can do?Don't you know what the night can do?
