The radio and a sundressMaking my world all a messBack corner of a cornfieldBottle tops and a truth spillsPull the lever, lay the seat back laughin'You slippin' off your shoesWhile the dashboard speakers sing every word of that night movesI wanna be that song that gets you highMakes you dance, makes you fallThat melody rewinds yearsOnce disappear, makes time stallWanna be those words that fill you upPull your windows down and keeps you youngMakes you believe you're right where you belongI wanna be that songI wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that songOh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wannaI wanna stand with you in the third rowWindow booth at a barBack pew on a Sunday pourin' out your heartWhen the bleachers are crowdedWhen you're sittin' all aloneWhen the rain is pourin' and you need something to take you homeLet me be that song that gets you highMakes you dance, makes you fallThat melody rewinds yearsOnce disappear, makes time stallWanna be those words that fill you upPull your windows down and keeps you youngMakes you believe you're right where you belongI wanna be that songI wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that songOh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wannaWhen you're searching the horizonWhen your eyes look backWhen you're standing in the momentEvery life has a soundtrackOh I wanna be, I wanna be, oh I wanna beI wanna be that song that gets you highMakes you dance, makes you fallThat melody rewinds yearsOnce disappear, makes time stallWanna be those words that fill you upPull your windows down and keeps you youngMakes you believe you're right where you belongI wanna be that songWhen the highway's callingWhen the bottle's dryWhen the sky is falling and you're asking yourself whyOh, oh, I wanna be, yeah, oh
