On a Monday I am waitingTuesday I am fadingAnd By Wednesday I can't sleepThen the phone rings I hear youAnd the darkness is a clear viewCause you've come to rescue meFall, with you I fall so fastI can hardly catch my breathI hope it lastsIt seems like I can finallyRest my head on something realI like the way that feelsIt's as if you know me betterThan I ever knew myselfI love how you can tellAll the pieces, pieces, pieces of meI am moody and messyI get restless and it's senselessHow you never seem to careWhen I'm angry, you listenMake me happy, its your missionAnd you won't stop till I'm thereFall, sometimes I fall so fastWhen I hit that bottom crashYou're all I haveIt seems like I can finallyRest my head on something realI like the way that feelsIt's as if you know me betterThan I ever knew myselfI love how you can tellAll the pieces, pieces, pieces of meHow do you know?Everything I'm about to sayAm I that obvious?And if it's written on my faceI hope it never goes awayYeaOn a Monday I am waitingBy Tuesday I am fadingInto your armsSo I can breatheIt seems like I can finallyRest my head on something realI like the way that feelsIt's as if you know me betterThan I ever knew myselfI love how you can tellI love how you can tellI love how you can tellAll the pieces, pieces, pieces of mePieces, pieces, pieces of me
