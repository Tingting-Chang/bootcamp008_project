When you're weary, feeling smallWhen tears are in your eyes, I will dry them allI'm on your side, oh when times get roughAnd friends just can't be foundLike a bridge over troubled waterI will lay me downWhen you're down and outWhen you're on the streetWhen evening falls so hardI will comfort youI'll take your partOh, when darkness comesAnd pain is all aroundLike a bridge over troubled waterI will lay me down ohSail on silver-girlSail on byYour time has come to shineAll your dreams are on their wayAnd see how they shineWhen you need a friendI'm sailing right behindLike a bridge over troubled waterI will ease your mindLike a bridge over troubled waterI will ease your mind
