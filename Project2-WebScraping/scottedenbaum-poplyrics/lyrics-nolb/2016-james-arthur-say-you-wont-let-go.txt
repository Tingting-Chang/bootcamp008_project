I met you in the dark, you lit me upYou made me feel as though I was enoughWe danced the night away, we drank too muchI held your hair back whenYou were throwing upThen you smiled over your shoulderFor a minute, I was stone-cold soberI pulled you closer to my chestAnd you asked me to stay overI said, I already told yaI think that you should get some restI knew I loved you thenBut you'd never know'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting goI know I needed youBut I never showedBut I wanna stay with you until we're grey and oldJust say you won't let goJust say you won't let gomeaningÂ byunicornsarebae	I think it means that he loves someone and will live them forever and ever morganxxxxxxxxxxxx	See allI'll wake you up with some breakfast in bedI'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your headAnd I'll take the kids to schoolWave them goodbyeAnd I'll thank my lucky stars for that nightWhen you looked over your shoulderFor a minute, I forget that I'm olderI wanna dance with you right nowOh, and you look as beautiful as everAnd I swear that everyday you'll get betterYou make me feel this way somehowI'm so in love with youAnd I hope you knowDarling your love is more than worth its weight in goldWe've come so far my dearLook how we've grownAnd I wanna stay with you until we're grey and oldJust say you won't let goJust say you won't let goI wanna live with youEven when we're ghosts'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you mostI'm gonna love you tillMy lungs give outI promise till death we part like in our vowsSo I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows'Cause now it's just you and me till we're grey and oldJust say you won't let goJust say you won't let goJust say you won't let goOh, just say you won't let go
