She loved him like he wasThe last man on EarthGave him everything she ever hadHe'd break her spirit downThen come lovin' up on herGive a little, then take it backShe'd tell him about her dreamsHe'd just shoot 'em downLord he loved to make her cry"You're crazy for believin'You'll ever leave the ground"He said, "Only angels know how to fly"And with a broken wingShe still singsShe keeps an eye on the skyWith a broken wingShe carries her dreamsMan you ought to see her flyOne Sunday morningShe didn't go to churchHe wondered why she didn't leaveHe went up to the bedroomFound a note by the windowWith the curtains blowin' in the breezeAnd with a broken wingShe still singsShe keeps an eye on the skyWith a broken wingShe carries her dreamsMan you ought to see her flyWith a broken wingShe carries her dreamsMan you ought to see her fly
