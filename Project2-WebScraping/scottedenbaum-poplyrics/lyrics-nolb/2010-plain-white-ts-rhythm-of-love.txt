My head is stuck in the cloudsShe begs me to come downSays "Boy quit foolin' around"I told her "I love the view from up hereWarm sun and wind in my earWe'll watch the world from aboveAs it turns to the rhythm of love"We may only have tonightBut till the morning sun you're mine, all minePlay the music low and sway to the rhythm of loveMy heart beats like a drumA guitar string to the strumA beautiful song to be sungShe's got blue eyes deep like the seaThat roll back when she's laughing at meShe rises up like the tideThe moment her lips meet mineWe may only have tonightBut till the morning sun you're mine all minePlay the music low and sway to the rhythm of loveWhen the moon is lowWe can dance in slow motionAnd all your tears will subsideAll your tears will dryAnd long after I've goneYou'll still be humming alongAnd I will keep you in my mindThe way you make love so fineWe may only have tonightBut till the morning sun you're mine all minePlay the music low and sway to the rhythm of lovePlay the music low and sway to the rhythm of loveYes sway to the rhythm of love
