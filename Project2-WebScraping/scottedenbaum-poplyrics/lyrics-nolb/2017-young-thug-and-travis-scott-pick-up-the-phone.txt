Right now we both knowWe're Marina Del RayPlanes gonna fly awayAnd you'll be on itAnd by this time tomorrowI'll be singing yesterdayThe sunshine's gonna fadeAnd we can't stop itSo before we turn inI can't make you love meLet's be brown eyed girl sweet CarolineFree fall small town Saturday nightBefore you lose that loving feelingLet's go dancing on the ceilingKeep on living that teenage dreamParadise city where the grass is greenPretty soon I'll be so lonesome I could cryBut that's a song for another timeJust for one more day what do you sayBaby be my pretty woman'Cause we know Sunday morning's coming downLet's take a drive you and I down some old country roadTalk about growing old in one of those pink housesYeah we might be a candle in the windBut let's pretend we'reBrown eyed girl sweet CarolineFree fall small town Saturday nightBefore you lose that loving feelingLet's go dancing on the ceilingKeep on living that teenage dream,Paradise city where the grass is greenPretty soon you will be always on my mindBut that's a song for another timeSo before we're singing I will always love youLet's sing
