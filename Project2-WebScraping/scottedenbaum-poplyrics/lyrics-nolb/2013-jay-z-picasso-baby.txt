I've been thinkin' bout you all day babyWaitin' on that sun to go downWhatcha say I pick you up after workSlide over, we slip out to the outskirts of townGot a blanket and a fifth of comfortA little something to knock off the edgeIt's supposed to get a little cool tonightLooks like I'm gonna have to hold you tight... yeahBout a mile off old mill roadIn that spot nobody knowsPark the truck and we take off runningHurry up, girl I hear it comingGot a moon and a billion starsSound of steel and old box carsThe thought of you is driving me insaneCome on baby lets go listen to the night trainYeah I hope it's gonna be a long oneIf were lucky it's moving slowWouldn't mind if it lasted all nightLying next to you on that hillside lets goBout a mile off old mill roadIn that spot nobody knowsPark the truck and we take off runningHurry up girl, I hear it comingGot a moon and a billion starsSound of steel and old box carsThe thought of you is driving me insaneCome on baby lets go listen to the night trainLet's go listen to the night trainBout a mile off old mill roadIn that spot nobody knowsPark the truck and we take off runningHurry up, girl I hear it comingGot a moon and a billion starsSound of steel and old box carsThe thought of you is driving me insaneCome on baby lets go listen to the night trainLet's go listen to the night train
