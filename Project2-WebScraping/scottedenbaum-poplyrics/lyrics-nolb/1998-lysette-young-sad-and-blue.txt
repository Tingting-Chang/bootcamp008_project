Undying love you've given to meSeen in me things I would never have seenI don't understand why you care so much, it's all a mysteryTime and time again I ask myselfWhat have I done to deserve such wealthThe price you paid, I could never repay your generosityIn wanting to save meIn order to save the dayBecause of love you placed yourselfIn harm's wayIt's truly beyond meLeft without a word to sayWhat kind of love would place itselfIn harm's way?What kind of love would place itselfIn harm's way?When I was down you came and lifted meWhen I was bound, yes, you set me freeThings that you do makes it clear to seeIt's all a master planOh, no greater love that I've come to knowAnd when I refuse, you still love me soWith open arms you came and rescued meAnd erased all the pain, yes all the painIn wanting to save meIn order to save the dayBecause of love you placed yourselfIn harm's wayIt's truly beyond meLeft without a word to sayWhat kind of love would place itselfIn harm's way?What kind of love would place itselfIn harm's way?What kind of love would place itselfAnd risk your life for love's sake?What kind of love just takes on all the blame?It seems to be so easyIt hurts sometimes but you never let goYou will to love in spite of all you knowYou know, you knowIn wanting to save meIn order to save the dayBecause of love you placed yourselfIn harm's wayIt's truly beyond meLeft without a word to sayWhat kind of love would place itselfIn harm's way?What kind of love would place itselfIn harm's way?
