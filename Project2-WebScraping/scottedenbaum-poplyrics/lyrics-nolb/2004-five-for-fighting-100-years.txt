I'm fifteen for a momentCaught in between ten and twentyAnd I'm just dreamingCounting the ways to where you areI'm twenty two for a momentShe feels better than everAnd we're on fireMaking our way back from MarsFifteen there's still time for youTime to buy and time to loseFifteen, there's never a wish better than thisWhen you only got hundred years to liveI'm thirty three for a momentStill the man, but you see I'm of ageA kid on the wayA family on my mindI'm forty five for a momentThe sea is highAnd I'm heading into a crisisChasing the years of my lifeFifteen there's still time for youTime to buy, time to lose yourselfWithin a morning starFifteen I'm all right with youFifteen, there's never a wish better than thisWhen you only got hundred years to liveHalf time goes bySuddenly you're wiseAnother blink of an eyeSixty seven is goneThe sun is getting highWe're moving onI'm ninety nine for a momentDying for just another momentAnd I'm just dreamingCounting the ways to where you areFifteen there's still time for youTwenty two I feel her tooThirty three you're on your wayEvery day's a new dayFifteen there's still time for youTime to buy and time to chooseHey fifteen, there's never a wish better than thisWhen you only got hundred years to live
