I used to be the one who made you feelSo safe and strongI could always make it rightWhen everything was going wrongI don't know why it seemsSo different nowI'm on my ownAnd I don't know what it isThat scares me when I'm all aloneI can't believe that everyone I knowWould lie to meWhen they all tell me that I'm not the manI used to beDon't want to hear about the thingsThat I already knowYou've got to say it isn't soOh no, it's the[Chorus]The ghost of you that gets me every timeJust won't let go until it brings me downI try to hide it but there's only oneMy obsession is youYeah, my friends all turn awayThey tell me not to waste my timeThey say they just don't understandHow anyone could be so blindAnd there's one thing you can't changeForget about her now you know she's goneHey boy, that girl is just no goodShe's only gonna do you harmSo I watch the hours turnUntil I lose the last lony Roy of lightAnd I know I can't pretendThose shadows won't come out tonight
