There were times I wasn't kindAnd there were times I wasn't even aroundAnd there were times I made you crySo many times I had to say goodbyeWhen you want to talkI'm on the phoneBut now baby I am here for you aloneI'm gonna stand by my woman nowI'm gonna stand by my woman now'Cause I can't live my life aloneWithout a homeThere were times I didn't understandAnd there were times I wouldn't hold your handBut baby now I'm here for you'Cause baby I am so in love with youI'm gonna stand by my woman nowI'm gonna stand by my woman now'Cause I can't live my life aloneWithout a homeI'm gonna stand by my woman nowI'm gonna stand by my woman now'Cause I can't live my life aloneWithout a homeI'm gonna stand (stand) by my woman nowI'm gonna stand by my woman now'Cause I can't live my life aloneWithout a homeStand by my woman nowI'm gonna stand by my woman now'Cause I can't live my life aloneWithout a homeWithout a home
