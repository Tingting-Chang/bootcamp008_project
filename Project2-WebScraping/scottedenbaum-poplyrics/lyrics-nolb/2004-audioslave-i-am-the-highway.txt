Pearls and swine bereft of meLong and weary my road has beenI was lost in the citiesAlone in the hillsNo sorrow or pity for leaving I feelI am not your rolling wheelsI am the highwayI am not your carpet rideI am the skyFriends and liars don't wait for meI'll get on all by myselfI put millions of milesUnder my heelsAnd still too close to youI feelI am not your rolling wheelsI am the highwayI am not your carpet rideI am the skyI am not your blowing windI am the lightningI am not your autumn moonI am the nightThe nightI am not your rolling wheelsI am the highwayI am not your carpet rideI am the skyI am not your blowing windI am the lightningI am not your autumn moonI am the nightThe night
