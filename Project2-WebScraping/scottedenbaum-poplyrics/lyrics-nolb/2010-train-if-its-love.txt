While everybody else is getting out of bedI'm usually getting in itI'm not in it to win itAnd there's a thousand ways you can skin itMy feet have been on the floorFlat like an idol singerRemember wingerI digressI confess you are the best thing in my lifeBut I'm afraid when I hear storiesAbout a husband and wifeThere's no happy endingsNo Henry LeeBut you are the greatest thing about meIf it's loveAnd we decide that it's foreverNo one else could do it betterIf it's loveAnd we're two birds of a featherThen the rest is just whateverAnd if I'm addicted to loving youAnd you're addicted to my love tooWe can be them two birds of a featherThat flock togetherLove, loveGot to have something to keep us togetherLove, loveThat's enough for meTook a loan on a house I ownCan't be a queen bee without a bee throneI wanna buy ya everythingExcept cologne'Cause it's poisonWe can travel to Spain where the rain fallsMainly on the plain sounds insane'Cause it is we can laugh we can singHave ten kids and give them everythingHold our cell phones up in the airAnd just be glad that we made it here aliveOn a spinning ball in the middle of spaceI love you from your toes to your faceIf it's loveAnd we decide that it's foreverNo one else could do it betterIf it's loveAnd we're two birds of a featherThen the rest is just whateverAnd if I'm addicted to loving youAnd you're addicted to my love tooWe can be them two birds of a featherThat flock togetherLove, loveGot to have something to keep us togetherLove, loveThat's enough for meYou can move inI won't ask where you've been'Cause everybody has a pastWhen we're olderWe'll do it all over againWhen everybody else is getting out of bedI'm usually getting in itI'm not in it to win itI'm in it for youIf it's loveAnd we're two birds of a featherThen the rest is just whateverThen the rest is just whateverIf it's loveAnd we decide that it's foreverNo one else could do it betterAnd if I'm addicted to loving youAnd you're addicted to my love tooWe can be them two birds of a featherThat flock togetherLove, loveGot to have something to keep us togetherLove, loveGot to have something to keep us togetherLove, loveThat's enough for me
