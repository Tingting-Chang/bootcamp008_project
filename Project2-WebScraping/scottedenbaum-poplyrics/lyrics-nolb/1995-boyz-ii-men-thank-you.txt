I was young and didn't have no where to runI needed to wake up and see what's in front of meThere has to be a better way, sing it again nowBetter way to show I'm gratefulSo I thought up this song to show my appreciation for lovin' me so longYou don't know how much you mean to me'Cause even though when times got rough, you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)When I felt I had enough you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)Wenk, wenk, wenk, wenk, bopWenk, wenk, wenk, wenk, bopWenk, wenk, wenk, wenk, bopWenk, wenk, wenk, wenk, bop bopAll through my life I knew that you'd be my worldKnowing every where I go, things you taught me, they would showSo many times and changes you've seen me throughI sure 'nough couldn't have survived without you, youAnd so I thought up this song to show my appreciation for lovin' me so longYou don't know how much you mean to me'Cause even though when times got rough, you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)When I felt I had enough you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)'Cause even though when times got rough, you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)When I felt I had enough you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)'Cause even though when times got rough, you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)When I felt I had enough you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)'Cause even though when times got rough, you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)When I felt I had enough you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)'Cause even though when times got rough, you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)When I felt I had enough you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)'Cause even though when times got rough, you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)When I felt I had enough you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)'Cause even though when times got rough, you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)When I felt I had enough you never turned awayYou were right there and I thank you (thank you)
