Sometimes the snow comes down in JuneSometimes the sun goes 'round the moonI see the passion in your eyesSometimes it's all a big surprise'Cause there was a time when all I did was wishYou'd tell me this was loveIt's not the way I hoped or how I plannedBut somehow it's enoughAnd now we're standing face to faceIsn't this world a crazy placeJust when I thought our chance had passedYou go and save the best for lastAll of the nights you came to meWhen some silly girl had set you freeYou wondered how you'd make it throughI wondered what was wrong with you'Cause how could you give your love to someone elseAnd share your dreams with meSometimes the very thing you're looking forIs the one thing you can't seeAnd now we're standing face to faceIsn't this world a crazy placeJust when I thought our chance had passedYou go and save the best for lastSometimes the very thing you're looking forIs the one thing you can't seeSometimes the snow comes down in JuneSometimes the sun goes 'round the moonJust when I thought our chance had passedYou go and save the best for lastYou went and saved the best for last
