Tear up the photographsBut yesterday won't let goEvery day every day every minuteHere comes the emptinessJust can't leave lonely aloneEvery day every day hey heyThis second-chancin's really getting me downYou give and takin' everything I dreamed aboutIt's time you let me know let me know just let goAll I ever wanted, all I ever wantedWas a simple way to get over youAll I ever wanted, all I ever wantedWas an in-between to escape this desperate sceneWhere every lie reveals the truthBaby cause all I ever wantedAll I ever wanted was youI'd rather walk aloneDon't wanna chase you aroundEvery day every day every minute I'd fall a thousand timesFor I let you drag me downEvery day every day hey heyYour new beginning was a perfect endingBut I keep feeling we've already been here beforeIt's time you let me know let me know just let goAll I ever wanted, all I ever wantedWas a simple way to get over youAll I ever wanted, all I ever wantedWas an in-between to escape this desperate sceneWhere every lie reveals the truthBaby cause all I ever wantedAll I ever wanted was youTell me with so many out thereWhy I always turn to youYour goodbyes tear me down every timeAnd it's so easy to see that the blame is on meAll I ever wanted, all I ever wantedWas a simple way to get over youAll I ever wanted, all I ever wantedWas an in-between to escape this desperate sceneAll I ever wanted, all I ever wantedWas a simple way to get over youAll I ever wanted, all I ever wantedWas an in-between to escape this desperate sceneWhere every lie reveals the truthBaby cause all I ever wantedAll I ever wanted was you
