There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smilesSame old tired, lonely placeWalls of insincerityShifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your faceAll I can say is it was enchanting to meet youYour eyes whispered "have we met?"Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to meThe playful conversation startsCounter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecyAnd it was enchanting to meet youAll I can say is I was enchanted to meet youThis night is sparkling, don't you let it goI'm wonder struck, blushing all the way homeI'll spend forever wondering if you knewI was enchanted to meet youThe lingering question kept me upTwo a.m., who do you love?I wonder till I'm wide awakeNow I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my doorI'd open up and you would say, heyIt was enchanting to meet youAll I know is I was, enchanted to meet youThis night is sparkling, don't you let it goI'm wonder struck, blushing all the way homeI'll spend forever wondering if you knewThis night is flawless, don't you let it goI'm wonder struck, dancing around all aloneI'll spend forever wondering if you knewI was enchanted to meet youThis is me praying that this was the very first pageNot where the story line endsMy thoughts will echo your name, until I see you againThese are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soonI was enchanted to meet youPlease don't be in love with someone elsePlease don't have somebody waiting on youPlease don't be in love with someone elsePlease don't have somebody waiting on youThis night is sparkling, don't you let it goI'm wonder struck, blushing all the way homeI'll spend forever wondering if you knewThis night is flawless, don't you let it goI'm wonder struck, dancing around all aloneI'll spend forever wondering if you knewI was enchanted to meet youPlease don't be in love with someone elsePlease don't have somebody waiting on you
