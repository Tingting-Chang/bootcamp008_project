I had a one night stand with my best friend's baby sisterAnd to this day he still won't speak to meI pawned my grandpa's old guitar in collegeFor a case of beer and a tank of gasolineI took a swing at my old man one ChristmasI never dreamed that it would be his lastI wish mom had rung my neckWhen she caught me with those cigarettesWhich reminds me, I'm down to my last packIf I had a dimeFor half the things I didThat didn't make no sense at allI'd be living a little higher on the hogIf only I'd have knownThat later on down the roadI'd look back and not like what I seeI'd have changed a lot of thingsStartin' with meI called my brother everything I could think ofThe night he wouldn't bail me out of jailI lost a job most folks 'round here would die forBy laying out all night and raising hellAnd I let a woman that I love slip through my fingersChalk another dumb move up to my foolish prideI wasn't there standin' by the bedWhen the preacher bowed his headWith the family the day my grandma diedIf I had a dimeFor half the things I didThat didn't make no sense at allI'd be living a little higher on the hogIf only I'd have knownThat later on down the roadI'd look back and not like what I seeI'd have changed a lot of thingsStartin' with me
