Here we are still togetherWe areSo much time wastedPlaying games with loveSo many tears I've criedSo much pain insideBut baby it ain't over 'til it's overSo many years we've triedTo keep our love aliveBut baby it ain't over 'til it's overHow many timesDid we give upBut we always worked things outAnd all my doubts and fearKept me wonderingIf I'd always, always be in loveSo many tears I've criedSo much pain insideBut baby it ain't over 'til it's overSo many years we've triedAnd kept our love alive'Cause baby it ain't over 'til it's overSo many tears I've criedSo much pain insideBaby it ain't over 'til it's overSo many years we've triedAnd kept our love alive'Cause baby it ain't over 'til it's overSo many tears I've criedSo much pain insideBaby it ain't over 'til it's overSo many years we've triedto keep our love alive'Cause baby it ain't over 'til it's overSo many tears we've criedSo much pain insideBut baby it ain't over 'til it's overSo many years we've triedto keep our love alive'Cause baby it ain't over 'til it's overSo many tears we've criedSo much pain insideBut baby it ain't over 'til it's over, over
