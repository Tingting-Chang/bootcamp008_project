Sittin' in the rainWater on your brainGot a hole in your boatTrying to stay afloatHas got you downI've got a wind in my sailRubber boots and a pailI'll throw you a lineRest assured that IWon't ever let you drown[Chorus]Cause when you're up against the wallYou know I'll be here for you, for youWhen you rise and when you fallI'll always be here for you, for youWhen the plans you makeFall through and take youFor a loopOr some bird has flown the coopAnd left you strandedJust lean on meAnd together you seeWe'll carry the loadEven if we don'tQuite understand it[Chorus:Repeat x2]
