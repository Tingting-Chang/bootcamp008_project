I've been up all night longJust waitin' on the sunI've given up, damn the dawnIt ain't never gonna comeSomething's wrong, as long as you're goneI'm not gonna sleep til I touch your faceBaby not a wink I could go for daysIf you ever needed to see me down on my kneesTake a look at me, baby I can't sleepRemember when you said you wouldn't lastI couldn't swallow my prideWhoa it's sinkin' in, baby losin' you hasFinally opened my eyesI'm wide awake, as long as it takesI'm not gonna sleep til I touch your faceBaby not a wink I could go for daysIf you ever needed to see me down on my kneesTake a look at me, baby I can't sleep
