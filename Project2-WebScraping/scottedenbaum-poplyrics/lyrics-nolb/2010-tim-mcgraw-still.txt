There's a place I like to goWhere I can here the cotton growWhen that train whistle blowsA dozen miles down the roadAll I really have to do is just be stillThere's the place I love to beMomma daddy my sister & meFirst time I ever saw the beach back to 1983All I really have to do is just be stillWhen this world gets crazyAnd tries to break meAnd I had all I can standI can close my eyes no matter where I amAnd just be stillThere's a place that I can seeWhere my baby's next to meClose enough to feel the heatAll wound up beneath the sheetsAll I have to do is just be stillWhen this world gets crazyAnd tries to break meAnd I had all I can standI can close my eyesNo matter where I amAnd just be stillThere's a place I need to goWhere the stain glass windows flowEvery part of me is knownThank god I can go thereThank god I can go there stillThank god I can go there still
