The snow glows white on the mountain tonightNot a footprint to be seen.A kingdom of isolation,and it looks like I'm the QueenThe wind is howling like this swirling storm insideCouldn't keep it in;Heaven knows I've triedDon't let them in,don't let them seeBe the good girl you always have to beConceal, don't feel,don't let them knowWell now they knowLet it go, let it goCan't hold it back anymoremeaning bylisaNC	this is such a very powerful song, especially when i begin to really discover what is the IT that i have to let go... let IT go... YOUR TRUE SELF! let your…	See allLet it go, let it goTurn away and slam the doorI don't carewhat they're going to sayLet the storm rage on.The cold never bothered me anywayIt's funny how some distanceMakes everything seem smallAnd the fears that once controlled meCan't get to me at allIt's time to see what I can doTo test the limits and break throughNo right, no wrong, no rules for me,I'm free!Let it go, let it goI am one with the wind and skyLet it go, let it goYou'll never see me cryHere I standAnd here I'll stayLet the storm rage onMy power flurries through the air into the groundMy soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all aroundAnd one thought crystallizes like an icy blastI'm never going back, the past is in the pastLet it go, let it goAnd I'll rise like the break of dawnLet it go, let it goThat perfect girl is goneHere I standIn the light of dayLet the storm rage onThe cold never bothered me anyway!
