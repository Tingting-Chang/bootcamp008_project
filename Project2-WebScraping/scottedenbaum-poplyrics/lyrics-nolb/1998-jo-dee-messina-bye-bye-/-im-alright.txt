We've been friends for a long long timeYou tell me your secrets and I tell you mineShe's left you all alone and you feel like no one caresBut I have never failed you I've always been thereYou tell your story it sounds a bit like mineIt's the same old situation it happens every timeCan't we see oh maybe you and meIs what's meant to beOr do we disagreeWhat if I told you (what if I said)That I loved youHow would you feelWhat would you thinkWhat would we doDo we dare cross that lineBetween your heart and mineOr would I lose a friendOr find a love that would never endWhat if I saidShe doesn't love youOh it's plain to seeI can read between the lines of what your telling meAnd he doesn't hold you the way a woman should be heldHow long can I go on keeping these feelings to myselfWhat if I told you -(what if I said)That I loved youHow would you feelWhat would you thinkWhat would we doDo we dare cross that lineBetween your heart and mineOr would I lose a friendOr find a love that would never endWhat if I saidOh we've both had our share of lonelinessSo who's to say we can't have a little happinessAnd if I found that in youIt would make my dreams come trueOr would you walk awayHear what I have to sayWhat if I told you -(what if I said)That I loved youHow would you feelWhat would you thinkWhat would we doOh do we dare cross that lineBetween your heart and mineI've always wonderedFrom that day that we metWhat if I saidWhat if I saidOhWhat if I said
