She's like the wind through my treeShe rides the night next to meShe leads me through moonlightOnly to burn me with the sunShe's taken my heartBut she doesn't know what she's doneI feel her breath on my faceHer body close to meCan't look in her eyesShe's out of my leagueJust a fool to believeI have anything she needsShe's like the windI look in the mirror and all I seeIs a young old man with only a dreamAm I just fooling myselfThat she'll stop the painLiving without herI'd go insaneI feel her breath on my faceHer body close to meCan't look in her eyesShe's out of my leagueJust a fool to believeI have anything she needsShe's like the windI feel your breath on my faceYour body close to meCan't look in your eyesYou're out of my leagueJust a fool to believe(Just a fool to believe)She's like the wind(Just a fool to believe)Just a fool to believe(She's like the wind)Just a fool to believe(Just a fool to believe)She's like the wind(Just a fool to believe)Just a fool to believeShe's like the windJust a foolShe's like the windShe's like the windJust a foolShe's like the windJust a fool
