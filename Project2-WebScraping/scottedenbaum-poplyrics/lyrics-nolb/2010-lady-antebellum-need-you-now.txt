Picture perfect memories,Scattered all around the floor,Reaching for the phone cause, I can't fight it any moreAnd I wonder if I ever cross your mindFor me it happens all the timeIt's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you nowSaid I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you nowAnd I don't know how I can do without, I just need you nowAnother shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the doorWishing you'd come sweepin' in the way you did beforeAnd I wonder if I ever cross your mindFor me it happens all the timeIt's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk, and I need you nowSaid I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you nowAnd I don't know how I can do without, I just need you nowGuess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at allIt's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you nowAnd I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you nowAnd I don't know how I can do without, I just need you nowI just need you nowOh baby I need you now
