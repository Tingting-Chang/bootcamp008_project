You know I'm a dreamerBut my heart's of goldI had to run away highSo I wouldn't come home lowJust when things went rightIt doesn't mean they were always wrongJust take this song and you'll never feelLeft all aloneTake me to your heartFeel me in your bonesJust one more nightAnd I'm comin' off thisLong and winding roadI'm on my wayI'm on my wayHome sweet homeTonight tonightI'm on my wayI'm on my wayHome sweet homeYou know that I've seenToo many romantic dreamsUp in lights, fallin' offThe silver screenMy heart's like an open bookFor the whole world to readSometimes nothing keeps me togetherAt the seamsI'm on my wayI'm on my wayHome sweet homeTonight tonightI'm on my wayJust set me freeHome sweet homeHome sweet homeHome sweet homeHome sweet homeI'm on my wayI'm on my wayHome sweet homeYeah yeahI'm on my wayJust set me freeHome sweet home
