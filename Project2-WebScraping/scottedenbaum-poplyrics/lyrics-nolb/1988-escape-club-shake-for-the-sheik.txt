All around the big bad worldOn the CIA machineTen, ten, the President's menIn a big black limousineThere's an ICBM flying byGet down and get to workHigh, high, we're high and dryAnd dancing in the dirt[Chorus:]Gonna shake for the sheikTill I feel my body breakI've got reds in the bedHear them dancing in my headGonna shake for the sheikTill I feel my body breakI got the blues, bad newsMy heart's dropped downTo my shoes, yeah, yeahShakeFrom the holy temples of BeruitTo the factories of JapanYou gotta shine your shoes and hide your lootAnd get rich while you canThere's a redneck knocking at my doorWith bibles and grenadesCan I fight him for a one man warIn bad black mirror shades[Repeat Chorus]Shake, shakeFat cats, big ass ratsJumping to the beatBlack, black oil and crackIn a big black limousine[Repeat Chorus 2x]Shake, yeah, yeahShake, shakeShake, s-s-s-shakeShakeS-s-s-shake, shakeShake, s-s-s-shake...
