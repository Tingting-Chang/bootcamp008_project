I gave you all I hadI gave you good and badI gave but you just threw it backI won't get on my kneesDon't make me do that pleaseI've been away but now I'm backDon't be too sure of thatWhat makes you sure of thatYou went away, you can't come backI walked away from youI hurt you through and throughAw honey give me one more chanceAw you're a lucky sonLucky son of a gunYou went away, you went awayYou went away but now your backI got down on my kneesAnd then I begged you pleaseI always knew you'd take me back
