I tried to find you at the bottom of a bottleLaying down on the bathroom floorMy loneliness was a rattle in the windowsYou said you don't want me anymoreAnd you left meStanding on a corner crying,Feeling like a fool for tryingI don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on youI wish I could erase our memory'Cause you didn't give a damn about meOh, finally I'm throughWasting all these tears on youThese tears on youYou ain't worth another sleepless nightAnd I'll do everything I gotta do to get you off my mind'Cause what you wanted I couldn't getWhat you did, boy I'll never forgetAnd you left meStanding on a corner cryingFeeling like a fool for tryingI don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on youI wish I could erase our memory'Cause you didn't give a damn about meOh, finally I'm throughWasting all these tears on youThese tears on youAnd you left meStanding on a corner cryingFeeling like a fool for tryingI don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on youI wish I could erase our memory'Cause you didn't give a damn about meOh, finally I'm throughWasting all these tears on youThese tears on youI tried to find you at the bottom of a bottleLaying down on the bathroom floor
