She left her boots she wears in the rainShe left her lady razorShe left a note that I can't explainOn the refrigeratorShe left a book she's been reading for daysBeside her chest of drawersShe left her nightgown hangingBehind the bathroom doorBut she left me no choice as far as I can tellWhen it comes to getting over herShe didn't leave me a chance in hellLike a snowball in El PasoLike a feather in the windWithout a prayer I'll ever find someone like her againA fast train is comin'And my heart's a penny on the railNo she didn't leave me a chance in hellShe left me wondering what I'm gonna doWith all these pieces left of meShe left her scent all over the roomSo even in the dark I'd seeShe left a thirsty man with no water in the wellAnd without a single storm cloud overheadShe didn't leave me a chance in hellLike a snowball in El PasoLike a feather in the windWithout a prayer I'll ever find someone like her againA fast train is comin'And my heart's a penny on the railNo she didn't leave me a chance in hell
