I have felt itAnd I have held itI have knownA woman's loveI have tastedAnd I have wastedA woman's loveAnd I knowI'll never understandAll the little thingsthat make It grandA woman's loveAnd I knowI'll never come Face to faceWith any thingthat takes the PlaceOf a woman's loveWell I have kiss itTried to resist itI have missedA woman's loveAnd I have hatedTaken for grantedA woman's loveWell I have neededAnd I have pleadedAnd I have lostA woman's loveAnd I have worshippedAnd I have cursed itA woman's loveWell I adore itThank god for itA woman's love
