Knock down the doors and break through the wallsTear out the phone run from it allI'm here to tell ya babeIt's been one of those daysI get a feelin' when I'm feelin' like thisMy heart's a target you never missYou got a way of puttin' everything in its placeTakin' your timeIt's all that you're sayin' just how you say itA serious game you start to playin'You never cease to amaze me.[Chorus]It's your voice I hear drivin' me wildWhispering in my earIt's your voice I hear dangerous childYou're sayin' what I want to hearIf I had my choice I'd run for coverBut I think It'll be OK'Cause all I needed to hearWas the sound of your voiceCurl your words up into the air run your poetry through my hairCall me that name you call me when there's no one aroundTake your time take all your precious timeIt's all that ya sayin' just how you say itSerious game you start to playin' you never fail to amaze.[Chorus]Bye baby bye byeI can tell ya that I miss the sound of your voice alreadyBye baby bye byeIt doesn't matter where I goIt's your voice I hearIf I had my choice I'd run for coverBut I think I'll be OKI can't say I'm going crazyBut you make a pretty good caseAnd you never fail to amazeIt's your voice I hear drivin' me wildWhispering in my earIt's your voice I hear dangerous childYou're sayin' what I want to hearIt's your voice I hear drivin' me wildWhispering in my earIt's your voice I hear dangerous childYou're sayin' what I want to hearIt's your voice It's your voiceIt's your voice
