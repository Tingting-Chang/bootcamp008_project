Must not have been paying attentionI stepped right on in itDidn't even notice how deep I wasI went from the ground to the top of the cloudAnd now as I look down I see where I fell into your armsNow I got love all over meBaby, you touch every part of meI got love all over meAnd I don't want to get it offI'm completely covered up in your loveEven my skin is changingI'm feeling warmerNo more icy blue hearts for meYou put the color back in my lifeAnd now where there was black and white I'm becoming iridescentI got love all over meBaby, you touch every part of meI got love all over meAnd I don't want to get it offI'm completely covered up in your loveBefore your love, baby, I was blindedTo think we painted--you took it from meYou showered me with a new beginningNow I'm cleanTook me by surprise when you ran up on meI came to life, baby, in that momentYou put your hands on my heart, babyNow it beatsNow I got love all over meBaby, you touch every part of meI got love all over meAnd I don't want to get it offI'm completely covered up in your loveIn your loveIn your loveAnd I don't want to get it offI'm completely covered in your loveIIn your love
