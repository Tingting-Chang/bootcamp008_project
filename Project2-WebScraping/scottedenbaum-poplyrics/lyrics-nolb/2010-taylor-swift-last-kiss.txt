I still remember the look on your faceLit through the darkness at 1:58The words that you whisperedFor just us to knowYou told me you loved meSo why did you goAwayAwayI do recall nowThe smell of the rainFresh on the pavementI ran off the planeThat July ninthThe beat of your heartIt jumps through your shirtI can still feel your armsBut now I'll go sit on the floorWearing your clothesAll that I know isI don't know how to be something you missedNever thought we'd have a last kissNever imagined we'd end like thisYour name, forever the name on my lipsI do rememberThe swing in your stepThe life of the party, you're showing off againAnd I roll my eyes and thenYou pull me inI'm not much for dancingBut for you I didBecause I love your handshakeMeetin' my fatherI love how you walk with your hands in your pocketsHow you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying somethingThere's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptionsAnd I'll go sit on the floorWearing your clothesAll that I know is thatI don't know how to be something you missNever thought we'd have a last kissNever imagined we'd end like thisYour name, forever the name on my lipsSo I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleepAnd I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breatheAnd I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you areHope it's nice where you areAnd I hope the sun shinesAnd it's a beautiful dayAnd something reminds youYou wish you had stayedYou can plan for a change in weather and timeBut I never planned on you changing your mindSo I'll go sit on the floorWearing your clothesAll that I know is thatI don't know how to be something you missNever thought we'd have a last kissNever imagined we'd end like thisYour name, forever the name on my lipsJust like our last kissForever the name on my lipsForever the name on my lipsJust like our last
