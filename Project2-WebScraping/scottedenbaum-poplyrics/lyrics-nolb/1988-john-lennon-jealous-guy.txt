I was dreaming of the pastAnd my heart was beating fastI began to lose controlI began to lose controlI didn't mean to hurt youI'm sorry that I made you cryOh my I didn't want to hurt youI'm just a jealous guyI was feeling insecureYou might not love me anymoreI was shivering insideI was shivering insideOh I didn't mean to hurt youI'm sorry that I made you cryOh my I didn't want to hurt youI'm just a jealous guyI didn't mean to hurt youI'm sorry that I made you cryOh my I didn't want to hurt youI'm just a jealous guyI was trying to catch your eyesThought that you was trying to hideI was swallowing my painI was swallowing my painI didn't mean to hurt youI'm sorry that I made you cryOh no I didn't want to hurt youI'm just a jealous guyWatch out baby I'm just a jealous guyLook out baby I'm just a jealous guy
