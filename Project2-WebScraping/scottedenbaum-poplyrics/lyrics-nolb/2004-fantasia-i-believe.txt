Have you ever you ever reached a rainbow's endAnd did you find your pot of goldEver catch a shooting star andTell me how high did you soarEver felt like you were dreamingJust to find that you're awakeAnd the magic that surrounds youCan lift you up and guide you on your wayI can see it in the stars across the skyDreamt a hundred thousand dreams beforeNow I finally realize youSee I've waited all my life for this moment to arriveAnd finally I believeWhen you look out in a distanceYou'll see it never was that far oh noHeaven knows your existenceAnd wants you to be everthing you are ohThere's a time for every soul to flyIt's in the eyes of every childIt's the hope, the love that saves the worldAnd ohhh we should never let it goI can see it in the stars across the skyDreamt a hundred thousand dreams beforeNow I finally realizeSee I've waited all my life for this moment to arriveAnd finally yeahI believe in the impossibleIf I reach deep within my heartOvercome any obstacleWon't let this dream fall apartSee I strive to be the very bestShine my light for all to see'Cause anything is possibleWhen you believe yeahI can see it in the stars up in the skyDreamt a hundred thousand dreams beforeNow I finally realizeI've waited all my life for this moment to arriveAnd finally I believeYes I believeOhh YeahLove keeps lifting me higherLiftin me higherLove keeps lifting me higherI said love keeps liftenLove keeps lifting meI said Love keeps liftenLove keeps lifting me higherSaid love keeps liften me higherI said love keeps lifting me high
