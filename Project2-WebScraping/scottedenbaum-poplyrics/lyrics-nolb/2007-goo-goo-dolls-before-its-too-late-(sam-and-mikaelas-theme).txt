I wandered through fiction to look for the truthBuried beneath all the liesAnd I stood at a distance to feel who you areHiding myself in your eyesAnd hold on before it's too lateWe'll run 'til we leave this behindDon't fall, just be who you areIt's all that we need in our livesAnd the risk that might break youIs the one that would saveA life you don't live is still lostSo stand on the edge with meHold back your fear and seeNothing is real 'til it's goneAnd hold on before it's too lateWe'll run 'til we leave this behindDon't fall, just be who you areIt's all that we need in our livesSo live like you mean itLove 'til you feel itIt's all that we need in our livesSo stand on the edge with meHold back your fear and seeNothing is real 'til it's goneHold on before it's too lateWe'll run 'til we leave this behindDon't fall, just be who you areIt's all that we need in our livesAnd hold on before it's too lateWe'll run 'til we leave this behindDon't fall, just be who you areIt's all that we need in our livesIt's all that we need in our livesIt's all that I need in my life
