No one knows what it's likeTo be the bad manTo be the sad manBehind blue eyesAnd no one knows what it's likeTo be hatedTo be faded to telling only liesBut my dreams they aren't as emptyAs my conscience seems to beI have hours, only lonelyMy love is vengeanceThat's never freeNo one knows what its likeTo feel these feelingsLike I do, and I blame you!No one bites back as hardOn their angerNone of my pain woeCan show throughBut my dreams they aren't as emptyAs my conscience seems to beI have hours, only lonelyMy love is vengeanceThat's never freeNo one knows what its likeTo be mistreated, to be defeatedBehind blue eyesNo one know how to sayThat they're sorry and don't worryI'm not telling liesBut my dreams they aren't as emptyAs my conscience seems to beI have hours, only lonelyMy love is vengeanceThat's never freeNo one knows what its likeTo be the bad man, to be the sad manBehind blue eyesIn the cloudsAll the gravesI'll stay if youGo awayConcreteTall as the skyMovement passi'n me byWhen you blushWhat a rushReminisceCold crushNext door ear to the wallAll the tension on me for the callI wish I wishI wish it was all that easyI wish I wishI wish it was all that easy
