Can't count the years on one hand that we've been togetherI need the other one to hold youMake you feel, make you feel betterIt's not a walk in the park to love each otherBut when our fingers interlock, can't deny, can't deny, you're the worth it'Cause after all this timeI'm still into youI should be over all the butterflies but I'm into you, I'm into youAnd even baby our worst nightsI'm into you, I'm into youLet 'em wonder how we got this far,'Cause I don't really need to wonder at allYeah, after all this timeI'm still into youRecount the night that I first met your motherAnd on the drive back to my house I told you that, I told you that I loved yaYou felt the weight of the world fall off the shoulderAnd to your favorite song we sang along, to the start of foreverAnd after all this timeI'm still into youI should be over all the butterflies but I'm into you, I'm into youAnd even baby our worst nightsI'm into you, I'm into youLet 'em wonder how we got this far,'Cause I don't really need to wonder at allYeah after all this timeI'm still into youSome things just, some things just make senseAnd one of those is you and ISome things just, some things just make senseAnd even after all this timeI'm into youBaby not a day goes by that I'm not into youI should be over all the butterflies but I'm into you, I'm into youAnd even baby our worst nightsI'm into you, I'm into youLet 'em wonder how we got this far,'Cause I don't really need to wonder at allYeah after all this timeI'm still into youI'm still into youI'm still into you
