(Come with me tonight)Let's blow out these city lightsLet's just leave it all behindGet up where the air is stillYou can hear the whippoorwillStart a fire pass the shineWont be home 'til mornin' timeShout your name out in the windConfess my love for you againGive you all I got to giveThat's how we live up on the ridgeWon't you come with me tonightWhere the moonlight drifts into your eyesYeah, I just want one little kissWhen we get high up on the ridgeHey now honey child we'd be runnin' free and wildNo one care what you doAin't no law to answer toDance around in the dirtListen to them crickets chirpHear old Jake start to howlWhen he hears that ol' hoot owlGive you all I got to giveThat's how we live up on the ridgeWon't you come with me tonightWhere the moonlight drifts into your eyesYeah, I just want one little kissWhen we get high up on the ridgeCome on girl it's almost dawnLets get it 'fore the magic goneTall tall grass all aroundCome on lay that blanket downWild flowers just like youLay on me like mornin' dewNow take my hand walk with meSun come up through them treesGive you all I got to giveThat's how we live up on the ridgeWon't you come with me tonightWhere the moonlight drifts into your eyesYeah, I just want one little kissWhen we get high up on the ridgeI just want one little kissWhen we get high up on the ridge(Three, four)
