Thrift shop pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautiousSomewhere between like rocky and Cosby sweater gang nope nope yall cant copyYup. Bad, moon walking, this here, is our party, my posse's been on Broadway,And we did it, our way.Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to itAnd yet Im on.Let that stage light go and shine on down, got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style.Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds,But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my townTrust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustlin',Chasing dreams since I was 14 with the four track bussing halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushingLabels out here,Now they cant tell me nothingWe give that to the people,Spread it across the countryLabels out here,Now they cant tell me nothingWe give it to the people,Spread it across the countryHere we go back, this is the momentTonight is the night, well fight till its overSo we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold usLike the ceiling cant hold usHere we go back, this is the momentTonight is the night, well fight till its overSo we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold usLike the ceiling cant hold usNow, can I kick it?
