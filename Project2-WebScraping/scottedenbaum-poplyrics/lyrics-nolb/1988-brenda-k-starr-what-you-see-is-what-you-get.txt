How can I explainWhen there are few words I can chooseHow can I explainWhen words get brokenDo you rememberThere was a time ahahaWhen people on the streetWe're walking hand in hand in handThey used to talk about the weatherMaking plans togetherDays would last foreverCome to me, cover me, hold meTogether we'll break these chains of loveDon't give up, don't give upTogether with me and my babyBreak the chains of loveDo you rememberOnce upon a time ahahaWhen there were open doorsAn invitation to the worldWe were falling in and out with loversLooking out for othersOur sisters and our brothersCome to me, cover me, hold meTogether we'll break these chains of loveDon't give up, don't give up nowTogether with me and my babyBreak the chains of loveTogether we'll break these chains of loveHow can I explainWhen there are few words I can chooseHow can I explainWhen words get brokenThey used to talk about the weatherMaking plans togetherDays would last forever
