Sometimes I feel so alone, babyI call your heart but there's no one at homeIt's taken it's toll on my pride, rightI'm reaching out but no one in sightYou know it doesn't feel rightWhen I look in your eyesI know love is blind, but the heart doesn't lieI'll ask one more time, babyThis time you'll trySo tell me girl what's deep in your heartYeahChorus:Girl I care about youI'm there for youSo why don't you care for me, like I care about youooh girlGirl I care about youI'm there for youSo why don't you care for me babyLike I care about youI spend like all of my days, babyTrying to sus out just how things got this wayI thought that we were in love, whoaBut I swear right now, I don't know what you want babyI make sure that I give you quality timeBut lately I feel you're not home by designBut still I gonna try to give you the love of my lifeIn hopes that you, that you will open up your eyesChorus
