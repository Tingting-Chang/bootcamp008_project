Midnight, gettin' uptight. Where are you?You said you'd meet me, now it's quarter to twoI know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' you.Hey, Jack, It's a fact they're talkin' in town.I turn my back and you're messin' around.I'm not really jealous, don't like lookin' like a clown.I think of you every night and day.You took my heart, then you took my pride away.I hate myself for loving you.Can't break free from the the things that you do.I want to walk but I run back to you, that's whyI hate myself for loving you.Daylight, spent the night without you.But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do.I won't be as angry 'bout the hell you put me through.Hey, man, bet you can treat me right.You just don't know what you was missin' last night.I want to see your face and say forget it just from spite.I hate myself for loving you .Can't break free from the the things that you do.I want to walk but I run back to you, that's whyI hate myself for loving you.I hate myself for loving you.Can't break free from the things that you do.I want to walk but I run back to you, that's whyI hate myself for loving you.I think of you every night and day.You took my heart, then you took my pride away.I hate myself for loving you.Can't break free from the the things that you do.I want to walk but I run back to you, that's whyI hate myself for loving you.I hate myself for loving you.I hate myself for loving you.
