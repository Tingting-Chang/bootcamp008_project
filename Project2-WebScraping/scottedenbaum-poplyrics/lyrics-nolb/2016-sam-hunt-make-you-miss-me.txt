You hear a new song, it's your favoritePretty soon you'll be changing the stationAnd all your old shoes are looking brand newThey wanna be worn but they never get the chance toHeavy into everythingReady for the next thingCatch a ride for a while then you're over itYou change your mind on itSoon as the shine's goneLike you always do, but you don't know it yet butWoah woahI ain't gonna be that easy to leaveWoah woahGirl I'm gonna make you miss meMake you wish that you were sleeping in my shirtLie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yoursWhen your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's meGonna make you miss meYou're cold and hotYou burn out like a matchKeep a slim knot in the strings you attachYou think it's easy, but that's a lieThe only reason that you're good at goodbye isEvery boy you ever met, was too easy to forgetWell, I ain't going out like thatWoah woahI ain't gonna be that easy to leaveWoah woahGirl I'm gonna make you miss meMake you wish that you were sleeping in my shirtLie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yoursWhen your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's meI'm gonna make you miss me (yeah)Woah woahI ain't gonna be that easy to leaveWoah woahGirl I'm gonna make you miss meWriting letters that you're never gonna mailStay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails'Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishing you were with meI'm gonna make you miss meMake you miss meMake you miss the way my hand fit in your handWhen you're dialing my number listening to my favorite bandsI'll say, hey baby you know all you can sayIs come and get meI'm gonna make you miss me (miss me)I'm gonna make you miss meAnd oh oh ohI'm gonna make you miss me
