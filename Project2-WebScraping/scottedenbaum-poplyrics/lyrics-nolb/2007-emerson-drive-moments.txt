I was coming to the end of a long, long walkWhen a man crawled out of a cardboard boxUnder the E. Street BridgeFollowed me on to itI went out halfway acrossWith that homeless shadow tagging alongSo I dug for some changeWouldn't need it anywayHe took it lookin' just a bit ashamedHe said, 'you know, I haven't always been this way.'I've had my moments, days in the sunMoments I was second to noneMoments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't doLike that plane ride coming home from the warThat summer my son was bornAnd memories like a coat so warmA cold wind can't get throughLookin' at me now, you might not know itBut I've had my momentsI stood there tryin' to find my nerveWondering if a single soul on earthWould care at allMiss me when I'm goneThat old man just kept hanging aroundLookin' at me, lookin' downI think he recognizedThat look in my eyesStanding with him there, I felt ashamedI said, 'you know, I haven't always been this way.'I've had my moments, days in the sunMoments I was second to noneMoments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't doLike the day I walked away from the wineFor a woman who became my wifeAnd a love that, when it was rightCould always see me throughLookin' at me now, you might not know itBut I've had my momentsI know somewhere 'round a trashcan fire tonightThat old man tells his story one more timeHe saysI've had my moments, days in the sunMoments I was second to noneMoments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't doLike that cool night on the E. Street BridgeWhen a young man almost ended itI was right there, wasn't scared a bitAnd I helped to pull him throughLookin' at me now, you might not know itOh, lookin' at me now, you might not know itBut I've had my moments, I've had my moments, I've had my moments, I've had my moments
