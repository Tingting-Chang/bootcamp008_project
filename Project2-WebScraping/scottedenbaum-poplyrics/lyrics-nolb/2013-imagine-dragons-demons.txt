When the days are coldAnd the cards all foldAnd the saints we seeAre all made of goldWhen your dreams all failAnd the ones we hailAre the worst of allAnd the blood's run staleI wanna hide the truthI wanna shelter youBut with the beast insideThere's nowhere we can hideNo matter what we breedWe still are made of greedThis is my kingdom comeThis is my kingdom comeWhen you feel my heatLook into my eyesIt's where my demons hideIt's where my demons hideDon't get too closeIt's dark insideIt's where my demons hideIt's where my demons hideAt the curtains callIt's the last of allWhen the lights fade outAll the sinners crawlSo they dug your graveAnd the masqueradeWill come calling outAt the mess you've madeDon't wanna let you downBut I am, hell boundThough this is all for youDon't wanna hide the truthNo matter what we breedWe still are made of greedThis is my kingdom comeThis is my kingdom comeWhen you feel my heatLook into my eyesIt's where my demons hideIt's where my demons hideDon't get too closeIt's dark insideIt's where my demons hideIt's where my demons hideThey say it's what you makeI say it's up to fateIt's woven in my soulI need to let you goYour eyes, they shine so brightI wanna save that lightI can't escape this nowUnless you show me howWhen you feel my heatLook into my eyesIt's where my demons hideIt's where my demons hideDon't get too closeIt's dark insideIt's where my demons hideIt's where my demons hide
