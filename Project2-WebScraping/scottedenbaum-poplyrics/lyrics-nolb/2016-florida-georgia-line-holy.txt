When the sun had left and the winter cameAnd the sky fall could only bring the rainI sat in darkness, all broken heartedI couldn't find a day I didn't feel aloneI never meant to cry, started losing hopeBut somehow baby, you broke through and saved meYou're an angel, tell me you're never leaving'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe inYou're holy, holy, holy, holyI'm high on loving you, high on loving youYou're holy, holy, holy, holyI'm high on loving you, high on loving youYou made the brightest days from the darkest nightsYou're the river bank where I was baptizedCleanse all the demonsThat were killing my freedomLet me lay you down, give me to yaGet you singing babe, hallelujahWe'll be touching, we'll be touching heavenYou're an angel, tell me you're never leaving'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe inYou're holy, holy, holy, holyI'm high on loving you, high on loving youYou're holy, holy, holy, holyI'm high on loving you, high on loving youI don't need the stars 'cause you shine for meLike fire in my veins, you're my ecstasyYou're my ecstasyYou're holy, holy, holy, holyI'm high on loving you, high on loving youYou're holy, holy, holy, holyI'm high on loving you, high on loving youYou're the healing hands where it used to hurtYou're my saving grace, you're my kind of churchYou're holy
