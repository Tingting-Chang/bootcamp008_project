Nothing lived, nothing grewTill I loved youEvery sky ever gray, never blueYou were my friend, good friendAnd sometimes I would wonderCould the one to save mePossibly be you?I was lost, I was blindTill I loved youWouldn't see, couldn't find someone newYou were my friend, dear friendI held you close to my heartBut I never thought that I'd feel the way I doUntil that certain moment when I loved youAnd now I can't ever imagineMy living without youIt seems I spend all of my timeThinking only about youOnce I dreamed in a dream I would find youNever thought that the dream would come trueUntil that curtain lifted, parted, drifted from youUntil that certain moment when I loved youUntil that certain momentCertain moment when I loved youWhen I loved youNothing lived, nothing grewTill I loved youEvery sky ever gray, never blueEmpty days, empty nightsSometimes I wonderCould the one to save me possibly be you?Ooooohh I was lost, I was blind till I found youCouldn't see, couldn't find someone newYou came along, stole my heart completelyAnd I thought, could the one to save me possibly be you?
