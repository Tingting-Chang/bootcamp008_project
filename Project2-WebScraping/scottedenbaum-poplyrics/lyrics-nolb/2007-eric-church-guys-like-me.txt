I wear a greasy ball capI like my shirt un-tuckedI spend Saturdays working on my truckI don't like to fightBut I ain't scared to bleedMost don't mess with a guy like me'Cause guys like me drink too many beers on Friday after workOur best blue jeans have Skoal ringsWe wear our boots to churchSo rough around the edgesIt's hard to believe that girls like youLove guys like meYour daddy worked at the bankMine worked on carsYou went to collegeI pulled graveyardYou must have had your pickOf all the trust fund typesBut you came back to me and only God knows why'Cause guys like me drink too many beers on Friday after workOur best blue jeans have Skoal ringsWe wear our boots to churchSo rough around the edgesIt's hard to believe that girls like youLove guys like meNow there's a lot of guys like me out thereIn a lot of little townsAnd tellin' all our buddies we won't ever settle downWe say that's just the way we are, and the way we'll always beSo God sends girls like you for guys like meThank God there's girls like you for guys like me
