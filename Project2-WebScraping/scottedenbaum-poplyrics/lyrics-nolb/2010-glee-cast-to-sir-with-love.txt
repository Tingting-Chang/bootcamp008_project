Those school girl daysOf telling tales and biting nails are goneBut in my mind I know they still live on and onBut how do you thank someoneWho was taken you from crayons to perfumeIt isn't easy but I'll tryIf you wanted the skyI'd write across the sky in lettersThat would soar a thousand feet highTo sir with loveThe time has comeFor closing books and long last looks must endAnd as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friendA friend who taught me right from wrongAnd weak from strong that's a lot to learnWhat can I give you in returnIf you wanted the moonI would try to make a start but IWould rather let me give you my heartTo sir with love
