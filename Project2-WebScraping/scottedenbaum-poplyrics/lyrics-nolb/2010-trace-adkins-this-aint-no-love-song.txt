Well my heart didn't skip a beatWhen I saw you standing thereLooking like some kind of angelLike you were walking on airAnd the earth didn't moveWhen you first said my nameI didn't feel a thing, no not me,My heart didn't skip a beatThis ain't no love songI just felt getting my guitar on and singing a tuneSinging about you yeahFeeling good and tapping my shoesAnd all this stuff I'm making up well you probablyWon't be hearing it on the radio but then you never knowSo baby if you wantYou can sing alongBut this ain't no love songI couldn't sleep last nightBut you weren't on my mindAnd I went for a drive last nightBut if you saw me driving byWell I must've took a wrong turnI must've been thinking bout something elseHad a melody in my head yeah maybe that's whyI couldn't sleep last nightThis ain't no love songI just felt like getting my guitar on and singing a tune,Singing bout you, feeling good and tapping my shoesAnd all this stuff I'm making up wellYou probably won't be hearing it on the radio but then you never knowSo baby if you want you can sing alongBut this ain't no love song, love song,Love song singing to you baby singing to you babyAll night longYeah half this stuff I'm making up wellYou probably won't be hearing it on the radioBut then you never knowSo baby if you want you can sing alongBut this ain't no love song, love song, love songThis ain't no love song
