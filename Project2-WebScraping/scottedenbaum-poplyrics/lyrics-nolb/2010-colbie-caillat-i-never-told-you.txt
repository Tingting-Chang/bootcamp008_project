I miss those blue eyesHow you kiss me at nightI miss the way we sleepLike there's no sunriseLike the taste of your smileI miss the way we breatheBut I never told youWhat I should have saidNo, I never told youI just held it inAnd now,I miss everything about youCan't believe that I still want youAnd after all the things we've been throughI miss everything about youWithout you, ohI see your blue eyesEvery time I close mineYou make it hard to seeWhere I belong toWhen I'm not around youIt's like I'm not with meBut I never told youWhat I should have saidNo, I never told youI just held it inAnd now,I miss everything about you (still you're gone)Can't believe that I still want you (loving you I should have never walked away)And after all the things we've been through (I know it's never going to come again)I miss everything about youWithout youBut I never told youWhat I should have saidNo, I never told youI just held it inAnd now,I miss everything about you (still you're gone)Can't believe that I still want you (loving you I should have never walked away)And after all the things we've been through (I know it's never going to come again)I miss everything about youWithout youOh oh oh oh ohMmm mmm mmm mmm
