Wake in a sweat againAnother day's been laid to wasteIn my disgraceStuck in my head againFeels like I'll never leave this placeThere's no escapeI'm my own worst enemyI've given upI'm sick of feelingIs there nothing you can say?Take this all awayI'm suffocating!Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me!I don't know what to takeThought I was focused, but I'm scaredI'm not preparedI hyperventilateLooking for help somehow, somewhereAnd no one caresI'm my own worst enemyI've given upI'm sick of feelingIs there nothing you can say?Take this all awayI'm suffocating!Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me!God!Put me out of my miseryPut me out of my miseryPut me out of my...Put me out of my fucking misery!I've given upI'm sick of feelingIs there nothing you can say?Take this all awayI'm suffocating!Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me!
