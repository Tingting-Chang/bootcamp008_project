(one, two)In our endeavor we are never seeing eye to eyeNo guts to sever so forever may we wave good-byeAnd you're always telling me that it's my turn to moveWhen I wonder what could make the needle jump the grooveI won't fall for the oldest trick in the bookSo don't sit there and think you're off of the hookBy saying there is no use changing'Cause that's just what you areThat's just what you areActing steady always ready to defend your fearsWhat's the matter with the truth did I offend your earsBy suggesting that a change might be a thing to tryLike it would kill you just to try and be a nicer guyIt's not like you would lose some critical pieceIf somehow you moved point A to point beMaintaining there is no point Changing'Cause that's just what you areThat's just what you areNow I could talk to you 'til I'm blue in the faceBut we still would arrive at the very same placeWith you running around and me out of the raceSo maybe you're right nobody can takeSomething older than time and hope you could makeIt better that would be a mistakeSo take it just so far'Cause that's just what you areThat's just what you areThat's just what you areActing steady always readyTo defend your fears(that's just what you are)What's the matter with the truthDid I offend your ears(that's just what you are)You're like a sleepwalking manIt's a danger to wake you(that's just what you are)Even when it is apparentWhere your actions will take you(that's just what you are)And that's just what you are(that's just what you are)And that's just what you are(that's just what you are)That's just what you are ?
