Somewhere over the rainbow way up high,There's a land that I dreamed of once in a lullabyHaaaaaiSomewhere over the rainbow skies are blueAnd the dreams that you dare to dream really do come trueUuuuuhOooh someday I'll wish upon a starAnd wake up where the clouds are far behind meWhere troubles melt like lemon dropsHigh above the chimney topsThat's where you'll find me.Oh somewhere over the rainbowBluebirds flyBirds fly over the rainbow.Why then, oh why can't I?
