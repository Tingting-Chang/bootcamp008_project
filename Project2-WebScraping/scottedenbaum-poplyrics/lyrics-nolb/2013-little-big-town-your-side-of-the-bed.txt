On your side of the bed, there's a picture of our wedding dayA clock that don't work and the bible that your daddy gaveIt's on the window side, where the moon creeps in at nightStaring at the ceiling, lying here all aloneI said a prayer for you, then I said one of my ownBut you don't reach for me, when you lie down quietlyTell me how, how'd you get so far away?All we have left, are the memories of the love we madeAre you sleeping with your own regret?On your side of the bedOn your side of the bed there's a burnt down candle flameA letter I've started but I didn't know what to sayNo I couldn't write it down, so I try to say it nowTell me how, how'd you get so far away?All we have left, are the memories of the love we madeAre you sleeping with your own regret?On your side of the bedAren't you even gonna make a sound?Your side of the bedTurn the other way when I turn the lights downYour side of the bedAre you lonely? Like I'm lonely?How, how'd you get so far away?All we have left are the memories of the love we madeAre you sleeping with your own regret?Tell me how, how'd you get so far away?All we have left, are the memories of the love we madeAre you sleeping with your own regret?On your side of the bedOn your side of the bedAre you still awake, on your side of the bed.
