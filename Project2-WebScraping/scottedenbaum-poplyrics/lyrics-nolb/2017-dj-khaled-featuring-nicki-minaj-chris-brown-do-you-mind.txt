I've been staring at the edge of the water'Long as I can remember, never really knowing whyI wish I could be the perfect daughterBut I come back to the water, no matter how hard I tryEvery turn I take, every trail I trackEvery path I make, every road leads backTo the place I know, where I can not go, where I long to beSee the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls meAnd no one knows, how far it goesIf the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind meOne day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll goI know everybody on this island, seems so happy on this islandEverything is by designI know everybody on this island has a role on this islandSo maybe I can roll with mineI can lead with pride, I can make us strongI'll be satisfied if I play alongBut the voice inside sings a different songWhat is wrong with me?See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blindingBut no one knows, how deep it goesAnd it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find meAnd let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
