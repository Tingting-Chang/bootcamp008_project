I wish I could take a cab down to the creekAnd hang a disco ball from an old oak treeSmoke and drink once in a whileSomehow it'd be good for meI want a cool chick that'll cook for meBut'll dance on the bar in her tan bare feetAnd do what I want when I want and she'll do it with meI don't need too much of nothingI just wanna sing a little chill songGet my groove onPour something strong down in my drinkOh, I know that I don't need a whole lot of anythingI just want a little bit of everything na na na na,Na na na naI just want a little bit of everything na na na na,Na na na naNow I don't need a garage full of carsBut I'll take a whole box of Cuban cigarsAnd I'll smoke 'em nice and slowLike they were good for meDon't need a ranch or a big piece of landBut I like to get a little bit of dirt on my handsA big ol' couch in a big ol' roomStill feels lonely when it's just you, yes it doesI don't need too much of nothingI just wanna sing a little chill songAnd get my groove onPour something strong down in my drinkOh, I know that I don't need a whole lot of anythingI just want a little bit of everything na na na na,Na na na naA little bit of everythingUnder the sunSo, when I kick back basking in itI'll be OK with what I've doneStill having funThat's right'Cause I don't need too much of nothingI just wanna sing a little chill songGet my groove onPour something strong down in my drinkOh, I know that I don't need a whole lot of anythingI just want a little bit of everything na na na na,Na na na naI just want a little bit of everything na na na na,Na na na naI just want a little bit of everythingYeah yea yeaWhoa, whoa, oh yeah
