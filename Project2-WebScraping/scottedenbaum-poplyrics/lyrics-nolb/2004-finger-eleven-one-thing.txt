Restless tonightCause I wasted the lightBetween both these timesI drew a really thin lineIt's nothing I plannedAnd not that I canBut you should be mineAcross that lineIf I traded it allIf I gave it all away for one thingJust for one thingIf I sorted it outIf I knew all about this one thingWouldn't that be somethingI promise I mightNot walk on byMaybe next timeBut not this timeEven though I knowI don't want to knowYeah I guess I knowI just hate how it soundsIf I traded it allIf I gave it all away for one thingJust for one thingIf I sorted it outIf I knew all about this one thingWouldn't that be somethingIf I traded it allIf I gave it all away for one thingJust for one thingIf I sorted it outIf I knew all about this one thingWouldn't that be somethingEven though I knowI don't want to knowYeah I guess I knowI just hate how it sounds
