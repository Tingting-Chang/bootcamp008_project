I'll have this feeling 'till the day that I dieWhen I hear my baby callingA simple motion, a look in her eyesAnd I'm helplessly fallingI'd give all of somebody elseFor any piece of her heart that's leftShe knows me better than I know myself[Chorus]Let me tell you 'bout the way she loves meOoh, I want the world to knowI'm crazy 'bout the way she loves meOoh, I'm proud to let it show, yeah, yeah, yeahCame close to letting this train pass me byJust like a fool second guessingI could've spent my life wondering whyI didn't cherish the blessingIf I'd have known she'd come my wayThe lonely nights would have been okayI have her promise that she's gonna stay[Chorus]Nobody else could do me rightA breath of heaven in my darkest nightI'm gonna hold on with all of my might[Chorus]
