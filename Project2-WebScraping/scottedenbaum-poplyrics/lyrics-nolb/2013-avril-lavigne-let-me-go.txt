Love that once hung on the wallUsed to mean something, but now it means nothingThe echoes are gone in the hallBut I still remember, the pain of DecemberOh, there isn't one thing left you could sayI'm sorry it's too lateI'm breaking free from these memoriesGotta let it go, just let it goI've said goodbyeSet it all on fireGotta let it go, just let it goYou came back to find I was goneAnd that place is empty, like the hole that was left in meLike we were nothing at allIt's not that you meant to meThought we were meant to beOh, there isn't one thing left you could sayI'm sorry it's too lateI'm breaking free from these memoriesGotta let it go, just let it goI've said goodbyeSet it all on fireGotta let it go, just let it goI let it go, and now I knowA brand new life, down this roadWhere it's right, you always knowSo this time, I won't let goThere's only one thing left here to sayLove's never too lateI've broken free from these memoriesI've let it go, I've let it goAnd two goodbyes, lend you this new lifeDon't let me go, don't let me goDon't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me goWon't let you go, don't let me goWon't let you go, don't let me goWon't let you go, don't let me goWon't let you go, don't let me go
