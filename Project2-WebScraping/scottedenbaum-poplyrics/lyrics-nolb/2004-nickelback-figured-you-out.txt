I like your pants around your feetAnd I like the dirt that's on your kneesAnd I like the way you still say please, while you're looking up at meYou're like my favorite damn diseaseAnd I love the places that we goAnd I love the people that you knowAnd I love the way you can't say "No" too many long lines in a rowI love the powder on your noseOuh, and now I know who you areIt wasn't that hardJust to figure you outNow I did, you wonder whyAnd now I know who you areIt wasn't that hardJust to figure you outNow I did, you wonder whyI like the freckles on your chestAnd I like the way you like me bestAnd I like the way you're not impressed, while you put me to the testI like the white stains on your dressAnd I love the way you pass the checkAnd I love the good times that you wreck (The good times that you wreck)And I love your lack of self respectWhile you're passed out on the deckI love my hands around your neckOuh and I know who you areIt wasn't that hardJust to figure you outNow I did, you wonder whyAnd I know who you areIt wasn't that hardJust to figure you outNow I did, you wonder whyWhy not before, you never triedGone for good, and this is itI like your pants around your feetAnd I like the dirt that's on your kneesAnd I like the way you still say please, while you're looking up at meYou're like my favorite damn diseaseAnd I hate the places that we goAnd I hate the people that you knowAnd I hate the way you can't say "No" too many long lines in a rowI hate the powder on your noseOuh and now I know who you areIt wasn't that hardJust to figure you outNow I did, you wonder whyAnd now I know who you areIt wasn't that hardJust to figure you outNow I did, you wonder whyWhy not before, you never triedGone for good, and this is itOoh
