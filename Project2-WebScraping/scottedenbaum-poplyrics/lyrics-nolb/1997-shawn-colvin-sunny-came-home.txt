Sunny came home to her favorite roomSunny sat down in the kitchenShe opened a book and a box of toolsSunny came home with a missionShe says days go by I'm hypnotizedI'm walking on a wireI close my eyes and fly out of my mindInto the fireSunny came home with a list of namesShe didn't believe in transcendenceIt's time for a few small repairs she saidSunny came home with a vengeanceShe says days go by I don't know whyI'm walking on a wireI close my eyes and fly out of my mindInto the fireGet the kids and bring a sweaterDry is good and wind is betterCount the years, you always knew itStrike a match, go on and do itOh days go by I'm hypnotizedI'm walking on a wireI close my eyes and fly out of my mindInto the fireOh light the sky and hold on tightThe world is burning downShe's out there on her own and she's alrightSunny came homeSunny came home
