In the dayIn the nightSay it rightSay it allYou either got itOr you don'tYou either stand or you fallWhen your will is brokenWhen it slips from your handWhen there's no time for jokingThere's a hole in the planOh you don't mean nothing at all to meNo you don't mean nothing at all to meBut you got what it takes to set me freeOh you could mean everything to meI can't say that, I'm not lost and at faultI can't say that, I don't love the light and the darkI can't say that, I don't know that I am aliveAnd all of what I feel I could showYou tonight you tonightOh you don't mean nothing at all to meNo you don't mean nothing at all to meBut you got what it takes to set me freeOh you could mean everything to me
