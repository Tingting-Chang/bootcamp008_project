I had two jobs, I had dishwater handsAnd on the weekend in a rock 'n' roll bandOne Friday night in my hometown barIn walked a girl who looked like a movie starShe stared at me and it was turning me onShe said she worked in a beauty salonI heard a voice inside me sayShe ain't pretty, she just looks that wayWe made a date to go for a drinkI wore my jeans and she wore a minkThere was this misconception all over townThat she ate lonely guy heart by the poundShe said "Take me home, there won't be no fuss"I said "Sure you got some change for the bus"Watching her leave I heard the bartender say"She ain't pretty, she just looks that way"So, I called her up, her father was home"Son, she's busy she can't come to the phone"I held my breath then decided to waitA guy like me doesn't get many datesI fell in love with a model from hellIt took some time for my hormones to tellThat chasing her has been a grave mistakeShe ain't pretty, she just looks that wayHer ego wrote checks incredibly fastBut her personality didn't have the cashI laughed out loud to my total dismayShe ain't pretty, she just looks that wayShe ain't pretty, she just looks that wayShe ain't prettyShe ain't prettyShe ain't prettyShe ain't pretty, she just looks that way
