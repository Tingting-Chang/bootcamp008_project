Dreams are just dreamsWhen it's dark inside your headAnd all it takes is a little help from youYou know it's trueThat dreams are for realWhen you see what I seeAnd you feel it tooWe took the longest roadJust to make it harderLet's do it all againIt only makes us stronger[Chorus]DreamsI guess we're just made of dreamNothin' else mattersAs long as we believeI'm lookin' at youAnd I see my lifePassing before my eyesAnd when the journey's overAnd all my dreams come trueI'll dream of youWhat do you seeWhen you look inside your heartA little thoughtCan walk a thousand milesAnd change your lifeWhen dreams lead the wayThe impossible is suddenly in sightEvery step you takeJust brings it all togetherYou gotta keep the faithWhen all seems lost forever[Chorus]You're the oneThat keeps my hope aliveMy vision clearI'll spend my life with youConquer fearWe'll make it throughNothin' else mattersAs long as we believeI'm lookin' at youAnd I see my lifePassing before my eyesAnd when the journey's overAnd all my dreams come trueI'll dream of youI'll dream of youI'll dream of you
