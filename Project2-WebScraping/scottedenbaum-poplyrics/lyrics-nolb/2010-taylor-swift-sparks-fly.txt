The way you move is like a full on rainstormAnd I'm a house of cardsYou're the kind of reckless that should send me runningBut I kinda know that I won't get farAnd you stood there in front of me justClose enough to touchClose enough to hope you couldn't seeWhat I was thinking ofDrop everything nowMeet me in the pouring rainKiss me on the sidewalkTake away the pain'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smileGet me with those green eyes, babyAs the lights go downGimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around'Cause I see, sparks fly, when you smileMy mind forgets to remind me, your a bad ideaYou touch me once and it's really somethingYou find I'm even better than you, imagined I would beI'm on my guard for the rest of the worldBut with you I know its no goodAnd I could wait patientlyBut I really wish you wouldDrop everything nowMeet me in the pouring rainKiss me on the sidewalkTake away the pain'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smileGet me with those green eyes, babyAs the lights go downGimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smileI run my fingers through your hairAnd watch the lights go wildJust keep on keeping your eyes on meIts just wrong enough to make it feel rightAnd lead me up the staircaseWon't you whisper soft and slowAnd I'm captivated by you babyLike a fireworks showDrop everything nowMeet me in the pouring rainKiss me on the sidewalkTake away the pain'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smileGet me with those green eyes, babyAs the lights go downGimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smileWhen sparks fly oh baby smileWhen sparks fly
