You held my hand and walked me home,I knowWhile you gave me that kiss you were something like thisIt made me go ooh oohYou wiped my tears got rid of all my fearsWhy did you have to go?Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my loveGuys are so hard to trustDid I not tell you that I'm not like thatGirl, the one who gives it all away?Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time?Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do,and cry?Don't try to tell me what to doDon't try to tell me what to sayYou're better off that waymeaning bykeribelles	This song is about a girl who is so disapointed with her boyfriend because he wants to have sex with her. And she thinks that it's not time yet. She thought…	See allDon't think that your charm, and the fact that your armIs now around my neckWill get you in my pants I'll have to kick your assAnd make you never forgetI'm gonna ask you to stop thought I liked you a lotBut I'm really upset, really upsetGet outta my head, get off of my bedYeah that's what I saidDid I not tell you that I'm not like thatGirl, the one who throws it all away?Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time?Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do, and cry?Don't try to tell me what to doDon't try to tell me what to sayYou're better off that wayThis guilt trip that you put me on won't mess me upI've done no wrongAny thoughts of you and me have gone awayDid you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time?Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do, and cry?Don't try to tell me what to doDon't try to tell me what to sayYou're better off that wayBetter off that wayI'm better off alone anyway
