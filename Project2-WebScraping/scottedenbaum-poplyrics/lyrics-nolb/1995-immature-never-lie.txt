[Chorus:]I will never lie again (I will never lie again)'Cause you will always be my friendI will never I will never lie again'Cause a friend like youWill last foreverSitting in my windowThinking of youAll the fun things we use to doI feel the painPlease come back to me'Cause a friend like you will onlyCome once in a lifetime[Chorus]On the phone when you were hereLaughing and jokingCryin and sulkingIn my dreamsYour still with me'Cause a friend like you will onlyCome once in a lifetime[Chorus]When I think of youI think of someone specialAnd how it used to beI know, you'll always be my friendAnd I'm so sad it had to endOh yeah baby[Chorus x2]
