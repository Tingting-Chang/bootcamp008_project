When a man loves a womanCan't keep his mind on nothin' elseHe'd trade the worldFor a good thing he's foundIf she is bad, he can't see itShe can do no wrongTurn his back on his best friendIf he puts her downWhen a man loves a womanSpend his very last dimeTrying to hold on to what he needsHe'd give up all his comfortsAnd sleep out in the rainIf she said that's the wayIt ought to beWhen a man loves a womanI give you everything I've got (yeah)Trying to hold onTo your precious loveBaby please don't treat me badWhen a man loves a womanDeep down in his soulShe can bring him such miseryIf she is playing him for a foolHe's the last one to knowLoving eyes can never see
