I know I'm probably better off on my ownThan lovin' a man who didn't knowWhat he had when he had itAnd I see the permanent damage you did to meNever again, I just wish I could forget when it was magicI wish it wasn't four am, standing in the mirrorSaying to myself, you know you had to do it I knowThe bravest thing I ever did was runSometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you againBut I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better manAnd I know why we had to say goodbyeLike the back of my handAnd I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better manA better manmemory byHersnow2015	These lyrics to this song describes exactly what happened between my husband and I.
