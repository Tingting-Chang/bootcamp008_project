The light in the window is a crack in the skyA stairway to darkness in the blink of an eyeA levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming backThe man in the dark will bring another attackYour mamma told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangersLook in the mirror and tell me do you think your life's in danger hereNo more tears, tears, tearsNo more tears, tears, tearsNo more tears, tears, tearsNo more tears, tears, tearsAnother day passes as the night closes inThe red light goes on to say it's time to beginI see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming hereNo more tears, tears, tearsNo more tears, tears, tearsNo more tears, tears, tearsNo more tears, tears, tearsIt's just a sign of the timesGoing forward in reverseStill, these were our firstIts just a hand in the bushA hand in the bushSo now that it's over can't we just say good-bye? (bye-bye, bye-bye)I'd like to move on and make the most of the nightMaybe a kiss before I leave you this wayYour lips are so cold I don't know what else to sayI never wanted it to end this way my love, my darlingBelieve me when I say to you in love I thinkI'm falling hereNo more tears, tears, tearsNo more tears, tears, tearsNo more tears, tears, tearsNo more tears, tears, tearsIt's just a hand in the bush(In the bush, in the bush, in the bush)
