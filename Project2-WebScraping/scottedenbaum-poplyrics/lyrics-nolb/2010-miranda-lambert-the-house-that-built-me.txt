I know they say you can't go home againI just had to come back one last timeMa'am I know you don't know me from AdamBut these handprints on the front steps are mineUp those stairs in that little back bedroomIs where I did my homework and I learned to play guitarI bet you didn't know under that live oakMy favorite dog is buried in the yardI thought if I could touch this place or feel itThis brokenness inside me might start healingOut here it's like I'm someone elseI thought that maybe I could find myselfIf I could just come in I swear I'll leaveWon't take nothing but a memoryFrom the house that built meMama cut out pictures of houses for yearsFrom Better Homes and Gardens magazinePlans were drawn and concrete pouredNail by nail and board by boardDaddy gave life to mama's dreamI thought if I could touch this place or feel itThis brokenness inside me might start healingOut here it's like I'm someone elseI thought that maybe I could find myselfIf I could just come in I swear I'll leaveWon't take nothing but a memoryFrom the house that built meYou leave home and you move on and you do the best you canI got lost in this old world and forgot who I amI thought if I could touch this place or feel itThis brokenness inside me might start healingOut here it's like I'm someone elseI thought that maybe I could find myselfIf I could walk around I swear I'll leaveWon't take nothing but a memoryFrom the house that built me
