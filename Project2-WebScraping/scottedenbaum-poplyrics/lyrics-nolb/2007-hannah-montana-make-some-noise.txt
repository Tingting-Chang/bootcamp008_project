It's easy to feel like you're all aloneTo feel like nobody knowsThe great that you are, the good that's inside youIs trying so hard to break throughMaybe it's your time to lift off and flyYou won't know if you never tryI will be there with you all of the wayYou'll be fineDon't let anyone tell youThat you're not strong enoughDon't give upThere's nothing wrongWith just being yourselfThat's more than enoughSo come on and raise your voiceSpeak your mind and make some noiseAnd sing - Hey! Hey!Make some noise - Hey! Hey yeah!You want to be knownYou want to be heardAnd know you are beautifulYou have so much to giveSome change you wanna liveSo shout it out and let it showYou have a diamond inside of your heartA light that shines bright as the starsDon't be afraid to be all that you areYou'll be fineDon't let anyone tell youThat you're not strong enoughDon't give upThere's nothing wrongWith just being yourselfThat's more than enoughSo come on and raise your voiceSpeak your mind and make some noiseAnd sing - Hey! Hey!Make some noise - Hey! Hey yeah!You can't just sit back and watch the world changeIt matters what you've got to sayThere's no one else who can stand in your placeSo come on it's never too lateMaybe it's your time to lift off and flyYou won't know if you never tryDon't let anyone tell youThat you're not strong enoughDon't give upThere's nothing wrongWith just being yourselfThat's more than enoughSo come on and raise your voiceSpeak your mind, make some noiseAnd sing - Hey!
