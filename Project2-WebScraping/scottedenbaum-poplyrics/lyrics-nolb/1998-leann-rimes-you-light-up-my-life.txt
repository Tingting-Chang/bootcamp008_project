So many nights, I'd sit by my window,Waiting for someone to sing me his song.So many dreams, I kept deep inside me,Alone in the dark, now you've come along.And you light up my life,You give me hope, to carry on.You light up my daysAnd fill my nights with song.Rollin' at sea, adrift on the watersCould it be finally, I'm turning for homeFinally a chance to say, "hey, I love you"Never again to be all alone.And you light up my life,You give me hope, to carry on.You light up my daysAnd fill my nights with song.You, you light up my lifeYou give me hope to carry onYou light up my daysAnd fill my nights with songIt can't be wrong, when it feels so right'Cause you, you light up my life
