In the brightest hour of my darkest dayI realized what is wrong with meCan't get over youCan't get through to youIt's been a helter skelter romance from the startTake these memories that are haunting meOf a paper man cut into shreds by his own pair of scissorsHe'll never forgive herHe'll never forgive herBecause days come and go, but my feelings for you are foreverBecause days come and go, but my feelings for you are foreverSitting by a fire on a lonely nightHanging over from another good timeWith another girl, little dirty girlYou should listen to this story of a lifeYou're my heroine in this moment I'm lonelyFulfilling my darkest dreamsAll these drugs, all these womenI'm never forgiven, this broken heart of mineBecause days come and go, but my feelings for you are foreverBecause days come and go, but my feelings for you are foreverOne last kiss, before I goDry your tears, it is time to let you goOne last kissOne last kiss, before I goDry your tears, it is time to let you goBecause days come and go, but my feelings for you are foreverBecause days come and go, but my feelings for you are foreverOne last kiss, before I goDry your tears, it is time to let you goOne last kiss, before I goDry your tears, it is time to let you goOne last kiss
