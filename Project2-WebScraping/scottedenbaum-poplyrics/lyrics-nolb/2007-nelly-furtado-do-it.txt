You're standing at the doorI'm falling to the floorYou look even better than you did beforeI'm staring at my feetWondering if I can do thisIt's been a while but I couldn't forget youJust a little look has got me feeling thingsJust a little taste has got me seeing thingsJust a little touch has got me off the chainsDoing things that I don't want toDo it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)Do it like you do it to me (just open up)Don't you know how much I want youWe're sitting real close and I can feel your breathI wanna touch your hand but I lay back'cause you know this thing could sprial in the nightI've changed my mind I'm ready for you this time
