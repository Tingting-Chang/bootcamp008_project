Where are the dreams that we once had?This is the time to bring them back.What were the promises caughtOn the tips of our tongues?Do we forget or forgive?There's a whole other life waiting to be lived whenOne day we're brave enoughTo talk with conviction of the heart.And down your streets I've walked alone,As if my feet were not my ownSuch is the path I chose,Doors I have opened and closedI'm so tired of living this life,Fooling myself, believing we're right whenI've never given loveWith any conviction of the heart.One with the Earth, with the skyI believe we'll surviveIf we only tryHow long must we wait to changeThis world bound in chains that we live inTo know what it is to forgive,And to be forgiven?It's been too many years of talking now.Isn't it time to stop somehow?Air that's too angry to breatheWater our children can't drinkYou've heard it hundreds of timesYou say you're aware, believe and you care, butDo you care enoughTo talk with conviction of the heart?
