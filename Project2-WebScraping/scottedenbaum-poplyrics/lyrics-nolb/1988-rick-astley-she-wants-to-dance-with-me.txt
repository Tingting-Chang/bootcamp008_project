She wants to danceShe wants to danceHoo!She wants to dance with meMmm, mmm, mmmThere's a girl I've been waiting to seeAnd I really get the feeling that she likes me'Cause she said so, but not in so many wordsI've got to tell you what I heardShe don't want no wild romanceWhen she's with me she only wants to dance[Chorus:]She wants to dance with me'Cause I hold her so tight next to meShe wants to dance with me'Cause I let her be what she wants to beNow I know I've been out of touchBut I never meant to hurt my baby oh so much'Cause I love her and i think she loves meAnd that's the way it's got to beWhen we're together we never fightWe've got better things to do tonightShe wants to dance with me'Cause I hold her so tight next to meShe wants to dance with me'Cause I let her be what she wants to beShe wants to danceShe wants to dance[Chorus To Fade]
