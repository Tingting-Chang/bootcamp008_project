Your not aloneOpen your mindSurely its time to be with meIn a way its all a matter of time,I will not worry for you you'll be just fineTake my thoughts with you and when you look behindYou will surely see, a face that you recognize[Chorus]Your not aloneI'll wait 'till the end of timeOpen your mind, surely its plain to seeYour not aloneI'll wait 'till the end of time for youOpen your mind, surely its time to be with meIt is the distance that makes life a little hardTwo minds that once were close now so many miles apartI will not falter though, I hold on to your hopeSafely back where you belongAnd see how our love has grown[Chorus: x4]
