I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love meThe start of nothingI had no chance to prepareI couldn't see you comingThe start of nothingI could hate you nowIt's quite alright to hate me nowWhen we both know that deep downThe feeling still deep down is goodIf I could see through walls, I could see you're fakingIf you could see my thoughts you would see our facesSafe in my rental like an armored truck back thenWe didn't give a fuck back thenI ain't a kid no moreWe'll never be those kids againWe'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back thenBack thenNo matter what I didMy waves wouldn't dip back thenEverything sucked back thenWe were friendsI thought that I was dreaming when you said you love meThe start of nothingI had no chance to prepareI couldn't see you comingThe start of nothingI could hate you nowIt's quite alright to hate me nowWhen we both know that deep downThe feeling still deep down is goodIn the halls of your hotelArm around my shoulder so I could tellHow much I meant to meant it sincere back thenWe had time to kill back thenYou ain't a kid no moreWe'll never be those kids againIt's not the same, ivory's illegalDon't you remember?I broke your heart last weekYou'll probably feel better by the weekendStill remember, had you going crazyScream my nameThe feeling deep down is goodI thought that I was dreaming when you said you love meThe start of nothingI had no chance to prepareI couldn't see you comingAnd we started from nothingI could hate you nowIt's alright to hate me nowWhen we both know that deep downThe feeling still deep down is goodAll the things I didn't mean to sayI didn't mean to doThere were things you didn't need to sayYou didn't need to need toI could dream all nightDream all nightI could drive all nightDrive all nightDreaming, dream on
