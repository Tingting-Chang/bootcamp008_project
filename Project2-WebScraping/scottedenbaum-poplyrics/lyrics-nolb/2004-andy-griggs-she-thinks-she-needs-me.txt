She thinks I walk on waterShe thinks I hung the moonShe tells me every morningThey just don't make men like youShe thinks I got it togetherSwears I'm tough as nailsBut I don't have the heart to tell herShe don't know me that wellShe don't know how much I need herShe don't know I'd fall apartWithout her kiss, without her touchWithout her faithful loving armsShe don't know it's all about herShe don't know I can't live without herShe's my world, she's my everythingShe thinks she needs meSometimes she cries on my shoulderWhen she's lyin' next to meShe don't know that when I hold herShe's really holding me, holding meShe don't know how much I need herShe don't know I'd fall apartWithout her kiss, without her touchWithout her faithful loving armsShe don't know it's all about herShe don't know I can't live without herShe's my world, she's my everythingShe thinks she needs meFunny thing is, she thinks she's the lucky oneShe don't know how much I need herShe don't know I'd fall apartWithout her kiss, without her touchWithout her faithful loving armsShe don't know it's all about herShe don't know I can't live without herShe's my world, she's my everythingShe thinks she needs me
