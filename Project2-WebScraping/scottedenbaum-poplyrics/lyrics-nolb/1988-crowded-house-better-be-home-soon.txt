Somewhere deep insideSomething's got a hold on youAnd it's pushing me asideSee it stretch on foreverI know I'm rightFor the first time in my lifeThat's why I tell youYou'd better be home soonStripping back the coatsOf lies and deceptionBack to nothingnessLike a week in the desertI know I'm rightFor the first time in my lifeThat's why I tell youYou'd better be home soonSo don't say noDon't say nothing's wrongCause when you get back homeMaybe I'll be goneIt would cause me painIf we were to end itBut I could start againYou can depend on itI know I'm rightFor the first time in my lifeThat's why I tell youYou'd better be home soonThat's why I tell youYou'd better be home soon
