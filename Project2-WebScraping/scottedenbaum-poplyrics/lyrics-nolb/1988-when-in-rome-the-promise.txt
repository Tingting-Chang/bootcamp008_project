If you need a friend, don't look to a stranger,You know in the end, I'll always be there.But when you're in doubt, and when you're in danger,Take a look all around, and I'll be there.I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say.I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be.But if you'll wait around awhile, I'll make you fall for me,I promise you, I promise you I will.When your day is through, and so is your temper,You know what to do, I'm gonna always be there.Sometimes if I shout, it's not what's intended.These words just come out, with no cross to bear.I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say.I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be.But if you'll wait around awhile, I'll make you fall for me,I promise you, I promise youI'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say.I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be.And if I had to walk the world, I'd make you fall for me,I promise you, I promise you I will.I gotta tell you, I gotta tell you, I need to tell youI'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say.I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be.But if you'll wait around awhile, I'll make you fall for me,I promise you, I promise you...I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say.I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be.And if I had to walk the world, I'd make you fall for me,I promise you, I promise you I will. I will. I will.
