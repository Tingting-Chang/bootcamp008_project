I can't feelFeel a thingI can't shoutI can't screamBreathe it outBreathe it inAll this loveFrom withinI won't cry when you say goodbyeI'm out of tearsI won't die when you wave goodbyeI'm out of tearsOut of tearsI won't drinkI won't eatI can't hearI won't speakLet it outLet it inAll this painFrom withinAnd I just can't pour my heart outTo another living thingI'm a whisperI'm a shadowBut I'm standing up to singI won't cry when you say goodbyeI'm out of tearsI won't die when you wave goodbyeI'm out of tears, yes I amI won't cry, I swear my eyes are dryI'm out of tearsI won't cry, I'm going to tell you whyI'm out of tearsOut of tearsOut of tearsLet it outFrom withinSome you loseSome you winI can driftI can dreamTil I floatOff your screenAnd I just can't pour my heart outTo another living thingI'm a whisperI'm a shadowBut I'm standing up to singI won't cry when you say goodbyeI'm out of tearsI won't die when you wave goodbyeI'm out of tearsOut of tearsI won't cry, I swear my eyes are dryI'm out of tearsOut of tearsI won't cry, I'm going to tell you whyI'm out of tearsOut of tearsOut of tears
