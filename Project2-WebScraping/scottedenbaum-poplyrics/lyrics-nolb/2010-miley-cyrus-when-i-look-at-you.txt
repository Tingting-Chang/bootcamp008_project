Everybody needs inspirationEverybody needs a songA beautiful melody, when the night's so long'Cause there is no guarantee, that this life is easyYeah, when my world is falling apartWhen there's no, light to break up the darkThat's when I, I, I look at youWhen the waves are flooding the shoreAnd I can't find my way home anymoreThat's when I, I, I look at youWhen I look at you, I see forgiveness, I see the truthYou love me for who I am like the stars hold the moonRight there where they belongAnd I know I'm not aloneYeah, when my world is falling apartWhen there's no light to break up the darkThat's when I, I, I look at youWhen the waves are flooding the shoreAnd I can't find my way home anymoreThat's when I, I, I look at youYou appear just like a dream to meJust like kaleidoscope colors that cover meAll I need, every breath that I breatheDon't you know, you're beautifulYeah, yeah,yeahWhen the waves are flooding the shoreAnd I can't find my way home anymoreThat's when I, I, I look at youI look at youYeah, yeah, oh, ohYou appear just like a dream to me
