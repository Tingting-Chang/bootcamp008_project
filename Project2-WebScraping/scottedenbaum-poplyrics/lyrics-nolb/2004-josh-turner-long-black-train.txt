There's a long black trainComing down the lineFeeding off the souls that are lost and cryingRails of sin only evil remainsWatch out brother for that long black trainLook to the heavensYou can look to the skiesYou can find redemptionStaring back into your eyesThere is protection and there isPeace the same burn in your ticket for thatLong black train'Cause there's victory in the lord I sayVictory in the lordCling to the father and his holy nameAnd don't go riding on that long black trainThere's a engine there on that long black trainMaking you wonder if your ride is worth the painHe's just a waitin' on your heart to sayLet me ride on that long black trainBut you know there's victory in the lord I sayVictory in the lordCling to the father and his holy nameAnd don't go riding on that long black trainWell I can hear the whistle from a mile awayIt sounds so goodBut I must stay awayThat train is a beauty making everybody stareBut its only destination is the middle of nowhereBut you know there's victory in the lord I sayVictory in the lordCling to the father and his holy nameAnd don't go riding on that long black trainI said cling to the father and his holy name and don't go ridin' on that black trainYes watch out brother for that long black trainThat devil's a drivin' that long black train.
