I hear your name whispered on the windIt's a sound that makes me cryI hear a song blow again and againThrough my mind and I don't know whyI wish I didn't feel so strong about youLike happiness and love revolve around youTrying to catch your heartIs like trying to catch a starSo many people love you babyThat must be what you areWaiting for a star to fallAnd carry your heart into my armsThat's where you belongIn my arms baby, yeahI've learned to feel what I cannot seeBut with you I lose that visionI don't know how to dream your dreamSo I'm all caught up in superstitionI want to reach out and pull you to meWho says I should let a wild one go freeTrying to catch your heartIs like trying to catch a starBut I can't love you this much babyAnd love you from this farWaiting for a star to fallAnd carry your heart into my armsThat's where you belongIn my arms baby, yeahWaiting (however long...)I don't like waiting (I'll wait for you...)It's so hard waiting (don't be too long...)Seems like waiting (makes me love you even more...)Waiting for a star to fallAnd carry your heart into my armsThat's where you belongIn my arms baby, yeah
