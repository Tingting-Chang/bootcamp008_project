On waves of love my heart is breakingAnd stranger still my self controlI can't rely on anymoreNew tides surprise my world it's changingWithin this frame an ocean swellsBehind this smile I know it wellBeneath a lover's moon I'm waitingI am the pilot of the stormAdrift in pleasure I may drownI built this ship it is my makingAnd furthermore my self controlI can't rely on anymoreI know why I know whyCrazy on a ship of foolsCrazy on a ship of foolsTurn this boat around back to my loving groundOh no, oh noWho claims that no man is an islandWhile I land up in jeopardyMore distant from you by degreesI walk this shore in isolationAnd at my feet eternity tries ever sweeter plans for meI know why I know whyCrazy on a ship of foolsOh, crazy on a ship of foolsTurn this boat around back to my loving groundOh no, oh noShip of foolsTurn this boat around back to my loving groundOh no, ohCrazy on a ship of foolsOh, crazy on a ship of foolsTurn this boat around back to my loving groundOh no, oh noShip of fools
