You look in my eyesAnd I get emotional insideI know it's crazyBut you still can touch my heartAnd after all this timeYou'd think that IWouldn't feel the sameBut time melts into nothingAnd nothing's changedI still believeSomeday you and meWill find ourselves in love againI had a dreamSomeday you and meWill find ourselves in love againEach day of my lifeI'm filled with all the joy I could findYou know that II'm not the desperate typeIf there's one spark of hopeLeft in my graspI'll hold it with both handsIt's worth the risk of burningTo have a second chanceNo, no, no, no, no, no I need you babyI still believe that we can be together, no noIf we believe that true love never has to endThen we must know that we will love again.I still believeSomeday you and meWill find ourselves in love againI had a dreamYou and meWill find ourselves in love againI still believeSomeday you and meWill find ourselves in love againI had a dreamSomeday you and meWill find ourselves in love again
