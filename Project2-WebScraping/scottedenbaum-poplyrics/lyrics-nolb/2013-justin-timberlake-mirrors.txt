Aren't you something to admire, 'cause your shine is something like a mirrorAnd I can't help but notice, you reflect in this heart of mineIf you ever feel alone and the glare makes me hard to findJust know that I'm always parallel on the other side'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soulI can tell you there's no place we couldn't goJust put your hand on the glass, I'm here trying to pull you throughYou just gotta be strong'Cause I don't wanna lose you nowI'm looking right at the other half of meThe vacancy that sat in my heartIs a space that now you holdShow me how to fight for nowAnd I'll tell you, baby, it was easyComing back into you once I figured it outYou were right here all alongIt's like you're my mirrorMy mirror staring back at meI couldn't get any biggerWith anyone else beside of meAnd now it's clear as this promiseThat we're making two reflections into one'Cause it's like you're my mirrorMy mirror staring back at me, staring back at meAren't you something, an original, 'cause it doesn't seem merely assembledAnd I can't help but stare 'cause I see truth somewhere in your eyesOoh I can't ever change without you, you reflect me, I love that about youAnd if I could, I would look at us all the time'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soulI can tell you there's no place we couldn't goJust put your hand on the glass, I'm here trying to pull you throughYou just gotta be strong'Cause I don't wanna lose you nowI'm looking right at the other half of meThe vacancy that sat in my heartIs a space that now you holdShow me how to fight for nowAnd I'll tell you, baby, it was easyComing back into you once I figured it outYou were right here all alongIt's like you're my mirrorMy mirror staring back at meI couldn't get any biggerWith anyone else beside of meAnd now it's clear as this promiseThat we're making two reflections into one'Cause it's like you're my mirrorMy mirror staring back at me, staring back at meYesterday is historyTomorrow's a mysteryI can see you looking back at meKeep your eyes on meBaby, keep your eyes on meI don't wanna lose you nowI'm looking right at the other half of meThe vacancy that sat in my heartIs a space that now you holdShow me how to fight for nowAnd I'll tell you, baby, it was easyComing back into you once I figured it outYou were right here all alongIt's like you're my mirrorMy mirror staring back at meI couldn't get any biggerWith anyone else beside of meAnd now it's clear as this promiseThat we're making two reflections into one'Cause it's like you're my mirrorMy mirror staring back at me, staring back at meYou are you are the love of my lifeYou are you are the love of my lifeYou are you are the love of my lifeYou are you are the love of my lifeYou are you are the love of my lifeYou are you are the love of my lifeYou are you are the love of my lifeYou are you are the love of my lifeYou are you are the love of my lifeYou are you are the love of my lifeNow you're the inspiration for this precious songAnd I just wanna see your face light up since you put me onSo now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already goneAnd I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you homeJust to let you know, you areYou are you are the love of my lifeGirl you're my reflection, all I see is youMy reflection, in everything I doYou're my reflection and all I see is youMy reflection, in everything I doYou are you are the love of my life
