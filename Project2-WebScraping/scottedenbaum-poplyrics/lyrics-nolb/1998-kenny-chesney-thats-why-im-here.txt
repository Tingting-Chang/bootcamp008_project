No I ain't had nothing to drinkI knew that's probably what you'd thinkIf I stopped by this time of nightRemember way back whenI promised you I'd drop inAt one of those meetings down at the YWhen they started talkin' 'bout the steps you takeMistakes you make, the hearts you break and the price you payI almost walked awayYou could hear a pin drop when this ole manStood up and said, I'm gonna say it again like I do every weekFor those who don't know me...It's the simple things in lifeLike the kids at home and a loving wifeThat you miss the most when you lose controlEverything you love starts to disappearThe devil takes your hand and says, no fearHave another shot, just one more beerI've been there, that's why I'm hereThis ole boy stood up in the aisleSaid he'd been living a life of denial and he criedAs he talked about wasted yearsI couldn't believe what I heardIt was my life word for wordAnd all of a sudden it was clearIt's the simple things in lifeLike the kids at home and a loving wifeThat you miss the most when you lose controlEverything you love starts to disappearThe devil takes your hand and says, no fearHave another shot, just one more beerI've been there, that's why I'm hereFor us it may be too lateBut it would mean the world to meIf you were there when I stand and sayIt's the simple things in lifeLike the kids at home and a loving wifeThat you miss the most when you lose controlEverything you love starts to disappearThe devil takes your hand and says, no fearHave another shot, just one more beerI've been there, that's why I'm here
