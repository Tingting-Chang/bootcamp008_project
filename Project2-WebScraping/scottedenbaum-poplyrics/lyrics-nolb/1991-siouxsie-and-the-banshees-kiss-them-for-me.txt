It glittered and it gleamedFor the arriving beauty queenA ring and a carNow you're the prettiest by farNo party she'd not attendNo invitation she wouldn't sendTransfixed by the inner soundOf your promise to be found"Nothing or no-one will everMake me let you down"Kiss them for me, I may be delayedKiss them for me, if I am delayedIt's divoon, oh it's sereneIn the fountains pink champagneSomeone carving their devotionIn the heart shaped pool of fame"Nothing or no one will everMake me let you down"Kiss them for me, I may be delayedKiss them for me, I may find myself delayedOn the road to New OrleansA spray of stars hit the screenAs the 10th impact shimmeredThe forbidden candles beamedKiss them for me, I may be delayedKiss them for me, I may find myself delayedKiss them for me, kiss them for meKiss them for me, I may find myself delayed
