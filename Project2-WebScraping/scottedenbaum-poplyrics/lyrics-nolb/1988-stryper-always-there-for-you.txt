Love can be so coldAnd loneliness gets oldMore than words or broken promisesI want to show you what true love isI'm always there for youI'll always stand by youWhen the world has closed the doorAnd you can't go on anymoreI'm always there for youYou've been hurt beforeAnd you don't want anymoreThere's a better way for youBelieve in me, I'll see you throughI'm always there for youI'll always stand by youWhen the world has closed the doorAnd you can't go on anymoreI'm always there for you
