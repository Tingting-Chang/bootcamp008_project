I'm gonna pick up the pieces,And build a Lego houseIf things go wrong we can knock it downMy three words have two meanings,There's one thing on my mindIt's all for youAnd it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warmIf you're broken I will mend you and I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on nowI'm out of touch, I'm out of luckI'll pick you up when you're getting downAnd out of all these things I've done I think I love you better nowI'm out of sight, I'm out of mindI'll do it all for you in timeAnd out of all these things I've done I think I love you better nowI'm gonna paint you by numbersAnd color you inIf things go right we can frame it and put you on a wallAnd it's so hard to say it but I've been there beforeNow I'll surrender up my heartAnd swap it for yoursI'm out of touch, I'm out of loveI'll pick you up when you're getting downAnd out of all these things I've done I think I love you better nowI'm out of sight, I'm out of mindI'll do it all for you in timeAnd out of all these things I've done I think I love you betterDon't hold me downI think my braces are breaking, and it's more than I can takeAnd it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warmIf you're broken I will mend you and I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on nowI'm out of touch, I'm out of loveI'll pick you up when you're getting downAnd out of all these things I've done I think I love you better nowI'm out of sight, I'm out of mindI'll do it all for you in timeAnd out of all these things I've done I think I love you better nowI'm out of touch, I'm out of luckI'll pick you up when you're getting downAnd out of all these things I've done I think I love you better nowI'm out of sight, I'm out of mindI'll do it all for you in timeAnd out of all these things I've done I think I love you better nowI'm out of touch, I'm out of luckI'll pick you up when you're getting downAnd out of all these things I've done I will love you better now
