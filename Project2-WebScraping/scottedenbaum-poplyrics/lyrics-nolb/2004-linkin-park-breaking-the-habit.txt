Memories consume like opening the woundsI'm picking me apart againYou all assumeI'm safe here in my roomUnless I try to start againI don't want to be the one the battles always choose'cause inside I realize that I'm the one confusedI don't know what's worth fighting forOr why I have to screamI don't know why I instigateAnd say what I don't meanI don't know how I got this wayI know it's not alrightSo I'm breaking the habitI'm breaking the habit tonightClutching my cureI tightly lock the doorI try to catch my breath againI hurt much more than any time beforeI have no options left againI don't want to be the one the battles always choose'cause inside I realize that I'm the one confusedI don't know what's worth fighting forOr why I have to screamI don't know why I instigateAnd say what I don't meanI don't know how I got this wayI'll never be alrightSo I'm breaking the habitI'm breaking the habit tonightI'll paint it on the walls'cause I'm the one at faultI'll never fight againAnd this is how it endsI don't know what's worth fighting forOr why I have to screamBut now I have some clarity to show you what I meanI don't know how I got this wayI'll never be alrightSo I'm breaking the habitI'm breaking the habitI'm breaking the habit tonight
