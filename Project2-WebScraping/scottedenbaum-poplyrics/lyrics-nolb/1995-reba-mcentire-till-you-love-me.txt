I sent you roses, I warned you I wouldDo all that I could to show you the way that I feelPlease, don't say I'm wasting my timeI've got nothin' but time so I'll do all that I can to catchThat ghost of a chance[Chorus]The sunlight, the moonlightAre beyond my controlAnd there are stars in the heavensThat I'll never holdBut if dreams give you powerThen I'm strong enough to offer my heartAnd never give up till you love meTill you love meI looked in your eyes, so bright and so blueAnd that's when I knew that you could be mineIf good things come to those who will waitWell, I guess I can wait if that's what I have to doOh, it's worth it for you
