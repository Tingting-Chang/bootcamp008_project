This is not the endThis is not the beginning,Just a voice like a riotRocking every revisionBut you listen to the toneAnd the violent rhythmAnd though the words sound steadySomething empty's within 'emWe say Yeah!With fists flying up in the airLike we're holding onto somethingThat's invisible there,'Cause we're living at the mercy ofThe pain and the fearUntil we get, forget it,Let it all disappear.Waiting for the end to comeWishing I had strength to standThis is not what I had plannedIt's out of my controlFlying at the speed of lightThoughts we're spinning in my headSo many things were left unsaidIt's hard to let you go(Oh) I know what it takes to move on,I know how it feels to lie,All I wanna doIs trade this life for something newHolding on to what I haven't gotSitting in an empty roomTrying to forget the pastThis was never meant to last,I wish it wasn't so(Oh) I know what it takes to move on,I know how it feels to lie,All I wanna doIs trade this life for something newHolding on to what I haven't gotYeah, yeahWhat was left when that fire was gone?I thought it felt right but that right was wrongAll caught up in the eye of the stormAnd trying to figure out what it's like moving onAnd I don't even know what kind of things I've saidMy mouth kept moving and my mind went deadSo, picking up the pieces, now where to begin?The hardest part of ending is starting again!All I wanna doIs trade this life for something newHolding on to what I haven't gotThis is not the endThis is not the beginning,Just a voice like a riotRocking every revisionBut you listen to the toneAnd the violent rhythmThough the words sound steadySomething empty's within 'em(Holding on to what I haven't got)We say Yeah!With fists flying up in the airLike we're holding onto somethingThat's invisible there,'Cause we're living at the mercy ofThe pain and the fearUntil we get it, forget it,Let it all disappear(Holding on to what I haven't got!)
