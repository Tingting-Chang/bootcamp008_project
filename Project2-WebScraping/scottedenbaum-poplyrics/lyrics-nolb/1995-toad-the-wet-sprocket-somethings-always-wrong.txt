Another day I call and never speakAnd you would say nothing's changed at allAnd I can't feel much hope for anythingIf I won't be there to catch you when you fallAgainIt seems we meetIn the spacesIn betweenWe always sayIt won't take longBut something's always wrongAnother game of putting things asideAs if we'll come back to them sometimeA brace of hopeA pride of innocenceAnd you would say something has gone wrongAgainIt seems we meetIn the spacesIn betweenWe always sayIt won't take longBut something's always wrong
