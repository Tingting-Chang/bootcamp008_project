Sometimes it feels like this world is spinning fasterThan it did in the old daysSo naturally, we have more natural disastersFrom the strain of a fast paceSunday was a day of restNow, it's one more day for progressAnd we can't slow down ?cause more is bestIt's all an endless process[Chorus](Well) I miss MayberrySitting on the porch drinking ice-cold cherry CokeWhere everything is black and whitePicking on a six stringWhere people pass by and you call them by their first nameWatching the clouds roll byBye, byeSometimes I can hear this old earth shoutingThrough the trees as the wind blowsThat's when I climb up here on this mountainTo look through God's windowNow I can't flyBut I got two feet that get me high up hereAbove the noise and city streetsMy worries disappear[Chorus]Sometimes I dream I'm driving down an old dirt roadNot even listed on a mapI pass a dad and son carrying a fishing poleBut I always wake up every time I try to turn back[Chorus]Bye, bye(I miss Mayberry, I miss Mayberry)
