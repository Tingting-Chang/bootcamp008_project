Let it go, let it goCan't hold it back anymoreLet it go, Let it goTurn my back and slam the doorThe snow glows white on the mountain tonightNot a footprint to be seenA kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the queenThe wind is howling like this swirling storm insideCouldn't keep it inHeaven knows I triedDon't let them in, don't let them seeBe the good girl you always had to beConceal, don't feel, don't let them knowWell now they knowLet it go, let it goCan't hold it back anymoreLet it go, let it goTurn my back and slam the doorAnd here I standAnd here I'll stayLet it go, let it goThe cold never bothered me anywayIt's funny how some distance makes everything seem smallAnd the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at allUp here in the cold thin air I finally can breatheI know I left a life behind but I'm too relieved to grieveLet it go, Let it goCan't hold it back anymoreLet it go, Let it go,Turn my back and slam the doorAnd here I standAnd here I'll stayLet it go, let it goThe cold never bothered me anywayStanding - frozen in the life I've chosenYou won't find me, the past is so behind meBuried in the snowLet it go, let it goCan't hold it back anymoreLet it go, let it go,Turn my back and slam the doorAnd here I standAnd here I'll stayLet it go, let it goThe cold never bothered me anyway...(let the music go on)let it go, let it goLet it go, let it go
