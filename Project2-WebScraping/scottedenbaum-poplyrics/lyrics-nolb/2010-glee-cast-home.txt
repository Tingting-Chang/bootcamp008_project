Another summer dayHas come and gone awayIn Paris and RomeBut I wanna go homeMay be surrounded byA million people IStill feel all aloneJust wanna go homeOh I miss you, you knowAnd I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to youEach one a line or two"I'm fine baby, how are you?"Well, I would send them but I know that it's just not enoughMy words were cold and flatAnd you deserve more than thatAnother aeroplaneAnother sunny placeI'm lucky I knowBut I wanna go homeI've got to go homeLet me go homeI'm just too far from where you areI wanna come homeAnd I feel just like I'm living someone else's lifeIt's like I just stepped outsideWhen everything was going rightAnd I know just why you could notCome along with me'Cause this was not your dreamBut you always believed in meAnother winter day has comeAnd gone awayIn Eden, Paris, and RomeAnd I wanna go homeLet me go homeAnd I'm surrounded byA million people I,I Still feel aloneLet me go homeOh, I miss you, you knowLet me go homeI've had my runBaby, I'm doneI gotta go homeLet me go homeIt'll all be alrightI'll be home tonightI'm coming back home
