When road is carved up yonderI hope you see me thereIt's in the water, it's where you came fromIt's in the water, it's where you came fromAnd the crowd begins to wanderAnd they cry to see your faceIt's in the water, it's in the story of where you came fromYour sons and daughters in all their glory it's gonna shape 'emAnd when they pledge and come together, and start arisingJust drink the water where you came from, where you came fromThe road it was carved from nothingNever sold yourself awayIt's in the water, it's in the story of where you came fromYour sons and daughters in all their glory its gonna shape 'emAnd when they pledge and come together, and start arisingJust drink the water where you came from, where you came fromIt's in the water where you came fromIt's in the water where you came fromIt's in the water where you came fromAnd when they pledge and come together and start arisingJust drink the water where you came from where you came from
