I got a good friend who's got a good lifeHe's got two pretty children and a real nice wifeYet he never seems quite satisfiedI said I know what' s on your mindBut you better think about it before you cross that lineThe grass ain't always greener on the other sideThen whatWhat you gonna doWhen the new wears off and the old shines throughAnd it ain't really love and it ain't really lustAnd you ain't anybody anyone's gonna trustThen whatWhere you gonna turnWhen you can't turn back for the bridges you've burnedAnd fate can't wait to kick you in the buttThen what, oh then whatI ain't sayin' that lookin's a crimeI've done my share from time to timeIt don't mean that you got to take that leapWhen you're standin' on the brinkBefore you jump you gotta step back and thinkThere's a price for every promise you don't keepThen whatWhat you gonna doWhen the new wears off and the old shines throughAnd it ain't really love and it ain't really lustAnd you ain't anybody anyone's gonna trustThen whatWhere you gonna turnWhen you can't turn back for the bridges you've burnedAnd fate can't wait to kick you in the buttThen what, oh then whatBut do what you want do what you wishIt's your life but remember thisThere's bound to be some consequencesFor sneakin' under certain fencesThen whatWhat you gonna doWhen the new wears off and the old shines throughAnd it ain't really love and it ain't really lustAnd you ain't anybody anyone's gonna trustThen whatWhere you gonna turnWhen you can't turn back for the bridges you've burnedAnd fate can't wait to kick you in the buttThen what, oh then what
