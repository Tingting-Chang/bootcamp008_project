We both lie silently stillIn the dead of the nightAlthough we both lie close togetherWe feel miles apart insideWas it something I said or something I didDid my words not come out rightThough I tried not to hurt youThough I triedBut I guess that's why they sayEvery rose has its thornJust like every night has it's dawnJust like every cowboy sings his sad, sad songEvery rose has its thornYeah it doesI listen to your favorite songPlaying on the radioHear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy goBut I wonder does he knowHas it ever felt like thisAnd I know that you'd be here right nowIf I could have let you know somehow I guessEvery rose has its thornJust like every night has it's dawnJust like every cowboy sings his sad, sad songEvery rose has its thornThough it's been a while nowI can still feel so much painLike the knife that cuts you the wound healsBut the scar, that scar remainsI know I could have saved our love that nightIf I'd known what to sayInstead if making loveWe both made our separate waysNow he found somebody newAnd that I never meant that much to youTo hear that tears me up insideAnd to see you cuts me like a knifeI guess every rose has its thornJust like every night has it's dawnJust like every cowboy sings his sad, sad songEvery rose has its thorn
