I have wondered this world far and wideI've been all around to the other sideBut there's nothin' like comin' homeI want to sit on my front porch and drink my lemonadeCut my grass after church every SundayAnd go out on Saturday nightLive the simple lifeWake up in the morning to these fields of goldAnd take a long walk down a gravel roadSpend my days in the sweet sunshineRock in my swing and watch my garden growKnow that I'll always have someone to holdOh I-I-I want to live the simple lifeI want to take a blanket down to the creekAnd let the water sing me to sleepLet go of timeLive the simple lifeLately I've seen too many city lightsI want to go somewhere where I can see the stars at nightSpend my days in the sweet sunshineRock in my swing and watch my garden growKnow that I'll always have someone to holdOh I-I-I want to live the simple lifeSpend my days in the sweet sunshineRock in my swing and watch my garden growKnow that I'll always have someone to holdOh I-I-I want to live the simple life
