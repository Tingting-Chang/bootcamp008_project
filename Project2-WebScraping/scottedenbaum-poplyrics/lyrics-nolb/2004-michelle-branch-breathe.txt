I've been driving for an hourJust talking to the rainYou say I've been driving you crazyAnd its keeping you awaySo just give me one good reasonTell me why I should stayCause I don't want to waste another momentIn saying things we never meant to sayAnd I take it just a little bitI, hold my breath and count to tenI, I've been waiting for a chance to let you inIf I just breatheLet it fill the space betweenI'll know everything is alrightBreatheEvery little piece of meYou'll seeEverything is alrightIf I just breatheWell it's all so overratedIn not saying how you feelSo you end up watching chances fadeAnd wondering what's realAnd I give you just a little timeI, wonder if you realizeI've been waiting till I see it in your eyesIf I just breatheLet it fill the space betweenI'll know everything is alrightBreathe,Every little piece of meYou'll seeEverything is alrightIf I just breatheBreatheSo I whisper and I'm,Hoping you hear meDo you hear me?If I just breatheLet it fill the space betweenI'll know everything is alrightBreathe,Every little piece of meYou'll seeEverything is alrightI've been driving for an hourJust talking to the rain
