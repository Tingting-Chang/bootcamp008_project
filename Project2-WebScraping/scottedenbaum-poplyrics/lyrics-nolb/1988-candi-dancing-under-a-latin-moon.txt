As I watch you move, across the moonlit roomThere's so much tenderness in your lovingTomorrow I must leave, the dawn knows no reprieveGod give me strength when I am leaving...So raise your hands to heaven and prayThat we'll be back together somedayTonight, I need your sweet caressHold me in the darknessTonight, you calm my restlessnessYou relieve my sadnessAs we move to embrace, tears run down your faceI whisper words of love, so softlyI can't believe this pain, it's driving me insaneWithout your touch, life will be lonelySo raise your hands to heaven and prayThat we'll be back together somedayTonight, I need your sweet caressHold me in the darknessTonight, you calm my restlessnessYou relieve my sadnessMorning has come, another dayI must pack my bags and say goodbye.
