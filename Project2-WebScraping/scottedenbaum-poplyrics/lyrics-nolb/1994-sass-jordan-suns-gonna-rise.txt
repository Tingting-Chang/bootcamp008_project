You know I've seen that face beforeI'm not sure if I want it to beThat old face I used to see'Cause that's the one that left me all aloneTook my feelings and hung them out to dryNever gave a reason whyYes, I know I fell from grace beforeBut all that's gonna endSun's gonna rise againI'll be listenin' to those lies againSun's gonna rise'Cause I went back for moreGuess I never learned my lesson wellI went straight back into hellBut when the lightnin' hits the stormy skyNo one cares about who'll be left to cryAnd there ain't no reason whyYes I know I led the chase beforeThe chase is gonna endSun's gonna rise againI'll be listenin' to those lies againSun's gonna rise againYou feelin' sorry for yourselfDon't affect my mental health, no moreI've had enough and it's overSun's gonna rise againI'll be listenin' to those lies again, yeaSun's gonna rise(Sun will arise)(Sun will arise again)
