[Chorus]Baby baby baby babyYou know that you're so fineBaby baby baby babyThink about you all the timeI guess it's time to say baby, babyHow you make me feelWhen you come to my mindI can't keep my cool baby, babyI can't hold it insideI can't wait each day just to see you walkTryin' to move in close to get to where you areI'm not trying to be rude baby, babyNothing ventured nothing gainedOh I'm telling you[Chorus]Words just ain't enough baby, babyBut that's all I can use to state my intentionsHope it gets to love baby, baby yeahIt's a perfect situationCause we fit together like a hand in gloveJust to be with you is all I'm thinking ofOh oh yeahWhat else can I say baby oh babyWe are alone and I'm singing this song to you[Chorus: x2]My darling, oh baby,You're all I'm thinking of nowMy darling, oh baby,You're all I need right nowHey hey hey[Chorus: x2]
