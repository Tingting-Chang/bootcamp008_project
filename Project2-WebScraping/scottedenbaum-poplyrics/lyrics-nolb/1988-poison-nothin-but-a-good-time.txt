Now ListenNot a dime, I can't pay my rentI can barely make it through the weekSaturday night I'd like to make my girlBut right now I can't make ends meetI'm always workin' slavin' every dayGotta get a break from that same old same oldI need a chance just to get awayIf you could hear me think this is what I'd sayDon't need nothin' but a good timeHow can I resistAin't lookin' for nothin' but a good timeAnd it don't get better than thisThey say I spend my money on women and wineBut I couldn't tell you where I spent last nightI'm really sorry about the shape I'm inI just like my fun every now and thenI'm always workin' slavin' every dayGotta get a break from that same old same oldI need a chance just to get awayIf you could hear me think this is what I'd sayDon't need nothin' but a good timeHow can I resistAin't lookin' for nothin' but a good timeAnd it don't get better than thisYou see I raise a toast to all of usWho are breakin' our backs every dayIf wantin' the good life is such a crimeLord, then put me awayHere's to yaDon't need nothin' but a good timeHow can I resistAin't lookin' for nothin' but a good timeAnd it don't get better than thisDon't need nothin' but a good timeHow can I resistAin't lookin' for nothin' but a good timeAnd it don't get better than thisIt don't get better
