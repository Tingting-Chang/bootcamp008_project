Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisyOut in the shack with a blue tick houndBroke as hell, but blessed with beautyThe kind that a rich man can't turn downShe caught the eye of an oil man dancingOne summer night in a dime store dressShe had the looks, he had the mansionAnd you can figure out the restIt was all roses, dripping in diamondsSipping on champagneShe was all uptown, wearing that white gownTaking his last nameShe could hear those church bells ringing, ringingAnd up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singingFold your hands and close your eyesYeah, it's all gonna be alrightAnd just listen to the church bells ringing, ringingYeah, they're ringingJenny was hosting Junior League partiesAnd having dinner at the country clubEveryone thought they were Ken and BarbieBut Ken was always getting way too drunkSaturday night, after a few too manyHe came home ready to fightAnd all his money could never save JennyFrom the devil living in his eyesIt was all bruises, covered in makeupDark sunglassesAnd that next morning, sitting in the back pewPraying with the baptistShe could hear those church bells ringing, ringingAnd up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singingFold your hands and close your eyesYeah, it's all gonna be alrightYou just listen to the church bells ringing, ringingYeah, they're ringingJenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskeyNo law man was ever gonna findAnd how he died is still a mysteryBut he hit a woman for the very last timeShe could hear those church bells ringing, ringingStanding there in a black dress singing, singingFold your hands and close your eyesYeah, it's all gonna be alrightAnd just listen to the church bells ringing, ringingYeah, they're ringing
