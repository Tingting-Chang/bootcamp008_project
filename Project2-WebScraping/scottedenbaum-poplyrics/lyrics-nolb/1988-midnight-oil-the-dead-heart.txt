We don't serve your countryDon't serve your kingKnow your custom don't speak your tongueWhite man came took everyoneWe don't serve your countryDon't serve your kingWhite man listen to the songs we singWhite man came took everythingWe carry in our hearts the true countryAnd that cannot be stolenWe follow in the steps of our ancestryAnd that cannot be brokenWe don't need protectionDon't need your landKeep your promise on where we standWe will listen we'll understandMining companies, pastoral companiesUranium companiesCollected companiesGot more right than peopleGot more say than peopleForty thousand years can make a differenceTo the state of thingsThe dead heart lives here
