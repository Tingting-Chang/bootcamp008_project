When I am down, and, oh, my soul, so wearyWhen troubles come, and my heart burdened beThen, I am still and wait here in the silenceUntil you come and sit awhile with meYou raise me up, so I can stand on mountainsYou raise me up to walk on stormy seasI am strong when I am on your shouldersYou raise me up to more than I can beThere is no life, no life without its hungerEach restless heart beats so imperfectlyBut then you come, and I am filled with wonderSometimes I think I glimpse eternityYou raise me up, so I can stand on mountainsYou raise me up to walk on stormy seasI am strong when I am on your shouldersYou raise me up to more than I can beYou raise me up, so I can stand on mountainsYou raise me up to walk on stormy seasI am strong when I am on your shouldersYou raise me up to more than I can beYou raise me up, so I can stand on mountainsYou raise me up to walk on stormy seasI am strong when I am on your shouldersYou raise me up to more than I can beYou raise me up to more than I can be
