I took a pill in IbizaTo show Avicii I was coolAnd when I finally got sober, felt 10 years olderBut fuck it, it was something to doI'm living out in LAI drive a sports car just to proveI'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollarsAnd I spend it on girls and shoesBut you don't wanna be high like meNever really knowing why like meYou don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all aloneYou don't wanna ride the bus like thisNever knowing who to trust like thisYou don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singingStuck up on that stage singingAll I know are sad songs, sad songsDarling, all I know are sad songs, sad songsmeaning byAmandaH	,  EditorMike Posner's original, acoustic-style version of "I Took A Pill In Ibiza" is actually less-known than the remix, done by SeeB. Here's the standard: See allI'm just a singer who already blew his shotI get along with old timers'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgotAnd I can't keep a girl, no'Cause as soon as the sun comes upI cut 'em all loose and work's my excuseBut the truth is I can't open upNow you don't wanna be high like meNever really knowing why like meYou don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all aloneYou don't wanna ride the bus like thisNever knowing who to trust like thisYou don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singingStuck up on that stage singingAll I know are sad songs, sad songsDarling, all I know are sad songs, sad songsI took a plane to my home townI brought my pride and my guitarAll my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawnsAnd the people still think I'm a starI walked around downtownI met some fans on LafayetteThey said tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatientSo I looked 'em in the eye and saidYou don't wanna be high like meNever really knowing why like meYou don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all aloneYou don't wanna ride the bus like thisNever knowing who to trust like thisYou don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singingStuck up on that stage singingAll I know are sad songs, sad songsDarling, all that I know are sad songs, sad songs
