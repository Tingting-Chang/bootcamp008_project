No sir I ain't been drinkingI ain't even had one beerThis sweet thing's got me buzzingFrom whispering in my earJust take a peek up in hereAt this little hot messMister, you'll understandI'm doing my bestAnd I know I'm all over the roadI can't help but goA little bit of left, a little bit of rightIt's hard to drive with her hand over here on my kneeWhen she's all over me, I'm all outta controlAll over the roadDon't wanna get no ticketDon't wanna cause no wreckIt's hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neckI say "girl take it easy"She laughs, says "it'll be fine"How am I supposed to keep it between the linesYeah I know I'm all over the roadI can't help but goA little bit of left, a little bit of rightIt's hard to drive with her hand over here on my kneeWhen she's all over me, I'm all outta controlAnd all over the roadSomething 'bout these wheels rollingRadio playing gets her goingI'm trying to get her home as fast as I can goAnd I know I'm all over the roadI can't help but goA little bit of left, a little bit of rightIt's hard to drive with her hand over here on my kneeHave a little mercy on meSir I'm sorry I knowI'm all over the roadAll over the roadAll over the road
