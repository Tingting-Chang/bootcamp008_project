I ride east every other Friday but if I had it my wayDays would not be wasted on this driveAnd I want so bad to hold youSome of the things I haven't told youYour mom and me just couldn't get alongSo I'll driveAnd I'll think about my lifeAnd wonder why, I'll slowly die insideEvery time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia lineAnd I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 rideA day might come and you'll realize that if you could see through my eyesThere was no other way to work it outAnd a part of you might hate meBut son please don't mistake me For a man that didn't care at allSo I'll driveAnd I'll think about my lifeAnd wonder why, I'll slowly die insideEvery time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia lineAnd I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride
