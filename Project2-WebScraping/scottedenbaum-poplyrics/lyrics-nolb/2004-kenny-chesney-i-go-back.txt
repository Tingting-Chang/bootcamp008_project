"Jack and Diane" painted a picture of my life and my dreams,Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to meWell I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along'Cause every time I hear that songI go back to a two-toned short bed ChevyDrivin' my first love out to the levyLivin' life with no sense of timeAnd I go back to the feel of a fifty yard lineA blanket, a girl, some raspberry wineWishin' time would stop right in its tracksEvery time I hear that song, I go back, I go backI used to rock all night long to "Keep On Rockin' Me Baby"At frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladiesI heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along'Cause every time I hear that songI go back to the smell of an old gym floorAnd the taste of salt on the Carolina shoreAfter graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friendsAnd I go back to watchin summer fade to fallGrowin' up too fast and I do recallWishin' time would stop right in its tracksEvery time I hear that song, I go back, I go backWe all have a song that somehow stamped our livesTakes us to another place and timeSo I go back to a pew, preacher and a choirSingin' 'bout God, brimstone, and fireAnd the smell of Sunday chicken after churchAnd I go back to the loss of a real good friendAnd the sixteen summers I shared with himNow "Only The Good Die Young" stops me in my tracksEvery time I hear that song, I go back, I go backTo the feel of a fifty yard lineA blanket, a girl, some raspberry wineI go back (I go back)To watchin' summer fade to fallGrowin' up too fast and I do recallI go back (I go back)To the loss of a real good friendAnd the sixteen summers I shared with himI go back, I go back, I go back
