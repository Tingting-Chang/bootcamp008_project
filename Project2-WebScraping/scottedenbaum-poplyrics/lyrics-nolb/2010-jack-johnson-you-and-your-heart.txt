Watch you when you sayWhat you are and when you blameEveryone, you broken kingWatch you change the frame orWatch you when you take your aimAt the sum of everything'Cause you and your heartShouldn't feel so far apartYou can choose what you takeWhy you gotta break and make it feel so hardLay there in the streetLike broken glass reflecting pieces of the sunBut you're not the flameYou got the people passing byBecause you know what you don't likeIt's just so easy, it's just so easyBut you and your heartShouldn't feel so far apartYou can choose what you takeWhy you gotta break and make it feel so hardOh and you and your heartShouldn't feel so far apartYou can choose what you takeWhy you gotta break and make it feel so hardYou draw so many lines in the sandLost the fingernails on your handsHow you're gonna scratch any backs?Better hope the tide will take our lines awayTake all our lines andHope the tide will take our lines andHope the tide will take our lines awayTake all our lines away
