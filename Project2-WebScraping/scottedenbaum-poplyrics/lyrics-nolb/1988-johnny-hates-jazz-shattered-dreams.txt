So much for your promisesThey died the day you let me goCaught up in a web of liesBut it was just too late to knowI thought it was youWho would stand by my sideAnd now you've given me given meNothing but shattered dreams shattered dreamsFeel like I could run away run awayFrom this empty heartYou said you'd die for me,Woke up to realityAnd found the future not so brightI dreamt the impossibleThat maybe things could work out rightI thought it was youWho would do me no wrongBut nowFrom this empty heartI thought it was you who said they'd die for love
