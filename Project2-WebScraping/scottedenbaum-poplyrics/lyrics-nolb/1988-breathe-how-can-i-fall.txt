How can I fall?When you just won't give me reasonsWhen you just won't give me reasons at allWhen all faith is goneI fight myself to carry onYet I know of the harm I doWhat more can I say to you?Now I hold this lineI know the choice to leave is mineI can't help what I feel insideWhat more can I say?How can I fall? How can I fall?(How can I fall?)When you just won't give me reasonsWhen you just won't give me reasons at allI'll follow through, I'll see I doWhen the time is far more right for youI'll make that move and when I doWill I doubt again the way I do?How can I fall? How can I fall?(How can I fall?)When you just won't give me reasonsWhen you just won't give me reasons at allHow can I fall? How can I fall?(How can I fall?)When you just won't give me reasonsWhen you just won't give me reasonsHow can I fall? How can I fall?(How can I fall?)When you just won't give me reasonsWhen you just won't give me reasonsJust won't give me reasonsJust won't give me reasons at allHow can I fall?
