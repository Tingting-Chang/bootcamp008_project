I said remember this momentIn the back of my mindThe time we stood with our shaking handsThe crowds in stands went wildWe were the kings and the queensAnd they read off our namesThe night you danced like you knew our livesWould never be the sameYou held your head like a heroOn a history book pageIt was the end of a decadeBut the start of an ageLong live the walls we crashed throughAll the kingdom lights shined just for me and youI was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"And bring on all the pretendersOne day we will be rememberedI said remember this feelingI passed the pictures aroundOf all the years that we stood there on the sidelinesWishing for right nowWe are the kings and the queensYou traded your baseball cap for a crownWhen they gave us our trophiesAnd we held them up for our townAnd the cynics were outragedScreaming, "this is absurd"'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the worldLong live the walls we crashed throughAll the kingdom lights shined just for me and youI was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"And bring on all the pretendersI'm not afraidLong live all the mountains we movedI had the time of my lifeFighting dragons with youI was screaming, "long live the look on your face"And bring on all the pretendersOne day we will be rememberedHold on to spinning aroundConfetti falls to the groundMay these memories break our fallCan you take a momentPromise me this:That you'll stand by me foreverBut if God forbid fate should step inAnd force us into a goodbyeIf you have children somedayWhen they point to the picturesPlease tell them my nameTell them how the crowds went wildTell them how I hope they shineLong live the walls we crashed throughI had the time of my life with youLong, long live the walls we crashed throughAll the kingdom lights shined just for me and youAnd I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"And bring on all the pretendersI'm not afraidSinging long live all the mountains we movedI had the time of my lifeFighting dragons with youAnd long, long live the look on your faceAnd bring on all the pretendersOne day, we will be remembered
