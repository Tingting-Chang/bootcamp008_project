There ain't nothing that can't be doneBy me and GodAin't nobody come in between me and GodOne day we'll live togetherWhere the angels trodMe and GodEarly in the morning talking it overMe and GodLate at night talking it overMe and GodYou could say we're like two peas in a podMe and GodHe's my fatherHe's my friendThe beginningAnd the endHe rules the worldWith a staff and rodWe're a teamMe and GodI am weak, and he is strongMe and GodHe forgives me when I'm wrongMe and GodHe's the one I lean onWhen life gets hardMe and GodHe's my fatherHe's my friendThe beginningAnd the endHe rules the worldWith a staff and rodWe're a teamMe and GodHe rules the worldWith a staff and rodWe're a teamMe and GodWe're a teamMe and God
