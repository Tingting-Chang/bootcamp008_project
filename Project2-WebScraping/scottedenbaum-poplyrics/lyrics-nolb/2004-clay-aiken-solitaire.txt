There was a man, a lonely manWho lost his love through his indifferenceA heart that cared, that went unsharedUntil it died in his silenceAnd Solitaire's the only game in townAnd every road that takes him, takes him downAnd by himself, it's easy to pretendHe'll never love againAnd keeping to himself he plays the gameWithout her love it always ends the sameWhile life goes on around him everywhereHe's playing SolitaireAnother day, a lonely daySo much to say that goes unspokenAnd through the night, his sleepless nightsHis eyes are closed, his heart is brokenAnd Solitaire's the only game in townAnd every road that takes him, takes him downAnd by himself it's easy to pretendShe's coming back againAnd keeping to himself he plays the gameWithout her love it always ends the sameWhile life goes on around him everywhereHe's playing solitaireA little hope, goes up in smokeJust how it goes, goes without sayingSolitaireAnd by himself it's easy to pretendHe'll never love againOhAnd keeping to himself he plays the gameWithout her love it always ends the sameWhile life goes on around him everywhereHe's playing solitaireSolitaire, solitaire
