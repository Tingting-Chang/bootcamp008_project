I feel terrible, sunlight's hurting my eyesSo I pull the shades and I make my place as black as nightI feel miserable and I'm missing you and meAnother Sunday morning all alone underneath these sheetsNo, I'm not hungover it's true, but I'm still not over youAll messed up, all strung out, I was sitting at home breaking downI'm not out there getting high underneath some neon lightsAin't no whiskey strong enough to make things rightI'm just getting over another sober Saturday nightBesides the pain, I don't feel a thingWhen my buddies call me up, I just let it ringNo, I'm not hungover it's true, but I'm still not over youAll messed up, all strung out, I was sitting at home breaking downI'm not out there getting high underneath some neon lightsAin't no whiskey strong enough to make things rightI'm just getting over another sober Saturday night
