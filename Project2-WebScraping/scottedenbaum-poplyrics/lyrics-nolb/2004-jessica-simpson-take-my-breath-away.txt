Watching every motionIn my foolish lover's gameOn this endless oceanFinally lovers know no shameTurning and returningTo some secret place and timeWatching in slow motionAs you turn around and sayTake my breath awayTake my breath awayWatching I keep waitingStill anticipating loveNever hesitatingTo become the fated onesTurning and returningWatching in slow motionAs you turn to me and sayTake my breath awayTake my breath awayThrough the hourglass I saw youIn time you slipped awayWhen the mirror crashed I called youAnd turned to hear you sayIf only for todayI am unafraidTake my breath awayTake my breath awayWatching everything motionIn this foolish lovers gameHaunted my the notionSomewhere there's a love in flamesTurning and returningTo some secret place insideWatching in slow motionAs you turn my way and sayTake my breath awayTake my breath away
