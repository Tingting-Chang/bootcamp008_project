It felt so easy in the morning sunWhen love was in season I was on the runI was lookin' for trouble and the thrill of the chaseLove was lookin' at me eye to eye, face to faceOne touch should've told me, try and understandLove was always a long shot to a gambling manWith a roll of the dice, girl I threw it awayNow I'm thinkin' 'bout you day and night, night and dayDidn't know it was loveDidn't know it was fateDidn't know it was destiny callin'Tell me it's never too lateWas I too blind to seeWhen push came to shoveYou were all that I neededDidn't know it was loveWasn't blind to the magic, you think I'm so toughTurnin' my back on the thunder, just ain't good enoughI keep trying to shake you, there just ain't no wayI've thinkin' 'bout you day and night, night and dayDidn't know it was loveDidn't know it was fateDidn't know it was destiny callin'Tell me it's never too lateWas I too blind to seeWhen push came to shoveYou were all that I neededDidn't know it was loveThose crazy nights on the borderlineDid my best to cut myself freeStood alone, just a prisonerNever knew you were holdin' the key, noI was lookin' for trouble and the thrill of the chaseLove was lookin' at me eye to eye, face to faceDidn't know it was loveDidn't know it was fateDidn't know it was destiny callin'Tell me it's never too lateWas I too blind to seeWhen push came to shoveYou were all that I neededDidn't know it was loveDidn't know it was loveDidn't know it was fate
