I wanted love, I needed loveMost of all, most of allSomeone said true love was deadAnd I'm bound to fall, bound to fall for youOh, what can I do? YeahTake my badge but my heart remainsLoving you, baby childTighten up on your reignsYou're running wild, running wild, it's trueSick for days, so many waysI'm aching now, I'm aching nowIt's times like these, I need reliefPlease show me how, oh, show me howTo get right, yes, out of sightWhen I was young and moving fastNothing slowed me down, oh, slowed me downNow I let the others passI've come around, oh, come around, 'cause I've foundLiving just to keep goingGoing just to be saneAll the while I knowIt's such a shameI don't need to get steadyI know just how I feelTelling you to be readyMy dear
