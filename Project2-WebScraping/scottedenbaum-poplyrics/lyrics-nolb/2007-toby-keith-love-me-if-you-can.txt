Sometimes I think that war is necessaryEvery night I pray for peace on EarthI hand out my dollars to the homelessBut believe that every able soul should workMy father gave me my shotgunThat I'll hand down to my sonTry to teach him everything it meansI'm a man of my convictionsCall me wrong, call me rightBut I bring my better angels to every fightYou may not like where I'm goingBut you sure know where I standHate me if you want toLove me if you canI stand by my right to speak freelyBut I worry 'bout what kids learn from TVAnd before all of debatin' turns to angry words and hateSometimes we should just agree to disagreeAnd I believe that Jesus looks down here and sees usAnd if you ask him he would sayI'm a man of my convictionsCall me wrong, call me rightBut I bring my better angels to every fightYou may not like where I'm goingBut you sure know where I standHate me if you want toLove me if you canI'm a man of my convictionsCall me wrong, call me rightBut I bring my better angels to every fightYou may not like where I'm goingBut you sure know where I standHate me if you want toLove me if you can
