Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrowWho else is gonna bring you a bottle of rainThere he goes moving across the waterThere he goes turning my whole world aroundDo you feel what I feelCan we make it so that's part of the dealI gotta hold you in these arms of steelLay your heart on the line this timeI want to breathe when you breatheWhen you whisper like that hot summer breezeCount the beads of sweat that cover meDidn't you show me a sign this timeWho else is gonna bring you a broken arrowWho else is gonna bring you a bottle of rainThere he goes moving across the waterThere he goes turning my whole world around, aroundDo you feel what I feelDo you feel what I feelAh can you see what I seeCan you cut behind the mysteryI will meet you by the witness treeLeave the whole world behindI want to come when you callI'll get to you if I have to crawlThey can't hold me with these iron wallsWe got mountains to climb, to climbWho else is gonna bring you a broken arrowWho else is gonna bring you a bottle of rainThere he goes moving across the waterThere he goes turning my whole world aroundTurning my whole world aroundTurning my whole world aroundTurning my whole world around
