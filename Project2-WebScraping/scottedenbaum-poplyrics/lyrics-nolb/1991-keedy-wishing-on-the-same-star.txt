It's so hard to leave youI don't really wanna goI don't wanna say goodbye to youIt's the last thing I wanna doBut I won't be sad now'Cause till you're in my arms againYou'll be inside of my heartAnd wherever I goWe'll never really be apartWe'll be wishing on the same starLooking at the same moonWhen you're thinking of me, babyI'll be thinking of youAnd no matter where I goI will be there with youWishing on the same starLooking at the same moonIt's not really overBaby, it will never beLong as you keep me in your heartI'll be there anywhere you areAnd when you feel sadRemember all the love we sharedAnd when you're feeling aloneWell just look up in the skyOh and baby, so will IWe'll be wishing on the same starLooking at the same moonWhen you're thinking of me, babyI'll be thinking of youNo matter where you turn aroundIt's the same sun that keeps shining downWherever we'll beI know that we'll beWe'll be wishing on the same starLooking at the same moonWhen you're thinking of me, babyI'll be thinking of you
