I'll never let you goNever let you goI'll hold you tight all nightI'll never let you goI've had my share of heartache and painI've been with users, and losersAnd seen all of their gamesBut no one makes me feel the way you doThere was a time when I was so all aloneThere was no lover, no otherI could call my ownBut now that I met youThose days are throughI'll never let you goI'll keep you on my heartNever let you goUntil the end of timeI'll hold you tight all nightNever let you goYou are the earth and I am the seaThe world together, foreverI'll be all that you needYou and I were always meant to beIf you should leaveAnd go your own wayI'll still love, I will surviveFor every night I prayIf you will find your wayRight back to meI'll never let you goI'll keep you on my heartNever let you goUntil the end of timeI'll hold you tight all nightNever let you goDay after day and night after nightI screamed your name and you just cameNow everythings alrightLoving you has made my life completeWhen I'm with youIt's like a dream has come trueMy emotions start to blowMy skies are blue and my eyes gaze on youAnd I think that you should knowI'll never let you goI'll keep you on my heartNever let you goUntil the end of timeI'll hold you tight all nightNever let you goI'll keep you on my heartNever let you goUntil the end of timeI'll hold you tight all nightNever let you go
