We were born to mothers who smoked and drankOur cribs were covered in lead based paintNo child proof lids, no seat belts in carsRode bikes with no helmets and still here we are, still here we areWe got daddy's belt when we misbehavedHad three TV channels you got up to changeNo video games and no satelliteAll we had were friends and they were outside, playin' outsideIt was a different lifeWhen we were boys and girlsNot just a different timeIt was a different worldSchool always started the same every dayThe pledge of allegiance then someone would prayNot every kid made the team when they triedWe got disappointed and that was all right, we turned out all rightIt was a different lifeWhen we were boys and girlsNot just a different timeIt was a different worldNo bottled water, we drank from a garden hoseAnd every Sunday, all the stores were closedIt was a different lifeWhen we were boys and girlsNot just a different timeIt was a different worldIt was a different lifeWhen we were boys and girlsNot just a different timeIt was a different worldIt was a different world
