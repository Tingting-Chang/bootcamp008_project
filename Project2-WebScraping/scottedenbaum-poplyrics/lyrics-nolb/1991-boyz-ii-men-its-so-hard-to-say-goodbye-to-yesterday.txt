How do I say goodbye to what we had?The good times that made us laughOutweigh the badI thought we'd get to see foreverBut forever's gone awayIt's so hard to say goodbye to yesterdayI don't know where this roadIs going to leadAll I know is where we've beenAnd what we've been throughand if we get to see tomorrowI hope it's worth all the waitso hard to say goodbye to yesterdayAnd I'll take with me the memoriesTo be my sunshine after the rainIt's so hard to say goodbye to yesterdayAnd I'll take with me the memoriesTo be my sunshine after the rainIt's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
