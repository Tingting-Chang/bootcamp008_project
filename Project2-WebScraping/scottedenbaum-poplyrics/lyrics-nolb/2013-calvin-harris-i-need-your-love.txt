I need your loveI need your timeWhen everything's wrongYou make it rightI feel so highI come aliveI need to be free with you tonightI need your loveI need your loveI take a deep breath every time I pass your doorI know you're there but I can't see you anymoreAnd that's the reason you're in the darkI've been a stranger ever since we fell apartI feel so out of seaWatch my eyes are filled with fearTell me do you feel the sameHold me in your arms againI need your loveI need your timeWhen everything's wrongYou make it rightI feel so highI go aliveI need to be free with you tonightI need your loveI need your loveNow I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?I walk in circles but I never make it outWhat I mean to you, do I belongI try to fight this but I know I'm not that strongAnd I feel so helpless hereWatch my eyes are filled with fearTell me do you feel the sameHold me in your arms againI need your loveI need your timeWhen everything's wrongYou make it rightI feel so highI come aliveI need to be free with you tonightI need your loveI need your loveAll the yearsAll the timesYou were never been to blameAnd now my eyes are openAnd now my heart is closingAnd all the tearsAll the liesAll the wasteI've been trying to make it changeAnd now my eyes are openI need your loveI need your timeWhen everything's wrongYou make it rightI feel so highI come aliveI need to be free
