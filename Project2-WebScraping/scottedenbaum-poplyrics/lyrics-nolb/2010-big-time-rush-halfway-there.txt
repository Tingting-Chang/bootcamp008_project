If we never flewWe would never fallIf the world was oursWe would have it allBut the life we liveIsn't so simplisticYou just don't get what you wantSo we take what comesAnd we keep on goingLeaning on each other's shouldersThen we turn aroundAnd see we've come so far somehowWe're halfway thereWe're looking good nowAnd nothing's gonna get in the wayWe're halfway thereAnd looking back nowI never thought that I'd ever sayWe're halfway thereWe're halfway thereWhen the chips are downBack against the wallGot no more to give'Cause we gave it allSeems like going a distance is unrealisticBut we're too far from the startSo we take what comes, And we keep on goingLeaning on each other's shouldersThen we turn aroundAnd see we've come so far somehowWe're halfway thereWe're looking good nowAnd nothing's gonna get in the wayWe're halfway thereAnd looking back nowI never thought that I'd ever sayWe're halfway thereWe're halfway thereHow you ever gonna reach the starsIf you never get off the groundAnd you'll always be where you areIf you let life knock you downWe're halfway thereWe're looking good nowAnd nothing's gonna get in the wayWe're halfway thereAnd looking back nowI never thought that I'd ever sayWe're halfway thereWe're halfway thereWe're halfway thereWe're halfway thereWe're halfway thereWe're halfway thereWe're halfway thereWe're halfway there
