Since you came inside my lifeYou've given me the bestIn you every day and nightI found my happiness in youMake me want to rideTo the end of any valleyThen you give me peace of mindYou bring me comfort to my soulNo will never let you knowMake me want to flyTo the top of every rainbowI love you more every dayYou show me love in every wayThere's nothing left for me to sayBut I love youI love you more every dayYou show your love in every wayThere's nothing left for me to sayBut I love youSo promise you will never leaveYou never say this is the endYou'll spend your life with meYou'll be my wifeAnd my best friendRaise a familySomething we both can treasureOh yeahIn the mean timeI'm goin' put in workYou'll goin' be fineYou'll never have to workSo won't you come and fly with meForever you and meThe times we supposed to beI love you onlyI love you more every dayYou show me love in every wayThere's nothing left for me to sayBut I love youI love you more every dayYou show your love in every wayThere's nothing left for me to sayBut I love youI don't stop loving youAnd I won't stop kissing youYou're the reason why I smileAnd I won't stop holding youAnd I won't stop loving youYou're the reason why I smileI love you more every dayYou show me love in every wayThere's nothing left for me to sayBut I love youI love you more every dayYou show your love in every wayThere's nothing left for me to sayBut I love you
