She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigaretteShe broke his heart, he spent his whole life tryin' to forgetWe watched him drink his pain away a little at a timeBut he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mindUntil the nightHe put that bottle to his head and pulled the triggerAnd finally drank away her memoryLife is short, but this time it was biggerThan the strength he had to get up off his kneesWe found him with his face down in the pillowWith a note that said, 'I'll love her till I die.'And when we buried him beneath the willowThe angels sang a whiskey lullabyThe rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herselfFor years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breathShe finally drank her pain away a little at a timeBut she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mindUntil the nightShe put that bottle to her head and pulled the triggerAnd finally drank away his memoryLife is short, but this time it was biggerThan the strength she had to get up off her kneesWe found her with her face down in the pillowClinging to his picture for dear lifeWe laid her next to him beneath the willowWhile the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
