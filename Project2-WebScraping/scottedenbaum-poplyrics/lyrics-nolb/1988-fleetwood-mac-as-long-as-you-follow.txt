I've been searchingFor a pot of goldLike the kind you findAt the end of the rainbowI've been dreamingThought it was in vainAh, But now you're hereCan't believe that you're back againNow I know I can't loseAs long as you followI'm gonna winI'm gonna beg, steal, or borrowAs Long as you followI've been wanderingGone away too farBut the road was roughTo get back where you areAnd the sun went downNever seem to riseAh, but now you're hereWith the light shining in your eyesNow I know I can't loseAs long as you followI'm gonna winI'm gonna beg, steal, or borrowYes, I can live todayIf you give me tomorrowAs long as you followNow I know I can't loseAs long as you followI'm gonna winI'm gonna beg, steal, or borrowYes, I can live todayIf you give me tomorrowAs long as you follow
