Take me in your arms caress me gently oh I can't get enoughThrill me say the word I will surrender to your poetic charmsWhen the night falls I hear seductive voicessing romantic songs of love let's get intimateTurn the lights down it's time to get romanticYou and me romantic now.Light a candle it's time to get romanticthe night has just begun oh baby we're gonna make itKiss me I feel waves of steamy passion I'm burning with desireFree me from the heat my heart's on fire 'causeI still need your love under the moonlight with stars shining so brightbaby my mind is on love when we get home tonightTurn the lights down it's time to get romanticYou and me romantic now.Light a candle it's time to get romantic
