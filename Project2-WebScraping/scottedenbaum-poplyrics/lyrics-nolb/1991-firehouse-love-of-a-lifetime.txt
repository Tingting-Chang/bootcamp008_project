I guess the time was right for us to sayWe'd take our time and live our lives together day by dayWe'll make a wish and send it on a prayerWe know our dreams can all come trueWith love that we can shareWith you I never wonder, Will you be there for meWith you I never wonder, You're the right one for meI finally found the love of a lifetimeA love to last my whole life throughI finally found the love of a lifetimeForever in my heart, I finally found the love of a lifetimeWith every kiss our love is like brand-newAnd every star up in the sky was made for me and youStill we both know that the road is long(But) We know that we will be togetherBecause our love is strong
