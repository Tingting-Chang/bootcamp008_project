Feeling my way through the darknessGuided by a beating heartI can't tell where the journey will endBut I know where to startThey tell me I'm too young to understandThey say I'm caught up in a dreamWell life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyesWell that's fine by meSo wake me up when it's all overWhen I'm wiser and I'm olderAll this time I was finding myselfAnd I didn't know﻿ I was lostSo wake me up when it's all overWhen I'm wiser and I'm olderAll this time I was finding myselfAnd I didn't know﻿ I was lostI tried carrying the weight of the worldBut I only have two handsI hope I get the chance to travel the worldAnd I don't have any plansI wish that I could stay forever this youngNot afraid to close my eyesLife's a game﻿ made for everyoneAnd love is a prizeSo wake﻿ me up when it's all overWhen I'm wiser and I'm olderAll this time I was finding myselfAnd I didn't know I was lostSo wake me up when it's all overWhen I'm wiser and I'm olderAll this time I was finding myselfAnd I didn't know﻿ I was lostI didn't know I was lostI didn't know I was lostI didn't know I was lostI didn't know I was lost
