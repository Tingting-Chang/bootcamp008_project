Well the streets are all crowdedLots of people aroundAnd there's music playingBut I can't hear a soundJust the sound of the rainFalling silently downLivin' ain't been livin'Since you put downYeah, life goes on around me every dayBut it might as well be half a million miles awayIt's like a ghost town without your loveLike a ghost town without your loveLike a ghost town, baby, can't you see?It's a ghost town until you come back to meoh, oh, till you come back to meWell I wish I still had youHad you here next to meBaby, where did you go?Baby, why did you leave?Though the world, it keeps turnin'But it don't turn for meWithout you in my lifeMy life ain't no place to beThere's only lonely days and empty nightsAin't the same without you, baby, nothin' feelin' rightDarlin', I want to leave this townDon't want to be aroundI'm gonna leave this town
