There ain?t no easy way to start this conversationSo I?ll just say what?s on my mindOnce our hearts both shared a common destinationTo love until the end of timeLately we?ve been drifting further from each otherSomeone?s gotta take the wheelI won?t wait until it?s too late to recoverSo let me tell you how I feelI?ll do anything if it?ll bring our hearts togetherI?ll stand and fight or get down on my kneesIf we can fix what?s wrong and just go on in love foreverBaby I?ll be beggin? pleaseI?m strong enough to handle any situationBut honey true love has no prideSo I can say without a moments hesitationBefore I?ll let you say goodbyeI?ll do anything if it?ll bring our hearts togetherI?ll stand and fight or get down on my kneesIf we can fix what?s wrong and just go on in love foreverBaby I?ll be beggin? pleaseBoy you know your love?s my one true weaknessWhen it comes to you I?m helplessI?ll do anything if it?ll bring our hearts togetherI?ll stand and fight or get down on my kneesIf we can fix what?s wrong and just go on in love foreverBaby I?ll be beggin? please...please
