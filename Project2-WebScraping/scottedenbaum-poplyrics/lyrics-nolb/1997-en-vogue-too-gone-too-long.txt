Did I hear you say that you want another chanceYou need another tryYou're ready to reclaim your prizeSo you want my love backWhy did you let it slip awayWhy did you every let me goYour change of heart has come to lateWell the door is lockedYou can't get inThe game is changedYou've been too gone too long babyTo ever get back again in my heartToo gone too long babyYou're too many tears too lateTo ever come back, to get back in my armsBeen gone, too gone, too longDid you hear me say thatYou'd be a fool to leaveYou'd regret the road youn choseYou'd come running right back to meYou had such a good love, sugarYou'd never find with no one elseWhat I knew all the timeYou had to find out for yourselfBut now you'll never know the love againYou're on you ownYou've been too gone too long babyTo ever get back again in my heartToo gone too long babyYou're too many tears too lateTo ever come back, to get back in my armsBeen gone, too gone, too longDid you really think I'd take you backLet you right in my life babyJust like thatSomeone new is loving me
