Street lights along the highwayThrowing shadows in the darkAnd the memories keep on turningTo the rhythm of a broken heartYou only need a roof when it's rainingYou only need a fire when it's coldYou only need a drink when the whiskeyIs the only thing that you have left to holdSun comes up and goes back downAnd falling feels like flying till you hit the groundSay the word and I'll be there for youBaby, I will be your parachuteParachuteThere's a song that I rememberI never learned to playAnd a lifetime of forgotten wordsI never got to sayYou only need a roof when it's rainingYou only need a fire when it's coldYou only need a drink when the whiskeyIs the only thing that you have left to holdSun comes up and goes back downAnd falling feels like flying till you hit the groundSay the word and I'll be there for youBaby, I will be your parachuteParachuteIf you think you're going downJust know I will be aroundYou only need a roof when it's rainingYou only need a fire when it's coldYou only need a drink when the whiskeyIs the only thing that you have left to holdSun comes up and goes back downAnd falling feels like flying till you hit the groundSay the word and I'll be there for youBaby, I will be yourBaby I will be your parachuteParachute
