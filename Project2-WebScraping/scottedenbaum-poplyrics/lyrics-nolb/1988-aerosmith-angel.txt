I'm alone, yeah, I don't know if I can face the nightI'm in tears and the cryin' that I do is for youI want your loveLet's break the walls between usDon't make it toughI'll put away my prideEnough's enoughI've suffered and I've seen the lightBayayby, you're my angelCome and save me tonightYou're my angelCome and make it alrightDon't know what I'm gonna do about this feeling insideYes it's true, loneliness took me for a rideWithout your love I'm nothing but a beggarWithout your love a dog without a boneWhat can I do? I'm sleepin' in this bed aloneBayayby, you're my angelCome and save me tonightYou're my angelCome and make it alright
