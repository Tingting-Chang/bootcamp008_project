Well, I'll never forget the first time that I heardThat pretty mouth say that dirty wordAnd I can't even remember now what she backed my truck intoBut she covered her mouth and her face got redAnd she just looked so darn cuteThat I couldn't' even act like I was madYeah, I live for little moments like thatWell, that's just like last year on my birthdayShe lost all track of time and burnt the cakeAnd every smoke detector in the house was goin' offAnd she was just about to cry until I took her in my armsAnd I tried not to let her see me laughYeah, I live for little moments like thatI know she's not perfect but she tries so hard for meAnd I thank God that she isn't 'cause how boring would that beIt's the little imperfections, it's the sudden change in plansWhen she misreads the directions and we're lost but holding handsYeah, I live for little moments like thatWhen she's layin' on my shoulder on the sofa in the darkAnd about the time she falls asleep so does my right armAnd I want so bad to move it 'cause it's tinglin' and it's numbBut she looks so much like an angel that I don't wanna wake her upYeah, I live for little momentsWhen she steals my heart again and doesn't even know itYeah, I live for little moments like that
