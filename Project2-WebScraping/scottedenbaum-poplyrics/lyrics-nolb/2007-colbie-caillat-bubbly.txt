Will you count me in?I've been awake for a while nowYou've got me feelin' like a child now'Cause every time I see your bubbly faceI get the tingles in a silly placeIt starts in my toes, and I crinkle my noseWhere ever it goes I always knowThat you make me smile, please, stay for a while nowJust take your time wherever you goThe rain is fallin' on my window paneBut we are hidin' in a safer placeUnder covers stayin' dry and warmYou give me feelings that I adoreIt starts in my toes, make me crinkle my noseWherever it goes I always knowThat you make me smile, please, stay for a while nowJust take your time wherever you goBut what am I gonna say?When you make me feel this wayI just, mmmAnd it starts in my toes, makes me crinkle my noseWherever it goes I always knowThat you make me smile, please, stay for a while nowJust take your time wherever you goI've been asleep for a while nowYou tucked me in just like a child now'Cause every time you hold me in your armsI'm comfortable enough to feel your warmthIt starts in my soul, and I lose all controlWhen you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows'Cause you make me smile, baby, just take your time nowHoldin' me tightWherever, wherever, wherever you goWherever, wherever, wherever you goWherever you go I always know'Cause you make me smile, even just for a while
