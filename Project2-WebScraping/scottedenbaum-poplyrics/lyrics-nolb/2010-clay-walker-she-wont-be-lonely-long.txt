Somethin' 'bout the way she's wearing her dress a little tighterSomethin' 'bout the way she's starin'--she's lookin' to start a fireSomethin' 'bout the way she's dancin' and drinkin' chilled patronIf she's lonely now, she won't be lonely longHeaven help the fool who did her wrongIt's too late, too bad: she's too far goneHe should've thought of that before he left her all aloneIf she's lonely now, she won't be lonely longSomethin' 'bout the way she's blushin'--you can tell she isn't sureLet you know she's up to something she's never done beforeTonight she wants to hold a stranger, but not the one at homeIf she's lonely now, she won't be lonely longHeaven help the fool who did her wrongIt's too late, too bad: she's too far goneHe should've thought of that before he left her all aloneIf she's lonely now, she won't be lonely longIf I had a woman like thatMan I'd let her knowI'd hold her tightI'd hold her closeDo anything, do everything to let her knowShe'd never ever be aloneHeaven help the fool who did her wrongIt's too late, too bad, she's too far goneHe should've thought of that before he left her all aloneIf she's lonely now, Lord, if she's lonely nowIf she's lonely now, she won't be lonely long
