She's her momma's babyShe's her daddy's pride and joyThey've kept her under wrapsShe ain't been hangin' outWith any ugly acting boysHardly ever been kissedTwenty years of innocenceJust what I'm looking forI want to be the man, holding her handWhen she can't hold it back anymoreGood little girls make some mighty wild womenBeen saving it up since the very beginningWhen they fall in loveThey want to take it to the limitGood little girls make some mighty wild womenShe's never been to Vegas, or danced in a Honky TonkNo trail of broken heartsAlthough she looks the partThat ain't the kind of life she wantsShe's waitin' for a gold ringBefore she trys her wingsThat's what I'm waitin' forI want to be the man holding her handWhen she can't hold it back anymoreGood little girls make some mighty wild womenBeen saving it up since the very beginningWhen they fall in loveThey want to take it to the limitGood little girls make some mighty wild women
