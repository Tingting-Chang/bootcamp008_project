I haven't been to church since I don't remember whenThings were going great 'til they fell apart againSo I listened to the preacher as he told me what to doHe said you can't go hating others who have done wrong to youSometimes we get angry, but we must not condemnLet the good Lord do His job and you just pray for themI pray your brakes go out running down a hillI pray a flowerpot falls from a window sill and knocks you in the head like I'd like toI pray your birthday comes and nobody callsI pray you're flying high when your engine stallsI pray all your dreams never come trueJust know wherever you are honey, I pray for youI'm really glad I found my way to church'Cause I'm already feeling better and I thank God for the wordsYeah I'm going take the high roadAnd do what the preacher told me to doYou keep messing up and I'll keep praying for youI pray your tire blows out at 110I pray you pass out drunk with your best friend and wake up with his and her tattoos
