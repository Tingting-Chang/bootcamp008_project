Kiss today goodbye,The sweetness and the sorrow.Wish me luck, the same to you.But I can't regretWhat I did for love, what I did for love.Look my eyes are dry.The gift was ours to borrow.It's as if we always knew,And I won't forget what I did for love,What I did for love.Gone,Love is never gone.As we travel on,Love's what we'll remember.Kiss today goodbye,And point me t'ward tomorrow.We did what we had to do.Won't forget, can't regretWhat I did forLoveWhat I did forLoveWhat I did for...Love Love is never gone.As we travel on,Love's what we'll remember.Kiss today goodbye,And point me t'ward tomorrow.We did what we had to do.Won't forget, can't regretWhat I did forLoveWhat I did forLoveWhat I did for...Love
