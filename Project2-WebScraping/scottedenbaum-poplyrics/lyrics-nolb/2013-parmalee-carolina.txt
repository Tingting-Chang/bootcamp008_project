Home is where my heart is still beatin'I don't know when I'll see her againI hate to see her cry when I'm leavin'Now I'm a thousand miles away againAnd she feels like Carolina, looks like CaliforniaShining like those New York lights on BroadwayWhen she looks back I'm behind herI'll always be there for herShe makes me feel like home's not so far awayShe feels like CarolinaIt's hard to understand the way I'm livingAnd I know you think I'm never coming homeBut I miss your pretty smile, and I'm coming back in a little whileBut I'm a thousand miles away againAnd she feels like Carolina, looks like CaliforniaShining like those New York lights on BroadwayWhen she looks back I'm behind herI'll always be there for herShe makes me feel like home's not so far awayNo matter how far I go, you know I can't stop thinking about herAnd there's nothing like the way I feel, the way I feel when I'm beside herOh, oh, oh, ohOh, oh, oh, ohShe feels like Carolina, looks like CaliforniaShiny like those New York lights on BroadwayWhen she looks back I'm behind herI'll always be there for herShe makes me feel like home's not so far awayCarolina, CaliforniaLike home's not so far awayShe feels like Carolina, looks like CaliforniaShe makes me feel like home's not so far awayShe makes me feel like home's not so far away
