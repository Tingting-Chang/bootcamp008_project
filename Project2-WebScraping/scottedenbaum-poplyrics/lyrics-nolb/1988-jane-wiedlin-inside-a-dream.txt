This is not an easy lifeIt's hard to hang on to hopeThere's so many things that need to changeWell I wonder how we'll copeBut I know where to goRun away, run away[Chorus:]And lose myself inside a dreamOpening up a secret doorI lose myself inside a dreamAnd find a world worth living for (living for)There is way too much to graspAm I losing holdIn a world full of many problemsI feel no control[Chorus:]And lose myself inside a dreamOpening up a secret doorI lose myself inside a dreamAnd find a world worth living for (living for)[Chorus:]And lose myself inside a dreamOpening up a secret doorI lose myself inside a dreamAnd find a world worth living for (living for)Only a dreamerCan keep the dream aliveI'll work and pray and sweat and slaveUntil the dream is realized[Chorus:]And lose myself inside a dreamOpening up a secret doorI lose myself inside a dreamAnd find a world worth living for (living for)(Until Fade)
