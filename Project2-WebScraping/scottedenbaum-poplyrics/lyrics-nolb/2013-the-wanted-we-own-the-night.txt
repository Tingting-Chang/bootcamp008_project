May our hearts be full like our drinks tonightMay we sing and dance 'til we lose our mindsWe are only young if we seize the nightTonight we own the nightTonight we own the nightLa la la la laLa la la la laWhen my time is over, lying in my graveWritten on my tombstone, I want it to say,"This man was a legend, a legend of his time.When he was at a party, the party never died."Hey, everybody's got a dream so what do you sayAre we making history?May our hearts be full like our drinks tonightMay we sing and dance 'til we lose our mindsWe are only young if we seize the nightTonight we own the nightTonight we own the nightLa la la la laLa la la la laFor tonight I'm famous, for tonight I'm kingAnd I will be remembered for centuries. They'll say,"This man was a hero, a hero of the night.When he was at a party, the party never died."Hey, I'm a little drunk but I got something to say(Hold your jars!)May our hearts be full like our drinks tonightMay we sing and dance 'til we lose our mindsWe are only young if we seize the nightTonight we own the nightAnd let us wake up inside of stranger's bedLet us drink until there is nothing leftAnd this night, my friends, we will not forgetTonight we own the nightTonight we own the nightMay our hearts be full like our drinks tonightMay we sing and dance 'til we lose our mindsWe are only young if we seize the nightTonight we own the nightTonight we own the night
