So you say that you can't go onLove left you cryin'And you say all your hope is goneAnd what's the use in tryin'?What you need is to have some faithShake off those sad bluesGet yourself a new viewOh, nothing is as sad as it seems, you know'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartacheSomeday you'll laugh at the painSomehow you'll get through the heartacheSomehow you can get through the rain[Chorus]When love puts you through the fireWhen love puts you through the testNothing cures a broken heartLike time, love, and tendernessWhen you think your world is overBaby, just remember thisNothing heals a broken heartLike time, love, and tendernessTime, love, and tendernessI understand how you're feeling nowAnd what you've been throughBut your world's gonna turn aroundSo, baby, don't you be blueAll it takes is a little timeTo make it betterThe hurt won't last foreverOh, all the tears are gonna dry you know'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartacheSomeday you'll laugh at the painYou may be down on your luckBut, baby, that old luck's gonna change[Chorus]Baby, oh baby you just need someYou just need someTime, love, and tendernessTime, love, and tendernessThe hurt ain't gonna last foreverTime, love, and tendernessTime, love, and tenderness
