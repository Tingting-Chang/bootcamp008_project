Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping handPut a little love in your heartYou see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitatePut a little love in your heartAnd the world will be a better placeAnd the world will be a better place for you and meYou just wait and seeAnother day goes by, and still the children cryPut a little love in your heartIf you want the world to know, we won't let hatred growPut a little love in your heartAnd the world will be a better placeAnd the world will be a better place for you and meYou just wait and see. Wait and see
