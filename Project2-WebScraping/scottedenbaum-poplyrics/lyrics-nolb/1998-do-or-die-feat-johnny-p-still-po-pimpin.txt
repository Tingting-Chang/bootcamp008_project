If there was a perfect nightThis might be the oneFor telling you the way I feelAnd just how real we've becomeIf I'm anxious and a little uptightIt's because I want to ask you this right(Chorus)If I never stop loving youWill you never start wanting me tooSay you won't and that's what I'll doFor forever with a heart so trueIf you'll start and end everydayAlways never wanting me to go awayAll I'm ever gonna doIs never stop loving youForgive me I'm a little bit nervousI really rehearsed what to sayIt's funny in front of the mirrorMy words sounded clearer todayIn my heart I've got it straight in my headI mean everything I think I just said(Repeat Chorus)
