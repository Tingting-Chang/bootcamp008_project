Someone I know is staring at meAnd when I look into her eyesI see a girl that I used to beI hardly recognize'cause in the space of a yearI've watched the old me disappearAll of the things I once held preciousJust don't mean anything anymore'cause suddenlyYou came, and changed the way I feelNo one could love you moreBecause you came and turned my life aroundNo one could take your placeI've never felt good with permanent thingsNow I don't want anything to changeYou can't imagine the joy you bringMy life won't be the sameAnd I'll be there when you callI'll pick you up if you should fall'cause I have never felt such inspirationNobody else ever gave me more becauseYou came, and changed the way I feelNo one could love you moreBecause you came and turned my life aroundNo one could take your place
