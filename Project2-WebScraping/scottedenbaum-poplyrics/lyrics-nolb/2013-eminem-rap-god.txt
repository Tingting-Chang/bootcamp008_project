Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotentLet off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'And I should not be wokenI'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floatingBut I got your mom deep throatingI'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodleI'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupilIt's me, my honesty's brutalBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do thoughFor good at least once in a whileSo I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodleEnough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough timesBut I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsignedRappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtimeI know there was a time where once IWas king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grindSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combineAppeal with the skin color of mineYou get too big and here they come trying to,Censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Marshall Mathers LPOne where I tried to say I take seven kids from ColumbinePut 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nineSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'veMorphed into an immortal coming through the portalYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004 thoughAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme forYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrowsYou're like normal, fuck being normalAnd I just bought a new Raygun from the futureTo just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's padSingin' to a man while they played pianoMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channelSo Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a humanWhat I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhumanInnovative and I'm made of rubberSo that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to youI'm never stating, more than never demonstratingHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitatingNever fading, and I know that the haters are forever waitingFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebratingCause I know the way to get 'em motivatedI make elevating music, you make elevator musicOh, he's too mainstreamWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse itIt's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse itWith rock, shock rap with DocThrow on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose itI don't know how to make songs like thatI don't know what words to useLet me know when it occurs to youWhile I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as youIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' youHow many verses I gotta murder to,Prove that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!School flunkie, pill junkyBut look at the accolades the skills brung meFull of myself, but still hungryI bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind toAnd I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tonguesBut it's still tongue in cheek, fuck youI'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seatBumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funkyBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and strugglingAngels fight with devils, here's what they want from meThey asking me to eliminate some of the women hateBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I hadThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situationAnd understand the discriminationBut fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade thenBut if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?Don't mistake it for SatanIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseasAnd take a vacation to trip a broadAnd make her fall on her face and don't be a retardBe a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?
