Somebody was spreading rumors,'Bout better days a comin'.Why was I hummin',As if I knew,One and the same?But I just whispered your name.Somebody was sayin' something,'Bout there being an end to tyranny.But when they asked me,What would I do,If that day came,I only whispered your name.Everyone got their own opinion,And protects their own dominion.No doubt, for them, it's true.But I tell them what I really believe;My only worry is protecting you.No one should ever be lonely.We'd all find somebody to care.Ask me if I dare.To answer whoCould carry that flame,I'd just whisper your name.
