You, with your words like knivesAnd swords and weapons that you use against meYou, have knocked me off my feet again,Got me feeling like a nothingYou, with your voice like nailsOn a chalk board, calling me out when I'm woundedYou, picking on the weaker manYou can take me downWith just one single blowBut you don't know what you don't knowSomeday I'll be living in a big old cityAnd all you're ever gonna be is meanSomeday I'll be big enough so you can't hit meAnd all you're ever gonna be is meanWhy you gotta be so mean?You, with your switching sidesAnd your wildfire lies and your humiliationYou have pointed out my flaws againAs if I don't already see themI walk with my head down,Try to block you out 'cause I never impress youI just want to feel okay againI bet you got pushed aroundSomebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now'Cause you can't lead me down that roadAnd you don't know what you don't knowSomeday I'll be living in a big old cityAnd all you're ever gonna be is meanSomeday I'll be big enough so you can't hit meAnd all you're ever gonna be is meanWhy you gotta be so mean?And I can see you years from now in a barTalking over a football gameWith that same big loud opinionBut nobody's listening, washed up and rantingAbout the same old bitter thingsDrunk and grumbling on about how I can't singBut all you are is meanAll you are is mean and a liar and patheticAnd alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and meanBut someday I'll be living in a big old cityAnd all you're ever gonna be is meanYeah someday I'll be big enoughSo you can't hit meAnd all you're ever gonna be is meanWhy you gotta be so (mean)Someday I'll be living in a big old city(Why you gotta be so mean)And all you're ever gonna be is mean(Why you gotta be so mean)Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me(Why you gotta be so mean)And all you're ever gonna be is meanWhy you gotta be so mean?
