<h3>Introduction</h3><p>Undeterred by the occasional e-coli and frequent gastrointestinal marathons, Chipotle’s super fans religiously eat their burritos.</p><p>There are the fanatics. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reallyslowfour/">Devin Cunningham</a> ate Chipotle 425 days in a row (and is in better shape than you). <a href="http://chipotlife.com/">Andrew Hawryluk</a> pledged to eat Chipotle everyday for Lent and then continued eating Chipotle for 186 days. <a href="http://kdvr.com/2015/07/22/colorado-springs-man-gains-internet-fame-for-eating-at-chipotle-for-109-straight-days/">Mark Rantal</a> gobbled down Chipotle for at least 109 straight days.</p><p>Then, there are the more casual devotees. Chipotle’s offered rewards to their addicts with their summer Chiptopia promotion and had to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2016/10/03/chipotle-to-pay-out-over-20-million-in-chiptopia-catering-rewards.html">pay out</a> over $20 million.</p><p>As a frequent eater of Chipotle in New York, I’ve always noticed that the price of burrito is much less than Chipotles in my hometown in the Chicago area. There is some <a href="https://qz.com/210428/chipotles-prices-are-rising-faster-than-expected-but-customers-dont-care/">limited</a> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-chipotle-burrito-prices-vary-by-city-2013-10">discussion</a> on the web about Chipotle price variance, but there hasn’t been a rigorous look at it.</p><p>Curious about price differences, and with the super fans in mind, I decided to take a deep dive into Chipotle data.</p><p>With some help from a couple undocumented APIs with info on Chipotle online ordering prices and food shortages, I’ve been able to get an almost complete set of data on Chipotle restaurants. (I've pricing data f0r 2,176 Chipotles. The data was collected on Jan 9,2017. Their Q4 2016 reports states they operate 2250 restaurants.) I’ve complemented this dataset with Yelp rating data ( as of Jan 27,2017), sale tax data, cost of living data, US Census data, and CPI data.</p>
