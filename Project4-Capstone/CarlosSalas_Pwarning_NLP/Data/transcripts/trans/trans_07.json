Today, we reported another record third quarter for Danaher. We are pleased with our team's execution which drove solid core growth, earnings performance and free cash flow. In a weakening global macro environment, we saw the positive impact of the Danaher Business System across our portfolio. Our consistent pace of new product introductions and go-to-market initiatives led to mid single digit growth or better for several of our operating companies, including Hach, Trojan, ChemTreat, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX, Videojet and Matco. We're also making steady progress on the separation front. This quarter we announced many key leadership positions for both NewCo and Danaher and began to identify new growth opportunities for many of our associates. With strong teams in place at both companies we remain on track to complete the separation in 2016. So with that as a backdrop, let's move on to the details of the quarter.", "Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were up 6% to $1.05. Reported revenue grew 6.5% to $5 billion, while core revenues increased 3%. Acquisitions increased our revenue by 10.5% while currency translation was a 7% headwind.", "Geographically, growth rates were balanced between the developed and the high-growth markets. Within the developed markets, the U.S. remained steady, growing at a low single digit rate, while Western Europe increased mid single digits as a result of share gains in a number of our businesses. In the high-growth markets, demand was mixed with strength in India partially offset by weakness in Brazil, Russia, and the Middle East. In China, growth moderated slightly from first half levels but still grew mid single digits in the quarter.", "Third quarter gross margin was 52.5%. It increased 40 basis points, or 80 basis points excluding acquisition-related adjustments from Pall. Core operating margin declined 10 basis points and reported operating margin was 15.9%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, core operating margin expanded 50 basis points. Free cash flow for the quarter was $691 million, resulting in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of approximately 115%. We expect this solid performance to continue in the fourth quarter.", "We're also having a record year on the M&A front. In addition to Pall, we closed or announced nine acquisitions for approximately $650 million in the first nine months of 2015, bringing our total spend to over $14 billion. Our funnels at both Danaher and NewCo are strong and we expect to focus our activity on small and mid-sized transactions throughout the separation process.", "In August, we closed the acquisition of Pall ahead of schedule, thanks to diligent work from both our teams. We're excited to welcome this iconic brand to Danaher and we're already impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment we're seeing as Pall associates begin to embrace the DBS process. Ultimately, we expect the thoughtful application of DBS tools and principles to result not only in an improved growth trajectory but in a better experience for our customers. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the $300 million of cost synergies we previously outlined and have financed the acquisition in an interest rate environment that is very favorable for highly rated companies.", "So now turning to our five operating segments. Test & Measurement revenue declined 2% while core revenue increased 2.5%. Both reported and core operating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.7%. Our Instrument platform core revenue increased low single digits. At Fluke, core revenue grew low single digits as strength in our Biomedical and Calibration product lines was offset by weakening industrial demand in China and North America.", "Tektronix revenue declined low single digits as solid demand in North America and Western Europe, particularly for our high-performance oscilloscopes, was offset by weakness in Latin America and Russia. Tektronix innovations continued to lead the market as we introduced several new products this quarter. Notably, we began shipping our new high-performance oscilloscope, the DPO70000SX, this quarter. The DPO offers the most accurate real-time performance and highest analog bandwidth on the market. It combines patented signal-capturing technology, compact design and highly scalable architecture to help reduce signal noise and distortion so electrical engineers can better understand and solve their most complex problems.", "Moving to Environmental, revenue increased 1% with core revenue up 6%. Core operating margin expanded 185 basis points while reported operating margin was up 160 basis points to 22%. Our Water Quality platforms core revenue increased mid single digits with Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan all growing mid single digits or better. Across the platform, the Danaher Business System is helping our R&D, sales and support teams bring new products to market faster, convert leads to new business, and drive customer loyalty.", "At Hach, this drove broad-based growth across all major product lines and geographies, including China and Latin America. As water becomes an increasingly valuable resource, our customers are more focused than ever on analyzing their local water supplies with the greatest degree of accuracy and simplicity. Hach's new products, including the SL1000 PPA that we introduced last year, enable customers to perform critical tests and analyze data more easily than ever before.", "ChemTreat also grew across all of its major geographies, in spite of the challenging environment, revenue in Latin America grew double digits, thanks to the team's outstanding execution and quick adoption of DBS in our recent acquisitions Aguasin and Lipesa. Trojan also had a solid quarter driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American municipal market.", "Turning to Gilbarco Veeder-Root, GVR had a strong quarter, delivering high single digit revenue growth as robust demand in North America was partially offset by a decline in China. In the U.S., double digit sales in order growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers continued as retailers began to implement new and upgraded EMV-compliant systems. We expect EMV regulations to drive demand at GVR for the next several years.", "Now turning to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, sales were up 14.5% while core revenue grew 3.5%. Operating margin decreased 490 basis points to 10.8%, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Margins were also negatively impacted by continued weakness in emerging market currencies and cost actions taken during the quarter. In addition, we continue to invest in feet on the street and new product initiatives to accelerate future growth.", "Our Diagnostic platform delivered low single digit core revenue growth. Specifically at Beckman Coulter, core revenue grew low single digits driven by our immunoassay and urinalysis products. During the quarter, we launched the DxH 500, a low volume hematology analyzer designed for use in physician office labs. The DxH 500 offers fast, powerful data processing software and longer up time, saving our customers time and money and helping keep their focus on patient care.", "At Radiometer, healthy demand in both high-growth and developed markets contributed to high single digit revenue growth. This marks Radiometer's 15th consecutive quarter of high single digit growth or better. All major product lines grew mid single digits or better, led by AQT, which was up more than 20%.", "Leica Biosystems increased at a low single digit rate as strength in Western Europe was partially offset by a double digit decline in the Middle East. Demand remained healthy for both advanced staining consumables and our recently acquired Devicor business. This August, we celebrated Leica's 10-year anniversary as part of the Danaher portfolio. Over the past decade, Leica Biosystems has built a leading pathology diagnostics platform through a series of strategic acquisitions and organic growth investments. Leica Biosystems now generates over $800 million in annual sales and has nearly eight times the operating profit it had in 2005.", "Our Life Science platform core revenue increased at a mid single digit rate. High single digit growth in the U.S. and double digit growth in Europe were offset by weakness in the high growth markets. SCIEX core sales grew mid single digits, driven by continued strength in our pharma and clinical end markets. During the quarter, we enhanced our QTRAP and Triple Quad mass spectrometry systems with the addition of the 6500+ series, offering revolutionary sensitivity, wider sample coverage and faster switching speeds, the 6500+ helped researchers detect more compounds to better understand disease, protect our water and food supplies, and develop pharmaceutical therapies. Customer reception has been very positive and sales since launch have exceeded our expectations.", "Leica Microsystems core revenue increased slightly, as growth in the U.S. and Eastern Europe was largely offset by weakness in Western Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Orders were stronger, up mid single digits, with robust demand for our medical and life science products. We recently launched the DMV6 (sic) [DVM6] digital microscope for use in quality assurance, research and development, and forensics applications. With a combination of outstanding optics, intuitive operation and smart software, the DMV6 (sic) [DVM6] enables users to change objectives with one hand and process results with the other, all while automatically keeping samples in focus. In addition, it's offered in three configurations which help our customers find a solution that best fits their applications, workflows and budget needs.", "Moving on to Dental. Total revenues increased 23.5%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition, while core revenue decreased slightly. As a result of this decrease, we saw a 55 basis point lower core operating margin while reported operating margin also declined 240 basis points to 14.8%. Nobel Biocare is approaching its first anniversary at Danaher and delivered another quarter of solid results.", "Since acquisition, Nobel has delivered mid single digit average daily sales growth and over 150 basis points of operating margin expansion. NobelClinician, our implant workflow management software, has helped drive this success, and during the quarter, we celebrated our 10,000th Clinician [NobelClinician] customer. Within the rest of the Dental segment, growth in consumables was offset by a decline in our North American and Middle Eastern equipment businesses.", "During the quarter, Kerr launched the SonicFill 2 in Europe, building upon the success of the original SonicFill by providing dental practitioners with more options for color matching and filling strength. Since its launch in North America earlier this year, the SonicFill product family has grown double digits. It remains the only single-step, sonic-activated handpiece that allows clinicians to easily fill cavities in posterior teeth.", "Turning to Industrial Technologies, sales decreased 6.5% while core revenue was flat. Core operating margin expanded 20 basis points, while reported operating margin increased 10 basis points to 24.4%. Our automation platform's core revenue declined low single digits with weakness in North America and China. In North America, we experienced weaker demand from our distribution partners and have seen a contraction in capital spending. Product identification core revenues increased low single digits. We saw particularly strong demand for our marking and coding products. which grew mid single digits in Europe, and we believe we continue to take share in that region.", "Videojet grew mid single digits with growth across all major product lines. Driving innovation in the market is a key focus area for Videojet and year-to-date, the team has launched several new products that help increase efficiency, improve quality and ensure reliability for our customers. During the quarter, Videojet expanded its thermal inkjet offerings with the launch of the m600 oem. The m600 was designed specifically for packaging machine builders in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food end markets, and offers a 60% smaller footprint, reduced heat emissions, and expanded control options for critical coding applications.", "So, in summary, we had another good quarter, delivering solid core growth, free cash flow and earnings performance. In a challenging global macro environment, we've continued to enhance our businesses through organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions. As we move forward, we believe the strength of our portfolio combined with our team's steadfast execution through the Danaher Business System will help us deliver strong operating results and shareholder value for the remainder of 2015 and beyond.", "Wrapping up, for the fourth quarter, we anticipate approximately 2% core revenue growth, which will be impacted by four fewer selling days versus last year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.29, which implies year-on-year growth of 12% to 15%.", "Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Eric, we're now ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll take the first question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks, good morning, guys.", "Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Nigel.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Nigel.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Just wanted to pick up on some of the guidance, Tom. It seems that September was weaker than the rest of the quarter, just maybe comment on that. And the 2% core growth as we enter 4Q shouldn't be a surprise, given the selling days pressure, but given the weaker September, is there a risk it could be a bit weaker than 2%?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Nigel, good morning. Overall, we have seen some incremental slowing in the macro. That being said, it's in pockets. There's some pockets regionally where we've seen some of that slowing, clearly, and in some of the more industrially oriented markets. We saw that in September. But I would not say we've seen some form of a step change in demand across the portfolio. In fact, we think generally, the portfolio is very well positioned, it clearly differentiates us.", "And generally we think, when you look at the strength of the portfolio, when you look at the fact that we got the Pall closing done and we're getting after the opportunities that we have there, and we see the year-over-year FX impacts potentially dissipating as we move forward, clearly some weakening, but my inclination is continue to play offense. We need to continue to be cognizant of both the headlines and our trend lines, but our bias is to build on our strengths and despite some slowing here, we think the fourth quarter could largely be consistent on a days adjusted basis, anyway, with what we've seen here in the late going in September.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, that's great. And then just as a follow-on, we're seeing some of your competitors have stepped up restructuring as we enter 2016. Are we still on plan with the original guidance for restructuring or do you see the potential for maybe an uptick in 4Q?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Back in December, we laid out sort of the view of the year, and I think what's a little bit different this year is that \u2013 and in line with that guidance, by the way, we've done some things along the way. We haven't simply sat back and taken stock of things here in the fourth quarter, but instead, I think we've been better at having each of our businesses look for opportunities along the way.", "So we've seen some activity going on throughout each of the quarters of the year. And while as we go through the fourth quarter, we may do a little bit more than we initially anticipated. Those plans are sort of still in the works here. But we think overall, that plan will be pretty consistent, maybe a little bit higher. Obviously, there'll be some Pall contributions to that activity. But generally, we think that will set us up pretty well for 2016.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, Tom, that's great. Thanks a lot.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Nigel, appreciate the questions.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Steve.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Could we get a little more color on Pall and, in particular, what you're seeing in the Industrial businesses there as well as the Life Sciences? And then just also what are the kind of financial moving parts as far as profit contribution in the fourth quarter and then to the extent that you're either investing that away with restructuring or letting that drop to the bottom line?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure, thanks, Steve. First of all, we're really pleased that we got the Pall closing done as we did. Terrific teamwork, I think, on the part of the Pall team as well as the Danaher team to get that done sooner than anticipated. We're off to a very good start. We have Rainer Blair, who many of you know from our Life Science business, in the leadership position over the business right now. We've added Danaher teammates to the Pall squad and teams are working well, driving both growth initiatives as well as cost initiatives.", "Specific to your question, Steve, on Industrial and Life Science. On Life Science, we've seen continued strength, anchored specifically in the biopharma side of the Life Science portfolio, consistent with what we've seen historically in the business and consistent with our expectations. We have seen an incremental level of weakness in the Industrial side of the house. Again, probably to be expected, given the nature of the exposure to certain end markets in Industrial business. So incremental weakening, but understandably so, given those vertical markets.", "Specific to the financial contributions, we will see some contribution clearly here in the fourth quarter at Pall, but obviously that will, in fact, be offset to some extent by any of the cost actions that we'll take and the investments that we'll make.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. So you're investing that away. And what was the core for Industrial in the quarter?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "They were all up. Pall with mid single digits, with Life Science high single to double, and Industrial slightly negative.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then one last question. How was September for you guys?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "September was up about 2%, Steve. We thought it would closer to 3% and that kind of cost us 0.5 point overall in the quarter.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. All right, thanks a lot.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "The next question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, good morning, guys.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Scott.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Tom, can you give us a little bit more color on Dental? And when you think about like \u2013 I can't do the math because I don't have the data, but if Nobel Biocare was up so well then the core underlying business must have been down pretty meaningfully. And you said consumables were strong, so basically means that dentists have stopped buying equipment. So I don't know this business well enough to know whether you get some strange buying patterns there or not, but can you give us a little bit of color on what are your sales guys telling you? Why are dentists not buying right now?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Scott, one point of clarification, in our core number, we are not including Nobel yet.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Oh, okay.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So on an adjusted basis, we would have been up low single digits, but I'll still let Tom \u2013 the question on why we were down slightly.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, thanks, Dan. Your question still has merit, Scott.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "That makes me feel better.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, but let's go a little deeper outside. First of all, on Nobel, just a quickie. We're really happy with what's going on there. The team has done an excellent job. Average daily sales rates continuing to trend very well. New product introductions coming out on schedule with a strong cadence, great acceptance in the marketplace. Good progress across various regions. So all in, we're super happy with the start there and team's doing well.", "But onto the core of your question, probably important to think about it in terms of the consumables side of the house versus the equipment side of the house. We saw better performance on the consumables side of the house. We've made a lot of progress, which we had talked about throughout the course of this year, on rightsizing inventories in the channel, driving some sell-out, and our performance there is really pretty good from the standpoint of what we're seeing in the sell-out data.", "I'd contrast that a little bit to what we've seen on the equipment side. Where on the equipment side it's the inventory rightsizing in the channel that's taken us a little bit longer than we had anticipated. So that is a bit of a headwind there. And secondly, we did see some slowdown in equipment purchases, particularly in the high growth markets, where it's a little bit more project-oriented.", "Now, the key thing that we look at, though, when we look through those numbers is we look at the sell-out numbers. And the sell-out numbers are \u2013 on a year-to-date basis, were in line with the market, certainly, so we think we're holding our own from a share perspective. But it's taken us a little bit longer to get where we wanted to on the equipment channel side and, again, a little high-growth market headwind.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. And then, I had an interesting meeting with a financial sponsor yesterday who just commented that they thought the IPO option was dissipating pretty fast and that they wanted to derisk their portfolio pretty quickly, and this was a fairly large sponsor. It seems to be an environment where Danaher could really provide some liquidity and pick up some decent assets at good prices, but you did comment that you were looking at more small and middish stuff. Is there a scenario where you would stretch the balance sheet and/or even tap equity markets if you felt like it was the right transaction, just given the dynamics out there?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think your question's framed in the right way, Scott. For the right strategic transaction, for the transaction, for the asset, the business that really strengthens us strategically that adds a level of competitive advantage, that provides a greater level of growth rate on a long-term basis, we would do the right thing from the standpoint of whether that's going into the markets, as we did so effectively to finance the Pall transaction, or set up the balance sheet in a way that would allow us to do that. So my comments should not mean to suggest that there's a bright line that's snapped at a certain point beyond which we wouldn't go. So it's all about the strategic value that can be created.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Fair enough. Good answer. Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks, guys.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Scott.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steven Winoker with Bernstein.", "Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thanks and good morning, guys.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Steve, good morning.", "Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Good morning. Hey, just first on the separation timing, I know you've obviously been very busy, you got Pall done early, what are the key hurdles to having that separation happen earlier? Is there a desire to do that earlier anyway? How are you thinking about that at this point?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Steve, two of the bigger drivers are filing with the IRS and getting a favorable ruling on key points and then, two, filing the Form 10 with the SEC and getting through that process. We're working diligently. I think there is a good chance, prior to the investor meeting, we'll have a better sense on whether or not we'll be able to try to pull this thing forward from our end of the year kind of current timeline.", "Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. And then secondly, just perhaps a minor point, but maybe help us understand to what extent in all the major currency headwinds that you've called out, how much of the margin impact is really transactional in terms of maybe mismatched price and cost base? Help us maybe just understand how you're thinking about that in the quarter.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. I mean try to think through kind of a high-level example. So if you take \u2013 we've got $5 billion of revenues and 25% of that's in the high-growth markets, not all of that's in local currency, but most of it \u2013 call it $1 billion of it in local currency, that's just kind of a rough number. Through the course of Q3, if you look at the JPMorgan Index, which is they track the top 10 emerging market currencies, those depreciated 10% during the quarter, from the beginning of July to the end of September. So call that a weighted average of a 5% decline.", "So you have a 5% decline on $1 billion of revenues, that's $50 million of revenues that we lost that we didn't think we'd lose at the beginning of the quarter. The dynamic on the margin side is in those high-growth markets, it's primarily sales and service and marketing people. So the lower local currency maybe saved us $10 million, $15 million of SG&A expense, but very little cost of goods expense. So you lost $50 million of revenues and you probably lost $15 million, $20 million of lower operating expense from currency, so you get a transaction effect of losing $20 million, $30 million of operating profit.", "Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, fantastic, very helpful. Thanks.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi, thank you. Just a question on some of the other companies in the group, they sort of break out price, raw materials price, raw materials impact on margins year-to-date, and obviously it's been a decent tailwind I think for pretty much every company. Is there any color you could provide in the nine-month period, let's say, not just the quarter on how much of a benefit price raw material has been?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Julian, it's clearly been a slight benefit. We continue to get about 60 basis points, 70 basis points of price largely in our consumables business. But commodities \u2013 given our gross margin profile, commodities do not play a big impact on our cost of goods sold. The one area where I would have thought we would have actually gotten more of a benefit than we have is actually on the logistics side. Clearly, fuel prices have come down, but the transport companies have been pretty sticky about reducing prices. Now, again, I think as demand gets a little weaker here, maybe that helps. So it's been a benefit to date. But just given our product make-up, it's not been \u2013 the commodity side doesn't help or hurt us as much as most industrial companies.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Thank you, and then just a question on China. Obviously, the last month or two, people are trying to see if there's any evidence of a bottoming-out in short-term demand there. Maybe just talk about how you have seen demand in the different verticals in the last three months or four months.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Julian, we've actually seen China, while slowing incrementally, it's still one of the better markets where we play today. Our growth rates continue to be very good in a number of our businesses. Specifically in our Diagnostic business, we continue to grow extremely well in China. We've seen some of the \u2013 some of the slowing that we had talked about around tenders for Life Science over a period of time, that money has freed up. Not perhaps to the same rate that we would have hoped by this point, but certainly, we're seeing a better environment for life science spending.", "Our Environmental businesses continue to see terrific opportunities. And so I think as we look at China, we really continue to look at a number of sectors in that market where our businesses are extremely well positioned and where the sectors themselves are really quite attractive. So, clearly, the more industrially oriented you are, the more challenging that may be, but our Environmental businesses, our Life Science Diagnostic businesses are well positioned and we still feel very good about those. I think that's probably a market, as an example, where we really plan to and my bias is to continue to play offense. We'll be selective about where those investments go and target them to the higher growth segments, but in general, we're still constructive in that market.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Great, thank you.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Hi, good morning, guys. So maybe a little bit more color on the pharma vertical as a whole would be helpful. I know you talked to Pall in the quarter obviously. There's been a number of sort of volatile events in the space, on drug pricing, et cetera and we've obviously seen a bit of a collapse in some biotech prices. And so help us understand, I mean, it seems like SCIEX had a pretty good quarter and obviously the biotech side of Pall did as well. So help us think through the market volatility and whether or not that sort of worries you at all relative to the demand side of things.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Ross. We continue to be bullish on those markets. Yes, obviously there's been some volatility, certainly, in those markets, certainly in terms of the way they've been trading. And of course, our exposure, as you mentioned, is largely in the Pall business as well as across our Life Science platform, and more specifically around AB SCIEX. Specifically, our pharma exposure in Life Sciences is about probably 20% or 25% of that business specifically goes into that market. In the case of Pall, specifically it's about a third of their business is bio pharma-related.", "The growth rates there continued to be very strong throughout the course of the quarter. These are critical applications that to some extent are a bit insulated from the core volume side of what's going on inside of those facilities. In other words, whether you're making a large volume or a small volume, you're still going to be running that equipment and consuming some of our products. On the research side, the research investments, while they're shifting around a bit, continue to be relatively good. So I think in general, we're staying the course there and we think there's still great opportunities ahead.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "And maybe just dovetailing off of Steve's question from earlier, it's been an environment that's been difficult for you from an M&A standpoint last few years, but we're finally getting to a period where there's a little more volatility, if valuation has come down in some subsectors, seems like the timing may be fortuitous given when you can complete the spin next year. Maybe remind us around your activity level on tuck-ins during the last kind of market dislocation in 2008-2009 and talk a little about the trade-off of kind of completing the spin in due course versus the desire to sort of continue to add on at least more of the tuck-ins versus maybe anything larger.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I hope we're not looking at 2008-2009.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "No, obviously.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "During \u2013 obviously, that was a good period for us in that 2008-2009 period, we acquired almost \u2013 brought in almost 20 companies and not surprisingly, those are among our best returns for the company. I don't think we're heading into that, but the environment's getting tougher. We talked earlier about the IPO market being tough here and I think that bodes well, I think that bodes quite well for NewCo, given the choppiness in the industrial sector, given a little less competition from private equity. We've talked about roughly 2 billion of capacity the rest of this year and into next year. But as we get towards the end of \u2013 middle, end of next year, that number's going to jump back up a lot. So we're not \u2013 Tom suggested we're not shutting down, we're still working hard looking at activities, looking at possibilities both for Danaher and at NewCo.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Great. Thanks.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Ross.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Had a couple quick comments or questions on the Water Quality side of the business and maybe you can give a frame for us how you're seeing municipal budgets today. Everything I'm reading, it looks as though muni budgets are actually one of the growth markets at least for North America. So how are muni budgets favoring projects for Trojan, for example?", "And then a second question on Pall, it's interesting that Pall, as you expect, you see the logo in the Life Sciences side, but it could have easily also showed up today in the Environmental logos, and be interested in how you're positioning Pall in go-to-market in Water Quality.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Deane. So specific to municipal budgets and the overall municipal water market as a growth market, it's interesting, right, because we could talk about it as a growth market today, everything's relative. We haven't historically thought of the North American muni market as a growth market on a relative basis, but today, it really probably is. To your point, it's growing better than a lot of other markets that are much more challenged. And I think the way I would describe it, Deane, is that in contrast to probably the last three years or four years where those budgets were flat or down, largely recovering from a pretty challenging housing market in so many areas around the U.S, today, we'd say those budgets are probably growing modestly. A lot of muni budgets are probably growing maybe in the 2% or 3% range, and that's 2% or 3% better or more than what they were growing probably in the last three years or four years.", "So there are good opportunities there. They continue to contribute well to \u2013 certainly to Hach Lange as well as to Trojan. Specific to your question about Trojan, we have seen the bidding activity up this year and we've seen overall revenue converting that business \u2013 that bidding activity into revenue up this year as well. So probably one of the better markets where we participate today and clearly with leading positions, we believe we're gaining share in Water Quality.", "In the Pall business, Pall does have a position in municipal water. It is \u2013 it's not one of their larger businesses, but we believe there are opportunities there. And we have a team at Trojan as well as at Pall looking together at where there might be cooperative opportunities. It could be on certain projects or certain opportunities relative to technology where bringing filtration as well as ultraviolet treatment together may be a great opportunity for a customer. So it's early days there. We're really just getting into the 100-day strategic plans across those vertical markets, but it is a good position to start with and we'll see what we can do.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks, and just a quick question. What was NewCo's core revenues in the quarter?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Deane, they were a little bit under the 3%. So they were 2%, 2.5% led by both Gilbarco and Matco.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great, thank you.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Deane.", "Operator", "The next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, guys, good morning.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Andrew.", "Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a question on free cash conversion. what are the buckets for improvement in the fourth quarter? And also if you could give us an initial sense given that we've closed Pall, how much working capital contribution can we get in 2016?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Andrew, I don't know if we're looking at a very different dynamic in Q4 of this year versus last year. We did see a spike in payables at the end of the third quarter. That sometimes happens when we have a quarter end that's in the following month. So we actually closed a quarter in October as opposed to September 29, September 30. That should normalize back in the quarter.", "We tend to have pretty good working capital performance as we get towards the end of the year. That should be another contributor. So I don't think \u2013 I don't see a very different frame than what we had last year. We're still working through the Pall numbers. We think there's some meaningful cash flow opportunities there, not only in the working capital side but also on the CapEx \u2013 managing CapEx a little differently there, but we'll talk about both of those more in time.", "Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And just a follow-up on separation timing. Did you change your disclosure language on the timing? Because the QNO (45:28) says in 2016, or is it the same language as before? Just to confirm, sorry.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I don't remember. What I'm continuing to say is our expectation is 2016, we still believe it will be the end of the year but that could change, and if there is a change, it would be to the positive and we'll know more here in a couple months.", "Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Andrew.", "Operator", "And the next question's from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning, guys, thank you. Just a question on Beckman to start. If I just take a quick look at peers here like Abbott and Roche, some of them do seem to have core growth rates closer to the high single digit range. And so I'm curious, sort of, if I look back at my notes, you guys had an analyst meeting earlier this year and gave a lot of disclosure on the things you've done to turn around the franchise, but curious kind of what you need to do from here to kind of pace ahead of your comps there.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Isaac, thanks. We're continuing to make progress at Beckman. We track our customer retention and we track our win rates very closely on a month-to-month basis. We're confident as we look at the combination of retention and win rates that we're adding to our growth position as we look out into 2016 and 2017. Obviously, some of what we see in retention and adding menu to retained accounts as well as new customer accounts don't necessarily manifest themselves in the quarter in which you've won them. In fact, oftentimes, it may take six months to 12 months for those to materialize.", "So I think we're confident we're continuing to make progress, strengthening the portfolio through new products, continuing to see good growth in the high-growth markets. But it's a journey, we still have work to do. We're not yet at the growth rates that we would like to see relative to the peer group. You highlight them well. And \u2013 but we are making progress and we're confident in the opportunities.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And then maybe just a question on NewCo. Where are you in the process of sort of leadership selection and when might we know a little bit more about kind of how you're going to staff up the NewCo? Thank you.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, we've publicly named Jim, obviously as the leader, but his entire L1 team with one exception has been named. They're all internal folks. And a fair number of people at the L2 level, the level below that, have also been named. So we're off to a good start on that front.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it.

We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter in which the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, strong core operating margin expansion, and record free cash flow. Despite the more challenging economic landscape, particularly in our industrially-oriented markets, we continued to build our competitive advantage and drove share gains across a number of our businesses. As always, the Danaher Business System is the foundation for our team's outstanding execution.", "We also made meaningful progress toward establishing a new industrial growth company, Fortive, which will be spun out of Danaher later this year. At our year-end Investor Meeting, we announced Fortive's name, branding, future operating structure, and additional leadership positions. We also achieved an important milestone in December, filing Fortive's Form-10 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are confident that Fortive will launch with a strong foundation and will be poised for success upon completion of the separation in the third quarter of 2016.", "For the full year, our investments in organic growth initiatives helped drive solid 3% core revenue growth. With the addition of our recent acquisitions and other portfolio moves, our total annual revenues are now over $20 billion. From an M&A perspective, 2015 was a historic year for Danaher. Including Pall, we announced or closed 14 acquisitions for nearly $14.5 billion, expanding our capabilities across the portfolio. Looking forward, our funnels at both Danaher and Fortive are strong and we'll continue to focus on small and mid-size transactions throughout the separation process.", "In 2015, we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow, including over $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio in 2015 was 123%, representing the 24th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. We recognize the importance of this metric, particularly in a more challenging macroenvironment, as strong free cash flow is the fuel used to fund both our organic and inorganic growth initiatives.", "Now, turning to the fourth quarter, sales grew 12.5% to $5.9 billion, while core revenue was roughly flat. Core revenue growth, particularly for our consumables businesses, was negatively impacted by four fewer selling days in the quarter. In addition, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 17.5%.", "In a weakening global macroenvironment, the Danaher Business System help protect and expand many of our market-leading positions driving share gains at Hach, ChemTreat, Matco, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX, and Videojet. In the high-growth markets, declines in Latin America, Russia, and the Middle East were more than offset by double-digit growth in India and high single-digit growth in China. Notably, annual revenues in China exceeded $2 billion for the first time and we remain well-positioned in the most attractive sectors in the market. In the developed markets, revenues were down slightly due to incremental softness in the U.S. and Western Europe.", "Gross margin for the quarter was 51.2%. For the full year, our gross margin was 52.3% and our gross profit increased by almost $900 million. In the quarter, core operating margin increased 120 basis points with all five segments improving by 60 basis points or better. Our reported operating margin was flat at 16.6%, negatively affected by the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and acquisition-related transaction costs. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.27, which represents an increase of 13.5% over last year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $4.30, up 8.5% from 2014.", "Turning to our five operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues decreased 9% while core revenues were down 5%. Core operating margin increased 110 basis points, primarily due to new product introductions and good cost management. Core revenue in our Instruments platform decreased at a high single-digit rate with declines across most major geographies.", "Fluke core revenues were down high single-digits as industrial markets continued to weaken in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East. In December, Fluke acquired Pacific Laser Systems, a leader in hand-held laser alignment tools, to enhance its product offerings for professional contractors, electricians, and general maintenance customers.", "At Tektronix, core sales declined high single-digits; declines in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East more than offset growth in China that resulted from solid execution by our local sales team. The team's continued investments in innovation placed Tek in a position of technology leadership within its industry. This quarter, Tek launched the MDO4000C, a mixed domain oscilloscope that combines up to six instruments in one unit. The new MDO4000C is completely customizable and upgradable allowing engineers to start with a high-performance oscilloscope and add functionality over time as needs change or budgets allow.", "Matco, a business that will be a significant contributor to Fortive's results delivered its third consecutive year of double-digit core growth in 2015. Even after three decades as part of the Danaher portfolio, Matco continues to find new ways to improve using DBS. By deploying such DBS tools as web marketing, accelerated product development, and lean conversion, the team continues to expand its franchise distribution network, gain market share, and expand margins.", "Turning now to our Environmental segment; revenues grew 1%, with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 260 basis points to 21.8%. Water quality core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate. A combination of fewer selling days and slower demand from our more industrial customers in the developed markets resulted in essentially flat core growth at Hach, while ChemTreat grew slightly. Trojan had another very good quarter, driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American muni market.", "Hach delivered another impressive year in 2015. In addition to mid-single digit organic growth, Hach continued its healthy cadence of bolt-on acquisitions. The team has done a terrific job implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses to help improve sales and drive innovation. One such example is BioTector, which was acquired in 2014 and had double-digit growth in the quarter.", "BioTector provides online total organic carbon analyzers that help our customers monitor water quality in real time and reduce waste. BioTector's early and effective application of DBS tools such as lean conversion and funnel management led to more than 200 basis points of margin expansion, significant inventory reductions and market share gains in the chemical and dairy segments.", "Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew high single-digits with strength across the platform. In the U.S., point-of-sale solutions and dispensers increased over 20% as our customers continued to upgrade their payment systems to comply with EMV security requirements. We expect EMV-related demand to continue to accelerate for the next several years.", "Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics, core revenues grew 2% with reported revenues up 34.5%, largely due to our recent Pall, MicroScan and Devicor acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 75 basis points. Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low single-digits with growth in the high-growth markets partially offset by slight declines in developed markets. As previously mentioned, fewer selling days in the quarter negatively impact our recurring revenue streams across the platform.", "At Beckman Coulter, core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate led by our immunoassay and urinalysis solutions.", "Utilization rates in Asia remain healthy leading to high single-digit growth across the region. In Europe, we celebrated our first orders with the commercial launch of our VERIS Molecular Diagnostics System. VERIS' streamlined sample-in, result-out workflow offers breakthrough ease of use in a market that is experiencing a shortage of skilled technicians. In short, it's helping our lab customers process more tests, reduce training requirements and save money, and thus far customer feedback has been extremely positive.", "Radiometer's core revenues were up slightly, a deceleration from previous quarters due to the effect of fewer selling days and a difficult comparison in instrument sales. Geographically, we saw healthy growth in China and Japan, while Latin America and the Middle East declined.", "Leica Biosystems had a good finish to the year, delivering low single-digit core growth as strong demand across most major product lines was partially offset by the impact from fewer selling days. Notably, the team delivered a record year of placements for our BOND Advanced Staining Instrument.", "Last December, we closed the acquisition of Devicor, a leading provider of breast biopsy devices and markers that moved Leica further upstream in the anatomical pathology workflow. Devicor continues to track well and has exceeded our expectations, posting high single-digit core growth or better in each quarter since acquisition.", "Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up low single-digits with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single-digits with continued strength in our clinical and applied end markets.", "2015 marked the fifth year since our acquisition of SCIEX. Since then, SCIEX has proven to be a remarkable example of how thoughtful application of DBS principles can drive tremendous financial results. The team has taken a business that was growing below market rates to mid to high single-digit growth and share gains. We've seen significant improvement on the cost side as well, which has enabled SCIEX to invest those savings into higher impact growth initiatives.", "Progress at SCIEX continues today and 2015 marked one of the most important product innovation years in SCIEX's history with the launch of its X-Series mass spectrometry platform. The X-Series introduces an entirely new design, easy-to-use software and custom models for targeted application in routine food, environmental and forensic testing labs.", "Leica Microsystems' core revenues were essentially flat as strong performance in China and Japan was offset by declines in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.", "Turning now to Dental, segment revenues increased 17% largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core revenues were up slightly. Core operating margins increased by over 500 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to consistent DBS implementation across a number of operational areas. Reported operating margins were 15.8%.", "Revenues in our consumables business were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter, but our team continued to execute well and saw a strong demand for several product lines throughout the year. In particular, our investments in innovation have provided us with truly differentiated technologies such as SonicFill, TF Adaptive, and elements free, which all launched in 2014.", "In dental technology, we saw our first quarter of positive growth since the fourth quarter of 2014. Top line results continued to be impacted by destocking within our U.S. distribution channels but to a much lesser degree than in previous quarters.", "December marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Nobel Biocare. The team has quickly embraced growth, lean and leadership tools of DBS, helping to not only accelerate growth, but also improve operating margins by over 300 basis points since the acquisition.", "Moving to Industrial Technologies, revenues declined 8.5% while core revenues were down 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 80 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 21.6%. Automation core revenues decreased at a high single-digit rate due to weakening in industrial markets in China and North America. Despite the challenging market and revenue decline, the team continues to identify cost savings opportunities and delivered solid core margin expansion in the quarter.", "Core revenues in our Product Identification platform were up slightly. In the fourth quarter, we continued to extend our reach into new product idea adjacencies with the acquisition of Laetus, a leading supplier of track-and-trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. Increasingly, pharmaceutical tracking is becoming a regulatory and public safety concern and Laetus gives us exposure to this important vertical, and we're excited to welcome Laetus to the Danaher team.", "At Videojet, core revenues were up low single-digits, as strong performance in Europe and North America was somewhat offset by weakness in the high-growth markets. Results were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter. Throughout the full year, Videojet has placed a major focus on digital investments, driving key innovations in areas such as network monitoring, Remote Service-enabled printers and predictive maintenance. As a result, we achieved record new equipment vitality of over 40% for the year. These tremendous technology capabilities have not only solidified Videojet's leadership position in the market, they have also meaningfully improved our customers' experiences.", "So to wrap up, we're pleased with our record fourth quarter results. During the quarter, the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, significantly expanded core operating margins, generated record free cash flow and announced several bolt-on acquisitions. Despite the more challenging economic landscape particularly in our industrially-oriented markets, we continue to execute well.", "Looking back, 2015 was a remarkable year for Danaher. We completed the largest acquisition in our history with Pall, announced our pending separation into two independent publicly-traded companies with Fortive and drove excellent overall financial results. With the Danaher Business System as our foundation, we believe we'll continue to deliver earnings outperformance and create long-term shareholder value in 2016 and for years to come.", "We're initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1 and $1.04 which assumes approximately flat core revenue growth. As we announced at our Annual Investor Event in December, we continue to expect full year 2016 core revenue growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.95, which would represent a 12% to 15% increase year-on-year.", "Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Leo, we're now ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We'll take our first question from Scott Davis of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Scott.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I think \u2013 I mean given that it's been about a month since you gave the last guidance in mid-December \u2013 the formal guidance, I guess \u2013 things seemed to have degraded a bit on the macro side. I mean, what confidence do you have? I mean, now that you've seen I guess most of January, I mean, have things stabilized? I mean, your guidance seems to indicate that you think that was a bit of a blip, I suppose, so just a little color there.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure, Scott. I think, Scott, what we're assuming is that what we saw with some of the slowing in December is essentially the environment that we're going to see in the near term here. It's clearly impacting our more industrial businesses more than our other businesses, so we're not immune to the slowdown but I think we took some appropriate actions in the fourth quarter.", "Those actions are going to pay off here certainly from a margin standpoint, but I think the other thing to keep in mind is that the portfolio that we have today truly does differentiate us. And I think when we look at the opportunities that we have in our Life Science businesses, our Diagnostic businesses, some improvement that we're seeing here in our Dental businesses, continued good progress at GVR, while we remain cautious in some respects around the macroenvironment and are not assuming things get materially better there, we're playing offense in a number of areas that I think will bode well.", "So, I don't think there's anything particularly optimistic in our outlook around the macro, but I think some of the things that we're doing from an investment standpoint and across our growth initiatives should continue to position a very good portfolio and a differentiated portfolio and continue to move it into an even better place.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. Makes sense. And then just as a follow-up, the emerging market currencies have degraded a fair amount. I mean, are you able to get local price to offset that? I mean, how do you manage that volatility, specifically, just given the exposures you guys have?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I mean, it's an issue; I'd probably bifurcate the answer. Where we have the aftermarket business, the consumables, the service, we typically able to get price; with equipment and instruments, we're not able to, and we're taking a little bit of a margin hit there. Fortunately, the euro has stabilized so the overall currency impact is not what it was in 2015, but there's a little bit of a negative right now.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Good luck. Thanks. I'll pass it on.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Scott.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Nigel.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Nigel.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah, so just on the $0.40 from Pall, can you maybe just first of all comment on how Pall is tracking or how it tracked through the quarter? Maybe comment on the Industrial versus Life Sciences sides? And yeah, has the composition of the $0.40 in the plan changed at all in the last couple months?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Nigel, we're very, very happy with how we've gotten started with Pall, starting with the team that we have in place, a terrific team, both the Pall leadership team, many of whom have taken on added responsibilities. But in addition, the added resources that we've put in place and the leadership that we have brought to bear in the business, I think together, that team is off to a terrific start.", "We'll talk to the $0.40 and the cost opportunities that we have here in just a minute, but coming to the growth side of the house, about what we expected: continued very good progress and growth rates on the Life Science side, keeping in mind that that business has an exceptional position in the biopharma market in Life Science. So, we're seeing continued good growth there. We're also seeing outstanding growth in single-use technologies, which are a key part and a key growth driver of the biopharma segment of the Life Science business as time goes on.", "On the Industrial side, again, what you \u2013 what we would've expected, which is a slowing on that side of the house. We've seen that \u2013 those businesses impacted far more than obviously on the more Life Science-oriented side of the house. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that that business is also strongly skewed towards consumables. In total, the portfolio is about 70% aftermarket, consumables primarily. And so, that's a strong foundation and I think continues to give us confidence that while we'll have some segments that are challenged, the business overall will continue to perform quite well.", "Relative to the cost side of the house, again, off to a very good start. You heard us in December take the 2016 number up to $100 million because we had gotten off to an earlier start. We're getting the kinds of cost reductions that you would expect us to get out of a public company in the early going. The public company cost, beginning to get after some of the indirect cost leverage that we get and some of the procurement cost leverage that we get by consolidating procurement across our other businesses where appropriate. And over time, we'll see some of the benefits coming from \u2013 on the gross margin side as we look to the operational footprint, but that will obviously take a little bit more time.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, but that's helpful. Thanks. Thanks, Tom. And then on the balance sheet, you've taken down a lot of \u2013 an impressive amount of debt since the acquisition of Pall, I think about $3 billion of debt paydown. Given the bit more challenging macro, is there a change in your bias towards delevering this year?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Nigel, I think we remain in that kind of $2 billion target for M&A this year. We are incrementally encouraged we're able to get some deals done in December, granted they were small, but we actually saw a flurry of deals get done towards the end of the year. Clearly what's going on in the high yield market has made it very difficult for the private equity parties, let alone industrial companies that have a lower credit rating. So, some of the anxiety out here is definitely helping some of the conversations. So, on the margin, we're a little bit more encouraged than we were 60, 90 days ago on the M&A front.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Oh...", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sorry, Nigel.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We may have lost Nigel there. Hope I didn't offend you, Nigel.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Operator, we can move to the next question.", "Operator", "Very good. Our next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. How's it going?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Steve.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Steve.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Can you just maybe talk a little bit more specifically about Pall industrial trends? I mean, what is the organic \u2013 what kind of organic are you seeing there and what are you expecting for 2016, a little more precisely?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, Steve, for the four months that we owned the business on a constant-currency basis, Pall grew about 4% on a combined basis. Clearly, it would've been accretive to our core growth here. Life Science was up high single-digits; Industrial was down low to mid-single digits. We see that for the near-term, not a bad way to be looking at the business. Certainly, the industrial piece is more challenged but more than making up for it with a very strong growth on the Life Science side.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then, what was Pall's contribution to free cash flow in the quarter?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "On the working capital side where we contributed north of $300 million of cash out of working capital, Pall was a nice piece of it, but maybe 15%. The working capital improvements were very broad-based, really exceptional performance across all the five segments. So, it was a nice contributor, but it was not an overwhelming piece.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. And then just one last question. What's the restructuring contingency look like in 2016? Is there any change to that as you kind of exited the year at a bit of a weaker rate, or are you in normal day-to-day planning? How extreme are things around some of the more industrial businesses?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Steve, I think one of the things that we learned from 2015 and we're pleased about is that we did a number of things throughout the course of the year from a productivity perspective. And I think particularly in an environment like this, it's important that we stay cognizant of the fact that there may be opportunities that present themselves, some things that we may need to do. So, we're going to keep the teams active at looking for opportunities throughout the course of the year, and we'll take advantage of those as they come up.", "So, I think we got a lot done in 2015. We got a lot more done in December than we anticipated, probably $20 million north of what we thought in December. So, that's a good thing; sets us up well a little bit more than we would have anticipated. But again, I think it's important that we stay (31:07) cognizant of the environment business-by-business and look for opportunities to take action where good projects present themselves.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thanks, and good morning, guys.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Steve.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey. What was the Fortive versus Danaher core growth, if you split it that way, for the quarter?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Looking at Fortive probably being rough down 2% to 3% and Danaher go-forward up 1%, 1.5%. So, I think that's roughly the way it would split.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. And just a couple of things...", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And, Steve \u2013 I'm sorry, Steve. Sorry to interrupt. Just wanted to make one other quick point just for clarification on that. It's important to recognize on the Danaher side of the house, that 1% to 1.5%, that side of the house has a higher percentage of consumables and recurring revenue than you do on the Fortive side. And as a result of that, the fewer selling days in the fourth quarter has a little bit greater impact on the Danaher side. So, when you normalize for the days impact on the Danaher side, that's going to be potentially could be 1.5%, 2% maybe even on that side. Again rough numbers, but it has a little bit more of an impact there.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Oh, okay. All right. And then just on a couple of the segments, so I think this was the \u2013 it's been at least eleven quarters since I've seen Fluke go negative. So, maybe a little commentary on what's going on in the industrial environment, specifically on Fluke.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "And then also Life Sciences & Diagnostics, it's the lowest I think I've seen in 14 quarters. So, you went through a lot of detail there, but to what extent are we \u2013 should we be concerned about any kind of bleed over from the broader environment into their markets?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Sure. We'll start with Fluke. Fluke clearly impacted by the downshift in the macroenvironment in the quarter, Fluke being one of our more industrially-oriented businesses. I think the macroenvironment, while it had its impact on us on a broad basis, also had an influence on the way our distributors were thinking about inventories during the course of the quarter.", "So, I think one of the things that \u2013 although we don't have all the numbers right now for full transparency on what happened to channel inventory, it's a pretty good hypothesis right now based on some early data we have that would suggest that there was some inventory control that went on in the channel that certainly would've had some impact as well.", "So, I think those two factors combined, again broad-based macro on sellout and probably some impact on sell-in based on inventory contraction.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "On the Diagnostics side, Steve, the bigger piece is obviously Diagnostics, that's largely consumables, Diagnostics were up 4% organically for the year. And as you remember, Q1 when we had the extra days, we were up 6%; Q4, when we had the fewer days, we were up 2%. So, actually on a days-adjusted basis, Diagnostics tracked pretty close to that 3% to 4% rate all year including the fourth quarter.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Maybe one other thing to add there is that best we can tell, Steve, we didn't see any year-end budget flush there in the fourth quarter. That's a little bit more of a Life Science-oriented phenomena than a Diagnostic-oriented phenomena. But in some past fourth quarters we've seen the impact of that. We didn't see any of that in the fourth.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good news and bad news on that front has an impact on the fourth quarter. Sometimes that budget flush can drive some inventories out that then create some go-forward weakness as you start the New Year. We're hoping we \u2013 and the early numbers coming out here in January look like we're off to a decent start.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "That's good. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Jeff. Good morning.", "Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Good morning. Thanks for that color on Fluke. I wanted to ask that question a little bit more broadly. To what extent do you think kind of the more industrially-oriented organic growth rates clearly reflect end demand versus maybe a broader channel liquidation? I don't know if you have any good insight into your other channels or any even anecdotal color there would be helpful.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't have much there, Jeff. I know the teams are still out talking to customers and trying to get a better sense of that. One reason for a little bit more insight on Fluke than and less so \u2013 Fluke's a little bit more concentrated with some big distributor partners that we can get a little bit more transparency a little bit more quickly. Some of the more automation sensors and control businesses and so on, more fragmented channels and it's just taking us a little longer to get any sense of channel inventories.", "Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And just shifting gears a little bit, any thoughts on how the device tax plays through? Do you see any change in demand there or any change in the way people are pricing competitively, and maybe just size what you think the impact could be to your business this year?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Jeff, when the device tax was first put in place, the impact of that was very fairly modest on us. There's money at stake but overall, not a huge number. So, what comes back in terms of a little bit of a lift to operating margins is also modest. I mean, net-net, it's a good thing for the industry. We didn't see much impact in the market from a pricing standpoint when it all happened \u2013 I should say, from a competitive standpoint. We did get some of that back in price over time and probably some competitors did as well, but in terms of real impact to competitive dynamics, I think it's too modest a change, certainly to the scale of our business and maybe to the scale of others to really impact the competitive world.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Jeff, I think we said in 2013 it was about a $0.05 hit. We recovered some of that in price. So, I think it'll be less than a $0.05, but maybe $0.03 benefit here in the year.", "Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "We'll move next to Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe on Dental, can you just give us a little bit more color just sort of on the progress you made throughout the year? It looks like ending the year, you had some of your best results obviously adjusting for the days. And so, as we sort of now rolled Nobel into the sort of core and we think about the margin progression of that business over the year, help us think through kind of the pushes and pulls and how happy you are with the progress made.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Ross. I think 2015 was a year of very good progress across the platform. You mentioned Nobel; let me just start with that. We have a tremendous team of folks at Nobel. Largely the leadership team that was in place when we acquired the business, they have really embraced DBS and are off to a terrific start, both in terms of continuing to use DBS tools to drive growth, but also in my comments earlier, some great progress on operating margins. And now, as that goes core to the Dental platform, we'll see some impact of that to the good.", "On the business that existed prior to 2015, I think again 2015 was a year of a lot of progress. I've mentioned a couple of times that we've had outstanding relationships with our distribution partners. We work in a collaborative way with them on channel inventories throughout the course of the year. That was obviously somewhat of a painful process to go through in the sense of the impact on core growth, but net-net, a very good process in terms of positioning the channel efficiently.", "So we're pleased that the vast majority of that's behind us. There can always be a little bit of a tail to that of stuff we're still moving out in slower-moving inventories, but again, I think a ton of progress. We've also got a very good leadership team in place in our Dental platform today with some new players in place that I think are doing some wonderful things in terms of driving innovation. It was a very good year of new product introductions and I think we'll see the benefit of that as core growth improves this year. So we know we still have work to do there, but good news is there's opportunities for value creation as we go on here.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Great. And maybe just quickly a little color more on the M&A pipeline. Can you just give us a sense \u2013 I mean there's obviously been a ton of equity market volatility. We've seen obviously a shift in how the private equity folks are also sort of transacting. Just give us a feel for maybe healthcare versus industrial-oriented assets and the like, whether there is more activity at one side of the spectrum versus the other and how sort of the valuation dislocations have been kind of digested by the various groups, because you're obviously doing smaller things at this point and it's obviously the large end of the market that's probably been most impacted.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Well, I'll let Dan comment in a second on kind of the environment that we're seeing. But if you just look at what we did in the fourth quarter, which I think is a bit instructive, we got four or five small deals done in the fourth quarter. And by the way, a couple \u2013 two or three of those deals were Fortive-related. I mentioned Pacific Laser Systems in my earlier comment, but there were a couple other smaller situations that we were able to complete during the quarter for Fortive's benefit, along with a couple on the Danaher side.", "So, I think the fourth quarter was indicative perhaps of some things opening up a bit. I think the environment is generally a favorable one for businesses like ours with a balance sheet that's ready to deploy into small and midsized situations. And I think to your question, there are some folks who are perhaps a bit more on the sidelines right now than in previous days.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Great.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Your line is open.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Morning, guys.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Shannon.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. So Test & Measurement and Industrial Tech are both generating pretty good core margin expansion here despite these mid-single-digit declines. Can you give a little more color on how they're managing to do that? I mean, both of them have pretty good leverage in the models so that's a lot to offset. And what's going on in those businesses and can they continue?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Shannon, it is a real testament to those businesses given the challenging environment they're in from a core growth perspective that they are getting the operating margin lift that they're getting without the benefit of the top line dropping that through. I think it is a testament to the strength of the Danaher Business System, the tools that we use not just in newly-acquired businesses, but in businesses with long histories with Danaher that have gotten a lot done using DBS in the past and are still getting it done.", "If you think about some of the businesses in T&M, be it Fluke and the associated acquisitions around Fluke that have been done quite a number of years ago, think about other businesses like Qualitrol, like some of the businesses in our automation sensors and controls areas. Those guys are using DBS, whether those are lean tools specifically in the plants or deploying those tools in areas of SG&A, they're just demonstrating that those tools are still highly effective in businesses with long histories with Danaher. So it's kudos to those guys and they continue to get her done.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And then you talked a little bit about the diagnostic comps and things, but Radiometer, that's been one that seemed like it was just going to grow to the sky forever in the equipment business.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Was a little weaker there. So maybe a little \u2013 just color, anything there to be concerned about.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, no. Radiometer is a tremendous business with a long track record of high single-digit growth at Danaher. I'm sure Matt or Dan can find how many quarters it's been, but it's quite a number of them in a row that we've been high single-digits and taking share.", "It's a high consumables business. It's probably in the 80% neighborhood of consumables so the days impact was fairly significant there. They also had a challenging comp in the fourth quarter on the instrumentation side, a couple of big orders that had some impact there. So, I think Radiometer is in as good a shape today as it's ever been. No meaningful shift in the competitive dynamics there, so we still feel very good about it.", "I think there was anything there, Shannon, that wouldn't be unique to Radiometer it's simply the fact that some of the growth that we have seen in the high-growth markets, while still strong in places like China and India, are still now very weak in Latin America, in Russia, in the Middle East. And so, even our best businesses are probably going to feel a little bit the impact there.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Shannon.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Just back on the Dental business, Dan, any chance you could give us the impact of the fewer days on core growth overall and how should we think about margin expansion for the year?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, it has less of an impact on equipment. We were up slightly in the quarter. It's the first time we've been up, albeit modestly, but it impacts consumables probably up, and as Tom alluded, to probably 1.5 points, 2 points when it comes to consumables.", "Good progress on the margin side granted we had a pretty weak performance a year ago, so part of it was a comp. But we've also took part of our incremental restructuring here in Q4 with the Dental, so we should see some continued margin expansion coming out of Dental hopefully with a little better growth than what we've seen here in 2015.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "That's all I got. Thanks.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Brandon.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Thank you.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Julian.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Just a question around Western Europe. I think I heard you say that sales were down slightly in Q4, having been up sort of around a mid-single-digit pace in the nine-month period. I think a lot of other companies have sort of been saying Europe's okay. So maybe just talk a little bit about what you saw there, specific countries or segments that slowed down.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Julian. I mean I think that was one of the areas versus what we expected at the beginning of the quarter that surprised us a little bit to the downside. It wasn't dramatic. Clearly, our consumables businesses over there were impacted by the selling days and maybe we were not as well calibrated as we should've been.", "But having gone through all \u2013 most of the business here's \u2013 in the first couple of weeks here, the tone in Europe is still decent and it doesn't feel like the step-down that our numbers in Q4 would suggest. And we think we'll get back to sort of modest growth here pretty quickly in 2016. Watching that carefully because it probably caught us a little bit by surprise here in the fourth quarter, but again, the tone still seems pretty good.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Understood. Thank you. And you laid out the overall EPS seasonality through the year about just over a month ago. Maybe just talk a little bit about the Pall seasonality of that $0.40, particularly given the industrial organic sales trend in that business right now and how you would contrast that $0.40 impact versus overall Danaher.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, the $0.40 should ramp during the year as we go after costs. Again, we were able to get some more things done in December, and that was inclusive of Pall as well, so we're getting it out of the gate a little bit faster in Q1 from a margin perspective. I think the offset, as you suggest, is the industrial side. So I think we'll get nice accretion here in Q1, but it'll clearly ramp through the year.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Great. Thank you.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Julian.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey. Good morning, guys. Obviously good performance in margin in the quarter. Are raw materials \u2013 lower raw material costs helping at all with price cost? Did price cost \u2013 was it stable in 4Q versus 3Q? Did it improve? I know you mentioned covering FX, but are raw materials helping at all?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I don't have any great analysis on that yet. Given our gross margin, raw materials tend to be less of a factor for us than a lot of other companies you might cover. We are continuing to get price, still getting 60 basis points, 70 basis points, and it's hard not to think raw materials are helping us a little bit, but for us, it's really on the margin.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. And then how do you get visibility into what to forecast, for example, in the Middle East? I mean, the region looks like it inflected down a bit in 4Q. And with oil's recent leg down, how difficult is it to get visibility? And what do you forecast for 2016?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Andrew, there's a couple of different ways to come at that in the Middle East. One is simply conversations with distribution partners and a lot of what we do in the Middle East does involve some form of a distributor partner, and making sure that we have transparency as much as we possibly can into the opportunity funnels that those distributors are seeing, as well as making sure that the conversations we're having with our own sales team around those funnels as they roll up to our leadership team are as well pressure tested as possible.", "The key thing about markets like the Middle East is, particularly in businesses like ours, you have a fairly high level of project or tender-related business and \u2013 at least on the equipment side. And so, really making sure that we understand opportunity funnels and are not overly optimistic about the timing within which funding will be released, as in many cases that funding has some governmental influence to it, is really important. It is easy to have a sales team get overly optimistic that the timing of funding release is going to be the same as it was a year ago or two years ago when the reality is things may have slowed down and tenders may be being let at a much slower pace. So being diligent about how we pressure test those funnels is key.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "So it's fair to say you're being pretty conservative with the Middle East forecast.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We're trying to be increasingly conservative as we see how government funding is being influenced. I think it was interesting watching the course of the year. Oil continued to drop, as you know, throughout the course of the year and yet we actually saw our Middle East numbers hang in there reasonably well throughout the middle part of the year and it wasn't until the latter part of the year that we saw a more acute shift in the Middle East. And so there was a little bit of a lag there and it's taken a bit of time for the team to fully recalibrate.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks, Tom.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Deane.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just a quick question on R&D spending overall came in lighter year-over-year and versus our estimates. Did you throttle back on any spending or is that just timing of some of the projects?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. As you probably saw in the numbers that we put out, Deane, we're showing R&D down about 20 basis points, but the reality is, is that that was primarily influenced by Pall. And R&D spending normalized for the Pall influence was actually up on the quarter. So we're continuing to make sure that innovation is a key priority for the businesses and that R&D spending is maintained to the greatest extent possible for the opportunities that we think have the greatest impact in the next year or two.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then just last question from me is the incremental restructuring done in December, did you say what portion of that was Danaher versus Fortive?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It was roughly the split you'd expect, 70%/30%. And that 70% is Danaher inclusive of Pall.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great.

Sales grew 15% to $5.4 billion and core revenue increased 50 basis points as a number of our businesses were negatively impacted by tough prior-year comparisons and one less selling day.", "Clearly the economic environment remains challenging in many verticals and geographies, but we were encouraged by signs of sales and order stabilization through the quarter. Our team's focus on portfolio optimization and diligent execution using DBS helped improve and sustain many of our market-leading positions. Finally, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 2% while acquisitions increased revenues by 16.5%.", "Geographically, the developed markets grew slightly with stability in the U.S. and Europe. High growth markets were up low-single-digits as continued growth in India was offset by declines in Latin America and Russia. In China, our teams are well-positioned to compete in several attractive markets, and delivered mid-single-digit core growth in the quarter.", "Gross margin for the first quarter was 53.1%, an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Along with the productivity initiatives undertaken in 2015, our gross margin expansion has enabled us to sustain and expand our growth investments in new product development and sales and marketing. Core operating margin expanded 45 basis points with reported operating margin at 16.4%.", "Free cash flow is one of the most important metrics at Danaher as it provides us with the agility to invest in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We had a strong quarter on this front generating $622 million of free cash flow, a significant increase over last year.", "Coming off a historic year of M&A, we closed six bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter, deploying over $100 million in capital. These deals will strengthen our capabilities across many of our businesses. Both Danaher and Fortive have strong and active funnels and we'll continue to focus on small and mid-sized transactions for both companies through the separation process.", "Now let's take a look at our five operating segments, starting with Test & Measurement. Revenues decreased 5.5%, with core revenues down 5%. Core operating margin decreased 135 basis points with reported operating margin coming in at 20.9%. Core revenues for our Instruments platform declined high-single-digits as we continued to face a challenging global market environment. All major geographies saw declines except for China and India.", "Fluke core revenues decreased mid-single-digits due to declines in the U.S., Western Europe and Latin America, partially offset by increases in China. While still a difficult environment, we did see some signs of stabilization in certain geographies and industrial end markets during the quarter.", "A few weeks ago, Fluke announced the launch of the Fluke 279 FC Thermal Multimeter, the world's first test tool that integrates a full-featured digital multimeter with a thermal camera in one device. This combination enables technicians to check for hot spots on high voltage equipment and analyze problems at a safe distance. By combining these important test tools into one, Fluke is helping our customers troubleshoot electrical issues more quickly, safely and thoroughly.", "At Tektronix, core revenue declined low-double-digits as growth in China and India was more than offset by declines in all other major geographies.", "The Matco team continued to execute well, delivering high-single-digit core growth in the quarter. Notably, Matco has posted mid-single-digit growth or better for 23 of the last 25 quarters and continues to improve its market position. In February, Matco hosted its annual Tool Expo in Las Vegas. The Expo provides Matco franchisees with an opportunity to see new products, attend training sessions and stock their businesses for the upcoming year. This year, almost three-quarters of Matco's franchisees participated, resulting in record attendance and event-driven sales.", "Turning to our Environmental segment, revenues grew 4%, with core revenues up 3.5%. Reported operating margin declined 220 basis points to 17.3%. Core operating margin declined 155 basis points and was negatively impacted by incremental investments, including EMV-related spend at Gilbarco Veeder-Root. We anticipate segment margins to return to more normalized levels in the second quarter.", "The Water Quality's platform's core revenues grew slightly as one less selling day and a tough prior year comparison had a negative impact. At Hach, positive momentum in the U.S. municipal market continued but softness in high-growth markets resulted in flat core growth for the quarter. Trojan also saw strong municipal demand globally and delivered another good quarter.", "Finally, at ChemTreat, the team grew revenue slightly in the quarter despite headwinds in its industrial and commodity-oriented markets. One of the ways that we continue to augment growth, build our capabilities and better serve our customers is through M&A. Our Water Quality platform has acquired more than 40 businesses since 1996 and continued its healthy cadence of bolt-ons this quarter with Hach's acquisition of Lufft Mess in January. Lufft's long-standing precision sensors \u2013 long-lasting precision sensors, are a key part of weather measuring networks along roads, railways and airports and enable us to deliver value to a wider range of customers around the world. The Hach team does an exceptional job of implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses and this is well underway already at Lufft. DBS lean and growth tools are helping us drive more efficient production, strengthen key account relationships and improve funnel management.", "At Gilbarco Veeder-Root, core revenue grew high-single-digits for the third consecutive quarter. EMV-related demand in the U.S. drove double-digit growth in point of sale solutions and dispenser systems, and we believe we continue to gain share on both fronts. Many of our customers are still in the process of upgrading indoor payment systems for last October's credit card liability shift. Additionally, we're well-positioned to benefit from the upcoming outdoor liability shift and the Gilbarco team is already collaborating with a number of customers to phase in outdoor upgrades. You'll hear more about EMV and GVRs other opportunities at our Investor and Analyst Event next month.", "Moving now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Core revenues grew 2.5% with reported revenues up 42% largely due to our recent Pall and MicroScan acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 205 basis points thanks to the team's solid execution using DBS. Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low-single digits led by healthy demand in high-growth markets. At Beckman Coulter, core revenue increased at a low single digit rate. We saw strong demand for our immunoassay solutions and used our well-established installed base to help drive increased sales in India and China.", "Our consumable streams remain solid, and we're seeing healthy utilization rates globally. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems both increased core revenues in the quarter with growth in China and India offset by declines in other high-growth markets. Our team is focused on improving our customers' experience every day and shows that commitment by expanding our product offering through both innovation and adjacent bolt-on acquisitions. Beckman Coulter's first major bolt-on, IRIS closed in 2012 and extended our foot print beyond blood testing into urinalysis. Since then, IRIS has delivered double-digit growth and expanded operating margins over 1,000 basis points. More recently, the acquisition of MicroScan expanded Beckman's already-strong presence in hospital and reference labs into the microbiology space. It has been one year since we closed the deal and we achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Both IRIS and MicroScan are helping us serve our customers better and we believe that adjacent acquisitions combined with our consistent application of DBS will continue to enhance our comprehensive workflow solutions across our Diagnostic businesses.", "In our Life Science platform, core revenue was up low-single-digits with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. Leica Microsystems core revenues were up low-single-digits as strong performance in North America and China was offset by declines in Japan and Latin America. At SCIEX, core revenues grew low-single-digits driven by demand in China and the Middle East. We also saw healthy sales growth in certain applied end markets and our service business. The SCIEX team has placed a strong focus on improving our customers' experience by pairing service contracts with instrument sales. This has driven record contract capture rates including over 500 basis points of improvement in year-over-year attachment rates in the first quarter alone. SCIEX is a great example of how we use new products to help our customers' most-critical challenges. In the quarter, we launched the X500R, the first model within our X-series product family which was the SCIEX team's largest-ever development project. The X500R is a robust instrument that was specifically designed to serve customers in food and environmental testing labs, two of the fastest-growing end markets in mass spectrometry. Going forward, we expect this to be a significant contributor to our future growth.", "Turning to Pall, we are very pleased with our early progress. This quarter, the Pall team delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth led by double-digit growth in our Life Science business due to demand for our biopharmaceutical solutions including single-use technologies. Our Industrial business was down low-single-digits as we faced challenging market conditions. The team's enthusiastic application of DBS including over 100 Kaizen events since close has led to meaningful process improvements and several product introductions across Pall's Life Sciences and Industrial businesses. As a result of our growth and productivity initiatives, year on year operating margins were up over 250 basis points.", "As we move on to Dental, core revenues increased by 0.5% due to strong demand for consumables and implants in North America and the high growth markets, as well as healthy orthodontic sales in China. These gains were negatively impacted by one less selling day. Over the last several quarters, the Dental team's focus on execution and disciplined spending has paid off in margin expansion. This quarter, the team grew core operating margins by 250 basis points and reported operating margins by over 500 basis points to 14.5%. Our continued investments in innovation have resulted in a number of differentiated product offerings for our Dental customers. At the Chicago Midwinter Dental Show in February, we launched over 15 new products, including Maxcem Elite Chroma, a revolutionary new cement for dental restoration that changes color to indicate the correct time for a dentist to remove any excess material. The first-in-class color indicator simplifies the dentist's procedure and reduces clinical risk.", "At Nobel Biocare, the team drove mid-single-digit average daily sales of implant systems this quarter. Since the acquisition closed, Nobel has achieved over 400 basis points of operating margin improvement and is focused on reinvesting those savings into future growth opportunities.", "Moving now to Industrial Technologies. Revenues declined 1.5% while core revenues were also down 1.5%. Despite the revenue decline, core operating margin expanded 25 basis points while reported operating margin declined 30 basis points to 24.3%. The Automation platform's core revenues decreased at a high-single-digit rate due to the weakness in global industrial markets and a difficult prior year comparison. While we expect this dynamic to largely persist in the near term, we were encouraged by signs of stabilization in the quarter.", "Product Identification core revenues grew at a low-single-digit rate as increased demand for marking and coding was offset by softer demand for the business's packaging and color solutions. Videojet's core revenues increase mid-single-digits driven by what we believe to be continuing share gains in North America and Europe while high-growth markets remain softer. The Videojet team has delivered mid-single-digit growth or better for 9 of the past 10 quarters.", "Last quarter, we announced the acquisition of Laetus, which extends our product ID offerings into track and trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. We're off to a good start with Laetus. The team's early adoption of DBS tools is already driving key process improvements, as quicker service deployment and improved on-time delivery are ensuring that our customers receive the best possible support.", "So to wrap up, our team executed well in the face of challenging economic conditions and we're pleased with our start to 2016. The Danaher Business System remains the driving force behind our performance this quarter, helping to deliver high-teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and 50% year-on-year free cash flow growth.", "We're also off to a great start at Pall where the team drove meaningful process improvements and delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to make progress preparing for the launch of Fortive Corporation, which remains on track to close in the third quarter. Our teams are excited about the unique opportunity to continue developing two separate portfolios of market-leading businesses that we believe will create shareholder value for years to come.", "We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.19 and $1.23, which assumes approximately 2% core revenue growth. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance from $4.80 to $4.95, to $4.85 to $4.98, which would represent a 13% to 16% increase from 2015 adjusted EPS.", "Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Isa, we're now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. We will now take our first question from Scott Davis from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Good morning, Tom and Dan.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Scott.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "China was a bright spot for you guys, and I know last quarter was \u2013 I mean it tracked pretty comparable last quarter as well, but it sounded like things maybe firmed up a little bit. I mean Fluke \u2013 is Fluke your canary in the coal mine in China having that business back in positive territory in the quarter? Maybe just a little color on what you guys are seeing there.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. China unquestionably is \u2013 remains a very good market for us despite much of the headlines that would certainly suggest that there's slowing in various areas. We were very pleased with the performance in China, and I think it was relatively broad-based. If you looked at Danaher versus Fortive, let's say, Danaher was up high-single-digits in China, and Fortive was up mid-single-digits in China. So I think a number of good examples where China remains a very attractive market for us.", "Relative to your specific question on Fluke, Fluke is just \u2013 is an exceptional business overall. We've had a \u2013 it's probably one of our most advanced businesses in terms of both go-to-market as well as local production and product development in China. And while there's clearly still some softness around various industrial segments of the Chinese market, Fluke is a very strong brand in that market and has a very strong share position. So I think we're encouraged by some of the stabilization we see in some of the markets, and in other of those markets, we just continue to see very strong growth.", "Our Dental business continues to perform exceptionally well in China. Life Sciences & Diagnostics broadly continuing to perform well there. So, again, while clearly the headlines would show that that market has pulled back a little bit in the aggregate, it's still a very good place to be.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful, Tom. And then I just wanted to ask where you stand in Pall versus the deal model. Kind of help us now that we're a year in or so, I mean give us a sense of how you \u2013 what's working, what's not working, what \u2013 Industrial is probably far weaker than you thought it was, but the Environmental, or the I should say, the Life Sciences side is probably far stronger than you thought it would be. So how are you managing that variability? And how does it all really stack up at the end of the day versus what your prior expectations were?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Scott, we're in \u2013 it's Dan. We're off to a very good start there. We had mid-single-digit good growth in the quarter. As Tom alluded, that was a combination of double-digit growth in the Life Science side and a slight decline on the Industrial side. Clearly that would have been a contributor to our overall organic growth at Danaher.", "From a margin perspective, we are ahead of schedule. We've talked about north of $100 million of benefit here this year on the margin side, continue to track very well to the ultimate target of $300 million. In addition to this, we are getting favorable mix given the Life Science business is more profitable and we really saw that play out exceedingly well in the first quarter. It'll likely create some opportunities where we'll be able to accelerate some investments here at Pall during this year given we're tracking so well.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "That's great. Good luck, guys. Thank you.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks. Just to follow on Dan's comment a little bit, the team at Pall has just done a tremendous job. It's, as we've mentioned before, it's a great combination of both some seasoned Danaher leaders as well as an exceptional group of folks who have been at Pall for a long time, who together have really brought DBS to life in that business in rapid fashion. You heard me mention about the 100 Kaizens that have gone on. Those have gone on literally around the world.", "And it's just one indication of the rapid rate at which the Pall team has adopted the tools of DBS, and really that has truly contributed to not only the growth dynamic that we're seeing, but certainly has assisted in us getting ahead on the cost takeouts on the margin side.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Steve. Good morning.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Just back to Pall just to follow up on that, I think they were doing a little bit better than $100 million in R&D a year, and R&D year-over-year was up I think about $20 million bucks. Is that a little bit of a decline in the core R&D? Or are you kind of getting efficiencies there on the Pall side?", "You also mentioned you're kind of walking away from some business there I think in your 10-Q at Pall. Could you just give us a degree of magnitude on that front? And then I have one quick follow-up.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Steve, on the walking away from some business, that's something that Pall had started prior even to our acquisition. It's down to a relatively nominal amount here and we'll be...", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think largely done by the middle of this year.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then on the R&D front, what was kind of Pall's R&D? I think it was greater than $100 million. Are you guys getting more efficiencies there? Do you expect to maintain that R&D budget, increase it?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I would \u2013 right now, we're sustaining and I suspect over time that will get increased.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. So...", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would just add to that, I think we've mentioned this maybe once before, but if you think back to the play book that we ran post the Beckman acquisition, I think the play book here at Pall is very similar, which is there's a number of opportunities to get cost out of the business broadly defined. And we're working on those, obviously, to start to see the margins coming up. But the play book is to then redeploy some of that cost takeout into investments in sales and marketing in R&D.", "You see us do that broadly across Danaher with gross margins going up and sales and marking and R&D on the quarter for Danaher in total up 30 basis points. We did that at Beckman. R&D lifted over time. We started to get the innovation engine going. Innovation at Pall has always been a strong suit there, but we think we can take it up another level. So some of those cost takeouts will ultimately translate into either higher spending or potentially more efficient spending if we find opportunities to do a better job innovating at the same cost rate. We'll see.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just lastly on the free cash flow, a very strong quarter. Obviously, you're paying down some debt, beginning to delever here a little bit. Is there anything about the timing of that free cash flow? Or should we think about kind of normal seasonality off of that base? I know there were some accruals, year-over-year accruals were less of a drag. Maybe there's just some timing. I mean, maybe the bottom line, is what's kind of the annual free cash guide?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, Steve, you know we don't give a specific guide but we're off to a very good start. There was a little bit of timing benefit around some tax payments, but broadly our cash flow was quite strong. As you know, we ended last year with a record number and a very strong second half for free cash flow. We expect that trend to continue. You know, we're not going to be up 40% year-on-year, but we'd expect a very healthy double-digit increase in free cash flow this year.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right. Okay. Awesome. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Our first quarter last year was...", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And we were a little bit light.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "A little lighter last first quarter. So a little bit of benefit there from a comp standpoint.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. Thanks.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nigel Cole from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey. Thanks. Good morning.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Nigel.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Hi. Tom, so you mentioned you've seen signs of stability. I think that was in relation to Fluke specifically. But maybe if you could just broaden out the conversation to maybe some of the more cyclical businesses within Industrial Tech, Tektronix. What are you seeing today compared to what you saw back in January?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Thanks, Nigel. Our comments about stability were not exclusively associated with Fluke. In fact, I think there's some pockets even around the Fluke business where we've seen stability, but we've also seen still some real headwinds. But I think we have seen stability in some other areas. You asked specifically about on the Industrial Tech side. The Automation businesses, our Sensors & Controls businesses, as we looked at those throughout the course of the quarter, February and March, we saw indications of stability. We saw those order rates kind of firm up a little bit. And while we wouldn't call it an upward trajectory, we would call those a bit more stable than we had seen in the trajectory of the fourth quarter and maybe at the very opening of the year.", "You mentioned Tektronix, I wouldn't necessarily put Tektronix quite in that category yet. It had one of the more challenging quarters. It's in one of the tougher markets probably that we face today. And so I think while we're very encouraged by the new product flow at Tektronix and we expect to see those new products drive some improved performance in the back half of the year, tech remains in a pretty challenging environment.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just switching to environmental margins, obviously a lot of noise this quarter. You called out investment spending. I'm wondering if you could maybe help us size that impact. And it seems that this quarter you had a negative mix of consumables versus GVR growth. Is that true and would you expect that to normalize over the balance of the year?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I'll need you to clarify that last question. I'm not exactly sure what you meant by negative mix relative to GVR growth unless you're talking about Water Quality versus GVR within Environmental. Was that your question?", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Exactly. Yeah. (32:55) GVR to the margin. Yeah.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. No, absolutely right. Yeah. Thanks, Nigel. You're right on. If you look at Environmental, which as all of you know both has our GVR business as well as our Water Quality businesses, GVR had stronger growth during the course of the quarter, very encouraging signs of the EMV dynamic taking hold. And GVR comes through that with a lower margin mix relative to our Water Quality platform which has higher margins, and specifically Hach. So a little bit softer Hach business, a little bit stronger GVR business during the course of the quarter together causes some of that headwind that you saw on the margin line there.", "The reference to investment spend is specific to what we need to do to build the capacity to step up to the demand associated with EMV. And so we see that in specifically in our GVR business, and those are investments that clearly will pay off as we continue to ramp our capabilities. And as we go into the second quarter and beyond, we would expect those margins overall in the segment to return closer to normal levels. Obviously, some continued investment there, but we expect water quality to come up a bit. So, overall, I think there were just a couple unique factors here in the first quarter.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's great, Tom. Thanks a lot.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Great. Thanks, Nigel.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Go ahead. Your line is open.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Morning, guys.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Shannon.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, Tom, you mentioned execution and disciplined spending at Dental with the big margin improvement there. I mean that's a segment that you've always targeted getting to much higher margins over the years, but it's been more of a challenge. I mean is this something of a breakthrough here? Or how should we read the performance and those comments?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, you're absolutely right, Shannon. It's been a challenge in the past, and we did set our sights and commit to making a difference there. We have some new leadership in place over the platform. Many of you have met Amir Aghdaei, who has led a number of our businesses over the last several years and some of our more challenging businesses. And he's really put a terrific team together. They've set their sights on specific margin improvements over time. There was some outstanding execution, some disciplined cost control.", "But similar to the comments I made earlier around the play book, I made reference to the Beckman play book and how that applies to Pall, while we'll continue to drive margin improvement at Dental under the team's leadership, we'll also take some of that improvement and continue to invest in sales and marketing and in R&D, because we do have opportunities for improvement in terms of our innovation cadence. We saw some modest improvement there in our core growth in the platform during the quarter, but we know there's opportunities to continue to improve that.", "We expect it to continue to step up, but some additional investment over time with some of that cost takeout will certainly be a help.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. And then, Dan, maybe a question for you on tax. Obviously a lot of new tax policies being contemplated and put into place that impact a lot of multinationals. Any, just, thoughts on that in general and potential impacts on Danaher as well as how should we think about kind of the two NewCo tax rates and any differentials there?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Shannon. Yeah, obviously it's something we're spending a lot of time on trying to understand better. I mean our initial read of this is, this is not going to be an impact to us, a material impact to us in the near term. But over time, we could see some rate creep because of it. Now that assumes nothing else happens, and there's no other opportunities, and so sitting here right now, it's not something that worries us a great deal. But it's obviously a potential risk kind of going forward.", "I don't think there's a big change in how we think about the tax rates of the two entities. We've talked about Fortive likely coming out closer to kind of a high 20%s tax rate. Again, I think as they begin to do some acquisitions, they'll have an opportunity to bring that down, and I would expect that Danaher would be at our current rate or lower. Danaher RemainCo would be at our current rate or lower.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Helpful. Thanks a lot.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Shannon.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thanks, and good morning, all. Could you maybe just clarify what \u2013 you talked about Fortive versus Danaher core growth in China. What was it globally for the quarter?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Danaher was up a couple points and Fortive was down one to two points, say 1.5%, I believe.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. And, well, I guess everybody, what are you thinking about in terms of, current thinking I should say, on capital structure for the two entities? Where are you still heading for that? I know there have been some private conversations, but don't have a sense for where that is now.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I don't think much has changed versus what we communicated a year ago. We would expect Fortive to come out as an investment-grade company. You know likely they're not going to be an A-rated company, but something in a BBB range where they would be strong investment grade and clearly have a fair amount of latitude to execute M&A.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. And if I could just one more. Tom, in terms of the R&D profile, I know you talked a little bit about it before specifically with Pall, but I guess overall for the company, where is \u2013 what level of R&D are we talking about for the new Danaher going forward? And do you see an opportunity to accelerate that at all as you think about also accelerating core growth in new Danaher?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Thanks, Steve. I've said for a long time I've always believed that there is no magic number for a business with the diverse portfolio that we have today. We really look at continuing to invest in R&D to certain levels specifically at an operating company level. And that's obviously relevant for \u2013 or relative to what's important to those markets, what's important for our competitiveness, what yields the greatest levels of competitive advantage from an innovation perspective. So we really look at it sort of operating company by operating company.", "Our track record is a great one and it will continue of taking R&D up year-on-year pretty consistently. We've used our operating margin expansion that's been driven by improvements in gross margin to put some of that back into not only R&D but into sales and marketing as well. And again, we've done that very consistently. I would expect that we will continue to do that. One of our five core values is Innovation Defines Our Future. And we represent that in our metrics by continuing to see that percent of R&D go up year-on-year. So, again, it will vary in terms of the number that we achieve year-on-year by operating company or even by platform, but using innovation to drive competitiveness is key to our strategy.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. But what was it? I mean, what was it in the quarter at least just for the current or for the new Danaher?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We were over \u2013 probably in the same \u2013 Steve, we have the dynamic around Pall where a lot of the application expertise they bring to their customers which is a big part of their value add, they include in sales and marketing than R&D. So the fact that you saw R&D as a percent of our overall revenues go down 40, 50 basis points year-on-year, that's entirely driven by the Pall dynamic. But I would say that Danaher is probably in that zone where you've got some higher R&D businesses. But because of the way Pall accounts for their R&D, it probably averages to where Danaher is today, around that 6% range.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Good morning, guys. Maybe on the Life Science business, just a little bit more color commentary. You called out pharma as sort of a strong end-market it seems like on the SCIEX side. That market's been running hot for a while. I mean, how do you see the trajectory there? And then secondarily on the Pall side, biotech, there's obviously been a lot of concern in the market, particularly with the smaller companies on funding and the like. Have you seen anything in that side of the business, particularly with small to mid-size biotechs in terms of any relevant slowdowns? Thanks.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Ross. Yes \u2013 no question the pharma market is an important driver of our growth across the Life Science portfolio. And we have exposure to that growing market across virtually every one of our Life Science businesses. Pall, specific to your question around biotech and small and mid-size, continues to perform exceptionally well across the biotech market. Just to go back and talk about a few things about what's going on in that market, Pall has a billion-dollar business today that's oriented towards biopharmaceuticals.", "And the combination of the solutions that they've had for a number of years along with the newer products in single-use technologies continue to drive the exceptional growth that we see there. That growth, as I think many of you know, Ross, and others know is really driven by this move, the growth and the transition from small molecule drugs to large molecule drugs. And not only are those the fastest growing segment of the market, but they're also the drugs that are most significantly represented in the pipelines of both small as well as large pharmaceutical companies today.", "So we remain optimistic and bullish on that market, and I think there's every reason to believe that we'll continue to see good growth not only from Pall but from our other Life Science businesses that have exposure to that market.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Great. And maybe just quickly on the capital allocation side. So a lot of equity market volatility to start the year. Private equity has probably been more of a net seller than buyer. I mean how has this sort of impacted asset prices on the private side in terms of what you're looking at? And does it make sellers more apt to maybe approach a process given they saw equity prices up, down, up again, maybe they're afraid they go down again and so they want to take advantage of maybe an opening in the sort of credit markets where larger companies can acquire? I mean I'm just trying to get a feel for kind of how all this volatility has maybe helped you a little bit on the deal front.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I mean volatility is a net positive for us as a well-capitalized acquirer. Your comment about private equity, it's getting a little better for them, but the leverage markets are still pretty tough. So I think all those factors play to our benefit. Now granted there are other \u2013 a number of other well-capitalized corporate players here. But we're happy to sort of compete in this sort of environment where there's a little bit more volatility and uncertainty.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Great. Thanks, Dan.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Ross.", "Operator", "Question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Jeff.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hey. Just a couple. First on SG&A, I guess, Dan, you kind of partially answered it speaking to the Pall R&D. But the SG&A moving up as a percent of sales, is there anything to flag there? And do you expect that sort of upward pressure over the balance of the year?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, if we first just take Pall out of the equation entirely, R&D as a percent of sales was flat year-on-year, but sales and marketing was up 30 basis points, and that was intentional. I mean we've stepped up some investments. We've talked about some of the opportunities in high-growth markets where we see people pulling back, and we see there's some opportunity. I think some of the success Fortive's having in China right now is probably a little bit of an example of that.", "And Pall brings in a pretty high sales and marketing expense when you kind of layer that in. That probably sustains itself. We see that as an important part of their go-to-market, not only their go-to-market but as I mentioned also sort of part of their R&D as well. So we don't see ourselves sort of cutting back on those investments, if anything given we have had a little bit more strength here earlier in the year, we may step some of that up.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And on tax, you mentioned creep and maybe there could be some offsets. Have you guys looked at this FASB change on stock comp and determined what, if any, benefit you'll have when you choose to adopt that?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We don't think it would be meaningful.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And then just finally, the six small deals, were any of those in Fortive? And if so, what?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "One was Fortive. It was an acquisition for Gilbarco.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And that's on top of a couple more we did late last year. So in the last four or five months, it's three deals, Jeff.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Great. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. You bet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Deane.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, I'd just like to go back to the 2016 guide and just to clarify, has there been any change to the core revenue outlook for 2% to 3%? And then maybe a bit on the cadence of that through the year and how might that split with Fortive?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Deane, no real change to our view of the full year at 2% to 3%. I think our comments referring to some stabilization that we've seen here in the last couple of months I think suggest \u2013 as well as by the way how that was represented in the order rates, not just the sellout but the order rates in the last couple of months, suggest that we still feel pretty good about the 2% to 3%. So I think we're going to stay there.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And how about the expectations for Fortive in the second quarter?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. We would expect that Fortive would be in the same zone, maybe a little bit better. Danaher ex-Fortive would be slightly better and that would roll up to be approximately 2% versus 0.5% of core we delivered in the first quarter.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. And then maybe some clarification on Hach, the softness in the high-growth markets, is there anything specific there? Is it tougher comps? Why might there be some slowing there?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, it certainly was a very challenging comp year-on-year. The platform overall I think comped at 10% versus last year, Deane. So it was probably, among the platforms that we have, it was probably the toughest comp perhaps across the entire corporation. So that was certainly challenging. We have seen some delays in some key projects in a couple of the high-growth markets. So that was certainly a factor there. In certain of those high-growth markets, we actually have a little bit more industrial exposure than purely municipal exposure, and that obviously had an impact in those markets.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Again, we don't \u2013 that business, you know it well, Deane, is just one of our exceptional franchises. And we're confident that business continues to \u2013 will continue to grow over time and we'll see that business' core growth rate improve here in the second quarter.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. And then just last one and still on the topic of Hach. I don't recall ever there being a time where Water Quality has been more front page news in the U.S. with Flint, Michigan. And just what's your expectation about the longer-term implications on water quality, water tests and how is Hach positioned?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Well, we wish we had an answer today to the infrastructure challenges that lead pipes represent in that situation. It's just terrible to see the challenges that that community has gone through. But I think if we try to look on the bright side from the standpoint of the overall market dynamics, situations like that always turn the spotlight up on the importance of regulatory oversight in municipalities around the country, and frankly, throughout the world. And so, if those regulatory drivers continue to be strengthened, to be pointed at the greatest vulnerabilities in municipal and industrial systems, that, again, while challenging for those communities, ultimately benefits consumers and certainly benefits us. Regulatory drivers have always been a key macro driver for that platform, and they will continue to be so for as long as we can anticipate.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Deane.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Good morning.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Andrew.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I guess on the Q, you sort of indicated that you're still on track to pay the $3 billion dividend from Fortive to Danaher. Is there any flexibility around that number if Fortive discovers a good acquisition? How flexible are you there?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, that's something obviously the Board would need to determine depending on obviously the size of the acquisition and what else they have in the pipeline.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "It's fair to assume that there's some flexibility there.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Nothing's set until it's set.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then just going back to GVR, the EMV investment and both growth and investment, is it fair to assume that investment is going to be front-end loaded Q1 and Q2 but you might see growth throughout the year? Is that the right way of thinking about it?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. There's clearly some upfront costs. And as Tom alluded, we also had some one-time items in the quarter and that will normalize as we get through the year.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Andrew.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Thank you. Just a question on Dental first. The growth rate was lower than I thought, particularly as Nobel should have automatically pushed up the organic growth a little bit and the comp was pretty easy. So I saw you called out Middle East and Africa equipment. But I wouldn't have thought that was a very sizeable piece of the business. So maybe just give a bit more color there.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Well, our Dental growth overall, Julian, was at a half a percent was basically in line with our expectations, modest improvement from where we've been over the last few quarters. And obviously as we talked just a few minutes ago, we're very pleased with seeing the OMX up at the rate that I talked about earlier. We saw solid low-single-digit growth in consumables and sell-out continues and actually is a fraction better than even our sell-in. So we always look at that sell-out. We have good transparency with our distribution partners, and we're encouraged by that.", "The Nobel Implant Systems business, mid-single-digit average daily sales growth in the quarter. We were pleased with that. The Ormco business, the orthodontics business continues to do well, and we're continuing to see on a geographic basis as I mentioned the \u2013 a couple of the high-growth markets specifically the \u2013 our business in China continuing to do well.", "On the flip side, on the equipment side, we have seen some challenges in Europe actually, and a couple in those high-growth markets where the equipment side has been held back a little bit more significantly. So I think as we annualize over some of those more challenging comps, we'll continue to see that growth improve during the course of this year.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Got it. Thanks. And then secondly, just on Test & Measurement, I wondered obviously that the trends year-on-year are sort of similar Q1 as in Q4. I wondered if there was any specific end market you'd call out that's sort of dragging on the growth now? Obviously, you do have some electronics exposure, for example, in T&M. Or if you thought it was sort of fairly broad-based, the weakness?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, there's certainly some broad-based weakness, but if I had to call out a couple of the softer spots, it probably would be the end markets where tech is most exposed and then probably secondarily, it would be on the Fluke side probably the U.S. point of sale has been a weaker spot here through the quarter. Those would be the two I'd probably highlight.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "And you're expecting those to be little changed in Q2?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We are. That's right. There's no indication right now of pick up there. Obviously, we can always be optimistic, but we're not projecting for any improvement there certainly in the second quarter.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Very helpful.

The second quarter was a busy and exciting one for Danaher. Despite challenging economic conditions, we are pleased with our performance as the team's consistent focus on execution helped deliver solid core revenue growth, high teens adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow performance.", "On July 2, we successfully completed the spinoff of Fortive Corporation, a new industrial growth company. The earlier than expected completion of the separation is a testament to our process orientation, execution focus and exceptional teamwork. We continue to believe that the separation will provide significant opportunities for both Danaher and Fortive to independently build even greater shareholder value in the years ahead.", "Since we own Fortive through the end of the second quarter, we will start with financial highlights that reflect the combined Danaher and Fortive results. We'll then provide detail for the businesses remaining with Danaher, outline our planned new reporting segments, and provide guidance for Danaher's continuing operations excluding Fortive for the third quarter and the full year. Since the Fortive team will be reporting their second quarter results separately next week, we'd ask that you please save any questions about the Fortive businesses until then.", "Now, turning to the details of the second quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.25, an increase of 17% over last year and our third consecutive quarter of mid-teens or better adjusted EPS growth. Sales grew 16.5% to $5.8 billion and core revenue increased 2%. The impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by half a percent while acquisitions increased revenues by 15%. Danaher remain core revenue was up 3% while Fortive core revenue was down slightly.", "Geographically, high-growth market revenues were up mid single digits led by double-digit growth in China and India. We saw better sequential performance in Latin America and Russia in part because of easier prior-year comparisons. Developed market core revenues were up low single digits led by growth in Western Europe. The U.S. remained roughly flat and we saw declines in Japan during the quarter.", "Gross margin for the second quarter was 54.4%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year. Reported operating margins were 17.9% with core operating margins down 30 basis points. More than 80 basis points of core margin improvement were \u2013 we had more than 80 basis points of core margin improvement at both Dental and Life Science & Diagnostics, which was offset by declines in Test & Measurement and Environmental segments.", "Free cash flow continues to be one of our most important financial metrics, enabling us to pursue organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter, up 14%, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%.", "Now, let's take a look at more detailed results across the Danaher portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenue increased mid single digits led by strength in high-growth markets and Western Europe. At Beckman Life Sciences, we continue to outperform. High-single-digit core growth in the quarter was driven by strong demand in flow cytometry particularly in North America and China.", "The robust growth in flow cytometry was largely driven by demand for our new CytoFLEX product based on the breakthrough technology, which we acquired as part of the Xitogen acquisition in 2014. This bolt-on acquisition has been a tremendous success and is a great example of how we incorporate novel technology into our portfolio to enhance our offering and expand our customer base. CytoFLEX has been a significant contributor to recent share gains in our flow cytometry business.", "At Leica Microsystems, we saw improved results versus previous quarters as recent new product introductions helped drive low-single-digit core revenue growth. Two such new product introductions included are Leica DVM6 digital microscope launched at the end of 2015 and our new Leica M530 neurosurgery microscope, which is off to a great start in China after successful launches in Europe and North America last year. The M530 is a standout combination of our high-resolution optics technology with improved ergonomics, helping neurosurgeons stay focused during their demanding high-precision procedures.", "Core revenues at SCIEX were up mid-single digits, as we saw continued strength in pharmaceutical, food and environmental end markets. We had another very strong quarter in China as new regulations from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration helped drive increased demand around drug testing and food safety.", "In June, SCIEX announced a number of new workflow solutions at ASMS, the American Society of Mass Spectrometry annual meeting. These solutions are geared towards fast-growing markets such as biologics, proteomics, food and environmental testing. We showcased the latest QTRAP 6500+ mass spectrometer that provides enhanced sensitivity and selectivity to create a powerful workflow solution for biologics analysis. We also rolled out BioPharmaView Software 2.0, which accelerates automated data processing and simplifies reporting, enabling biopharma researchers to make better decisions faster.", "At Pall, core revenues were up mid-single digits for the quarter compared to last year as a stand-alone company. Continued strong demand in biopharma, particularly single-use technologies, led to double-digit core revenue growth in Pall Life Sciences. In Pall Industrial, revenues were down low-single digits, but we're continuing to see some signs of stabilization in those end markets.", "Pall continues to ramp exceedingly well across a number of key metrics. The team's commitment to the Danaher Business System has resulted in on-time delivery improving by more than 1,500 basis points with greater productivity and quality driving improved customer satisfaction.", "Since acquisition, faster-than-expected cost savings and meaningful operational gains have contributed to sizable growth and operating margin improvements. As a result of the team's impressive start, we've been able to redirect some of that benefit into R&D and sales and marketing investments. By pursuing this combination of margin enhancement and growth opportunities, we believe we can continue to drive innovation and improve Pall's competitive advantage.", "The Pall team showcased a number of innovations such as acoustic wave separation in our new single-use bioreactor at the INTERPHEX biomanufacturing trade show in April. Our expanded single-use product offering has enhanced our competitive position as pharmaceutical companies look to shift from traditional large infrastructure stainless steel systems to more efficient production processes.", "Pall's bioprocessing solutions help our customers save significant time, energy and money, while greatly reducing cross-contamination risk, which provides the flexibility to easily and safely make multiple products in one facility.", "Moving now to Diagnostics; core revenues increased low-single digits with double-digit gains in China and India, partially offset by weakness in the Middle East and the Americas. At Beckman Coulter, core revenues were up low-single digits, driven primarily by strengthened high-growth markets. This past June marked the fifth anniversary of the Beckman acquisition. We've made tremendous progress since then, significantly improving quality, delivery and our overall customer experience, while using productivity gains to help fund new product development and add feet on the street.", "Another quarter of good execution by the Beckman team contributed to healthy core operating margin expansion, and we continue to reinvest in high-impact growth opportunities. New menu additions are gaining traction, including our vitamin D and AMH fertility test in our amino assay business. Our recently launched molecular diagnostic platform, VERIS, continues to gain early traction in Europe. New product developments like these, combined with opportunities at recent bolt-on acquisitions like MicroScan, will continue to help build meaningful runway for growth at Beckman going forward.", "Radiometer achieved mid-single-digit revenue growth, with healthy performance in Western Europe and China, partially offset by weakness in Latin America and the Middle East. Our growing installed base of blood gas instruments and AQT analyzers contributed to solid consumable sales in the quarter. The Radiometer team also recently launched the TCM5 FLEX, a new transcutaneous monitor design. This noninvasive monitor measures ventilation per patients in critical condition. And the TCM5 updated design is easy to use and reliable, providing nurses and doctors with improved usability while maintaining accuracy and precision. At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid single digits. Results were driven by a combination of strength in high-growth markets and continued growth of instrument placements in advanced staining and core histology.", "Moving now over to our Dental segment. Core revenues were up mid single digits with growth across consumables, equipment and implants. We saw particular strength in our restorative and Ormco product lines. Geographically, China had another strong quarter with double-digit growth, and we maintained positive momentum in North America and Western Europe.", "Nobel had another good quarter, with mid-single-digit core revenue growth. We've improved operating margins at Nobel by more than 500 basis points since acquisition, enabling us to direct some of our savings into expanded product offerings and accelerated sales and marketing efforts. This is similar to what you've seen us achieved at other large acquisitions like Beckman and Pall, where operational improvements help fuel renewed focus on new product development and go-to-market initiatives.", "The Nobel team has launched more than 20 new products since acquisition and featured a number of these recent innovations at the Nobel Biocare Global Symposium in June. Nobel's new On1 implant base remains in position during the entire restorative workflow; from implant placement to finalization and for the lifetime of the restoration. This helps simplify the dental surgeon's workflow and allows for an improved patient experience.", "And our new NobelParallel CC implant is a straightforward, highly versatile implant system providing an efficient treatment flow that can be used in a wide variety of implant cases. Both of these new innovations help us serve our customers with better solutions to improve their patients' experience and treatment.", "Turning to product identification. Core revenues increased low single digits. We saw increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies, partially offset by softness in some of our packaging and color solutions offerings.", "Videojet's substantial and growing installed base contributed to mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strong market performance in North America, Latin America and Western Europe offset softness in certain high-growth markets. Videojet recently introduced a new service offering that enables our technicians to remotely gather data from a printer that's experiencing a fault or a failure condition. This helps our customers return to normal operation much faster, often without a site visit. With our range of comprehensive, preventive services, we're able to improve end-user productivity over the course of a printer's lifespan, ultimately reducing operating costs and enhancing customer satisfaction.", "In June, Esko successfully launched a number of new products and innovations at drupa, the world's largest printing equipment exhibition, which is held every four years in Germany. This is the most important tradeshow in the industry. Esko introduced more than a dozen significant hardware and software innovations at drupa this year including a suite of powerful new software tools to help customers simplify, automate and integrate their complex packaging and label production work flows. We originated a record number of leads and orders at drupa, which we expect to help drive improved growth at Esko and across the Product ID platform in the second half of the year.", "Lastly, turning to Water Quality. Core revenues grew low single digits with strength in Western Europe, India and China partially offset by lower demand in Japan and Eastern Europe. Hach had a solid quarter with mid-single digit core revenue growth. Results were driven by strength in U.S. municipal markets and Western Europe. We saw improved growth in China as Hach continues to benefit from ongoing regulations around water quality monitoring and analysis in the region.", "Hach's on-line water monitoring solutions are in place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for next month's Summer Olympics. Our solutions are installed at the majority of event sites, including the largest soccer stadium in the world. We'll apply our expertise to monitor water quality in order to help Brazil execute a successful Olympic Games. After the events wrap up, the Hach systems will be transferred to municipal water plants across the country, benefiting local communities for many years to come.", "At Trojan, high-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter was a result of a number of project wins in North America, Western Europe and Australia as well as robust demand in municipal markets. And finally at ChemTreat, core revenues grew low single digits despite exposure to weaker industrial and commodity-oriented end markets.", "So to wrap up, the Danaher team executed well in a challenging macro environment. The thoughtful application of DBS continued to drive results with meaningful process improvements enabling reinvestment in high-impact growth initiatives. One of Danaher's core values is innovation defines our future, and the successful new product launches we've seen across the portfolio demonstrate our commitment to providing customers with truly differentiated technology to strengthen our collective competitive advantage.", "Following the launch of Fortive, Danaher will be a diversified multi-industry science and technology company united by common business models and the power of DBS. We remain focused on improving growth, margins and cash flow and will continue to pursue meaningful organic and inorganic opportunities to strengthen our market-leading portfolio of businesses.", "Going forward, Danaher's businesses will be organized across four segments: Life Sciences, including all of Pall; Diagnostics; Dental; and Environmental and Applied Solutions, which includes our Water Quality and Product Identification businesses. For further details, please refer to the supplemental information that we posted on our website this morning. This marks the start of an exciting new chapter for Danaher and we look forward to the exciting opportunities we see in the years ahead.", "We are initiating third quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $0.80 to $0.84. We are assuming third quarter core revenue growth of 3% or better. For the full year 2016, we are anticipating adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.60, which at the midpoint would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015. Both our third quarter and full year guidance exclude the impact of Fortive.", "Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Ashley, we're now ready for questions. As a reminder, we just ask you to please keep your questions specific to Danaher and save any Fortive questions for their earnings call next week.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Unknown Speaker", "Thank you. We will take our first question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Nigel.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning, Tom. So, I just wanted to just fill in the gaps on the FY guide. You said 3% or better for 3Q. Is that the working assumption for 4Q as well? And then, what assumptions are you making in terms of the corporate dis-synergies in the back half of the year? I mean, obviously, there's a corporate line which is unallocated but then there's some corporate absorbed by the segments. I'm just wondering how that impacts margins in the second half of the year. Any color would be helpful.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So Nigel, this is Dan. So, Q3 we're talking about 3% or better core. I think if we \u2013 in that zone, in part because we have a little bit of easier comparison in the fourth quarter, core could be a little bit higher than that. Regarding the corporate on a combined basis, we've talked since the beginning and we're still sort of in that zone about $70 million to $80 million of corporate dis-synergies from the two entities, and going forward, corporate will remain in kind of the low $40 million for Danaher.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, does that impact the segment line as well, Dan? Or is it just within that unallocated line? So, I guess what I'm saying is the 2Q, 1Q pro forma segment numbers for new Danaher, is that a good base for the second half of the year?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. And then just on Dental, you gave some details on the moving parts, will work out better in 2Q. But I'm just wondering, given the pretty soft acceleration from 1Q to 2Q, was there any pull forward or pull back from 1Q to 2Q? Was there some channel volatility? Or is this just natural volatility that we will see from time to time?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Nigel, we did see some core improvement without a doubt in Dental, 4% core growth in Dental, and a good part of that was clearly around better execution and to some extent, a little bit easier comp. We saw good performance in implants and equipment at mid-single-digit growth. Consumables, more like low single digit. Terrific performance in China continued. You've heard us talked to double-digit growth in China and we saw that continuing. U.S. and EU getting a little bit better and the high-growth markets, still challenging for sure but we are rounding around some easier comps. You heard me talk about good solid performance at Nobel. That continued.", "That said, relative to your question about any impact, there may have been a little bit of pull forward on some revenues just based on the nature of the calendar and the way the calendar worked on the end of the quarter but, in general, I think we were very pleased with the performance. Given seasonality, we could see some moderation in the Q3 growth rates at low-single digits. That's typically a function of more European exposure and the summer tends to be a little bit slower. So, we won't necessarily see a straight line to the improved performance, but we were very, very pleased with the execution in the second quarter and we think we've got a very good trajectory behind us that bodes well for, I think, the quarters to come.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Nigel.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey. Thanks, and good morning, guys.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Steve.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey, Tom. Just on the segmentation, the new segmentation front, a couple of questions here. One, why is Pall Industrial stuck in Life Sciences? And then secondly, on Environmental and Applied Solutions, I thought maybe Water Quality and Product ID would be stand-alone. Are they just not big enough yet? Or is there a strategic thought here, number of segments? I mean, how are you thinking about those two?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Thanks, Steve. Relative to Pall, we did think it was important to keep those together in a single segment. Obviously, the Life Science part of the Pall portfolio is the larger part of the portfolio. There's commonality internally at Danaher from a reporting standpoint, both in terms of both businesses, both sides of the business reporting into a President at Pall as well as an EVP overseeing all of Life Sciences. There's also commonality across R&D and supply chain and operations.", "So, there's a lot of reasons operationally to keep the businesses together and therefore, somewhat from a reporting standpoint as well. I mean, realistically, we probably could have split them up, but I think we would probably reevaluate that over time. And see how we might run the businesses in the years to come. But I think for right now, that's probably the best approach is to keep them together.", "In terms of Environmental and PID, I think those businesses do share some commonality in terms of serving some different applied end markets. We could have kept them separately. They would've been far smaller segments. So, I think we felt that those kind of went together and provided some flexibility for us as we defined ourselves as remaining a multi-industry company, there obviously is some flexibility maintained in terms of how we might add to that segment over time.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then I suppose sticking on the same M&A or the same theme here on M&A, I know it's bumpy, but you did six last quarter I guess and zero this quarter. Was it \u2013 were you busy with separation, things just didn't come together? How's the pipeline looking going forward? What should we kind of expect in terms of momentum or pace on the M&A front?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Steve, it didn't have anything to do with being busy or in any way focused on other things. Acquisition volume kind of ebbs and flows over time and so we think the pipe \u2013 we know the pipelines remained quite good. We have active conversations in each one of the platforms, so we feel very good about where we are. We have obviously a terrific balance sheet to work with and I think we'll see good things in the quarters to come.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "And you emphasize the multi-industry diversified nature as well as science and technology, but are you as optimistic on the Environmental and Applied Solutions I supposed in Pall Industrial front as you are on the other parts of the business?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We are. We continue to have teams that focus as we always have in each one of the operating companies and in each one of the platforms focused on developing funnels, ensuring that we have active cultivations and yes we remain bias towards applying our free cash flow to each one of the businesses across the portfolio.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. I'll hand it off. Thanks.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Steve.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Next we will take Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Good morning. How are you doing?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Great.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Congrats on getting Fortive done. Hey, just maybe a couple of business-related questions, drilling in a little bit. Tom, could you elaborate a little bit what was going on in Environmental core margins in the quarter, why they're under pressure and kind of what the trajectory is looking forward?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Jeff, thanks for the question. In general, we feel very good about where those businesses are. I'll speak specifically to the Hach business. We had very good performance in the prior quarter \u2013 in the same quarter last year. In addition, we're making some investments from a growth standpoint in those businesses. So, I think we'll continue to see margin expansion from the Water side of the Environmental segment and I think those investments overall are going to pay off in terms of good growth rates in the quarters to come. So, it's not an area of concern for us.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And Jeff, two things to add. One is Gilbarco had better growth than the Water business, so there's a negative mix in there for the segment and we had our best \u2013 best segment was Q2 last year was probably 150 basis points, 200 basis points better than any other quarter we had in 2015. So, a little bit of a comp issue as well. But as Tom alluded to, we are investing pretty heavily right now in the Water business organically.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Speaking of investment, maybe just kind of a total new Danaher question but the idea of kind of restructuring, be it quiet or otherwise, is that likely part of the equation here as you progress through the year? And could you give us some idea how to think about that?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Jeff, as we, I think, showed last year, we've established a cadence of restructuring that has gone on, you might say quietly but I would say more consistently and appropriately throughout the course of the year. As opportunities have come up, we've taken advantage of those in each of the quarters. And so, we still have opportunities for some level of restructuring in the third and fourth quarter. But in general, we've been more balanced through the course of the year. And I think that has served us well in terms of the operating margin expansion that you've seen over time late last year and this year as well.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And then finally, just back to Environmental and Water, specifically in the muni markets. So, we've been kind of hearing for a couple quarters that things are gaining traction; obviously, had a strong quarter at Trojan. Could you speak a little bit to the forward visibility there? What's going on in order activity? Do you have top-line visibility into that business now into 2017?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Jeff, it's probably a little bit early to kind of comment on 2017. The muni strength continues to be broad based, both at Trojan and at the Hach business. And at the Hach business, we're seeing it both in Europe and the U.S. Very consistent and healthy spending there. The offset of that both for Hach and ChemTreat is where we serve the industrial or any commodity-oriented markets. They've been challenging.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Right. Thank you very much.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning, guys.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Shannon.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Just on this emphasis on reinvesting some of the synergy upside at Nobel and at Pall into new products, go-to-market investments. What kind of lag are you expecting from that? I mean, when do you expect that to translate into improving organic growth for those businesses and just what you're seeing?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Shannon, it varies depending on where we direct those funds. I think in some cases, when we put investment directly into, say, feet on the street in either a developed market or a high-growth market, we tend to see those investments pay off in just a quarter or two. If we're talking about investments that go into new product development, those tend to have much more of a lag time. As projects get kicked off into early business case-oriented toll gates, you could have several quarters to it, at times, even a couple of years before you might see the impact of a new product investment, again, depending on how early or late stage an existing project might be in the pipeline. So, it's varied.", "I think in the case of Nobel, just to talk to one of the businesses, we've seen those investments pay off relatively quickly. You've seen it in good core revenue growth consistently in that business. They have relatively shorter cycle times in terms of new product development. In businesses like Beckman, for example, and at Pall, the product development cycles are longer, certainly significantly longer at a place like Beckman where oftentimes, we'll have clinical trials and/or regulatory clearances. And so, those new product investments can take some time, obviously.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. And then, yeah, maybe a follow-up to that. I mean, in terms of \u2013 in diagnostics, you talked about Beckman's growth being driven by high-growth markets. What's going on in the developed markets and then maybe it kind of gets to some of your comments you just made there but maybe fill out what's it going to take to get some better growth in developed markets for Beckman?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Yeah, a little bit slower growth in the developed markets. I mean, in general, the developed markets, from an overall perspective, are slower growth markets to begin with. We've always seen better market growth in the overall in places like China and India and the Middle East. So in general, I think we're tracking closer to the market growth rates than anything else. Still have work to do; there's no question about it. We have improved our retention rates and our competitive win rates, but there's still work to do in terms of both go-to-market as well as new product development. And over time, we do believe those will pay off and better growth rates in the developed markets.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And our next question is coming from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Thanks. Tom, just wondering if you can talk about some of the gives and takes, where you're feeling a little bit more constructive by segment in the back half of the year. You talked to the gives and takes on Dental, so maybe you can pass on that. But is Pall Industrial kind of bottoming out here? Could you see some improvement there? Obviously, the academic fund flows may pick up in the back half of the year and that could help SCIEX. So, could you just talk by division where you're feeling a little more constructive for the next couple quarters?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Good morning, Tycho. Thanks for the question. We do think that we're \u2013 as you mentioned, we've seen good performance in Dental. Again, not necessarily a straight line but we're very encouraged by the performance we're seeing. In terms of the other businesses across the second half, I think we'll see continuing better performance across the Diagnostic businesses in particular. We're starting see the benefit of a number of the investments across those businesses. I think we'll see continuing good performance from Water Quality. PID has been pretty consistent along the way, so I think we will see that continue. Our Life Science businesses have also performed well particularly SCIEX as well as Beckman Life Science.", "So, I think we'd see some modest incremental growth there. I would also remind you that we're coming around through some easier comps in the second half as well and so we will get a little bit of benefit from those easier comps really across the entire portfolio.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And since you called out Europe as a source of strength for Life Sciences and Radiometer, are you kind of comfortable with the macro plan in the back half of the year for these markets?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think the Brexit situation certainly has created uncertainty around not just the U.K. but across European theater at large. Uncertainty is rarely a good thing for markets in terms of people's willingness to make investments particularly in instrumentation and higher cost instrumentation. So, I think that uncertainty could potentially result in some slowness in the second half but it's very early to tell.", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Tycho, we've been (38:43) on Western Europe. We've been consistently in kind of a pretty healthy low-single-digit number across Western Europe. It's been pretty broad-based. It is an area where I think because of some of the uncertainties in the last couple of years, we've probably taken a fair amount of share as we've seen some people kind of pull back in Western Europe over the last couple of years. So, it's been a good market for us and we're also seeing Pall doing quite well in Europe but those are, obviously, not in the core numbers yet.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, just lastly on the capital deployment question, earlier you touched on the framework a little bit. Can you just remind us where you're comfortable picking up leverage? And maybe, just any comments on what you're seeing in terms of valuation given how much of this space is run?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, Tycho, we've obviously spent the last year in a significant effort on deleveraging. We're in really good shape. We're south of two-and-a-half times at this point. Initially, we're close to four times leverage. So, we're back to a mode of spending our free cash flow plus and we talk about a couple billion of capacity for this year but going into next year, you're back to more $3 billion to $4 billion of capacity per year. And that's not without \u2013 that's without really stretching the balance sheet.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Tycho.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "So I appreciate, I know you gave us already some color on Pall single use and on SCIEX, but I'd love it if you could tease out at all sort of pharma demand based on sort of customer types of sort of separate maybe pharma from biotech or emerging biotech to see if there's any sort of discernible trend you've seen amongst and it's clear Pall, obviously, having pretty strong growth across the board. But I was wondering if any of the end of markets, whether it's generic or CRO, et cetera, you're seeing any change in demand.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Ross. SCIEX is probably the best business to think about when you think about your question about pharma versus, say, biotech. SCIEX has exposure to both those end markets and we're seeing good performance, healthy demand and fairly consistent demand from both sides of the house there. I'd have to do some follow-up to get you some detail on anything to do with the generics or the CROs, specifically. But clearly in the aggregate, these markets are doing quite well. Pall, as you mentioned, we've talked about the growth that we're seeing in the Life Science side, specifically around our single use technology product offering, where we're seeing continued double-digit growth rates in that area, and that clearly is associated with the growth in biopharmaceutical specifically in the growth in large molecule drugs.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "I guess what I was getting at is more on the zero charts (41:57), so maybe I'd ask it differently. In terms of just the high-growth markets and it's clear China has been good but outside of China, how would you sort of characterize the rest of the key markets? Obviously, LatAm has kind of been a mixed bag overall, but India and some of the other key geographies.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'd say China in particular, India as well, are very good markets for us. But I would say that there's still a long runway ahead for those markets. Some of the generic and the CRO movement into those markets has been on balance, a positive, but there are also components of the market that are still relatively nascent, particularly in terms of what might be going on there in the future relative to large molecule drugs. So, I think there's still a pretty good runway ahead.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "Great. Thanks, Tom.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank, Ross.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good morning.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Derik.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So, could you talk a little bit about capital deployment? I'm just curious now that sort of Fortive has spun out. How do you sort of view your overall strategy in the Life Sciences space? Do you still feel like you want to stay focused on the core \u2013 stand-alone core brands or do you feel the need to sort of become a more integrated provider in the space? Do you think you need to add anything to your Life Sciences & Diagnostics armament?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Derek, I think, first of all, starting at a Danaher level, our bias towards M&A is not \u2013 and the use of our free cash flow to M&A is not specifically skewed towards any of the four segments that I mentioned. We've had a consistent track record of capital allocation across each of those four segments that we'll be reporting on in the future, and I think you'll continue to see us do that. Now specifically to your question around Life Sciences & Diagnostics, what you've seen us do in Life Sciences is continue to broaden our product offering over time and I think you'll continue to see us do that. We have had a bias and we continue to have a bias towards businesses with not only strong brands and significant installed bases, but installed bases that drive good, consistent recurring revenue and consumables growth.", "The diagnostic business is inherently that way, typically, and you've seen us buy businesses with those same characteristics; strong brands, significant installed bases and strong recurring revenue and consumable streams. I think you'd see us continue to do that. We think there is certainly room to continue to expand our Diagnostic product offering and provide hospitals with broader bundles of product. Today, we provide products obviously to the central laboratory, the core clinical laboratory as well as anatomical pathology and to the acute care areas of the hospital. And with expansion of MicroScan into microbiology with IRIS opening up urinalysis for us, I think those types of expansions of our footprint would certainly be characteristic of the types of things that we would hope to do in the future", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. That's really helpful. Just one quick follow-up. It's been over a year since you launched the VERIS platform in molecular. Could you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of installed base and competitive wins and essentially, where is that going? What's the customer type? And then, I assume you're taking share from people because most hospitals have molecular platforms of that size, could you just talk a little bit more and some color on that?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure, Thanks, Derek. Just for everyone's benefit, the VERIS platform is a high-volume, random-access molecular diagnostics instrument that was commercialized for the first time in Europe in the second half of last year. That product line serves the core or central clinical laboratory of major hospitals. And again, as I mentioned, it's a high-volume platform. We're very pleased with the early traction that we've gotten. It is still early. During the first year of a significant new product introduction like that, the first of its kind by Beckman Coulter, it does take a while to build the funnel, but we've been very happy with how that funnel has built the sales opportunity funnel in the last year.", "The installations that we have thus far are running very well. We have four assays in the market right now, but the four assays really are just the beginning. There's a significant roadmap of assay development ahead that will ultimately be commercialized both in Europe as well as in the U.S. That product will need to go through regulatory clearance in the U.S., so it'll be some time before we see the volumes ramp beyond the early days here in Europe. But the feedback from customers has been very strongly positive, and we feel good about the start we have.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And when is FDA approval expected? Thanks.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I usually hesitate to try to put any bets on FDA clearance. There's a fair amount of work to do, even before we file for that clearance. So, I'll probably have a better sense of that in the quarters to come but I couldn't put a date on it today.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Good morning.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Julian.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Morning. Just a question on margins, firstly. So, the core margin in total Danaher fell about 30 bps in Q2. Could you give that comparable number for the remaining business and how you think that will trend in the second half? And tied to that, I guess going back to the Environmental and Applied Solutions segment, the headline margin there was down 300 bps plus in Q2. Should we see that coming back in the second half as the comps on margins get much easier?", "Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. Sure, Julian. On the last one, yes. And as I mentioned earlier, part of the Environmental issue was a comp issue that margins, on a historical restated basis for the Environmental and Applied Solutions were 200 basis points higher in Q2 a year ago. So, you expect that to sort of normalize. Core margins were relatively flat for Danaher. Ex Fortive, that was again somewhat of a function of the prior-year compare. For our full year, we continue to expect 50 to 75 basis points of core margin expansion for Danaher, ex Fortive, and you'll see better performance. So, very good performance in the first quarter. You'll see better performance in Q3 and Q4.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Great. Thanks. And then, just on Pall Industrial, you called out the overall organic sales trend year-on-year. Is there any sort of color you'd give there on specific verticals or markets within that? Any changes?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No. I wouldn't say we've seen necessarily any changes, Julian. I think to the extent that there's good news there, I think it would be that we've seen some stability found in those markets. We continue to make some excellent progress in terms of our go-to-market initiative. We've done over 40 growth-related kaizens at Pall since we acquired the business. And a number of those kaizens have been going on in the industrial markets. And that involves installing DBS tools such as funnel management and transformative marketing that we think is improving our execution in those markets. So, I think the combination of seeing some stability across each one of those end markets in combination with the application of DBS tools, I think has gotten us to a pretty good place. So, I would hope to see some incrementally better performance late this year and certainly entering next year. But I think in general, we're pleased that things have stabilized.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our final question is coming from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning, guys. Thank you. I just want to ask another question on Pall Industrial. If we look back prior to the acquisition, that business was obviously growing a little slower than the Life Science side. But curious if you could maybe take a bigger step back and give us a sense of what you think it will take for Industrial to return to growth. Is it mostly a function of end markets, or is there really more of an execution issue?", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Isaac, good morning and thanks. I think it's both. As I was just mentioning to Julian, I think we've seen the markets themselves from a macro standpoint stabilize a bit; in other words, not get any worse. And we will need to see some improvement in the macro environment to see some meaningful or step function improvement in growth. But we're not waiting for that. Our focus is on ensuring that we have the best sales team on the field, that we're providing those teams with exceptional new product development, that we've got our coverage set up appropriately across geographies and across each one of those verticals. And I think the combination of good market coverage, DBS tools, new product development and some improvement in those end markets is what it's going to take. Obviously, the majority of that we hope to be in our control but a little help from the end market certainly wouldn't hurt.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah, that's helpful. And then one other question on Beckman. If we \u2013 just trying to square up kind of what we saw last week with some of the peer groups in Diagnostics with what you said. Obviously, you've got VERIS and CytoFLEX helping out. If we pull those out, just trying to get a better sense of how you think you're pacing versus the overall market for Diagnostics. And any color there, especially in North America, would be helpful. Thank you.", "Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Thanks, Isaac. Well, as you know, we had come from behind here from the standpoint of the big five in the overall market. I think from a pacing standpoint, we've now gotten to a point where we are very close to, if not at market growth rates with a couple of the competitors as you mentioned that reported last week posting better growth rates. And in doing so, in some cases, as a function of their positions in certain higher growth markets but, in other cases, we simply have work to do in terms of continuing to drive our new product development and our go-to-market initiatives. We're ahead of a couple other competitors in that market and we have demonstrated where, from a competitive win perspective, we've become far more competitive in the overall market.", "So, I think we've made a ton of progress but clearly work to do, and that work is, as you've referenced, is represented by some folks that are still putting up some pretty good numbers. So, I think we've got the initiatives and the investment levels in the right place to continue to make progress, and it'll take a bit of time, but I think we're on the right track.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it.

This is $0.23 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.15 per share better than consensus.", "Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was up $243 million, or 3.1%; operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.5% increase; and income from continuing operations is up $39 million, a 5.6% increase. This quarter's operating earnings of $1.034 billion reflects 12.9% operating margin, consistent with the 12.9% operating margin of third quarter 2014.", "By the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we have had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion.", "Sequentially, revenue is up $112 million, or 1.4%, operating earnings are down $47 million, and operating margin is down 80 basis points. Recall, however, that last quarter's earnings included a gain on the sale of our Cyber commercial security business. Excluding that gain, the operating earnings for the quarter are rather similar.", "On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $1.17 billion, a 5.2% increase. Operating earnings are up $320 million, a very strong 11.3% increase. And operating margins are up 80 basis points, once again, reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations.", "With respect to cash, we had $652 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter; that is 89% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.81 billion year-to-date, 82% of net income from continuing operations.", "You may recall that we received significant advance payments on international orders last year and on commercial shipbuilding orders the year before. That cash is being deployed this year and next as we have previously advised you.", "We are also hampered by OWC growth at Gulfstream, which is the natural result of building test articles in pre-production buildup of parts and wings for the G500 and G600. All of the foregoing makes performance at 100% of net income this year and next problematic.", "In the quarter, we repurchased 7.15 million shares for over $1 billion. We have purchased approximately 19.3 million shares year-to-date for about $2.7 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance to you that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts in excess of this year's free cash flow. To help you size that, we have spent $3.380 billion on share repurchases and dividends year-to-date compared to free cash flow of $1.81 billion. That is a delta of $1.57 billion. That delta is likely to grow in the fourth quarter.", "As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was a good intake of orders in all segments other than the Marine group where we have received several multi-year orders in prior quarters. The Marine group has the largest backlog of all of our operating segments. We ended the quarter with total backlog for the company of $68.7 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter.", "Let me say a few words about each of our businesses, business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue, earnings and margin are all up from the year-ago quarter, as well as for the first nine months of the year. The group reported sales of $2.34 billion, up from the third quarter of 2014 by $54 million, or 2.4%. This represents the group's highest-ever revenue quarter.", "Operating earnings increased $15 million, or 3.6%, to $426 million on an operating margin of 18.2%, a 20-basis point improvement on the year-ago quarter. By the way, this is the fifth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million.", "On a sequential basis, the group experienced some margin compression from the first half, but was nevertheless better than our expectations in guidance to you. We had good order intake in the group at 0.8 to 1 book-to-bill measured in dollar value of orders and 0.9 to 1 in number of units sold. The distribution of the orders is also attractive with the G650 and G650ER leading the way. Only four of the orders were for models not yet in production.", "Much like the automobile industry, general business aviation market is increasingly North America-focused with particularly strong interest from Fortune 500 companies. However, the G650 continues to see activity even in areas experiencing political or economic challenges. We had G650 orders from China, Japan, Brazil and Eastern Europe in the quarter. Our pipeline of projects and active sales discussions are good, so we are reasonably optimistic about order intake for the fourth quarter.", "Next Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter, with revenue of $1.35 billion, operating earnings of $218 million, and a really strong 16.2% operating margin. However, margins are off somewhat against the third quarter 2014, when we enjoyed an operating margin that was 40 basis points higher. Compared to third quarter 2014, revenue was off $50 million and earnings were off $14 million. Importantly, however, year-to-date revenue was flat against 2014; operating earnings are up $57 million, or 9.6%; and operating margin is at 15.7%, up 130 basis points. Combat Systems remains on course for a very strong year.", "The Marine group's revenue is higher than 2014, both for the third quarter and for the first nine months. Revenue in the quarter is up by $267 million, a 14.7% increase to $2.09 billion. Year-to-date revenue has increased by $759 million, or 14.4%, to over $6 billion. The growth in both periods is attributable to the group's submarine programs, both construction, repair and engineering, and to a lesser degree, commercial ship construction activity. This is the strongest revenue quarter ever for the Marine group.", "Operating earnings at $181 million are up modestly compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis points in the quarter and 50 basis points year-to-date as a result of mix shift and a one-time charge at NASSCO on a warranty item in the quarter. However, margins for the first nine months of the year remain a respectable 9.2% and should improve a bit in the fourth quarter.", "And finally IS&T. They continue to outperform our revenue expectations. Revenue of $2.2 billion is off $28 million against last year's quarter, but up $113 million, or 1.7% year-to-date. Recall that we had initially expected a 5.5% revenue decline for the year, and instead, we are up almost 2%.", "Operating earnings of $219 million are up $17 million, or 8.4%, compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 90-basis point improvement in operating margin. Year-to-date, operating earnings are up $100 million, a 17.5% increase on 130-basis point improvement in operating margins. This is a very good news story with both revenue and operating margin higher than expected.", "So what does all this mean as far as the year is concerned? Well stronger than expected operating results in the quarter, a lower than planned tax rate, and somewhat lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.20. Our guidance goes from a range of $8.70 to $8.80 to a range of $8.90 to $9.", "I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for some more details.", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll be brief as I've got just a couple of things to cover before we start the Q&A period.", "As we've discussed throughout this year, we're seeing more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility this year than we have in the past. Still not material in the aggregate, but it's having a negative impact on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue was held steady over the first nine months compared with last year, but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group sales would have been up by 8% year-to-date. As Combat Systems shifts away from a heavy reliance on U.S. military sales to an increasing level of international activity, we'd expect foreign currency fluctuations to continue to be a part of the group's story.", "Moving onto interest expense, the net expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $21 million in the third quarter of 2014. The slight increase is due to lower interest income as we've deployed over $1 billion this year from the balance sheet towards share repurchases and dividend payments. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $85 million.", "At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net debt position at just about break even, a total of $41 million debt in excess of cash. This compares to a net cash balance of about $660 million at the end of the second quarter. And that change, again, is due to the capital deployment activity in the quarter.", "Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the quarter, lower than we expected as a result of increased international earnings as well as favorable contract closeouts and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, reflecting our favorable performance to date, we now expect an effective tax rate closer to 28%.", "We funded our pension plans as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2015 to be approximately $185 million.", "Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A.", "Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue.", "Nicole, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning, everyone.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jason.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Phebe, thanks for the additional detail and color in your opening remarks. It's very helpful. I just had one quick follow-up question though on some of the comments that you made around the book-to-bill. At Gulfstream, with regard to value versus units, it sounds like the number of units were a little bit better than the value. And then you followed on with some positive commentary about the G650. So wondering if you could dive in a little bit more about the difference between the two and what that might say about the pricing environment that you're seeing today for particularly the G450 and G550.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it was largely the difference between the two book-to-bill calculations is really about mix, and let me give you, let me take this opportunity, I think, to give you a little bit of color and detail and I'll parse for you sort of the demand picture, because I think I want you all to understand the demand signals in their totality. So what I'm going to talk to you about is what we have seen so far this year. And I think this context is important.", "First, Gulfstream continues to perform well in the market. This was our strongest third order intake in the last four years. And by the way, it follows the strongest second quarter intake that we had in seven years last quarter. Second, our North American sales activity remains good. And this quarter we saw some resurgence in the international market. Interestingly, with about half of our orders coming from ex-U.S., Asia, Pacific Rim, Australia, Latin America, Mideast. So nice broad order interest and order activity. Third our book-to-bill, as you noted, is wholesome. And fourth, and I think this is also important to recall and understand, our firm backlog for this quarter is $13.6 billion. That's right around the median of our backlog total for three years.", "So what does that mean? It means that the backlog has been remarkably stable. And by the way, recall that our orders come with good deposits and strong contract terms, so they're rather sticky.", "So let me give you a little bit of color going forward. Our pipeline is good, as it's been all year. And if you're interested in the piece parts constituents of the pipeline, it's heavily North American which is wholesome. Public, private companies, high net worth individuals. And these are sophisticated buyers, who're interested in fleet replacement and augmentation. So I think as context, that gives you a little bit of color on what we're seeing.", "Now, with all of that said, there are some non-macro headwinds. We had a competitor with white tails in the G450 and G550 space at very low prices. There are also five to six pre-owned G550s on the market that are less than five years old. And these newer planes are still under warranty. And for some customers, they can be competitive with our new offerings. So with all of that said, we remain pretty cautiously optimistic.", "I think I gave you a little bit more there, but I wanted you to understand how we're seeing the entire market, because I think it's important to see it in its totality.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "That's very helpful. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Phebe, you talked about the disconnect between cash generation and cash deployment. And consistently in the past it's been 100% of conversion. And you teed up the 2015 and 2016 explanation thereof. So I'm just curious: how much of the deployment this year \u2013 I think that you said somewhere around $3.3 billion year-to-date \u2013 is deployed and presumably there'd be more of that in the fourth quarter. How much of that is indicative of what you think free cash flow is once you get through this kind of negative headwind you're seeing in 2015 and 2016? Is that the underlying cash generative base of business that you see out in the 2017, 2018 period of time?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, to the extent that I think that can fully understand your question, we will give you more color on 2016, as we always do, in January of that year. But I'll try to give you some context for 2015 and 2016 and not beyond that, what we see in terms of the cash headwinds. We have those international deposits that we're deploying, as you would expect. And we're building our operating working capital, also as you would expect if you think about it at Gulfstream. So that all flushes out at the end of 2016. So if the essence of your question is there any structural cash generation issue at our company, the answer is no (17:37).", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "By 2017 you see it largely resolved back to the kind of the GD of old, the 100% conversion?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then just a clarification. Jason, the tax rate contribution of $0.20 was how much of the raise?", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So it was $0.05 impact in the quarter. And as I mentioned, I think we're expecting closer to 28% tax rate for the year. So you can do the math on what that does to the fourth quarter.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Got it. Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Just a quick one on IS&T. Obviously, the results there have been much better than you expected. I wondered if you might give us some color on where you're seeing the strength and break out the more traditional service-oriented offerings versus the product-oriented offerings. And maybe comment on the cost structure and your efforts there and what impact that's having. Just a little bit more color on the successes you've been having there.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, so this is a good news story for us. And it's across both Mission Systems and Information Technology. They both had a strong quarter, and they're improving their performance year-to-date. And there is no single area that's driving strength, given the number of programs that we have in that portfolio. There is just constant flux in mix and timing. They have been, but because of their decreased cost structure, they've been winning more than their fair share. So that has added nicely to our book-to-bill which I think year-to-date is about 1-to-1. And those short cycle businesses, that's pretty impressive. So I think it's operating excellence, technical ability, and just focus. So we're very pleased with what they've done.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks, Phebe.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is now open.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Yes. Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hi. I wanted to get back to Gulfstream. And just two things to understand. One, you've talked in the past about potentially moving forward some G650 production, perhaps adding some in the nearer-term which would help the revenue top-line. Can you comment on that? And then also, where does availability stand on the G450 and G550 now in terms of months ahead?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, let me take them in the inverse order. The G450 and G550 are about three to four quarters. So not much of a change there. With respect to the G650, our production is as we anticipated this year. So no changes to that. But going forward, as we prepare our plan for next year, we'll look to feather in a couple of, and I'm talking about one and two, just a handful \u2013 onesies and twosies \u2013 feather in some G650s to help offset as we make that transition to entering into service on the new airplane. So that's pretty much what we've been seeing all year and saying is exactly what we're continuing to see.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey. Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So Phebe, if you could give us some color on how the flight test program is going, because it's kind of hard to follow as an outsider. What milestones are happening? And if you could just kind of paint a picture for that.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. So our flight test program is going very well. On the G550 we have surpassed G500. We've surpassed more than 100 hours of flight, and we've successfully completed about, I think, 45 missions. On the G600, we've begun construction and is well underway on construction on the test aircraft. And we plan to fly that in 2016. And our entry into service remains unchanged. So going very, very well.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just as a quick follow-on, is there any chance that, that entry into service could happen a little earlier if kind of everything just continues to go smooth?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, that's hard to predict since we don't, but I'm not going to get out ahead of Gulfstream. We're sticking right now to what our original entry into service is. And as we go and we mature and get down the test flight program, we'll have a little bit more clarity. But right now that's what we still see.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Arment (22:47) with Sterne Agee. Your line is now open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Yes. Good morning, Phebe.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Unknown Speaker", "Can you give us an update on your general thoughts of the latest talk on the budget deal, if there's any material impact in terms of your overall plan and just regarding, in particular, regarding Combat? It seems like the mix there continues to favor the margin performance. If you could just update how we see the mix going forward. Thank you.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the budget \u2013 the prospective budget, agreement would be very welcome news I think from a national security perspective. And certainly for us our programs are fully funded in the President's request and as we understand the proposed budget agreement. So I think that's some very, very good progress made quickly. So we're pleased with that and we would encourage and hope that, that continues since \u2013 we're hopeful that, that's all on track.", "And on Combat, we are continuing. It's between, last year and this year, we've had some mix issues as we came off of mature programs that were in development and at the end of their production runs and started up on a whole series of new programs. But that backlog, and that coupled with the operating excellence of that entire group, positions us quite well for nice earnings growth. And margins should increase over time.", "If you think about that business as we've got our platform businesses, but we also have our Ordnance and Tactical Systems business. And they had an absolutely terrific quarter. So they are highly focused on their cost structure, operating leverage, and they had a very wholesome book-to-bill in excess of 1-to-1. So for a short cycle business that's very, very good.", "Unknown Speaker", "Appreciate it. Thank you, Phebe.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Good morning. I wanted to go back to Marine and the strength there. You talked about it before \u2013 submarine driven. Is this a sustainable revenue rate quarterly, Phebe, as we go forward here? It sounds like...", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, think about the submarines in two ways. We're at our \u2013 this will be steady state on Virginia Block IV revenues. So what we're seeing now will continue. And we will continue to see and anticipate growth in the Ohio Replacement design work, which has been growing at a very healthy clip. And the growth will slow down but it will continue to grow. So that business is very well positioned for additional revenue increases.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "And you see the margins coming back up into the 9%s?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I do.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks so much. Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "I wanted to ask Myles' question again maybe from a different direction. The buy-back and the dividends exceeding free cash flow this year, do you think that's something that we should expect again next year? And do you have a sort of leverage target in mind? You've gone back to sort of net debt to cash of basically zero. But do you see it actually moving to a net debt situation going forward?", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So I think one way to think about it is we would never view a net cash position as being optimal and even a break even situation is not optimal. I don't necessarily think we'd characterize as having a target leverage position. So much as we think about having the preservation of the strong balance sheet that allows us to be poised to quickly and readily take a strategic direction when the opportunity presents itself. And as far as capital deployment goes, I'll look at my boss and say I'm not going to speak to our plans for next year and get out ahead of her. But you know where we are today is trying to normalize that deployment of capital to a net income level given that we see free cash flow being somewhat less than net income this year.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And maybe a quick follow up, Jason, as well. On the foreign exchange you mentioned this is something we should watch. What's your hedging situation? Do you have most of these export revenues hedged?", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So yeah, two parts to answer that question: from the perspective of actual economic exposure in having a foreign currency revenue or expense item in a particular business, we have about 100% hedged and we're totally secure on that front. What I'm referring to strictly is the translation of our indigenous businesses in Spain, in the U.K., in Canada and so on translating those operating results back into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. So it's not an economic loss we're talking about. It's a headwind from a U.S. consolidated reporting perspective. But from an actual economic exposure standpoint we're very comfortably hedged.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "That's great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So I think some of the wait times, if not all of them by your aircraft platform at Gulfstream actually increased a little bit last quarter including G450 and G550, both the CBs. You've indicated there is some headwinds there in that market right now \u2013 call it cross winds, if you will, from obviously a competitor. The question is have you actually scaled back on G450 production at all this year as it relates to the next couple of years of rate? And can you remind us what the wait time is for the G650 right now? Thanks a lot.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So our production for this year is exactly on track. No changes. We're in the process of setting our production rates for next year and we'll give you that color when we report fourth quarter and give you guidance. And the G650 actually, we are one or two slots away from moving to a second quarter of 2018 availability. So that backlog, as wholesome as it is, continues to grow.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I want to go back to the same question I guess in terms of the free cash flow. I guess I'm just trying to think about when you first came in, Phebe, you talked about the M&A organization as being broken and needed to be fixed. And I guess I'm wondering why we haven't seen you make more actions there? Is it the budget outlook? Is it the prices? Is it that you see more value in the stock? Just what would make you change your view towards buyback and start thinking about acquisition?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, so far, we've seen nothing to particular note that's interesting at accretive prices. So I think that's the best way to think about it. We're really not looking because there isn't much out there, from our perspective. So we just continue to keep our powder dry and you'll continue to see us through the course of the year buy back shares as it makes sense tactically.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And if I can follow up, is there any way you can size the warranty issue at NASSCO?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No. It had to do with a bearing on a drive shaft. And that's to the extent of which I understand the shipbuilding challenge there. But we took the warranty and NASSCO is, we took the charge and NASSCO is all set to, it is poised to recover for next quarter. So that was a one-time event, and it's in our rear view mirror.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, Phebe.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Howard.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "It'll be a little bit like trying to pull teeth here, but we'll see if I can succeed. Your outlook for Gulfstream. They've continued to surprise you, and yet you're being conservative about the fourth quarter. Could you elaborate a little bit more on some of the challenges? Is it higher R&D? Is it mix? Is it something else that causes you some concern about profitability?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So the fourth quarter is going to be lighter than the third quarter. And let me take you back to last quarter when we talked about Jet Aviation and that we were going to see some margin compression in the second half as we began to spend on engineering in the pre-production activities at Basel that we need to do in anticipation of the start of production which begins early next year. That has happened and it will continue into next quarter. So couple that with you've got a higher R&D and lower launch assistance. And that's essentially the story from where we sit right now.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Did you pull any teeth?", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "No, I'm not going to try too hard because you've been pretty consistent and doing a reasonable job there.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Phebe, I'm going to try and follow on to Howard's question. For the margin at Gulfstream to only be 18.5% for the year, it requires the fourth quarter to be down like 16.5% or something. Why would it get that low?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, as I told you, we're seeing a significant margin compression at Jet. And I think that if you back in the math, it's fourth quarter, maybe somewhere around 18%. Yeah. So Jet is a factor. Our R&D spend is going to be higher. There's really nothing other than that. There's nothing structural, if that's what you're getting at.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "What's R&D going be relative to the third quarter?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Up.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. I'm sure you won't quantify it, but I'll let you go with that. Thanks.", "Phebe N.

Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Phebe, on the G500 could you talk about order interest there, ex the initial fleet buyers that came in for that airplane when you announced it? And then one question about your comments on free cash flow conversion as we head into next year. Are you assuming that advances we see a further draw down on the advances side into 2016? Thanks.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, on your latter question. And on the G500 and G600, customer interest has been good. And we expect that interest and demand increase as we progress through the development program and we, frankly, get closer to EIS. So this is an attractive airplane set for our customers.", "David E.

Your line is now open.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Phebe, just looking at Combat just given the strong order flow over there the past 18 months or so and the FX pressure that you're seeing this year, what's the growth for that segment look like next year? Some of the international contracts flowing through but just being offset by FX and does that annualize next year?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, as you would expect, we took in a large number of orders into the backlog in 2014 and if you look at the engineering cycle and typically when programs start production, you could reasonably expect that production to begin in 2016 and I think we've been pretty clear about that. But I don't want to get into any more detail on what 2016 looks like until we finish our plan.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much, and good morning. Notwithstanding what you just said about not getting into 2016, I was wondering if you could comment on how the profitability headwind from Jet carries over for \u2013 in Aerospace from Jet Aviation \u2013 carries over from Q4 into 2016 since you've got some pretty tough margin comps in the first half of the year? The Gulfstream margin was around 20%. And I thought that the cost management in Aerospace was one of the ways to help manage this transition from the G550, G450 to the G500, G600?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, your supposition is right. Cost management is going to be key. The margin compression that we've seen in Jet reverses in the first quarter of 2016 as they begin production. Right now, they're simply in the dueling phase and engineering for these large body and narrow body airline completions. So that's a fair amount of engineering work. We'll get into production then starting in the first quarter of next year.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So that headwind is behind us.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yes.", "Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations", "And Nicole, I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Could you give us your thoughts on that program? Just how it's going and if there's any financial risk going forward related to that?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, so let me talk a little bit about DDG-1000. As we've said before this is a highly complex and revolutionary surface combatant. The first of which \u2013 we've got three in our backlog and three under construction \u2013 the first of which is nearing C trial. So we are continuing to work with the Navy to resolve O&E developmental issues that they see. And I think we all agree that we're working through all of those technical challenges on this first ship.", "And by the way, I think the bellwether that we used to think about performance on that ship is, you may recall that the complete redesign of the deckhouse on the third ship was reassigned to us, that design is nearly complete and construction is proceeding quite nicely. So that suggests considerable learning and I'm very pleased with at least that performance there.", "We do have some risks going forward. We'll manage that accordingly. We're working very closely with the Navy and Navy's other subcontractors on this program. But let me give you some sense of magnitude: Bath is 1/32nd of our sales so we are paying quite a bit of attention to what is a complex warship, but I think the context is important here.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Thanks so much.", "Phebe N.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, Abigail, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Erin, and good morning, all. Earlier today we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operation of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.81 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $764 million. Incidentally, we beat analyst consensus by $0.02, which is hard to do this late in the year. Revenue and operating earnings were down against the year-ago quarter by 6.6% and 2.9% respectively. Earnings from continuing operations, however, were up $27 million on the strength of a 50-basis-point improvement in operating margin and a lower tax rate. Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.21, almost 10%.", "By the way, in connection with the comparisons to the year-ago quarter, let's remember that the fourth quarter 2014 was and remains the strongest revenue performance of any quarter in the last four years and by no small measure. So it is a very difficult comparison. And that will be true in the business segments as well.", "Sequentially, the quarters were very similar. Revenue was down $185 million or 2.3%, but operating earnings were up $2 million on a 40-basis-point improvement in margin rate. So all in all, a solid quarter with particularly good performance in the Aerospace group, which I'll speak about in a little bit more detail.", "So, for the year, where does that leave us? We had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.08 on revenue of $31.47 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.97 billion. Return on sales was 9.4%. Revenue for the year was up $617 million or 2%. Operating earnings were up $289 million or 7.4% on a 70-basis-point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations were up $292 million or 10.9% helped by a 200-basis-point improvement in the effective tax rate. This, together with share repurchases activity led quite naturally to a 16% improvement in earnings per share. So all in all, 2015 was a great year, improving significantly over a very good 2014. It was a year of further progress from an operating perspective and revenue growth consistent with our guidance to you at this time last year.", "Turning to cash. Free cash flow from operations was $120 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.93 billion, which is 65% of earnings from continuing operations. As we advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to reach 100% of net earnings for three reasons. First, we are working off the very large advanced payments received in 2014 on a major Combat Systems program. Second, we have an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream consistent with building numerous aircraft for test and preproduction parts in connection with the G500 and G600 program. And third, we were also working off large advanced payments received in 2014 at NASSCO for commercial shipbuilding programs.", "All of this will normalize and unwind quite positively, but not until 2017. In 2016, we will continue to have less than our usual robust free cash flow.", "Let me give you some color on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace, revenue was down modestly over the year-ago quarter. Sales were down $98 million, but earnings were down just $2 million as a result of a 70-basis-point improvement in margin; very nice operating performance. For the year, revenue was $8.85 billion and operating earnings were $1.71 billion with an operating margin of 19.3%. This is a year-over-year improvement of 2.3% on sales, 5.9% on earnings, and 70 basis points on operating margin. All in all, a very good year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and good order intake.", "During the quarter, we took down the production rate of the G550 to what will be the sustaining rate through 2016. The G450 will come down modestly in the first quarter of 2016. By the same token, the production rate of the G650 and G650ER were taken up during the second half of 2014 and will be taken up again in 2016 to reflect current demand and our sizable backlog. The production rate on the G650 and G650ER is clearly sustainable for this year and next.", "So, contrary to what many investors seem to have anticipated, order activity in the quarter was quite good. The book-to-bill at Gulfstream was at least one to one, both dollar base, one to one, and in units of green delivery, 1.1 to 1, with particularly strong demand for the G650 and G650ER. By the way, an interesting data point is that there were more orders for in-production aircraft in 2015 than 2014. All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good.", "Let me say a few words about the large-cabin business jet market in general. We find demand to be reasonable. We see no evidence at Gulfstream of a cyclical decline. The order activity is good, but not frenetic, and North America is particularly good.", "More than 50% of our orders for the year were from North America. I should also point out that, despite the hand-wringing by some, our orders from Asia Pacific improved by more than 60% over 2014. In short, this market is not ebullient, but it is steady from our perspective. We also seem to be picking up some share from other OEMs.", "Combat Systems. Combat revenue was down $90 million, or 5.6%, and earnings were down $37 million, or 13.7%, on a 140-basis-point reduction in operating margin over the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, a 15.4% operating margin was more than respectable and consistent with our expectations for the group. Sequentially, the story begins to foretell the future. Sales were up $179 million and earnings were up $16 million. That is 13.3% and 7.3%, respectively. For the full year, sales were down $92 million, or 1.6%, and earnings were up $20 million, or 2.3%, on a 60-basis-point improvement in operating margin. This margin expansion is the result of restructuring at both our European and Ordnance and Tactical Systems businesses. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. You may recall that we had guided to flat revenue and earnings.", "Overall, Combat Systems is a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding cost and margin performance. By the way, in just a moment, Jason's going to give you a little bit more color on this group's revenue performance. This is a business poised for modest growth in 2016 and quite significant growth in the 2017 through 2019 timeframe as we begin delivering on our $19 billion backlog.", "Now, Marine Systems. The group's revenue of $1.98 billion in the quarter was down $58 million, or 2.8%, compared to the year-ago quarter, and down $105 million, or 5%, sequentially. Revenue for the year, however, was up $701 million, a rather extraordinary 9.6%. And recall that this increase in annual revenue follows a $600 million increase in 2014.", "Operating earnings were down $21 million, or 10.9%, against the year-ago quarter, and down $9 million, or 5%, sequentially. For the full year, earnings were up $25 million, or 3.6%, despite a 50-basis-point decline in operating margin.", "In the Marine Group, we guided you at this time last year to revenue growth of 2% to 2.5%, which we exceed by a fair measure. We forecasted margins at 9.5% and wound up at 9.1%. So the story here was better-than-anticipated revenue, but not as good as expected operating margin, which left us relatively consistent with our guidance for operating earnings.", "The growth in revenue in the year was driven by Electric Boat on two Virginia-class construction, sub \u2013 two Virginia-class submarine construction and increased engineering work for the Ohio Replacement Program. This group's margins are the result of a mix shift; higher engineering work transitioning to Block IV from Block III and increased work on commercial Jones Act ships at NASSCO.", "IS&T is a business group where, once again, we saw less-than-expected revenue decline coupled with improved operating performance. Several of our major ground and maritime programs were all funded beyond our plan, improving our sales performance. Margin improvement was the result of greater efficiencies than planned in business unit consolidation and continuing operating performance across all the portfolio.", "Revenue in the quarter was $2.16 billion, down $307 million, or 12.4%, against the year-ago quarter, a very difficult comparator as I had mentioned previously. On the other hand, operating earnings of $230 million in the quarter were 8.5% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $11 million, or 5%, on the strength of 10.6% margins, 70 basis points better than last quarter.", "For the year, revenue was down $194 million or only 2.1%. Remember, this is dramatically less than the 5.5% revenue decline we forecasted in our guidance to you at this time last year. For the year, earnings were up $118 million or 15%; very good operating performance in the face of a 2% revenue decline.", "On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance with respect to operating margins in this \u2013 in the 9% range, which we beat by 110 basis points. All-in-all, we beat forecasted revenue and operating margin. When that happens, the result is significant upside to the forecast. On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2015 was to expect revenue of $31.3 billion to $31.5 billion, an operating margin rate of 12.8%, a tax rate of 30.5%, and a return on sales of 8.7%. We wound up the year with revenue at $31.47 billion, an operating margin rate of 13.3%, an effective tax rate of 27.7%, and a return on sales of 9.4%.", "Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $8.05 to $8.10. We wound up at $9.08. About 46% of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.05 from the gain on the sale of a small business, $0.30 from a lower-than-planned tax rate, and the balance from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly a great year by any measure.", "So let me provide some thoughts about 2016, initially by group and then on a company-wide roll-up. In Aerospace we expect revenue to be approximately $8.9 billion, up very modestly. Margin rate should be down 10 basis points to 20 basis points and operating earnings flat to last year. 2017 should look a lot like 2016 with upside in revenue and earnings if we can deliver the G500 in the fourth quarter. Revenue and earnings growth will resume with full scale production and delivery of the G500 in 2018 (13:59) and the G600 the following year.", "In Combat, we expect revenue to be up $160 million and the margin rate similar to 2015 with more vigorous growth of both revenue and earnings in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The Marine group is expected to have revenue similar to 2015 but improved operating earnings as a result of operating margins in the mid-9% range. Revenue in 2017 and 2018 will have growth of a couple of hundred million a year, an additional $0.5 billion in 2019 growth.", "Finally in IS&T we expect a modest improvement in revenue and a 20 basis point to 30 basis point decline in operating margin that remind you again that a gain on the sale of a business was included in 2015's operated earnings and margin rate. This will result in essentially flat operating earnings year-over-year. Once again, we should see more solid revenue growth in 2017 and 2018.", "All of this rolls up to $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion of revenue, operating margin of around 13.3%, and return on sales of roughly 9.1%. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 29.5% tax rate, and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercise. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of around $9.20 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year's guidance of $8.05 to $8.10 at the same time on the same basis.", "Let me also reconcile this forecast of $9.20 to our 2015 year-end result at $9.08. In 2016 we will not have the operating gain from the sale of a business. That gain was $0.05 of EPS. In 2016, we will have higher interest expense with a $0.02 negative impact to 2016 EPS. We will also have a higher effective tax rate in 2016 that will cost us $0.23 per share. Foreign exchange headwinds at current FX rates will cost another $0.04 of EPS compared to 2015. On a pro forma basis, this suggests 2015 to $8.74 and gives us a 5% adjusted growth in forecasted 2016 EPS before deployment of capital.", "With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it looks like most years. So divide our guidance by four, then take $0.20 off of Q1, $0.10 off Q2, leave Q3 even, and about $0.30 up in Q4. So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effect of capital deployment.", "With respect to the deployment of capital, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2016 for dividends and share repurchase. While we don't anticipate a robust year from a free cash flow perspective for the reasons I have previously described, we will use balance sheet cash to some degree to supplement our free cash flow for share repurchase activity. I'll have more to say on this subject at the end of the first quarter as our planning becomes more refined and is approved by our board.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. As we discussed previously, we felt more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility in 2015 than we have in the past. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on the growth experienced in our Combat Systems group given their increasing international activity.", "As Phebe pointed out, the group's full-year revenue was down 1.6% compared to 2014. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and to the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group's sales would have actually increased by 6.4% in 2015. For the company as a whole this would have taken our 2% top line growth over 2014 to almost 4%.", "As a reminder, this has nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. This is merely the translation of our various international indigenous businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes, and the negative effect on that translation that comes with a strengthening dollar.", "Given where we see the mix of Combat Systems programs in the years ahead, we expect foreign currency fluctuations to be an ongoing part of the group's story. Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million, consist with the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, interest expense was $83 million, $3 million less than the year before due to the repayment of $500 million of fixed rate notes that occurred in 2015.", "For 2016 we expect net interest expense of around $95 million. And the increase is due primarily to less interest income as we've deployed cash off the balance sheet. As we've deployed that cash over the year, we've moved from a net cash position, that's cash in excess of debt, of $1 billion at the end of 2014 to a net debt position of $614 million. And I'll walk through those capital deployment activities in just a minute.", "Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the year, right in the ballpark, slightly lower than the 28% we forecasted at the end of the third quarter. The lower outcome is attributable to favorable contract closeouts with the IRS and Congress' enactment of tax extenders in late December; in particular, the research and experimentation credit. For the year, the research tax credit extension benefited our rate by about 50 basis points, but was offset by some one-time unfavorable effects of other provisions in the extenders law. The combined effect was a 20-basis-point reduction in the 2015 effective rate, or about $0.02 per share.", "You may recall at this time last year that, given our increasing international presence, we considered the new normal for our effective tax rate to be in the 30% to 30.5% range. For 2016 with the research tax credit now permanent, we expect an effective tax rate in the mid-29% range.", "Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed about $185 million to our pension plans in 2015, as forecast. And for 2016, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million to be contributed mostly during the third quarter.", "And finally on the capital deployment front, to summarize our activities for the year, we spent approximately $3.2 billion on share repurchases; and when you combine those share repurchases with our dividend payments, we used $4.1 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2015 or 2.1 times our free cash flow from operations for the year.", "Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A.", "Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue.", "Abigail, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.", "Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT", "Yes. Good afternoon, Phebe and Jason.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good afternoon.", "Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT", "Phebe, maybe this is a good opportunity just since we haven't spoke since the budget deal, and maybe you could just give us your overview how you see that impacting domestically? And also, related to that, are you seeing any changes on the international order front just given what has happened with the oil prices with any of your customers? Thanks, Phebe.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So the budget deal provided us funding in line with \u2013 exactly in line with what we anticipated, so no surprises there; and some upside, frankly, in a couple of areas. But that stability is critical and, I think, very helpful as we think through the defense portfolio for the next year or two. So that was, I think, very helpful. But as I said, it was consistent with what we had anticipated. With respect to international orders, we have continued to increase \u2013 and particularly on the Combat Systems side, increase our order activity internationally. And so far, we have yet to see any impact from oil prices in the Mid-East.", "You know, as we've talked a lot in the past, from my perspective, defense spending is completely determined by the threat. And the threat environment in that world has gotten nothing but worse. So we're very sensitive to our customers' needs and requirements. And we work carefully with them to ensure that we can provide them what they need when they want it and terms that are favorable to us and which they can accommodate. I would also remind you, by the way, that most of our orders in that part of the world are government to government, which provides some stability. So that is a benefit to us as well as we look forward.", "Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. You had talked a little bit about free cash flow not being that robust this year. And you had talked about last \u2013 I guess, in 2015 because of the Aerospace investments. Can you just walk through what kind of expectations and then what changes as you go into 2017 that makes it start to see us return to 100% conversion?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's all three. It's a reversal, an unwinding of all three of the factors that we've talked about impacting 2015 and 2016, but let's take Gulfstream. We're continuing to build demonstration and test aircraft, test aircraft for both the G500 and G600. Our capital deployment \u2013 or our CapEx is largely done at Gulfstream, but that buildup in inventory will continue until we begin to take \u2013 or deliver the G500 and G600. So that will help unwind that buildup of working capital at Gulfstream. NASSCO will have completed its Jones Act ships in 2017. And then we anticipate a number of orders coming into the Marine group that, of course, carry cash. And in Combat Systems, we will begin to get additional cash as we ramp up to full-rate production on a number of our international orders. So 2015, 2016, lighter than we're used to. But 2017, it'll be above; every expectation we have is it'll be above 100% of net income.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Any way to quantify what percentage of net income you're expecting this year?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It'd be about similar to last year.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Think about cash similar to last year.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Morning.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Phebe, on Gulfstream, can you just talk about what you're expecting actually for the actual number of large cabin deliveries you're expecting in 2016? And then can you talk about what the reducing rate on the G450 and G550, what that's done to shrink or to expand the lead time? Thank you.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So let me take those in inverse order. We've been reducing the G450 very immaterially for the last about seven or eight quarters, so in line again with what we saw in demand and what we predicted in demand. And as to be expected, we reduced the G550 production rate in the fourth quarter, again, in line with demand. Our wait times are essentially the same, three to fourth quarters in those lines of business. In 2016, you asked about what are our production and delivery \u2013 what are our delivery targets in our plan. Large cabin about 104, medium cabin 34. That compares to 2015, large cabin of 112 and medium cabin of about \u2013 mid cabin about 35. So down eight large and one medium cabin, with a better mix, I might add. And that's what you would expect, a better mix as we enter this year of transition, more G650s, fewer G450s and G550s.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Good morning, Phebe, Jason. I wanted to ask for just a follow-on to David's question just on the pricing environment. Then I had a more technical question on your share authorization. Last year you did this twice and you had one in December and mentioned there might be something coming at the end of Q1. Is twice the norm going forward?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me talk about the pricing environment. We have held our prices very consistently, and to the extent that others are having pricing pressure, it hasn't affected us materially. So I think that's the full and short answer to that question. Jason, you want to...", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "... share repurchases.", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, the share repurchase authorization, so you're right. We did a total of $20 million authorized last year in two tranches. We got $10 million authorized late in the year by the board. Certainly wouldn't want to get out ahead of them in terms of the plans for the coming year but we'll address that as it comes. And as the opportunistic approach to share repurchase works down that current authorization, we'll see where it goes midway through the year.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "But there's no mechanical plan here that continues like this? There's nothing to it? It's just coincidental?", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Exactly. It's coincidental. And as we said, as always, more of an opportunistic approach and we'll see where that takes us.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Morning, George.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Phebe, the usual question I'll ask would go through. You had much better Gulfstream margin in the fourth quarter than the third even though the revenues were down. Maybe if you could explain a little more what happened there. And then going forward with G650s being up, I would think they probably have the highest margin at this point. So why would the margin deteriorate a little bit in 2016? Thanks.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So let me talk about revenue. As we noted before, we reduced the G550 rate for the fourth quarter. We had less preowned revenue than anticipated and somewhat less than anticipated service revenue. But Gulfstream was up and their backlog was up. Jet was down 5% in revenue and that was mix driven as we increased our engineering work in anticipation of the production work that we're starting this year. And we had lower FBO revenue because of fuel prices. We also had reduced business jet completions in St. Louis. So that sort of ties the bow on revenue. In margins, it's the same old stuff we always get, right?", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Right.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "From the usual suspects. We had mix shift. We had liquidated damages, launch assistant. And by the way, you quite rightly point out we had improved margins in the G650. So we anticipate roughly comparable margins. Those aren't what we (30:57) leading you to, guiding you to is \u2013 are not sufficient or significant material degradations in the margin rate. But what we are focused on and have been laser focused on and have been telling our investors for some time, we are going to keep earnings flat. And that's what we've signed up for and we see the path forward to clearly do that.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you. On IS&T, Phebe, about a year ago or so, I think you were \u2013 you sounded pleasantly surprised at how well IS&T was holding up, and it has held up quite well while others in some similar businesses have had a lot of issues. The backlog's down a little bit in this quarter. If you look inside that business and look forward and you separate into Mission Systems and GDIT, how do you see those two outlooks going now over the next couple years?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Let me talk a little bit about the book-to-bill. With the exception of the fourth quarters in 2014 and 2015, our IS&T book-to-bill has been approximately one to one every other quarter in both years. Q4 in those lines of businesses tends to be more of an issue, a timing issue than anything else. And we expect book-to-bill for 2016 about one to one. These are businesses that are performing extremely well and winning more than their fair share based on their ability to increase their operating leverage by decreasing costs, and their performance has been outstanding. So it's more of the same for them going forward. So ruthless dedication to cost cutting, operating performance, must perform on that backlog. And that then quite nicely leads to the kinds of book-to-bill that we've seen in these businesses. So I see that as more goodness to come.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Do you see Mission Systems and GDIT behaving somewhat differently? They have somewhat different drivers.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, they're different margin businesses. Mission Systems tends to be more heavily product oriented in nature, and product tends to carry higher margins. Our IT business is services; services have lower margins. But as I like to tell everybody, they got great cash performance. In fact, by the way, both of those businesses have a great cash performance. And with our services business, terrific return on invested capital. So there's no invested capital.", "But think about our information \u2013 our IT services businesses. When they go to market, they go to market in their core, and they are very competitive in their core both through past performance and cost competitiveness. So I like where they're positioned, and that hasn't changed for us. They continue to win and they're a big dog in the barnyard, not to make too many metaphors.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning, or I guess good afternoon now. I wanted to follow up on Gulfstream for a second, and on the G650 in particular. Could you comment on where this skyline currently reaches to? And also a little bit on the pre-owned or, I guess, the available for sale G650s that are in the market and at what point do you see that as being more of a threat to production, because there's always going to be a battle of if the like-new starts to approach price points of your aircraft coming off the line? Thanks.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me answer that in the inverse order. We have seen and don't anticipate seeing any impact from the planes that are in the used market. It really hasn't impacted us at all, because the guidance of the demand for that airplane has been, and we believe will continue to be, very, very wholesome. Despite taking up our production rates slightly, we are still at first quarter 2018 first available. So that tells you that is a strong, sustainable backlog for a very powerful airplane.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. I want to turn to Marine for a moment, Phebe. There's a number of dynamics going on there. You have a new agreement at Bath. You've got a couple of new opportunities. And then, at the same time, you've been working through the Jones Act backlog. Could you describe a little bit of the working parts there and what might the Navy also do in terms of service going forward?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So, yeah, let me talk about all three of those businesses and give you a little bit of color. We have achieved a very significant agreement with our partners, our workforce in Maine at Bath that will allow Bath to be increasingly competitive going forward in all of its competitions. And we're very proud of our workforce there, and we are very optimistic about our ability to compete on a going-forward basis. So I like what I see at Bath.", "And by the way, you didn't ask, but on the DDG-1000, the first one is 98% done; so almost out the door. The second one's 84% done; and again, with the kinds of issues that you might expect on the first-of-class ships, but nothing that has been particularly surprising to us. The third ship, I think, is only about 40% done, but it has a deck house that we entirely designed and built, so that reduces the risk going forward. So I see the future for Bath very nice.", "At NASSCO, we are continuing to work off the backlog of Jones Act ships, as you quite rightly point out. There is, we believe, significant demand going forward because of the age of the fleet that has to be replaced for more Jones Act ships. Our experience in the Jones Act market is it's highly lumpy, but there is demand out there. And because of NASSCO's performance and because of its good cost structure, they have been very competitive in their Jones Act competitions and won a nice backlog; and we continue to believe we're going to add to that backlog.", "Their service business has been performing very, very nicely. The Navy is, what we believe, quite rightly moving to fixed price service contracts, and we know how to work those and we've been working closely with our Navy customers. So we like what we see in service, particularly out west in San Diego; little bit of lightness in the Norfolk area as the Navy re-jiggers some of its porting of some major ships, but we anticipate service to grow reasonably well on the surface ship side, single digit, low-single digit with a nice operating performance. We also anticipate additional submarine service at Electric Boat. Nothing too significant, but, again, right in our sweet spot. And, again, at Electric Boat, it's a story about Virginia and Ohio. Right?", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Yes.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "But I (39:10) think a once over of that entire portfolio.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much for the rundown.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good afternoon, Phebe, Jason.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hi.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I didn't know \u2013 just a quick clarification and a question. I didn't know if you mentioned the year-over-year impact from pension in that apples-to-apples comparison. If you could give us that, that'd be helpful as well. And then, just really appreciated the commentary on 2017, 2018, 2019. If you look \u2013 I know you talked about revenues in Marine and IS&T. And as you think about margins there, obviously, you talked about margins being up as part of the vigorous earnings growth in Combat. But when you look at potential for margins in the defense businesses in aggregate, and mainly IS&T and Marine, what's the outlook for those similar to the comments you made for Combat?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Let me have Jason ask the first part of your question on pension.", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure. And Carter, if I understand your question, you're talking about the sort of the walk forward on EPS from 2015 to 2016. And really when you think about our pension plans and our accounting for those plans, especially in the defense businesses, that is a muted effect in EPS. So it really just isolated to the commercial pension side which had a negligible effect.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yep.", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I haven't calculated it, but it's nothing that would be materially...", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Extremely modest positive is what you're saying?", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "There you go.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So let's talk about the businesses. On a going-forward basis, we anticipate the IS&T group to be at around a 10% margin business. That may vary from quarter to quarter, or year to year depending on how much revenue the service business brings in. But for our foreseeable future that's about a 10% business. Combat, we see in the mid-15%, 15.5% pretty steady eddy. We may have, and we do, I believe, have margin expansion opportunity at the platform businesses. But remember, that will be somewhat offset by the short cycle business of OTS which we had terrific margins out of that business after we consolidated two units in 2014.", "With all things at defense, some of that goodness needs to go back to our customer, quite appropriately so. So that'll cause some margin compression for them. But from right now what we're planning for, for Combat, steady state 15%, 15.5% margin. We will, of course, strive for higher. And then the Marine group will be a 9.5% to 10% margin business depending on mix. As we've talked about before, performance at shipyards is, well performing shipyards, is all about the mix and we've got a number of mix shift issues which we've kind of articulated. But I think that gives you a sense of how we see our business going forward.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks, Phebe.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes, Phebe, thanks so much, and good performance.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "So at Gulfstream I guess two issues. One is if you could give us any help in terms of where the R&D and launch aid is in your plan for 2016? And secondly I guess more importantly, you had a 7% layoff you announced in December. Maybe walk us through if there's any severance impact in the fourth quarter and the types of benefits you expect to realize from that in 2016.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me talk a little bit about the reduction, then I'll turn it over to Jason. We've been talking for the last year or so about this transition period from moving from the G450, G550 to G500 and G600. Well, we're in it now, and quite appropriately you would expect us to size for that. So our head count reductions were all about sizing appropriately for what we see in terms of revenue and our promise to keep margins, well, keep earnings flat year-over-year. So we did some pruning. Headcount reductions were just a part of our cost cutting effort as we improved our operating performance, took a fair amount of overhead out and touch labor. And we'll continue to do so, on a going-forward basis.", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So on the R&D question, as you can imagine, the pace of that will sort of follow the cadence of the flight test program. So we expect that to pick up modestly in the next year and a little bit more in 2017 as we continue through that program. But I say modestly immaterially, still well within the range of our normal collar that we would normally expect R&D to flow in.", "Your question around the launch of systems payments, they'll continue to flow. I don't have the exact schedule of that, but it'll cause that quarterly amount to be lumpy as it's always been. And we'll report that to you when it gets out of line. But expect, net-net, a modest immaterial growth in R&D next year and then again the following year.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hello. Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey. Just totally changing gears to the balance sheet. As you well know, right, the balance sheet's extraordinarily strong. Do you have any thoughts on maybe levering it up a little bit? Or what you think about that? Or what do you think the proper capital structure is for General Dynamics?", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So I think consistent with the position we've held in the past is levering up really is not something we're interested in, particularly as it relates to our current capital deployment approach of share repurchase and dividends. Incurring debt for the proper long-term strategic opportunity is certainly out there, but that's something that we'll continue to hold as dry powder until that type of opportunity shows up.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Yeah. Thank you.", "Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations", "And, Abigail, I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks very much. To follow up actually from what Ron was asking, does this imply that the acquisition pipeline out there is not particularly attractive in your point of view? And maybe in relation to this, there's a little bit of stickiness going on in fed IT at the moment. Do you think this has any implications for you?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So fed IT, I think what you're seeing is \u2013 what we anticipate is seeing the same players just with new t-shirts on, new brands. In the pipeline, it is what it has been. And I think to Jason's point, it has always been our view that if we found something attractive and very accretive, we would lever up for it. But we haven't been there, and we don't see that as we stand in the moment. I don't think anything has fundamentally changed in the broader portfolio, defense and Aerospace portfolio. Service, a little bit, but that's \u2013 I gave you my view of that.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay.

I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Erin, please go ahead.", "Erin Linnihan", "As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filing.", "I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Thanks, Erin. I will keep my remarks somewhat brief, since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward. I'll try to give you some of the more prosaic data up-front and then give you a little bit of color and insight from my perspective.", "The first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $2.34 per fully diluted share on revenues somewhat in excess of $7.7 billion. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion, and earnings from continuing operations of $730 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.18. We were also better than our previous guidance to you.", "The diluted weighted average share count was $312.3 million for the quarter, compared to consensus of about $315 million, which accounts for approximately $0.02 of the out-performance. I should note that at the same time a year ago, the diluted weighted share count was 22.4 million shares higher. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 29.9%, somewhat higher than anticipated. Therefore, almost all of the out-performance came from strong operating results, as evidenced by the operating margin of 13.6%. With respect to cash, we had $439 million net cash provided by operating activity. After capital expenditures of 65 million, we had $374 million of free cash flow from operations.", "The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter reflect, as you would imagine, the strong operating performance. Compared to first quarter 2015, revenue was down $60 million, less than 1%. However, our operating earnings were up $26 million, or 2.5% over the prior year's quarter on a strange of a 40-basis point improvement in margins.", "On a sequential basis, revenue was down $85 million or 1.1%. but operating earnings were up $17 million on a 30-basis point improvement in margin. All of the foregoing is a reflection of positive operating leverage.", "Finally, EPS from continuing operations was up 9.3% over the year ago quarter, as a result of better operation earnings and lower share count, offset in part by a higher tax rate.", "So let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of our operating segment. First, Aerospace. Sales were down $121 million, compared to Q1, 2015, about 5.7%, and down $155 million sequentially against a strong fourth quarter. Earnings were down against the year ago quarter by $20 million, only 4.6% on a 30 basis point expansion in operating margin. Operating earnings were up a million sequentially on 150 basis point improvement operating margin.", "Orders to the group were typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, the net orders of 1.3 billion were 1.3 billion and the dollar book base book-to-bill was 0.7. This is consistent with what we saw on the first quarter of 2012 through Q1 2015. The Aerospace average bookings for the first quarter over the last five years, including 2016, is $1.35 billion, a book-to-bill of 0.5.", "So it was a quarter were the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthened, part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter. And I should also note that activity has been strong in April. So we are off to a good start in Aerospace, generally consistent with our guidance to you. We had previously guided to a modest increase in revenue, a modest decline in margins, and flat operating earnings for the year. We still believe we will be at flat operating earnings for the year, but with slightly lower revenue and somewhat higher margins. As a result of increased efficiency, we have been able to slip a few deliveries in the next year and still come out in the same place.", "Let me turn to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.13 billion was up $188 million or 9.7% compared to the year ago quarter, and up $149 million or 7.5% sequentially. Operating earnings were up $4 million or 2.1% against the year ago quarter, and up $20 million or 11.6% sequentially. We had particularly good performance at Electric Boat. Also at Electric Boat, the Navy announced its acquisition strategy for the $100 billion Ohio replacement program which designates EB as the prime contractor responsible for about 80% of the construction of new subs.", "The Navy also articulated a build strategy for the Virginia attack boat program during the same timeframe, and we find that very wholesome.", "Some of the more interesting comparisons are found at Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, sales were down $90 million or 6.6%, largely due to timing, but earnings were up $13 million or 6.4% on a 200 basis point improvement in operating margin. The 17% operating margin is second only to the third quarter of 2013, in all the group's history. Sequentially, revenue was down $251 and operating earnings were down only $17 million on 160 basis point improvement in margins. This is a business that always has a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries. So this comparison is really quite wholesome.", "Also in the quarter, we began to transition from engineering into low rate production on two large international orders for Canada, the mid-east, and the U.K. vehicle programs. These programs will continue to grow through the next several years. Even given Combat's large backlog, they had nice order activity in the quarter with a one-to-one book-to-bill, all in all, extremely strong operating performance at Combat Systems.", "With respect to Information Systems and Technology, we experienced very good performance in the group. Revenue in the quarter was down $37 million or 1.6% against a year ago quarter, and up $172 million sequentially. Operating earnings of $248 million in the quarter were $31 million more than the year ago quarter, up 14.3% on 140 basis point improvement in margins. Once again, nice operating leverage. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $18 million, or 7.8%, and margins were consistent with last quarter. The trend here is clearly in the right direction.", "I think it's important to note that IS and T backlog was $851 million in the quarter and the book-to-bill was $1.3 for the quarter, following the strong book-to-bill of one-to-one on average for the last three years. The last time the book-to-bill was higher was in Q3 of 2008. This represents a very wholesome win rate for these fast cycle businesses.", "So we are off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice, and has been for many years, to give you a full review of our expectation at the midpoint of the year. Suffice is to say that we are ahead of the operating plan on which our guidance was based. We will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve performance. On a quarterly basis, we expect the second quarter to be weaker than the first in the nickel category.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.", "Jason Aiken", "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. About a year ago we started talking about the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the resulting impact that foreign exchange rates had on our reported results, especially within Combat Systems. Remember we're referring to the translation of our international results into U.S. dollars rather than any economic harm to our contracts. This continues to be a factor in 2016, and in the first quarter, assuming stable exchange rates from the year ago period, our revenues in the Combat segment would have declined by 2.3% versus the 6.6% decline we reported. And for the company as a whole, first quarter revenue would have actually been up slightly from last year.", "Moving on to a few other income statement matters. We took a charge of $13 million in discontinued operations to record the final resolution of some outstanding items related to a disposition that closed last year. We don't expect any further activity in this area during the year.", "Net interest expense in the quarter was $22 million versus $21 million in the first quarter of 2015. On the capital deployment front, we expended just over a billion dollars on the repurchase of 7.8 million shares in the first quarter. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $1.2 billion in shareholder friendly actions during the first quarter. That's more than three times our free cash flow from operations, and we used a little bit of that balance sheet cash to do so.", "At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet remains strong and reflects a cash balance of $1.8 billion and a net debt position of $1.5 billion. As Phebe mentioned, our effective tax rate was 29.9% for the quarter. While that was slightly higher than our full year forecast, we're still on course for a mid-29% tax rate for the full year.", "Erin that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.", "Erin Linnihan", "Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue.", "Liz [ph], could you remind participants how to enter the queue?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason M. Gursky with Citi.", "Jason Gursky", "Hey. Good morning, Phebe.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Good morning, Jason.", "Jason Gursky", "I was wondering if you could drive a little bit - good morning. I was wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper on the Aerospace business that you talked about, a revenue slip or a push out or maybe it was something that was driven on your own volition, but some sort of slip into next year on the revenue side. I'm wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper on that. And then also just talk about the sustainability of the margins that we saw this quarter. Obviously continued to see some expansion there. Just wondering whether these are any kind of one time kinds of things or whether we're setting a new bar here for margins? Thanks.", "Phebe Novakovic", "So let me talk a little bit about revenue and give you some insight into how we think about revenue and how we develop it with respect to Aerospace. We take revenue directly from the operating plan, and revenue in Aerospace is driven by a multitude of factors, as you would imagine, given the complexity of the business. Airplane green and completed deliveries, service volume and mix, which by the way can and do move across reporting periods. Pre-owned Jet Aviation Services and completion. So some of these are harder to predict because they have more estimating methodology embedded. For example, I think it's a pretty good one. Our plan has us selling between 10 to 14 pre-owned airplanes with revenue of $250 million at break-even margins. It's very difficult to forecast this.", "This quarter had one sale for $4 million, a good thing, but below our revenue estimate. On the other hand, the easiest factor to predict is airplane greens and completion deliveries because of the backlog of the 650. We have some other models to sell for delivery in Q4 but do not see that as a problem. As I told you, we're striving to keep our earnings flat for the year, and that's what we think is feasible.", "Jason Gursky", "And are the sustainability of the margins going-forward?", "Phebe Novakovic", "We're sticking with, you know, we're going to have slightly higher margins, as I said, because we're going to keep our earnings flat, and we're going to have", "slightly less revenue. So I think the margin you're going to see, as I noted some improvement, from what I guided you to which was about 19%.", "Jason Gursky", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.", "Ronald Epstein", "Hey. Good morning, Phebe.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Hey, Ron.", "Ronald Epstein", "So I think probably no big surprise, sort of the question that everybody's, you know, kind of thinking about is, what demand are you seeing on 650? How is that going? I mean, it's - I think it's no secret there's been some more 650's piling up in the available for sale market. Can you just give everybody your perspective on what's going on there? And how healthy that market is, or not. Just some color on that?", "Phebe Novakovic", "Sure. Be happy to. So what I want to do is give you some facts instead of speculation. Think about it as firsthand intelligence, not second and third hand conjecture. So let me parse this in some specificity. First, sales activity, as I noted, in the quarter is", "similar to the quarter of last year. Our first quarter earnings were in line with all of our other prior years. In other words, we typically come off a strong fourth quarter, and orders this quarter were as anticipated, seasonably light. The pipeline, however, remains nicely active. I would note that the U.S. stock market fluctuations in that first quarter seemed to slow down some purchasing decisions, but our pipeline remains active.", "Today, we have the same competitive pressures that we've been dealing with for the last year, including overproduction of large cabin planes by others. So think about it this way. No change on that front.", "Demand for the 550 and 450 is in line with our expectations, and we continue to see interest in those planes, particularly the 550. The 650 is sold out for the year, and the first available ELS is about 24 months out. Remember, I think it's important to recall, but the 650 has 100% market share for a market it created, and from my perspective would appear to, I think it's safe to assume, or what I see, is that it's likely to remain in that position for the foreseeable future. It's still a hot plane and our demand is solid. The number of pre-owned 650's apparently on the market is higher than in the past, but to the best of our knowledge, we have not lost a single sale to pre-owned aircraft. So I've tried to parse for you sort of how we see it from the battlefield. And give you the facts by - by the, you know, the large cabin airplanes that we sell.", "Ronald Epstein", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard", "Thanks so much. Good morning.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Good morning.", "Robert Stallard", "Maybe just to follow-up on Ron's question may be slightly more broadly. What you're seeing out there on the Aerospace side in terms of regional variances, but I don't think has changed in the first quarter this year, and also more broadly, on the pricing of your product?", "Phebe Novakovic", "Well, orders in the first quarter were 50% U.S., 30% Mid-Eastern Europe and 21% Asia Pacific, that goes everywhere from, and our region there is from Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, into China. Frankly, not a whole lot of quarterly variance on the - where the orders are emanating from. Pricing, we have, as we noted, adjusted our prices for the 450, 550 commensurate with where they are in their life cycle. We have not, and do not, intend to adjust for 650 prices.", "Robert Stallard", "And any change on the G280 there?", "Phebe Novakovic", "No, it's about the same.", "Robert Stallard", "Okay. That's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Peter J. Arment with Stern Agee CRT.", "Peter Arment", "This quarter. Phebe, could you give us an update on kind of where things are on the G500 and G600 program? I saw the announcement earlier this month on kind of the progress but, you know, kind of how you view those programs transitioning into 2017 and 2018?", "Thanks.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Sure. Both airplanes, the G500 and the G600 are moving nicely through their test program. There have been no negative surprises. And as I think you alluded to, you read that we recently joined the wing to the fuselage and on the G600 we expect to fly later this year or early 2017. From the sales perspective, the customer interest in both airplanes has been good and, you know, and as we progress through the development program, we expect the demand to increase.", "Bye the way, to - for those of you who like to speculate about Gulfstream future models. I wanted to assure you that there is no 600ER. We'll be able to publish a definitive range for that plane once we're in test flight, and we have a reputation for exceeding our target, but the G600 is the G600.", "Erin Linnihan", "I think we can take the next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Co.", "Cai Rumohr", "Yes. Thank you very much. Good numbers, Phebe.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Thank you.", "Cai Rumohr", "Could you comment on two things, you know, why was your profitability quite so good this quarter, and particularly where was R&D? And secondly, you mentioned a couple of deliveries slipping from this year into next year. How many slipped? And why did they slip? Thank you.", "Phebe Novakovic", "So, you know, profitability and you're focus on cost is a quarter-by-quarter battle. At Gulfstream, we had a couple of things. Favorable mix, improved labor efficiency, very nice high margins at service at Gulfstream, both from the mix of service in the barn and performance. We also had substantial improvement in G&A expense, even though R&D went up slightly.", "You know, we're benefiting from all of the cost cutting we've been doing. We've been improving our processes, reducing waste and we're also getting some benefit from lower material costs. So the cost initiatives began in 2015 to reduce overhead and indirect throughout the enterprise are paying off.", "Cai Rumohr", "And the slips in deliveries?", "Phebe Novakovic", "Yeah, so the slips in delivery. We, every year, every quarter, working with our customers, can determine whether it's more convenient or preferable to take one, two, three airplanes in a given quarter, in a given year. It's not unusual for us to move airplanes across reporting periods or across years even. So we typically haven't talked about it before, but I wanted to give you guys a little bit more understanding of a revenue number.", "Cai Rumohr", "Thank you", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.", "Samuel Pearlstein", "Good morning.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Hi, Sam.", "Samuel Pearlstein", "Just to ask something other than Gulfstream. Can you talk a little bit about the Ohio replacement? And I guess what I'm trying to just think about is when does that start to grow for you in terms of revenues? When do you start booking and so we see it in backlog? And really doesn't that have a negative margin mix as you transition work from Virginia class to Ohio replacement, and how should we think about that transition?", "Phebe Novakovic", "So let me talk to you with that. We have, over the last three years, been increasing our revenue and our performance on Ohio, all in the engineering and design portfolio side of our business. Those margins are all in the cost plus work tend to be less than mature in production construction on submarines, right? So you've seen that that quarter-over-quarter for the last several years, and that along with the two per year for Virginia has driven some of the growth. That will - from my perspective, the engineering and design work will be stable going forward, until it begins to transition down in the latter part of this decade. The - while we don't have specific time lines for when we're going to build the first ship, I think it's in the 2020, 2021 timeframe, but we're going to see some early, likely to see a taskless prologue. Some early material purchases so that we can, you know, we can lock in some favorable rates. So that program will program will really begin to ramp up really in the 2020's and go on for some time.", "The margin profile way out then is going to be driven in the first instance by how the contract is structured, and I don't know. We don't know yet, and I think the Navy, we're still working with the Navy on how they want to do that. Typically, in complex naval ship building programs, the first ship is cost plus, but that's the Navy's decision and we'll have a lot more clarity about the margin performance. But, again, it's past is prologue, Electric Boat has shown the proclivity and the ability to increase their profitability by reducing their cost and improving their manufacturing efficiency hull over hull. So this is a very important program for General Dynamics. Increasingly now, but very much in the future.", "Samuel Pearlstein", "And if I just looked at that past, do you typically do the long lead? Is it two years ahead of the boat construction starting? When do you start that long...?", "Phebe Novakovic", "I think it's about two years before.", "Samuel Pearlstein", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.", "Doug Harned", "Good morning.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Hi, Doug.", "Doug Harned", "Hi. I wanted to continue in Marine. The other big thing that is coming up is the competition for the TAO205, the LXR and the LHA8. And when you look at that, one would naturally see NASSCO as the choice for the TA205, Ingles is the logical choice for the other two ships. But how do you see NASSCO's position in competing for, particularly the LXR? Can you use the MLP hull form and be an effective competitor in that part of this competition?", "Phebe Novakovic", "Well, we've already submitted our bids and, you know, I'll get myself in a really sticky wicket if I spoke to the Navy about relative competency. But we know how to build the TAOX, no surprise, and we've bid appropriately on that entire solicitation. So I think that's about all that I'm permitted to say. Sorry about that.", "Doug Harned", "Okay.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Ask the Navy. See what they say.", "Doug Harned", "No, I understand.", "Phebe Novakovic", "I ask the Navy, so.", "Doug Harned", "Okay. And what do you see as sort of the timeframe now on how that's going to play out, that decision?", "Phebe Novakovic", "I'm told that it will be sometime this year.", "Doug Harned", "For the...", "Phebe Novakovic", "But I don't have any more clarity whether it's third or fourth quarter.", "Doug Harned", "Okay. Okay. That's great. Thank you.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.", "David Strauss", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Hi.", "David Strauss", "A couple of questions on Gulfstream. I think your large cabin delivery guidance for 2016 was 104? Can you tell us what it is now, with some of the push out? Is the plan still to hold Gulfstream EBIT flat beyond 2016? Thanks.", "Phebe Novakovic", "I'm not going to give you the 2017 guidance. What I told you is, we're going to do 2016 at flat EBIT and that looks very, very possible from our perspective. I think we're moving one large cabin airplane from this year to next and a couple of mid cabins.", "David Strauss", "And Phebe, can you explain the large gap between green large-cabin deliveries in the quarter and completed? I don't think I've ever seen that large of a gap.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Oh, it's all timing, and it is the druthers of the customers on what they want in terms of outfitting them on their airplanes and any special configurations. There's nothing there that's particularly anomalous, simply timing.", "David Strauss", "All right. Thank you.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.", "Robert Spingarn", "Good morning.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Hi.", "Robert Spingarn", "Hi. So maybe we'll switch to IS&T for a minute; I wanted to ask you about two things there. Just on this big IDIQ on jitters for the handheld, three of you participating there, competing, so I wanted to ask you how you think about that in terms of orders for the contract, how that might impact IS&T sales and margins going forward? And then separately, this stretch of WIN-T and how that might affect things? Thanks.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Sure. So as it was reported in the press, we were down selected along with two others for what is essentially a 12.7 billion, five-year hunting license, and it- the way we're thinking about it in the moment is we deliver the next generation radio hardware in this quarter for evaluation and then full wave production follows that, conceivable this quarter and next.", "One thing that I think is interesting to note, is we've got the only radio that's a proven MUOS capable terminal. So that ought to, from another perspective, be a by the competitive advantage. You know, it's, with these IDIQ programs, you've got to sort of handicap what you see as your win rate. We typically have been very successful in our win rates, but again, it will be highly competitive and we're just going to have to work our way through it.", "This is a mission systems, where this resides is a high-operating leverage business, so I would expect them to perform nicely on those IDIQ contracts that they win.", "WIN-T is, you know, WIN-T has slipped more than a skater on the ice. We're in increment two; it's in full rate production. It's going to be fielded to the next, I think, to an active brigade combat team and National Guard units over the next eight, nine years. And it is already in the field and successfully supporting down range missions. So from a financial perspective, it's performing very nicely. It's sort of up to our customer on what the pace of deployments will be, but heretofore we've managed, because of our intimacy with the customer, we've managed to accommodate their desires nicely, and I would expect that to continue.", "Robert Spingarn", "So, Phebe, net-net, it sounds like the jitters is a positive relative to what you're thinking might have been when you initially provided 2016 guidance, and therefore, is it fair to assume that you'll bake that in with when we hear from you next on this?", "Phebe Novakovic", "Yeah. If, in fact, they start to issue the IDIQ purchase orders within this year. So that's part of what I don't know, right?", "Robert Spingarn", "Right. So it could be a 2017 thing?", "Phebe Novakovic", "It could be. But I don't know. So...", "Robert Spingarn", "Okay. Thank you.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.", "Carter Copeland", "Hey, good morning, Phebe, Jason. Phebe, I wondered if you could talk to the booking strength in IS&T and maybe even the margin strange in IS&T, sort of the difference between IT and Mission, give us some color on that, and maybe where some of that strength is coming from?", "Phebe Novakovic", "So let's talk about this in two parts. Our Mission system is still benefiting from the cost synergies we achieved by combining two of our businesses. They're also - and by the way, that's why I was interested in that combination. But the business unit guys were saying and oh, by the way, in addition to cost savings, we're going to see some marketing synergies. And I said, yeah, good, great. Well, it turns out they were right. So they have won more than their fair share, and that's reflected in no small measure in that $1.3 book-to-bill. And their performance, operating performance is really terrific.", "Now, this margin rate in the moment is a bit high going-forward. And while I'm not ready to update guidance, this group should be a double-digit earner in the near future. We've got additional opportunities for margin improvement in efficiencies and performance, and it - the margin performance in this group on the Mission Systems side is heavily driven by the product mix.", "On the IT side, again, this is a very competitive business, with terrific cash flow, and as I always like to tell everybody, great return on invested capital. They are very disciplined when they go into the market, and they win their fair share. And I say disciplined, we're careful that he we don't, you know, pursue contracts down rat holes where we don't think we can get a decent return.", "Carter Copeland", "And in terms of their pipeline, do you expect to continue to see win rates like this? And you know, obviously the market is, as you stated, pretty competitive, but clearly you've seen this trend for a while now.", "Phebe Novakovic", "So, you know, it is very difficult to project win rates in such a short cycle business. I've been pleased with how they've done. They can - they've got more performance opportunity, cost cutting opportunity, as they would quarter in, quarter out, and so, you know, a combination of performance and cost efficiency, dedication to schedule adherence to schedule, schedule is not a guideline, right? Those are the things that make you win, and these businesses are firing on all cylinders, so I'm pretty place pleased.", "Carter Copeland", "Great. Thanks for the color, Phebe.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jeffries.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Hey, Howard.", "Howard Rubel", "Good morning, Phebe. Thank you. To go to Combat Systems for a moment, I mean, you know, it's always lumpy when we see ads to the backlog, but keeping it stable at this point seems pretty good, given the large contracts you're working on. Could you address what you're seeing in terms of incremental interest internationally?", "Phebe Novakovic", "So as you and I have talked about on this call before, the world remains a dangerous place, and that Russian fair is roaring. So we've got considerable interests in interest in places that you might think.", "Just to give you a little bit of color on some of the contracts that we have just put into backlog, the Swiss Army is purchasing 4.4 combat vehicles, and that went in I think this quarter for about $400 million, U.S. dollars. So that was good. The Czech Republic is on the map, as is the Spanish 8 by 8 technology program, and our land systems is in good position on that - on that program. And then we continue to see demand signals coming out of the Mid East. Iraqi tanks, Kuwait and in other parts of the Mid East where there's some really hot wars going on. So you know the pipeline looks good internationally. And if you look at the Army budget, they're beginning to recapitalize, so that's pretty wholesome in and of itself.", "So, again, as in the IS&T case, our ability to perform with contract, keep our costs down will be the key to, again, winning more of our fair share. And oh, by the way, our armaments business is doing quite nicely as well.", "Howard Rubel", "That doesn't surprise me. Just sort of a little bit related to profitability, just to go to Marine for a second, the numbers were really good, could you address in some way how you were doing on Zumwalt and some of the other programs, just in terms of capability. Because, I mean, they seem to be surprising a little bit on the bottom line?", "Phebe Novakovic", "So let me give you some clarity on this program. Operationally, the ship is performing quite nicely; it's been out on two sea trials and we like what we see and, more importantly, our customer seems to. But let me remind everybody of a couple of things.", "First, we are not the integrator of prime on this ship, the Navy is. So I really don't have any insight into the program beyond our shipyard. I think that's the first thing to consider.", "The second thing is our share of the $22.4 billion program is less than about a quarter. So, again, that gives you some perspective. The Navy reported some cost growth to the Congress over the last 12 months and I don't have visibility into that number. I do know, what I do know, is that that VAS has experienced some cost growth primarily on the first of cost ship, which is the cost plus help. But that's not a surprise given the complexity of this ship. And we continue to work close closely with the Navy to ensure that, you know, we're delivering the ships that they want and that they need operationally and that, you know, we minimize or reduce risk, manage the risk from the second two ships.", "The 51 programs are running in tandem with 1000 and we've seen some impacts, as we started up a co-line, the 51s. And by the way, this flight of 51s is materially different and upgraded than the former flight. So we're confident that we can work through these, and we know these ships.", "So, again, we're working with the Navy on scheduling costs so that we can ensure we get them what they need with profitability that we require.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you very much, Phebe. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan.", "Seth Seifman", "Thanks very much, and good morning", "Phebe Novakovic", "Good Morning.", "Seth Seifman", "I'll ask the capital deployment question this morning and basically, obviously there's not really anything to quarrel with in a billion dollars of share repurchased in the quarter, but it's not the first time that you've bought back a billion dollars, and you know, given sort of the underlying objective of the repurchase program to be opportunistic, obviously you've had some opportunities in the first quarter, how do we think about share repurchases going forward and, you know, would you characterize what you did in the quarter as opportunistic?", "Phebe Novakovic", "Yeah. I mean, we believe that the stock was undervalued, so we went in and bought and we'll continue to do that in instances where we think the market has mispriced our stock. That's our view, and we've been consistent about that strategy. So I think that's not a particularly big change.", "Seth Seifman", "Right. And any color about the level of repurchases going forward?", "Phebe Novakovic", "Well, because we're opportunistic, you know, I'm going to have to see, you know, we understand in the absence of M&A, it's, and given the investments that is we're making in our gross businesses, I think it's a reasonable, shareholder friendly action to take, and, frankly, you know, never forget, it's all about the shareholders.", "Seth Seifman", "Yep. Absolutely. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Walton", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Good morning.", "Myles Walton", "Can I ask a question on cash flow? And I know last year 1Q is a tougher comp and most of the advanced burn was in the second half of last year, but the improvement in conversion from herein out through the rest of the year, should we expect that to kind of pick up the pace and do you think conversion will actually be better than last year before you get to full conversion in 2017?", "You know, I think the way we think about that, and I think we signaled this before is that, you know, we the expect the free cash flow profile this year to look similar to last year. As you mentioned, it was a particularly tough comp from the first quarter of last year, which far outstripped our expectations and outstripped really a typical Q1 profile. The first quarter is usually a slightly softer cash performance and frankly, sometimes in the past it has even been negative. So on balance, I think you look at the year as similar to last year. It will fluctuate a little bit on the timing of some of the remaining progress payments and outflows on the international programs.", "Myles Walton", "Okay. And then, Phebe thinks for the color on the 650. But I'm curious, is there a level where you think the pre-owned stock becomes more of an obstacle to you selling aircraft or pricing, or maintaining the price?", "Phebe Novakovic", "Well, let me be clear. We're not going to drop the 650 price, or the 450, 550, based on the use. We don't compete that way. But let's talk about that used market. And it's not a homogeneous market. It's highly differentiated by model types. So let's think about it in two respects. You've got the 450, 550 used market that is mature, it's established, it has demonstrated factors that influence its behavior, and we have watched it now for well over a decade. The 650 is an immature developing market.", "So let me parse, if it would help a little bit, let me walk through both of those markets. So with respect to the 450, 550, we did lose some G550's to the used inventory because there were a lot of them, the late models, that were available, and there still are to some degree. But this is an active market, it's a very active market, and so it has pretty good throughput. I think in the last 12 months we sold - the market sold 29 used G550's. So this is a market with predictable and understandable transition rates and activity rates.", "And conversions. I hear less about the 450's used market, but I think the 450 is attractively priced. The bigger problem for those models, frankly, is that some customers are waiting for the G500 and G600. Now, the same has not been true to this point for the G650. I'm not aware of losing a single G650 new airplane ordered to a used airplane.", "I would also comment that, as I noted before, this pre-owned market is developing, it's a developing market. For example, it's not clear how many dedicated sellers we have. Some folks have been there in there for three years and not lowered the price. And there's not been a transaction there for some time.", "The early 650's, the early models, N numbers that were available to sellers or are available, are attractive at favorable prices, above the original sale price. Those were earlier on, but, you know, we've got to see how that market develops. By the way, we're very happy to help buyers in the used markets get into our airplanes. But one of these days, the market will be determined. But so far, it's just too speculative to observe outcomes.", "Myles Walton", "Okay. So you're comfortable with continuing to grow and pricing won't enter the discussion, but you're sold out for the next 24 months. So that's kind of the landscape as we see it right now?", "Phebe Novakovic", "Very wholesome.", "Myles Walton", "Okay. Thanks.", "Erin Linnihan", "And Liz, I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolf Research.", "Hunter Keay", "Hi. Thanks for getting me on. I appreciate it.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Good morning.", "Hunter Keay", "Good morning. So Phebe, you talked about the difference in time between green deliveries and completions, and as it relates to customer preference. I'm wondering if that sort of implies maybe you shift away from fleet sales and more to sort of individual purposes. And maybe I'm just reading too much into it? And can you confirm that one way or the other? And can you also talk about, generally, how you think about margins versus fleet sales to the individual one off purchases? Thanks very much.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Okay. So I wouldn't read too much into the timing difference between green deliveries and completed. I mean, there's really nothing there.", "With respect to fleet and - and individual, let's talk about fleet. You know, fleet can be a fair number of aircraft going into a Corporation to replenish their, and refresh their active fleet. There's another series of fleet buyers that are fractional. We have very little exposure to fractional markets. And then there's another set of fleet buyers that buy for the Airlines. So that's a little bit different as well. And, again, we don't have too many of those.", "We are very careful on our pricing, very careful. So don't think about those as materially different.", "Obviously you get some volume discounts. But we have a pretty strict pricing discipline. Okay?", "Hunter Keay", "Got it. Thanks a lot for the time.", "Phebe Novakovic", "Great.", "Erin Linnihan", "Thank you for joining our call today.

Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Erin, and good morning. As you may observe from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $7.67 billion, and net earnings of $758 million. We reported EPS of $2.44 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the year-ago quarter. We were also $0.13 a share better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that the self-side anticipated about $200 million more revenue, lower margins, and a somewhat higher tax rate. Compared to consensus, we had about $30 million more in operating earnings on higher margins, $10 million less in taxes, resulting in about $40 million more in net earnings. The big driver in the quarter was the operational performance.", "Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue of $7.67 billion was $217 million lower. However, earnings of $758 million were up $6 million on a 30-basis point improvement in operating margin, and 140-basis point lower effective tax rate. I should note that our earnings in the year-ago quarter included a gain on the sale of our Commercial Cyber business. Excluding that gain, there is a 60-basis point improvement in operating margin. Sequentially, revenue was down $59 million, or less than 1%, and earnings from continuing operations were up $28 million on a 40-basis point improvement in operating margins, and a lower effective tax rate.", "Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2016 and compare it to the first half of 2015. Revenue was down 1.8% against the first half of 2015. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $15 million. Operating margins were 30 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $20 million. EPS was $0.36 better. In short, we are off to a good start, ahead of both our internal plan and external expectation. That leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance shortly. But first, let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year, and wrap that into our EPS guidance.", "First, Aerospace; Aerospace had a very good quarter. Revenue of $2.13 billion was $124 million lower than the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $434 million were only $5 million less on a 90-basis point improvement in operating margins. Importantly, on a sequential basis, revenue was up $147 million or 7.4%, and operating earnings were up $23 million or 5.6%. For the first half, revenue at $4.12 billion is off $245 million against last year, reflecting planned production cuts to the G450 and the G550, offset in part by increased delivery of the G650. However, earnings at $845 million are off only $25 million on a 60-basis point improvement in margin. In short, at $845 million in operating earnings for the first half of the year, we are well-positioned to achieve or exceed our earning goal for the year.", "By the way, recall that last year we told you that we had in Q1 a positive supplier settlement. Absent that contribution, earnings would actually have been up this year. So let me give you some commentary about order activity in the quarter, and then some observations about the current state of the market. First, on a numerical or unit basis, we had 50% more orders than we did in the first quarter. However, the mix was not as advantageous. In other words, think about it this way, we sold more mid-cabin in the quarter than in the first quarter. So the dollar-based book-to-bill was not much better. About a third of our orders in the quarter were mid-cabin.", "Activity and interest level were good throughout the quarter. But at the end of the quarter when many transactions typically closed, activity almost ceased as a result of the events associated with the Brexit vote. However, those customers did not go away, and are continuing to pursue transactions with us this quarter. We are quite optimistic regarding third quarter sales activity. Active prospects are very good, better than at any time in the year. The U.S. jobs report earlier this month, slightly improved economics stories in the U.S., and to a lesser extent in Europe, coupled with the quick market recovery from the initial Brexit vote reaction, seemed to have accelerated the activity level on our prospects. We fully expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective.", "You may recall that the G500 made its first flight in the second quarter last year. This month, it made its international debut at the Farnborough Airshow. T4, that's the fourth test article, made the flight from Savannah to Farnborough in 6 hours and 55 minutes, traveling at a steady 0.9 Mach. Flight test is going very well, and we are on or somewhat ahead of schedule. We look forward to the first flight of the G600 late this year.", "Let's take a look at Combat. They had a very solid quarter. Revenue was $1.32 billion, $93 million less than the second quarter last year. However, a 60-basis point improvement in operating margins resulted in a modest $7 million increase in operating earnings over the year-ago quarter. All-in-all, very good operating leverage and an outstanding 16.7%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $42 million or 3.3%, and operating earnings were up $2 million, about 1%. For the first half, revenue was down $183 million, or 6.6%, against the first half of 2015. Operating earnings, on the other hand, were up $6 million on a 130-basis point margin expansion. Pretty impressive operating performance.", "Work is progressing quite well on our international orders, with prototypes in production for both our AJAX program and our Canadian Mid-East (8:08) contract. We were also awarded a contract to begin fast ceiling (8:13) of the up-gun Stryker. With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $1.99 billion was $14 million lower than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were off $6 million against the year-ago quarter, and operating margins were off 20 basis points. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $144 million due to timing on submarine material purchases. Operating earnings were down $11 million, resulting in a modest 10-basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, revenue of $4.1 billion was up $174 million, or 4.4% against the first half of 2015. Operating earnings were essentially the same on somewhat lower margins. Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us, and will continue to be so. We have some work to do on margins in the second half.", "Turning to IS&T, that group continues to do well. Revenue of $2.2 billion and operating earnings of $244 million were up against the year-ago quarter $14 million and $7 million, respectively. There was a 20-basis point improvement in operating margin, which was particularly impressive when one considers that the sale of the Commercial Cyber products business contributed 100 basis points of margin in the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, revenue was lower by $104 million, but operating earnings were down only $4 million, or 1.6%, on a 30-basis point improvement in margin. This 10.9% margin is the strongest in nearly five years. The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue was down $23 million, 0.5%, and operating earnings were up $38 million, or 8.4%, on a 90-basis point improvement in margin. So once again, very strong operating leverage. This group also tells a story about building the backlog through the first half. Book-to-bill at about 1.3, which marks the eighth quarter in the last 10 quarters the group has achieved a book-to-bill equal to or greater than 1:1. In short, we believe all this leaves us poised for a good second half.", "So turning to guidance. Let me provide you some guidance for the year for each segment, and then compare it to what we told you in January, and then wrap it up into our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue somewhat lower than 2015 and margins somewhat higher than 2015, leading to flat operating earnings. We now expect to be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion of revenue, with margins slightly above 20%. This implies a slight pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the third quarter. This will result in operating earnings the same as last year or even slightly better. Despite all the handwringing by some, these two businesses will continue to perform well.", "So for Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of approximately $5.8 billion, and margins in the mid-15% area. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.7 billion, and margins at 16% to 16.1%. Revenue will see strong uplift in the fourth quarter. The difference in revenue guidance is simply from timing. For the Marine group, we previously guided to revenue of $8 billion and margins in the mid-9% range. We now expect revenue to be between $8.1 billion and $8.2 billion, and margins around 9.2%. For IS&T, we guided to revenue of about $9 billion and margins approaching double-digits. It now appears that our revenue guidance was good, with slight upward pressure, and that operating margins would be somewhat better than 10.5% for the year.", "So all of this rolls up into revenue for GD of about $31.5 billion, operating margins of 13.7% to 13.8%, net income somewhat more than the $3 billion, and a return on sales of around 9.6%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue, but higher operating income on higher margins, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70. To help you further, our original EPS guidance was $9.20 per share. The $0.50 difference is $0.24 from operations, $0.09 from a lower tax rate, and $0.17 from share repurchases. If you think about the progression for the remainder of the year, third quarter should be somewhat weaker than the second quarter, but much like the first quarter, followed by a very strong fourth quarter.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Jason Aiken, our CFO.", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with an update to an issue that we've been addressing since last year, and that's the impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. This continues to be focused in our Combat Systems group, and when you compare that group's results to the first half of 2016 to the similar period a year ago, our 2016 revenue would have been higher by approximately $75 million, had the exchange rates that prevailed in the first half of 2015 remained in effect this year. And for the company as a whole, revenue would have been a little over $100 million higher.", "Moving down the income statement, our net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $20 million in the second quarter of 2015. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $45 million, versus $41 million for the same period in 2015. For 2016, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $95 million, up from 2015 due to lower cash balances resulting from our capital deployment activities, which I'll cover in just a minute. We continue to expect free cash flow this year to look similar to 2015, though more weighted to the latter part of the year. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a cash balance of $1.9 billion, and a net debt position of $1.5 billion, both essentially unchanged from the end of the first quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we had $500 million of fixed rate notes mature, and we're in the process of refinancing that debt as we speak. We intend to replace that debt and raise an additional $500 million from general corporate purposes to include share repurchases.", "Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the quarter. This was lower than our original expectation as we adopted a new accounting standard that altered the accounting for tax benefits associated with our stock options and restricted stock. In a nutshell, these tax benefits are now treated as a permanent benefit that impact our effective tax rate. In the second quarter, this change reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 140 basis points. We're at a rate of 28.8% year-to-date, and we're now targeting a full-year rate right around 29%. On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter we repurchased 1.1 million shares, bringing us to just under 9 million shares in the first half of 2016 for almost $1.2 billion. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid through the first six months of the year, we spent $1.6 billion in shareholder-friendly capital deployment, more than two times our free cash flow for the first half.", "Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.", "Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Candice, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Absolutely. And our first question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is now open.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, David.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning, Phebe. Thanks for taking my question. Phebe, thanks for all the color on Gulfstream, but maybe just a little bit more color on the large cabin market, and how you saw it evolve in Q2, both from a used inventory perspective, how you're competing on the G450 and G550 with the used inventory that's out there, and the G650, and then what you saw regionally? Did North America hold in there pretty well? Thank you.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So I think I gave you a pretty robust response in my remarks, but let me parse this, our market, in a couple of ways. First, let's talk about the G650 pre-owned market. So I've seen some folks saying there are going to be 20, or there are 21 used airplanes in the market. We simply do not see them. If I count serial numbers, we have 14 on the market right now with one pending transaction. We have 186 in service, so that equates to 7.5% of the fleet. That is well below the 10% used to in-service ratio. So that's rather typical. And by the way, we have long anticipated the emergence of a G650 used market, so in my mind, this should be no surprise. I would also note that we have seen minimal impact with a few customers choosing the near-term availability rather than wait.", "So from my perspective, based on the facts and the data, we're quite comfortable that that used market is appropriate and acting in a rational and typical sort of way. So G650, so if you talk about by model, the G650 demand remains quite active. In our subs market, sub-sections of the market, the G450 and G550 are, as we anticipated during this period of transition to the G500 and G600, complicated the touch by competitors' overproduction. By the way, I might tell you that the G500 and G600, a lot of those positions are sold in 2016 and 2017. So we like how all of that is shaping up. And with respect to the geographic distribution, about 50% of the orders were North America, and I think the rest split between Mid-East, Asia-Pacific, Europe and South America, in that order.", "Okay?", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Good morning. I wanted to switch to Marine for a moment, Phebe. You guided for us earlier, but you have a lot going on there. You've got the Block IV pricing going up, there's growth in ORP (20:33) funding. When would we start to see some real improvement in sales from all of these positives?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we've been experiencing that improvement, but when we look at the Navy's plan to continue with the Gulfstream, or the Virginia-class deliveries, as well as other (21:00) replacement, we see that we get some real nice ignition starting in 2019, when we have long-lead delivery \u2013 how we're anticipating, based on the Navy's plan, long-lead delivery in 2019. But let's not forget, this has been a very nice, steady quarter-over-quarter performer.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "True. And how would the TAO(NYSE:", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So the TAO(", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Phebe, you talked a lot about the earnings and the revenue for the year. In the past, you've talked about free cash flow conversion relative to last year. So now with a higher net income, should we still see a similar conversion? And somewhat related, we knew you were going to be eating into those international combat advances, but really, what should that advances line look like when we get to the end of the year on the balance sheet?", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sam, so as I addressed in my remarks, we do continue to see full year free cash flow for this year looking similar to what we had last year, although as I said, a little bit inverted toward the second half of the year, slightly different profile than we had last year from a timing standpoint. As it relates to the advances, we'll continue to draw down on those, so you'll see that balance \u2013 you've seen it come down throughout the first half of the year, and we'll see that continue, as we continue to make progress on the production side of those contracts through the balance of the year.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "But coming down at the same rate?", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I don't have the exact specifics on that. We can perhaps talk after the call on that. But directionally, yeah, we'll see it continue to come down.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is now open.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Doug.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "I wanted to try and understand a little bit of the margin situation at Gulfstream. I mean, the margins have been great, at around 20% level, even with declining production. So, can you talk a little bit about what's enabled you to achieve that as you're going through a transition to the new programs? You have a lower rate on the G450 and G550. And when you roll that forward, do you expect, if you have to take rate down perhaps even more on the G450 and G550, can you keep that margin level through the product transition?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let's talk about this year, and I don't want to get into too much specificity in 2017 and 2018. But the margins are driven by \u2013 and this is true year in and year out \u2013 they're driven by our managing of costs and our cost reduction, in addition to the G650's nice contribution. So when I think about that, that and our performance on service has been quite nice through the course of the year. So I have a great deal of confidence that we can continue to maintain our profitability as we go through. We'll have to modify it somewhat, but with our profitability, going through this transition period.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "And that is \u2013 but even as you take rates down and you, in theory, would lose some operating leverage.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we've pretty much planned in the rates on the G450. I don't see any more reductions. In fact, I don't see any more reduction on the G450. And the G550, we see very minimal changes going forward. So looks, our job is to keep earnings up as high as possible during this transition period, and manage our margins. We're going to continue to do that. I think we've demonstrated that track record the last six quarters, and we're going to continue going forward.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. First, Phebe, I have a clarification.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Howard.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Thank you. Sorry. I think you said G500, G600 sold in 2016 and 2017. Did you mean that you're largely sold out in 2017 and 2018?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I'm sorry, if I wasn't clear on that. The G650 is sold out in its entirety through the first quarter or through 2016, and also in its entirety through 2017. So when we look at the order activity on the G500 and G600, what I'm saying is, is that our expectations for entry into service would remain the same. In that projection, we have sold an awful lot of our both of those G500s and G600s. So that positions us very well, I think.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "So I'm sorry, again, so 2017 and 2018 for the G500 and G600 are largely sold. Is that how I'm hearing this?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. We've got a lot of sales", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "And then just to follow this, it sounds like, though, there were some adjustments to the large cabin delivery schedule. Could you articulate where you are for this year? And I guess, you probably won't. And then maybe if you can address some elements of how you're thinking about 2017.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So I don't want to get into 2017 at the moment because, as you know, we provide that to you in the fourth quarter of the 2016 call by tradition. So that said, let me give you some color on where we are in the moment. First, production rates this year have not changed. So we've kept them the same as when we set this plan. Revenue is impacted in 2016 by a couple of factors; one, we have one less screen (28:12) airplane, I think it's the G280, and six fewer completions. We're moving these completions from this year into next, largely because of customer preferences on when they want to take the plane. And then we got a mix of other smaller puts and takes.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, Phebe. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow up on the G500 and the G600 really quickly. I think, at the launch event a few years ago you suggested that the book-to-bill, or the bookings that you take on that aircraft would be kind of barbelled. You take some at the beginning, would have a lull until you got closer to the entry into service of the aircraft. I'm wondering, if that's still the way that you're thinking about that. And at what point historically do you see the second into that barbell begin to pick up? Meaning when (29:16) we see some more orders for the G500 and G600 begin to come in relative to the entry into service? How much before entry into service do we see that to pick back up?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So I don't have perfect clarity about the precise timing of when orders will pick up, but it's our expectation building on the good sales we've had (29:39) that the closer these airplanes are to entry into service, our sales will pick up.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Myles.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Phebe, can you comment on the capital deployment strategy and where your head is currently in terms of M&A? The market's gotten richer or cheaper in property, availability has gotten better or worse, and also the repurchase slowdown, is there anything to read there?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So on M&A, I really don't have any update for you, but if and when we do something, we'll let you know. We'll advise you. Jason, do you want to talk through the share repurchase?", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I think, Myles, for the balance, when you think about the year, our objectives, our targets for the year on deployment haven't changed. As you know, we were fairly on the active side in the first quarter of the year. And so we looked at the second quarter, and we feel like by the balance of the first half of the year we're right on track and doing exactly what we had hoped to do. We've deployed, as I said, two times our free cash flow on share repurchase and dividends. So I don't think you should see that as a signal of any directional shift for us at any time.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. So the full year return on capital still targeted to be 100% of net income then?", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "That's correct.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, and nice quarter.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Just a clarification and a question. I know, Phebe, you said the production plan didn't change, but I just wondered if you could clarify whether or not your cost plan changed at all. I know you had some cost reduction actions and furloughs. I didn't know if any of that changed from what you initially planned on. And then one for Jason, just on the FX front, I mean, you've called out the UK impact. I think, you've got a little bit of Swiss impact as well. What should we be thinking of in terms of forward impacts, if currencies stay where they are? Are there any transactional FX exposures that we should be aware of going forward? Thank you.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So look, as I mentioned earlier, our margins at that level really aren't sustainable each and every quarter. But the G650 is contributing, and really it's cost management, cost reduction that's driving our margins. And so it's hard with perfect clarity to estimate the goodness that you can achieve until you're really in the moment. So we're continuing to manage our costs. I think we've got more way to go. And then at the same time, by the way, we've got to continue to improve the G650 and G280 operating margins, which we will do and are doing. And then we've got to ensure that the G400 and G500, or G450 and G500 maintain their profitability. And so I think that (33:05) very nice on track, particularly with respect to the latter.", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So Carter, with respect to your foreign exchange question, you can think about our exposure as this way, in order of magnitude, if you will. It's really Canadian dollars, euros, pounds, and then Swiss francs sort of, in terms of magnitude. But the updated guidance that Phebe walked you through earlier was actually predicated on the latest rates we have at hand projected through the balance of the year. So that is the latest look at the impact, and it's not \u2013 I wouldn't call it material through the balance of the year, but we also don't necessarily take a bet on rates moving further one way or another. So if there is a further movement in the second half, we would obviously tell you about that and it could have an upside or a downside impact to that guidance. The last thing I would say is that there's no, absolutely zero, from our perspective, transactional exposure. This is all strictly, as we've discussed before, the translation for U.S. dollar reporting. Everything from a transactional perspective is hedged in, and has been working effectively up to this point.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Ron.", "Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. Hey. Good morning. Phebe, I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update where we stand on the Ohio-class program, in terms of what's going on actually at Electric Boat, and then what you're looking for over the next coming quarters.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So if you've been following this, the Navy and Electric Boat have been active in a number of discussions. Most recently we delivered our Ohio Replacement Integrated Product and Process Development plan, and think about that as the detailed design and long lead material portion of the procurement process. So the Navy is reviewing that in the moment. I think their plan is to get back to us sometime late summer, early fall. But that's kind of their call in terms of the cadence of the timing. But that will provide, and should provide, depending when we close on that, some upside in this year. And then again, as we've talked before, this is a very strong growth engine for us over time.", "Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thank you very much. So Phebe, how far are the G450 and G550 sold into next year? And I think, at one point you said you'd rather take down production than take down price. How large is that period between when that backlog ends and when we might see initial deliveries of the G500?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I'm comfortable that we can manage this transition, and we are in good shape to either \u2013 we sold a fair number of the positions going into next year, particularly on the G450, and also on the G550. So the transition, the trick to the transition is, we've got to bring down the production on the G450, G550 while ramping up the production on the G500 and G600. The ease of this is somewhat benefited, or somewhat benefits, from the fact that these two sets of airplanes are built in completely different facilities. So, if you're suggesting that we have a gap, that's not an altogether bad thing, as long as we stay on schedule for our deliveries on the G500 and G600, which I see no reason why we can't at the moment, but we're in good shape for next year on the G450, G550. Got a little ways more to go, and then we'll set the production rate for the G500 and G600 as we move forward. So does that get to the essence of your question?", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "That's helpful. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks very much, and good morning. I was wondering if you could tell us, maybe Jason, of the shortfall in cash flow, free cash flow, relative to net income this year, maybe in kind of qualitative terms, how much of that is related to the construction of flight test articles for G500 and G600? And do all those flight test articles go to customers, and so do all of those costs go into inventory?", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So the flight test articles do go into inventory, and eventually they'll go into long-term product design use or to customers. I would say, from a qualitative standpoint, the outsized impact on the cash flow differential is really more about the international program advances being drawn down. There's some impact on, not so much the flight test aircraft impacting Gulfstream so much as just inventory build toward production, but that's the minor share. The larger share really is about the international advance drawdown.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Okay. Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi George.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yes. Hi, Phebe. Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "I wanted to pursue, you had four used sales in Gulfstream. Could you give us the revenues and approximate earnings? And I would assume that that would have deflated the margin you reported, as high as it was. So when you go to the second half and you have higher revenues, why does the margin be somewhat less than what it was this quarter? Thanks.", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So George, I'll take that. The revenues for the quarter were right around $40 million, I believe, is the number for pre-owned, and as is typical, it's right around breakeven, maybe a $1 million or $2 million loss associated with those, which is pretty typical. If I understand your question, for the balance of the year we do have profiled, as we've talked about before, an expectation of additional pre-owned coming into inventory and being sold, which actually is consistent with the point Phebe made before, with a little bit of a downtick in margins, particularly in the third quarter. So I think those are consistent, unless I misunderstood your question about the balance of the year.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "No. I think it's right, Jason. I just thought that, to deliver four used planes in subsequent quarters, you're probably not going to do that much, maybe you will. So I was kind of figuring the used planes would be less, so you got a little less pressure on the profit and you got higher revenues.", "Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Actually, a little bit more color on that, the planes in the quarter, there were four of them, but the mix of them, they were pretty modest in terms of revenue per unit. So that's not the assumption necessarily going forward. There are a lot of different mix in there, in terms of the inventory that we take in.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah (40:48). So think about it this way, George. We sold four in the quarter, which you know. We took in three and have sold one, so today we have two in inventory. But remember that the margin impact can vary depending on the aircraft itself.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. No, that's a good answer. And one quick one, Combat margin is usually the biggest in the fourth quarter, and yet your guidance is implying that second half won't be as good as the first half. So if you had a little explanation on that.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So we are in the third quarter and more importantly, in the fourth quarter beginning to move from our \u2013 as the domestic land forces contract, some of those begin to taper down, we are increasing our international production. So we've got \u2013 that's really the margin pressure. It's simply a question of mix. As long as operating performance is good, these guys have done very well, but they've got to come down their learning curves, right?", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Right. Okay. Thanks very much. Very good.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Good morning. Thank you.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey. Phebe, can you give us any color on the customer mix or geography on all those mid cabins in the quarter that you sold? And was that order activity in line with your expectation on a dollar-based book-to-bill basis, or would you say you're slightly surprised with the upside? And sort of to that, can you talk about how wait times on the mids change in the quarter? Thank you.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So if I understand your question properly, our sales on the G280 were a little different, or a little better than we had anticipated. And I think that's just reflecting the strength of the North American market. So with respect to wait times, and let me give you this opportunity or take this opportunity to give you a little bit of color on the wait times, on the G650 and G650ER, we're about 24 months; G550 and G450, nine months to 12 months, no change; G280, nine months to 12 months; and the G150, we've got onesies and twosies left to sell there. So the first available there is a year from now.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks. So on the G280, better than expected, that wasn't just timing, that was actually just \u2013 maybe you just won a few more awards that could have gone either way.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think that, that's right. And it wasn't \u2013 that's always the case. We understand our customers' needs, but the order in which they want to execute the placement of their fleet will kind of depend on their imminent needs for the mission that a particular airplane serves. So the good news is, they're selling well, the G280s, but it does impact book-to-bill.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Sure. Thank you.", "Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations", "Candice, I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Yeah, Phebe, I guess, I'll ask you one on the Navy subs program. I'm wondering how you think about \u2013 there seems to be some emerging chatter from the Democrats about the affordability of nuclear triad recapitalization. And I know you have some potential CapEx bills to pay as you think about what the rates are going to be. So how do you decide out of your CapEx profile there at Marine, given kind of the sizable bills the Navy is going to have to pay, and if they can pay those bills or not?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, there is often chatter when we \u2013 and this has been true from the last time that we recapitalized our nuclear fleet, about the affordability of it. But this is really a national policy issue, and to the extent that the United States wants to maintain a nuclear deterrent, they've got to build this submarine. So that's number one. And that's my view. And I think that that's supported by many people in the government on both the Executive and the Congressional side. So I wouldn't say that Democratic \u2013 some chatter in the system suggest walking away from this requirement. So I think in terms of \u2013 the Navy has budgeted here a revenue flow to us that we can easily accommodate the CapEx and the other improvements that we have going forward in terms of the ability to build these. I might also tell you that we've been spending CapEx over the last few years to position ourselves, particularly at the Quonset Point, on the Ohio replacement. So we work very carefully with our Navy customer to determine what they need, what we need, the funding allocation, who's responsible for what, and we're certainly not going to get caught long.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Do you think ultimately you keep the Virginia rate at two per year?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, that's the plan. In fact, we like that plan.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "I hear you. Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today.

Ma'am, you may begin.", "Erin Linnihan - General Dynamics Corp.", "Thank you, Chelsea, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Thanks, Erin. Good morning, all. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 for fully diluted share on revenue of $7.73 billion and income from continuing operations of $767 million. This is $0.20 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.10 per share better than consensus.", "Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was down $263 million or 3.3%. Operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.4% increase, and income from continuing operations is up $34 million, a 4.6% increase.", "This quarter's operating earnings of $1.07 billion reflect a 13.8% operating margin, 90 basis points better than the third quarter 2015. By the way, this is the eighth consecutive quarter that we've had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion.", "Sequentially, revenue is up $66 million, almost 1%. Operating earnings are essentially flat and operating margin is down 20 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, revenue is off $540 million, a 2.3% decrease. However, operating margins are up 50 basis points and earnings from continuing operations are up $54 million, a 2.5% increase, once again reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations. Earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.57 or 8.5% over last year.", "I should point out that the entirety of the year-to-date revenue decrease is attributable to Aerospace, as we forecasted in January. The defense businesses have actually shown some modest growth year-to-date.", "With respect to cash, we have $389 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 51% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.1 billion year-to-date, 50% of net income from continuing operations.", "In the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $348 million, offset in part by the exercise of 1.5 million options. We have purchased approximately 11.2 million shares year-to-date for about $1.5 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts and somewhat in excess of this year's free cash flow, much as we did last year.", "As a reminder, in 2015, we had free cash flow of $1.9 billion and spent $4.1 billion on share repurchases and dividends. This year, we have spent $2.2 billion on share repurchases and dividend year-to-date compared to a free cash flow of $1.1 billion, a delta of $1.1 billion. We will continue to use our balance sheet prudently and appropriately for the rest of the year. In short, we are honoring our word in these two years of low cash flow and using our balance sheet to offset lower cash.", "As you can see from the charts attached to our press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was good contract activity in all segments, with particularly strong order intake at Gulfstream. We ended the quarter with a total backlog for the company of $62 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter. Of that amount, $51.4 billion is funded.", "Let me say a few words about each of our groups. Let me start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue is down $326 million or 13.9% compared to the third quarter of 2015, in line with the production cuts to the G450, G550 and, to a lesser extent, the G280, that we had previously discussed with you. Also remember that Q3 2015 was the group's highest ever revenue quarter.", "On the other hand, operating earnings increased $11 million or 2.6% to $437 million on an operating margin of 21.7%, a 350 basis point improvement over the year-ago quarter. This is a real tribute to the operating efficiency of the Gulfstream and Jet Aviation teams. By the way, this is the ninth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million and the highest ever margin for the group.", "On a sequential basis, the group experienced $117 million reduction in revenue, 5.5%, but a $3 million improvement in operating earnings and 140 basis point improvement in margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $571 million or 8.5%. Operating earnings are down $14 million or 1.1%, a 160 basis point improvement in operating margin.", "On the call last quarter, we advised that we were quite optimistic regarding order activity in the third quarter. Our optimism was well founded. We had strong order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9:1 book-to-bill measure in dollar value of orders. Gulfstream alone was about 1:1 on a dollar value basis and 1.2:1 on a number of units basis.", "The distribution of these orders is also attractive, with the G650 and 650ER leading the way. I can also tell you that our pipeline of prospects grew, and our active sales discussions are quite good. We are again reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look much like the third quarter. By the way, this was the strongest discrete third quarter since 2011 for orders.", "Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter with revenue of $1.33 billion, operating earnings of $219 million and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, revenue is off $15 million but earnings are up $1 million on a 30 basis point improvement in margin.", "On a sequential basis, revenue was up $15 million and operating earnings are flat. Year-to-date, revenue is down against 2015 by $198 million or 4.8%. Operating earnings are up $7 million or 1.1% on a 100 basis point improvement in operating margin. Combat Systems remains on course for a very good year, and we fully anticipate that their fourth quarter earnings will see a 30% increase in revenue.", "All of our major programs are performing very well in Combat. Our cost performance has improved. Our competitiveness positions us well for the future and through rest of the year, by the way. We continued to see opportunities for growth both internationally as allied nations continue to see increased emerging threats and domestically as the U.S. Army and Marine Corps begin to recapitalize their equipment.", "The Marine group reported revenue of $2.04 billion, a $44 million or 2.1% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. However, revenue was up sequentially by $56 million or 2.8%. Year-to-date, revenue has increased by $130 million or 2.2% to $6.2 billion.", "Operating earnings for the third quarter at $166 million are down by $15 million compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis in the quarter as a result of a onetime charge at Bath on their restart of the DDG 115 and DDG 116 program. This charge flows through to the sequential and year-to-date comparisons as well.", "IS&T, well, IS&T continues to outperform somewhat our revenue expectations. Revenue of $2.34 billion is up $122 million or 5.5% against last year's quarter and up $112 million sequentially, also a 5% increase. Year-to-date revenue of $6.9 billion is up $99 million or 1.5% over last year. Operating earnings of $256 million are up $37 million or 16.9% compared to the third quarter last year on the strength of a 100 basis point improvement in operating margin.", "Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings are up $12 million on a 10.9% operating margin in both quarter. Year-to-date operating earnings are up $75 million, an 11.1% increase on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. This is a very good news story with both revenue and operating margins higher than expected. Really strong performance by IS&T.", "So, what does all this mean as far as the year is concerned? Well, stronger than expected operating results in the quarter, a lower than planned tax rate and modestly lower share count enabled us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for EPS from continuing operation goes from $9.70 to $9.75. This late in the year, we anticipate our end of year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance.", "And finally in closing, as tempting as it is this time of year for some of you to ask about the following year, let me just remind you that we have a planning process in the fall when these businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. That guidance, which we give to you in January, is grounded in that process and as a result, it's full and thorough. So, I don't want to prematurely piecemeal at this juncture.", "I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken.", "Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.", "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll be brief as I've got just a few things to cover before we start the Q&A period. First, some background on the charge in discontinued operations. Back in 2013, we settled the 1991 litigation with the U.S. Navy related to the terminated A-12 aircraft contract in our former tactical military aircraft business, retiring in excess of $1 billion in potential risk to the company.", "In connection with that settlement, we provided various forms of consideration to the Navy including the release of some rights to the potential reimbursement of costs that affected all ships under contract at the time at our main shipyard. As we've progressed through the ship building process, we've determined that the cost associated with this settlement is greater than the parties anticipated. Therefore, we recognized an $84 million loss net of taxes to adjust the previously recognized settlement value.", "As we've discussed throughout this year, we're seeing an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility. It's still not material in the aggregate, but it continues to be a slight top line drag on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue declined by 1.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2015 but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar held constant from 2015, the group's sales would have remained steady quarter-over-quarter.", "Moving on to interest expense, the net expense in the quarter was $23 million, similar to the third quarter of 2015. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $95 million. In July, we repaid $500 million of maturing debt with cash on hand and subsequently issued $1 billion of new debt in the quarter. Despite the net increase in long term notes, our net debt position remains unchanged from the end of the second quarter at approximately $1.6 billion.", "We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion after deploying over $550 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. We funded our pension plan as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2016 to approximate $200 million.", "Our effective tax rate was 26.8% for the quarter, somewhat lower than we expected as a result of tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate in the high 28% range.", "Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.", "Erin Linnihan - General Dynamics Corp.", "Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has the chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Chelsea, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Hi.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So, Phebe, just a quick question. I know you don't want to get into much detail on 2017. But if I just rewind a little bit, I think in the past, you mentioned a goal, a longer-term goal of getting to double-digit earnings growth. If we think about the margin performance that the company has done this year, how should we think \u2013 is double-digit a reasonable starting place for 2017 when we think about where earnings could go?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Wow, so much for not getting into 2017. Look, we have, as a goal, double-digit growth, but it's too soon for me to tell how 2017 plays out. So, if you want to ask another question, go ahead.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Sure. Okay. So, thank you for that. So, maybe just a", "follow-up on \u2013 in the quarter, you mentioned that sales at Gulfstream were good, right? And you have book-to-bill of 1 or over 1, depending on how you want to measure it.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Order. Yeah.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Can you give maybe a little more color on kind of regional distribution and how G650 was doing? Because as you know, there has been worry about sales of G650s, that kind of thing.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Yeah. So look, you asked about the regional distribution, and I think it's worth stepping back a moment and talking in the general and then in the specific. And let's start by talking about the market, and let me try to give you some insight into our market.", "Let's start with, for example, the Honeywell study, which measures deliveries, not orders. Deliveries in the business jet market are down, including somewhat at Gulfstream, right? So, the good and valid reasons that we have discussed during our transition, discussed with you previously during our transition from the G450 and G550 to G650 or G550 and G600 or G500 and G600. Deliveries, however, are based on retrospective orders, so 12 to 24 months previously. And for Gulfstream, from an order perspective, we have seen and continue to see nice demands.", "So, it would appear that we have been taking share from others in our space and as the G500 and G600 enter into service, we really anticipate that we will continue to take share. I've been reluctant in the past year or so to get into a share discussion because we really are about \u2013 not about share but really about profit, but it would appear that we are indeed taking share. So, I think that understanding where we are positioned today and how our position going forward will help you.", "It would also appear, specifically to your question, that we are far less dependent on the BRIC countries and on, frankly, any one particular region outside North America. And our demand, consequently, has not been as perturbative as others have seemed to be. So, it gives you a sense of I think where we stand in the market and how we see it in general.", "Now, let's dig down a little bit deeper into Gulfstream, and let's just think about this. So, from a Gulfstream perspective, again as measured by our sales pipeline and order activity with respect to demand, both are stable and sufficient to get us through to the new aircraft. I mentioned that the third quarter orders are the strongest in five years and interestingly, both our fourth quarter activity to date and the pipeline are good.", "If we think about Gulfstream more specifically, let me talk to you and just give you a little bit of color without getting into guidance. This is just color in the most broad sense. The G500 will most certainly make a contribution in 2017 and a significant one in 2018. The amount of the 2017 contribution, of course, will be dependent on the timeliness of the certification. The G600 should make a contribution in 2018 and a significant contribution in 2019.", "So, why am I confident in talking to you all about this? I'll tell you why. It's because the test program for both airplanes are going very well. The G500 is doing well in tests and should be certified and entered into service in 2017, as implied by what we've just talked about. The G600 will fly this quarter and should be certified and enter into service, and all are on schedule with some forward bias.", "Thinking about, again, just broadly, our market in Gulfstream in particular, I've always been of the view that a new plane needs 50 solid orders before the commencement of initial production to have a good start. Well, the G500 is going to exceed that number, which is quite good, especially when you consider that our sales force has been incentivized to focus on the G450 and G550. They'll now be incentivized to turn their attention towards the G500.", "So, with respect to used airplanes, some of you have been very concerned about that. Let me talk to you a little bit about where we are in the used market. We see, in the G650 market, I think there are about 19 to 20 airplanes that are up for sale, but as we deconstruct and analyze those potential aircrafts, we see maybe 12 to 14 serious sellers, dedicated sellers. So, that's well within the 10% of the 200 and some \u2013 203, actually, G650s that we've got into service, and we haven't seen any impact this quarter on our new order activity or our order activity from the used market.", "And with respect to the G550, the used market is about 7% of the 700 or so aircraft in service and so, we haven't been affected by that either. So, I notice that was rather a soliloquy, but I think your question about the distribution of our market I think was particularly just \u2013 gave me an opportunity to talk to you guys a little bit more fulsomely about the market. So, I hope that helped.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. That does. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is now open.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you. Phebe, I guess following up on that. You've talked about Gulfstream EBIT holding flat through this transition period. Is that still the official line given the pull forward on the \u2013 it sounds like a bit of a pull forward on the G500 and G600 and with the G450 going out of production?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Well, you're quite right. We said that we're going to try \u2013 we intended to keep earnings as flat as we could and the margins as high as we could during this transition period just to be a bit cyclical and frankly, so far, I think we've done a pretty good job. We'll get into 2017 after we set our production rates and got a little more clarity into the market, but that still remains our goal to give you those higher earnings as we possibly can and margins as high as we can.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Quick, quick follow-up. Marine \u2013 how much was the charge of Marine on the quarter?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "It's not material.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Thank you.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "But I wanted to mention it to you so you just at least understood what was going on.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Your line is now open.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thank you, Phebe, and congratulations. Terrific performance at Gulfstream.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Thanks, Cai.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Can you explain to me, I mean, for the deliveries that you made, which were pretty much in line where we were guessing, we had less profit by $30-million-plus. So, was it lower R&D? Was it supplier payments? Was it forfeitures? Was it better margins? What got you to a number that strong and is that likely to repeat in the fourth quarter?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Well, as we've talked before, Aerospace margins and Gulfstream, in particular, are variable quarter-over-quarter. But what you're seeing here is a result of the Gulfstream team doing a superb job taking costs out as their revenue has declined. And they've done a very good job at that in the quarter. R&D was somewhat lower. We had some timing issues at Jet Aviation. I don't anticipate that performance going forward in margins, but they will continue to do quite well.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, Phebe and Jason.", "Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.", "Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Good morning.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Just a quick one on how you think about the transition to the G500, G600 from a margin or a cost standpoint, I guess. Clearly, it's come out that you'll end the G450 production in 2018, and you just made a comment about the contribution you expect from the G500 and G600 and how that layers in, in 2017 and 2018. But with those aircraft being produced in different facilities, how should we think about the ramp down on the G450, and then eventually the G550 and how that impacts the overall cost structure of the segment? Thanks.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Okay. We've talked the last year or so about how we're going to manage the transition as we wind down the G450 and G550 and then bring on the G500 and G600. And the key there is matching the shipsets, the wings, the fuselage, the engines with the number of airplanes that we have left to sell or left to deliver. And so far, with the G150 for example, we got it spot on. We're on track to get that perfect correlation on the G450 and I expect the same thing on the G550. So, I don't anticipate any decrease in margins as a result of our failure to make that transition really comfortable and profitable.", "That said, as we, look, think about it. Any time you have a mix shift, which is what Gulfstream's going to have, right. You're going to have a mix shift as we go from older production, long-running lines, long historic learning curves, as we enter and start to produce and deliver G500s and G600s. But I will tell you, if you look at the G650 by comparison, and let's just use that as our baseline, the G650 margin performance was faster and higher than the G550 before it. So, that means it's coming down its learning curve and we're seeing gross margin expansion earlier than we had ever before.", "So, the lessons that we have learned on the G650, we are translating into how we go about the production on the G500 and G600, and that gives me an awful lot of confidence that this team is going hit the ground running. They have some margin compression as we begin to deliver, as we come down those learning curves, but our ability to come down those learning curves as we've demonstrated, I believe is going to go much, much faster. And remember too, there's a fair amount of commonality between the G500 and G600. So, I suspect that the ignition coming down, when we bring that G600 into full wave production, it's going to be pretty impressive.", "I got to tell you, I like where we are. I like where we're headed. We're moving through this transition period like I told you we were going to do, and we're in good shape for real revenue and earnings growth as we get these two new airplanes into service.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, Phebe.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Hi, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. I wanted to ask you about Combat Systems. You made a comment about the sequential growth you're going to see in the fourth quarter. And just to get to your annual guidance, you do need something like a 35% sequential increase. So, can you talk a little bit about what drives that?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Sure. So, the fourth quarter revenue increase is driven primarily by a couple of things. The Canadian, Mid East order and our AJAC programs as they move from engineering and low rate production in the third quarter into full rate production in the fourth quarter. So you're going to see some real \u2013 and by the way, we got this \u2013 Combat has this analyzed down to a fine level of detail, and we have that growth in our backlog and we are positioned on both of those programs. So those are going to drive it primarily. But recall also Combat tends to have very robust revenue growth in the fourth quarter across the portfolio, and we'll continue to see that in OTS and ELS as well as Land Systems. So, there isn't much ambiguity this late in the year with the group that really understands their products and how they're going to then begin to execute.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And if I can follow-up a question just in terms of the other Mid East Abrams order that Congress has been pushing back on. Is there a certain timeframe when", "that has to come in until it starts to affect your production?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Well, I'm not sure why you think they're pushing back on it. Frankly, they approved. If you're talking about the 100, in September, they approved the 133 M1A2 Saudi Main Battle Tank request, so that's good to go, it at contract.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "All right.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, good morning. Thank you. Phebe, I'm curious about that comment you made about the sales force having their incentives change around the new programs slipping to the G500 and G600 from the G450, G550. Can you help me understand a little bit how, first of all, when that happened? And how material of a change is this in their own lives? Is this like a significant driver of their compensation structure? Or is this a small thing in their bonus? I'm just kind of trying to think about ...", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Well look, I'm not going to get into how we pay them.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "No. I don't want to know how much money they make, but just...", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "But to give you a sense, just in general it's the case here is that the sales force is incentivized to sell whatever products we, at the moment, are focused on. And so their bonuses are a significant part of their compensation and it's up to us to give them the direction of where we're going have them focus. So, this has been a very effective sales force as I think you can see from our order activity.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Oh, sure. Did this change within the last few months? Or has this been in there for six, nine months, something like that? Or is it just like something a change effective at the end of the year?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Well, look, think about it. The G450 we've announced \u2013 that line is going to end, surprisingly, right? These replacement aircrafts, by definition, are going to replace airplanes that we're winding down and the G550 has continued to have very nice order activity. So, we're pretty confident that it's time now to move more robustly to the G500. And let me tell you, even incentivized as they were, as I mentioned in my remarks, we have sold quite a few. So, we're in pretty good shape here.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Hi, Howard.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "Hi, Phebe. I'm so inclined to ask a Gulfstream question, but you've answered them all.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Oh, go ahead.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "No. I won't do that. Instead, talk a little bit about Information Systems and Technology. I mean, you've stated that there has been a change and it's sort of taking on your growth profile. Can you elaborate a little bit upon what some of the pillars are that are behind this and how you'd like to shape it going forward?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "All right. Let me kind of take that in two parts. And let's start with our book-to-bill because I think that that reflects a lot of different moving parts. In the quarter, we had a book-to-bill about 0.8:1, and that's solid for this short-cycle business. And think about it in terms of the last eight quarters, or eight of the last 11 quarters for this group have had a 1:1 or greater book-to-bill, which is really quite exceptional in the short term for short, these highly transactional businesses.", "So, that gives us the platform for some of this ignition. And in terms of where we're focused, on our platform side, we've got a number of growth opportunities across our platform portfolio. In our ISR business and space payload markets, cyber, nuclear weapons and avionics. So, I like where they are there.", "On our IT side, we have had nice book-to-bills, and we've got a number of wins that we've had across the entirety of the portfolio. And I'll tell you, if you remember, we also have the census in there, which would be a nice cost plus award fee program for five years, and we like how that fits into our low risk cash generating portfolio.", "And then going forward, we've got an awful lot of competitions coming up, and we tend to", "announce those as we win them or we put them into our backlog. So, the diving board for our growth is there in our backlog, and because these businesses have really reduced their cost and increased their competitiveness, their book-to-bill has been wholesome for quite some time now and I expect it to be going forward.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "And then actually, I do want to, as a follow-up, you know if you do the flight hours on the G500, you're clearly ahead of schedule. Can you provide us a little bit of an indication of when you think in the first half of 2017 you might get the cert?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "I think first half is a touch ambitious, but I'll be able to give you in January a lot more clarity when we get the full certification timeline from the FAA. But I'm very confident we're going to cert in 2017.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is now open.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Hi, Doug.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "I wanted to ask on Marine, on the Ohio Class Replacement Program, because the scale of that program is so large that one would expect it to transform Electric Boat in the next decade, and particularly if we see Virginia class stay stay at two per year.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "That's my view.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "So, when you look at it \u2013 can you talk about the general trajectory of revenues and earnings over the next five years as you move toward the first ship? And also, what investments might be needed to really set Electric Boat up for the scale of operations that will ultimately be there?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "All right. Let me give you a little bit \u2013 because this is such a big program, let me give you a little bit of detail on what's going on, on the Ohio Replacement. We have had the design contract now for about five years, and we're proceeding nicely apace. As you know, we're the prime contractor for the design but not the sole contractor, and the prime contractor for the construction.", "So, our schedule is right on point to start the conception of the lead ship in 2021, and I would imagine that \u2013 well, I expect that our profile on revenue between now and 2021 where we'll really begin to see the real ignition, will be driven by a couple of things.", "One, we'll continue to have further design work on the Ohio, which will begin to ramp down as we get closer and closer. But starting perhaps in 2019 \u2013 I think we're anticipating 2019 \u2013 we're likely to see long lead production, so we can actualize the ship production construction in 2021. So, as you know, these submarine programs take \u2013 require a fair amount of long lead material in order to ensure that you stay on your construction schedule.", "So, to give you a sense of where we in the design and the component development. Well, we have proposed a detailed design and, actually, all the component development design to the Navy earlier this summer, and they'd like to give us an award by the end of the year.", "And you know what, when you think about these large nationally strategic programs, one of the most important things that we all get right is that the costs are well understood. And so one of the things that's been driving our work the last three years is a bottom-up analysis of the full cost of construction. So that'll be an important element as we work through those costs with the Navy. And once we get some clarity about the schedule and the pace, then we'll be able to have more clarity about specifics on that production ramp because it will all be very public and obvious.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "When you look at Electric Boat though, this will really change what the operations look like up there. I mean, how do you think about planning for that?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Well look, I'm sorry, you did ask that, my fault. We have begun making the investments over the last five years. The investments are primarily funded by the Navy, but we will also and have been putting some of our capital in and will continue to because, well look, we invest in lines of business that have high returns for us and good returns for us and this is one of those lines of business, and it is transformative. You put Ohio on top of Virginia and there's going be quite a lot of workload.", "So we have spent the last five years both getting our facilities in place. Our design tools are mature. the design to build tools are also very mature, and we need to get our work force because we're going to have this increase in volume. We're going to be bringing in a fair number of green labor. We have a robust education program in the trades with Rhode Island and Connecticut and that will provide us the foundation to really be able to start full rate production on schedule on the Ohio Replacement and continue on Virginia class.", "Shipbuilding, one of the competitive advantages in shipbuilding is that detailed planning is critical, and that's something that Electric Boat has excelled at for decades and has demonstrated yet again in their preparation for the Ohio. So we have detailed hiring plans, training plans, CapEx plans with the Navy, and of course our design work that we also have in lock step with the Navy on. So, this is all about preparing for success and so far, so good.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Hi.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "First one is a clarification. Phebe. I think you said that you were going to do repurchase and dividends slightly ahead of your free cash flow. I just wanted to clarify, and maybe I misunderstood. I thought previously it was the 100% of the net income and you kind of make up the difference for repurchase in cash flow.", "Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.", "So Myles, I think we've used a couple different terms in the past. We've talked about normalizing versus the lower free cash flow in these couple of years. But I think the key point is we had had a tremendous amount of cash on the balance sheet coming into the past couple years. A lot of that was timing for a number of the things that we've talked about over the past several quarters. And at this point, the key is we are committed to using that balance sheet to again sort of normalizing that free cash flow at a lower level to return that capital.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "And look, think about it this way, we've long been talking about these two years of fairly low cash flow. We need to normalize that cash flow and augment it by our balance sheet and we've done that. I think about it more like, where are we in cash flow, where are we on the balance sheet, and what resources do we have to continue to go buy shares and other investments as needed. And I think we've managed that pretty prudently. So I think about it as where our cash flow is and where are our cash deployment, where our cash flow is and what our balance sheet looks like and we've been pretty consistent.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And the conversion for 2016 you think can still get close to the 2015 conversion level at 65%.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "We'll have to see on that. But we've got plenty of powder on our balance sheet. So, there's been no material change from the guidance that we gave you back in January about our cash flow.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Think about it that way.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Good morning, Phebe, Jason.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Hi.", "Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.", "Hi.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. On the cash flow, you've had this drawdown on the advances in Combat Systems on the large contracts you talked about before. The Middle East lab and the AJACs and you've got the growth in Q4, but does that trend continue next year? Is there any concern that the Middle East customer might slow the intake of deliveries especially as those cash advances get exhausted and just given lower \u2013 the potentially scarcer resources over there?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Well, let's talk about the Middle East for a moment in general. And this particular customer, we have had a 50-year productive relationship with the Kingdom. And the vast preponderance of all of our combat programs are government-to-government and the contracts have been \u2013 products have been fully vetted and supported and these all happen to be products that the customer wants and needs. So, we have seen no indication from the end-user customer that there is concern on their part or an intent on their part to change the profile of these \u2013 of our deliveries. And look, we will \u2013 we got these large advances and we've been working those down and then we'll continue to refresh cash flow as we \u2013 from these customers as we increase deliveries. And so far, we're in pretty good shape.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. And if I could just ask one more, Phebe, maybe for Jason, but a follow-up to Doug's question. On this design release, on Columbia, Ohio Replacement that's upcoming, could \u2013 if the timing is there and the CR doesn't get in the way, could that be an inflow about $700-million-plus of design money to you by the end \u2013 before the end of the year or maybe early next year?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Look, we will work with the Navy. I haven't planned on and haven't looked at the specific timing of the cash flow with respect to that order \u2013 of that contract, because we don't have the contract signed yet. So, as soon as we get that contract, we'll have real clarity about the timing quarter-by-quarter of when we can expect the cash associated with that. But there's no way to estimate at the moment until that contract is signed.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Right. The reason I ask is because it sounds like DoD could be making some kind of decision in early November.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Well, they are. They're making their Milestone B decision, which is predicated on that submission that we just made on the components \u2013 detail design and component design. So, that is a trigger. But once that decision is made, then you got a good contract, right?", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Fair enough. Fair enough. Thank you.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "And Chelsea, I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Certainly. And our last question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is now open.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey. Good morning. Phebe, just a quick clarification. I want to make sure I heard you correctly. You said you have got 50 orders on the G500?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "No. What I said was that it has been my experience that you \u2013 to have a successful launch of a new airplane, you need to have 50 orders before entry into service and we on our way to exceed that amount.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful.", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "That helps?", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, it does. Thank you very much. And then, looking out to 2018, you suggested that the G500 will contribute in that year and then meaningfully \u2013 excuse me, in 2017 and meaningfully in 2018. You've also suggested in the past that you've got some delivery slots that are available on the G650 out there in the second quarter of 2018. Just wondering if you could update us on that.", "And what I'm trying to figure out here is whether you're going have enough in the orders on the G650 to hold production flat out there in 2018? Or if the plan here is to begin taking production rates down on that and having any hole from an EBIT perspective that gets created by the G650 decline and then filled in by the G500 and that's kind of the key to the recipe of holding EBIT flat through these transitions?", "Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.", "Yeah. So look, what we said all along is that \u2013 we use that wonderful word feather \u2013 we'll feather in additional G650s. But that production rate during the transition is not sustainable nor healthy and that we would never intend to keep that production rate up. What we aim for is to keep our backlog on G650s on any of our programs, particularly that one, between 18 months and two years and we're now at two years again.", "So, as we think about that, I mean, that order book is there for the two \u2013 we've got now two years next available, so that ought to give you a little bit of color on how we intend to think through as we set our deliveries and our delivery schedule. But I have not set, and we haven't set until later \u2013 late November or mid-November our production schedule for next year. So, on the fourth quarter call, I'll give you copious detail what we plan on", "doing. Okay?", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great.

I think we will get started with the next session. I am Itay Michaeli, Citi\u2019s auto analyst. And I am very pleased to have GM back with us for the 2016 Citi Industrials Conference. From GM, we are pleased to have John Stapleton to my right. He is the CFO of North America. And to his right is Steve Dork from Investor Relations. John will make a presentation and we will have some time for Q&A. Just two quick housekeeping items, if you do like to ask a question, just please un-mute and un-mute your microphones in front of you. And for those who need Citi\u2019s legal disclosures, we have them upfront as well.", "So with that, we are very pleased to have GM back with us at the conference. And John, I will turn it over to you.", "John Stapleton", "Okay. Thank you, Itay. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about General Motors North American operations. Before I get into the pitch, I would like to show a video. So, let\u2019s shoot the video. We just launched this last week.", "It\u2019s a good video. No go? Okay, so let me describe the video. So last week, on Wednesday, we launched a head-to-head video, our Silverado versus the Ford F150. And in the video, we highlighted the fact \u2013 we looked at utilizing the bed of the truck. So, we \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you guys have been able to see it, but we dumped some bricks into the F150. We dumped some bricks into the Chevy Silverado. The F150 has an aluminum bed. The Silverado has a high-strength steel bed. And the bottom line is if you look at the video, we like having steel in the bed. We believe you need to have steel in the bed for the functionality. It takes a beating. The aluminum, actually, when you dumped the bricks as well as pushing a toolbox into the bed, you actually pierce the metal. So, it\u2019s aggressive. We actually went out with it last week. You can \u2013 there is actually pierce and actually splits in the metal on the Ford. The Chevy Silverado just had dents. That went out on Wednesday. On Thursday, we actually got notification from Google, who owns YouTube that was the number one watched video in the United States last Thursday. So, it was very, very powerful. We have both an English version and a Spanish version. As of Monday, we had 36 million views of this video, so very powerful. If you get a chance, go look at it. I will talk about our marketing here in just a second.", "Itay Michaeli", "We can all play it on our iPads, if you want.", "John Stapleton", "No, the screen is frozen.", "Itay Michaeli", "There we go.", "John Stapleton", "Okay. Today\u2019s presentation is going to be governed by the following forward-looking statements. Next slide, there you go. Okay, before I get into North America, I have to talk about GM as a compelling investment opportunity. From an earnings growth perspective, North America we were able to achieve 10% margins in 2015 one year ahead of schedule. We are growing our adjacent business like our after-sales business, like our OnStar business. They are very profitable. GME is on the cusp of profitability. And China continues to grow.", "Our disciplined capital allocation, we are reinvesting in the business at 20% return on invested capital. And we are trying to maintain a target cash balance of $20 billion returning excess to the shareholders. Relative to robust downside protection, in 2007, our breakeven in North America was 16 million units. Today, it\u2019s between 10 million and 11 million units. We have been able to take a lot of fixed cost out. We have compressed a lot of manufacturing. We have been able to get rid of a lot of legacy costs like retiree healthcare. And now we are on the DC pension plans. So, it\u2019s \u2013 we are much stronger than where we are at before the last recession.", "Okay. The agenda, I will talk about North American margins then I will shift on to our products and brands and then I will finish off with our adjacent sales. Okay. So, I have showed this chart before. Chuck Stevens, our CFO, has shown this chart many times. This is North America margins. We have achieved 10% margins in 2015. In 2016, our goal is again to sustain the 10% margin while we invest in the future. We do have to cover costs such as launches, engineering and advertising of our new product.", "In subsequent slides, I will cover the new models and adjacent sales, but just a quick couple of comments on the three bullets below. So, material cost optimization, Chuck Stevens has guided in the past that we will achieve a $2 billion material cost reduction year-over-year for carryover material and logistics. I mean, that\u2019s strong. That\u2019s a couple of years in a row where we have had a couple of billion dollars of material cost. This is carryover material. How are we doing this? We are actually bringing the suppliers in early in the process. We are giving them multi lifecycles of product to get the lowest possible cost and the most innovation. We are reducing build combinations, taking complexity out, so that you have a larger scale of buy.", "The second bullet there, that\u2019s not highlighted, is the operational excellence. We have a team of \u2013 that we have trained there like Six Sigma OpEx leaders, they actually sponsor projects throughout the company to take cost out. It\u2019s embedded in the company. We review it at the senior leader level twice a month. It\u2019s actually harvesting great results. And finally, GMF. So North America, we don\u2019t show the GMF profit, but it does help our results. If you look, we are full captive now on our lease. When you have lease customers coming back at the end of the cycle, we see strong loyalty with a full captive to the 4 to 5 points of loyalty. In addition, it\u2019s great to have a captive as you walk into some type of downturn so you know that you actually have financing for sales.", "Okay. Let\u2019s get into North America a little bit here. Our U.S. retail sales strategy, the first bullet, not all shares created equal. We have been public. We are trying to reduce our rental volumes, significantly reduce our rental volume. 2015 to 2014, we pulled out 50,000 units. \u201816 to \u201815, our goal is to pull another 80,000 units out, 130,000 units out of the system in just 2 years. 4 years ago, our rental volume as a percent of total volume was 17%. In the calendar year-to-date timeframe this year, we are running at 11%, so a strong reduction. And industry today is running at 14%, which is a bit high, but we are actually below industry. So, the result of the strategy should hopefully improve our brand health. We need to see better residuals and we will see hopefully better loyalty, which again is going to be key as you walk into a future downturn. Loyal OEMs, we saw the OEMs with a higher loyalty actually had higher share. And again, we are doing everything in our power to get loyalty.", "The second bullet, retail share, we have increased about 50 bps, strong full-size pickup trucks, strong full-size SUV and midsize cars. Our incentive spend has actually been quite disciplined. In Q2, our incentive as a percent of ATP, average transaction price, is about 10.2%. Industry is at 10.6%. We are below industry. Calendar year-to-date, GM North America or U.S. were at 11%. The industry is at 10.9%. So, we are right on the industry and that assumes a rather big sell-down of our old Chevy Malibu and Chevy Cruze in the beginning of the year.", "Relative to industry leading marketing, we have \u2013 I wish I could have shown you the video. We have strong, passionate marketing out there. Malibu started it. It\u2019s reinforced that Chevrolet is not just the truck brand, it\u2019s actually a great car brand. In the past 2 years, Chevy has garnered 44 awards, including 3 Cannes Lions award, which in my understanding is the most prestigious award in the global marketing world. So, what you will see in subsequent slides is how this marketing is translated to results.", "Okay, new models. So, we are extremely pleased with the Malibu to-date. The first bullet, our retail segment share has moved. We were eighth in the segment. We are now #4. We have created a much stronger cross-shop dynamic. And a couple of examples. So, Camry, the old Malibu was 36th in consideration relative to a Camry buyer. We have actually moved from 36 to number two, Altima from 12 to one and Ford fusion, from 12 to four, so strong cross shopping performance that we just have not seen in the past for Malibu. Our build combinations, we have moved from 46 to 22, again a huge reduction. What we are trying to do is not only do you get the scale to buy, you do get to the lower complexity, but you make it easier for the customers to order the vehicle, you make it easier for the dealers to order the vehicle. Our goal is to have high turning, high volume vehicles at the dealer. And hopefully this translates to again, better loyalty and reduce sales allowances.", "The Cruze, we are still launching. We are building inventory right now. We have a 37-day supply, very, very low days supply. We are going to launch a new hatch and we have a diesel coming, so more to come. We have gained one point of share as we look at it from April to May. And we are currently launching the CT6, the XT5, Acadia, Envision and Bolt, more to come on that. The Bolt we will actually launch later in the year. And I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t say, on the Malibu and the Cruze, we have been public relative to a $1,500 variable profit improvement, old and new. That is still the plan for both the cars.", "Okay. Chevrolet, we are working very hard to improve the Chevy brand. And I think it\u2019s paying off. We think it\u2019s paying off. I would just jump right to the table. If you look at our retail share, we have increased 50 bps and that\u2019s the same as General Motors U.S. in the prior slide. So it\u2019s been dominated by Chevrolet, the fastest growing full line brand in the industry. Now the next four metrics are more brand health metrics; net momentum, conquest, loyalty and opinion. And if you look at the metrics, we have increased net momentum by 17 points. And what is net momentum, we go out to customers and ask the question, would you say the brand is moving in a positive direction or a negative direction and there is five selections, two negatives, a neutral and two positives. And the way that it works is, the positives less the negatives equal the score that's on the screen of 34. And for us to essentially double our net momentum score is just huge.", "We have ways to go the Toyotas and the Hondas are in the 40 \u2013 low-40, so we have got a little bit more work to do, but again strong progress. Conquest, we have increased our conquest share, up 0.8 points and we are the only brand to grow share in \u201816. Loyalty and I will continue to hit on loyalty as I go through the pitch. We are up 1.4 points, it\u2019s the highest in 12 years. And we got to have the loyalty, not only is it to increase our revenue, our profit, but also prepares us to hopefully maintain our gross share in a future downturn. And then excellent opinion, we have raised opinion up by 5 points and we have closed the gap to Ford. Again, more work to do against Toyota, but significant progress for Chevrolet.", "Okay. Trucks, if you \u2013 no other OEM can offer what we are offering right now with the midsize pickup, a large pickup, both light and heavy and then a large SUV. If you look at the table, we have industry leading ATPs, we continued to grow ATPs. And we are maintaining or even growing market share in some of the segments, which is strong. We feel lower for longer gas prices and weak housing starts will support a sustained truck segment in the foreseeable future. In addition, the car parc age, it\u2019s old. And I will go through a couple of numbers on another slide. We feel there is a great opportunity here to continue to sell deep in trucks, so a couple of numbers here. So the mid-pickup, you will see we essentially a couple \u2013 3 years ago, we were at zero segment share. Now we are up to 34. The Colorado\u2019s top conquesting model is the Ford F150, it\u2019s interesting. So it\u2019s a midsize truck. Our number one conquesting model for Colorado is the F150. We are offering a diesel engine now that gives 31 miles per gallon, so an extremely competitive product. We are doing very, very well. And we have very low days supply, 46 days supply right now in the field.", "Large pickup, in May, Silverado and Sierra had the highest ATP on record. And you can see, relative to the competition we are actually slightly above from an ATP perspective. We have held share. There is a lot of articles about GM\u2019s losing share. We have held share in a calendar year-to-date basis. And then if you look at what we are doing with special editions, special edition is a unique model that will offer not a ton of volume, but we are \u2013 it keeps the showroom fresh. It attracts customers that normally wouldn\u2019t come to a Chevy dealer or a GMC dealer. They are younger buyer. They are more affluent. They have a higher education level. Our volume turns in a third of the time of regular pickup trucks, the special models like the Midnight Edition, Blackout Edition. We have a special ops edition. We have a Realtree edition, so strong performance in the large pickup. And finally large SUV, if you look at the data there, we have been very fortunate to grow share six points, retail share and our ATPs are extremely strong, well above the competition.", "Okay. We will shift again to trucks but this is Denali, so a brand within a brand of GMC. Denali represents 25% of our volume at GMC, 35% of our profit. We all sell Lincoln, Land Rover, Volvo and Porsche, again a brand within a brand. And we are going to launch the new Denali Canyon this fall. So the Denali customer is much more affluent than other customers buying our vehicles. The Denali customer has average household income of about $237,000. The Tahoe Yukon is about $147,000. And a typical GM customer on average is $87,000 household income. So a high household income, which is great, because actually we have a very strong loyalty to the Denali brand, which is great. As I have said as we walk into potential future downturn down the road, they have the means to actually continue to purchase product. And then also, we have a lower incentive spend on Denali than the rest of the models.", "Okay. Crossovers, if you look at our crossover portfolio, we do have an aging portfolio. On average, if you look at our Equinox Terrain, if you look at our Traverse, you look at our Enclave, they are 6 years to 8 years old. So again, we need to get the new product out there. We do have some new product, it\u2019s the XT5. For Cadillac, we have a new slightly smaller Arcadia that we are now just launching. The Envision for Buick is just now launching. So we do have some new products, but a lot of the mainstream compact SUV volume is still quite old. Compact SUV is the number one segment in the United States and Canada. So that\u2019s the Equinox and the Terrain. It\u2019s like a 3 million unit segment. It is now bigger than midsize car segments and compact car segments. So if you look at the data, we have shed a little bit of share, I relate that to you again some of the age of our portfolio. But given that age, a refresh can\u2019t be too far away. And I will just leave it at that. We have been able to hold ATP as well.", "Okay. A couple of slides on adjacent businesses, so after-sales, if \u2013 I will just try to clear the slide. The left side of the slide would be the car parc at General Motors in millions of units. So the blue bars. The right side is our revenue. And if you look at the slide, historically speaking, our car parc has been shrinking. But the good news is, if there is good news in this, is that we have been increasing our revenue as \u2013 even in the facing a slowing or a decreasing car parc. How are we doing it, initiatives, we are working very hard to get customer retention in the service line. I will talk a little bit about that relative to OnStar and how that\u2019s helping us. Next-day repair, having parts as the customer walks into the showroom with an issue, the goal is to get the parts to the dealer the next day, so they have a great experience at the dealer and then strategic pricing.", "Now prospectively, if you look at \u201816 and beyond, the car parc is actually starting to grow. So we will take full advantage of that. And I would \u2013 my expectation is the slope of that revenue line should actually start to increase with an increased car parc, so a couple of facts for you relative to the car parc. And these facts in my opinion, support strong after-sales revenue as well as strong new car sales on a go-forward basis. The average U.S. car parc is 11.5 years old. So the average car out there burning gas today, 11.5 years old. At General Motors, our car parc is 14.2 years old. So it\u2019s older, again more of an opportunity, in my opinion, to convert some of those vehicles back to a new vehicle hopefully soon. The full-size pickup truck car parc is 11.9 years old, so a little older than the average. The General Motors\u2019 version of full-size pickup truck car parc were 12.6 years old, again an opportunity for us to convert those driving older vehicles to a new vehicle in short order.", "Almost 20% of our pickup car parc is 20 years old. So that\u2019s a big number. And again, we are doing everything in our power with CRM, with OnStar to try to get these customers back into the showroom and convert them into a new. But until they do that, we are going to sell them as many after-sales parts as we can. And then one final comment relative to after-sales. So we are growing revenue. We are growing profit. It\u2019s a very strong business. I call after-sales the small full-size truck of North America. It doesn\u2019t have the dollars billions in revenue. But from a margin perspective, it\u2019s the same type of margin as a full-size truck. So, we are doing everything in our power to grow this business and to take care of the customer. In addition, the after-sales business is not as susceptible to industry fluctuations bored down. And as you know, we ultimately head into a downturn down the road. Strong after-sales business will actually be more steady and again having that high full-size truck margin business available to us in the downturn is very attractive.", "Okay, OnStar, another adjacent business opportunity. 1.2 billion customer requests responded to in the last 20 years. We have \u2013 there is a lot of OEMs that are connecting their vehicle, but I don\u2019t think any OEM can claim the history that we have relative to how we have already been connected for many, many, many years. We have a lot of history. We have a lot of knowledge. We have had a lot of interactions with the customers, 12 million connected vehicles around the world by year end. We are going to be 7x more 4G/LTE than the rest of the industry combined. By 2020, three quarters of our sales should be connected.", "So, a couple of more facts for you. Last year, we have had 133 million interactions with customers through OnStar. We are starting to see this interaction double every single year. And we have had over 50 million interactions in the first quarter alone. So, think about this connection to the customer, connection to the car and potential to up-sell, up-sell products like more subscriptions, some B2B sales. We can sell more 4G Wi-Fi, e-commerce. So, it\u2019s a great opportunity to take care of the customer, a great opportunity to promote our vehicles, but also a good opportunity for us to drive more revenue and ultimately profit.", "Other revenue opportunities, the service lane work. So, you get a notification you need an oil change. You get a notification that your pressure is low in your tires. We have certain preventative diagnostics on parts of the vehicle that can say, hey, it looks like your water pump may go in the future. And it\u2019s trying to get vehicles \u2013 sending them a notice, getting the customer into the showroom, get it fixed before it\u2019s a walk home situation. So, it\u2019s very, very powerful. In addition, we can use the pipe, the 4G pipe for over-the-air fixes, over-the-air warranty fixes like a re-flash of the electronics. It\u2019s very powerful what you can do now with all the electronics in the car and 4G.", "Last slide, okay, summing it all up. North America, we remain focused to sustain the 10% margin and we will continue to invest in the brands. We do have a lot of launches. We are supporting the launches with marketing. We are supporting the launches with engineering. We do remain committed to our retail sales strategy and that\u2019s a huge reduction in our rental volumes and we are going to continue to do that to promote our brand health. And finally, we will continue to invest in the brands and the goal is to offset that investment with other efficiencies such as the material cost reduction that I mentioned, the carryover material costs and logistics savings to help pave for that. In addition, we are obviously trying to bring as much cost out of SG&A, manufacturing. I mean, we are actually pretty good at taking cost out of the system.", "So with that, I will turn it over to you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Q - Itay Michaeli", "Great. Thank you very much, John. So, we have got about 15 or so minutes for Q&A. Maybe I will just kick it off I think with a question lot of people are probably asking these days. You delivered 10% margins last year. It seems like that\u2019s still the target for this year. When you look at the last few months, people have pointed to kind of so, so retail SAR some weakness in used pricing, the main objects for GM in particular were of discussion. As we kind of look at the whole market today, both the industry and to what GM is doing, how do you feel about that 10% margin target this year relative to maybe where \u2013 what you felt in January? What\u2019s going right? What\u2019s going less right, more right in kind of whole update on the field?", "John Stapleton", "We still remain confident that \u2013 on the 10% margin in 2016. Yes, we have seen a little bit of weakness in retail and the retail SAR \u2013 the fleet SAR is actually going up. But that being said, what are we seeing out there? We are \u2013 we still have strong truck sales, strong truck demand. Our day supply is lean. It\u2019s very good. Full size SUVs are still moving. Even our older compact SUV, the Equinox and Terrain, while it is roughly 7, 8 years old, our day supply is extremely low. We are still moving a lot of volume right now. So, I \u2013 we still feel very strong. I also feel that the after-sales business that I mentioned and the OnStar business, it\u2019s just the two hidden gems that help contribute where maybe we fall down a bit on the vehicle side. We are starting to see increased revenue on, let\u2019s say, after-sales, to help offset some of that. So, we still feel very good.", "Itay Michaeli", "Maybe I will sneak one more and you mentioned that the pickup truck market, a market we have done a lot of work on ourselves. And hoping you just comment on what you are seeing in terms of industry supply demand. Our work has shown that there is an imbalance in terms of capacity having come out over many years, while the installed base of pickup trucks, where the parc has actually grown. You shared some statistics as well on the average age. Are you seeing that tight supply demand imbalance that was caused by the capacity cuts years ago? And is that something that two might give you confidence perhaps in terms of sustaining margins in a plateaued SAR?", "John Stapleton", "Yes. So, I get a lot of questions about full-size pickup truck capacity. And as you say, we have removed quite a bit of capacity in the 2009, 2010 timeframe. But that being said, if you look at \u2013 what we are trying to do is rather than put brick-and-mortar in and large installments of capital or capacity we are tweaking the system. So, let\u2019s tweak it to get another 1 or 2 jobs per hour in a plant, not have to spend any capital. Let\u2019s negotiate with the union to try to work more Saturdays, if at all possible, over and above what a union contract would provide for. And in some cases, we can actually ask for volunteer work even on Sundays. So, we are doing unique things like that to get more volume. If you look at 2015 versus \u201814, we have been running very, very hard on pickups in both years. Yet \u201815, excluding midsize trucks were up \u2013 we produced 7% more. If you look at 2016 calendar year-to-date versus 2015 calendar year-to-date, again, we produced another 7% more. So, we are finding ways to get more production, unique ways, again dialing it up a little bit relative to line rates as well as union deals. And I think that we have been very smart, because we are running at a very, very high industry right now to put the capacity, to put the capital in. Right now, I just don\u2019t know if it makes sense. And if you look \u2013 if you remember the market share slide, we have been maintaining market share. So, it\u2019s \u2013 we feel we are in a good place right now. Add to it, we actually have a midsize pickup truck, so plus 140,000 units in the pickup truck world that had nothing to do with the full-size and that\u2019s all incremental volume versus three years ago.", "Itay Michaeli", "I would like to ask you a structural question for the industry over the next 5 years. But there are two emerging trends though are picking up steam, one is autonomous and second is the shared economy. And some argue that this will really restructure the entire industry and the amount of cars we put into the market where instead of two cars per household, we are going to have fewer than that as we shared those resources and we will need fewer drivers, because they have autonomous, semiautonomous technologies to do it for us. How do you think that will change the business? You are talking about 11 million cars to breakeven. Is this a realistic number that will see the industry cut by half, because we just share cars instead of drive our own?", "John Stapleton", "So we have guided in the past that we feel the industry in the United States will be in the mid 17s into the foreseeable future. Why? Because of the housing starts just haven\u2019t taken off as well as we think lower for longer gas prices. So, that\u2019s going to help. So, let\u2019s just assume you are at a mid-17 industry, which again is really strong. So, how would autonomous impact us? It\u2019s going to take a while. First of all, you got to figure out a way to make this safe before people are going to sit in an autonomous car. And so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s within the next 4 years, the next 10 years, but there is a lot of work to do to make it safe. Will it replace vehicles? In particular for General Motors North America, a lot of the autonomous we would see in urban city areas. If you look at our market share, where we are the weakest, it\u2019s in the big city areas. So, in one aspect, I could view this as an opportunity for General Motors to grow our market share in the cities with autonomous vehicles. I think we have been public that we currently have a Bolt EV autonomous vehicle running around in San Francisco right now. So I don\u2019t know if I view it as a huge negative in many ways in big cities for General Motors just because we are \u2013 we under index versus our market share nationally. Kind of contrary, maybe that\u2019s an opportunity for us. But it\u2019s just too early to tell relatively to replacements. We do feel though that the car sharing is going to significantly increase in the future and that\u2019s hence some of our investments with Lyft and Cruze.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just to follow-up on that, what does car sharing mean to your OE sales, fewer cars each time, but you replace them more often because they drive more?", "John Stapleton", "Well, I mean from a \u2013 we have what we call the Maven business. So we actually have cars, car sharing, residential car sharing like in apartment complexes. We have city car sharing that you can actually just rent the Chevy Cruze for a while and then we have Express Drive, which is Lyft. They go and they get the vehicle, they can run it for a day, a week, a month and then just drive people around. We feel that that business is just starting, but the actual vehicles that you move into that dynamic are not necessarily new vehicles. We take them off rental. We could use a 2-year lease vehicle. So I have already booked the sale. I have already captured the revenue and the profit. Now the vehicle is being driven in another segment, another capacity. And then they go into this car sharing. So it\u2019s almost \u2013 I get a double benefit in some ways. That\u2019s how we are running the Maven business right now.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you for taking the question. Just some maintenance questions, quickly. The $2 billion material cost reduction, what\u2019s the timeframe on that, also what are your pricing assumptions within the breakeven level of 10 million to 11 million SAR. And then do you have an update for the European emissions issues right now I believe within Opel? And then lastly, with Moody\u2019s, when was your last conversation with them and what are your expectations for the upgrade timing?", "John Stapleton", "Okay. What was...", "Itay Michaeli", "That\u2019s four in one. What was the first one again?", "Unidentified Analyst", "The timing for the $2 billion material cost reduction, what was the timeframe?", "John Stapleton", "Okay. $2 billion carryover material costs and logistics 2016 versus 2015, so calendar year. Relative to pricing and the SAR, in a lower SAR environment, was that your question?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes. What are your pricing assumptions baked into that, I am assuming you are not holding pricing flat on a breakeven at 10 to 11?", "John Stapleton", "No. In a dramatic, 10 to 11, which is where we were back in the 2009 timeframe, I just don\u2019t know if we will ever see something like that in the near future. But our pricing assumptions, we definitely have to increase our incentive spend. I am not going to give you the exact number, it\u2019s nowhere near though what happened back in the \u201809 timeframe. Why, if you look at the pins \u2013 if look at incentive as a percent of ATP back in 2009, at General Motors, our full size truck incentive spend was like 19% and our cars and SUVs were very high as well. But since then, we have taken out so much install capacity that it\u2019s not going to be as big of an impact. I think our competitors have also reduced their install capacity as well. So will we take more have to increase incentives, yes, there is no doubt. But it won\u2019t be to the level that what you saw back in the \u201809 timeframe. If you think about what we have been able to take out of the system, we have taken two full-size pickup truck plants out from 2009 to today, two big, 300-plus thousand full-size truck plants out and one full-size SUV plant out, Arlington \u2013 I am sorry, Janesville in Wisconsin. So those are just some examples of why we think it won\u2019t be as bad. But again, we are not \u2013 we are also realistic. And we would have to take some incentives. Relative to your third question on Europe, I \u2013 my focus is more North America. I don\u2019t to get involved with Europe as much, especially on the diesel discussion. And I am not involved in the discussions with Moody\u2019s, so I can\u2019t answer that question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Maybe I will sneak one in, John. So after-sales, interesting topic, I think at the Investor Day last year, Dan Ammann sort of sized up the profit contribution to the whole company, I think something in the billions, can you maybe size that for North America, give us some of the clue there perhaps on that size and then ultimately where that can go order of magnitude in the next few years as well as I think some of the opportunities longer term with connectivity to maybe capture parts of the aftermarket in 7-year-old and older vehicles you might not be capturing as much today?", "John Stapleton", "Okay. Connectivity, so from an after-sales perspective, I mean Dan has mentioned profitability, increasing profitability. And I think he did use the word billions. North America, we are the biggest in General Motors. So I don\u2019t know if \u2013 I can\u2019t tell you the exact number, but we are a big contributor to his billions number. We have a strong focus right now on after-sales. Again, it\u2019s full-size truck margin like profitability. And with the connectivity in the car and with our relationships with the dealers, we think that there is even more opportunity for us to drive more revenue into the future. So our long-term outlook is more revenue and more profit. We are taking lessons learned from mature markets like North America and Europe and we are actually installing some of those lessons learned in China, where we have another huge opportunity on the after-sales side, huge opportunity. Relative to connectivity and what was the question on service?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes. Just in terms of the opportunities that kind of big data and real-time analysts can give you to capture new parts of the aftermarket where you may be under-indexed today?", "John Stapleton", "So just relative to like OnStar, we will put the module in virtually 100% of our vehicles in North America. And so a customer, after the free trial period may not elect to do it. But if he or she sells the vehicle to another person, they may and we do market to that. We have serum activities that because it\u2019s actually installed in the vehicle already, it\u2019s pretty much we just have to flip a switch. So that\u2019s again another opportunity for us to activate more subscriptions out in the marketplace. And we do, do that. We definitely go after a 2 year or 3 year or a 4-year-old vehicle out on the road where their OnStar is not active. And we market and tailor the opportunities, whether it\u2019s crash protection, I mean there is a lot of turn by turn, there is a lot of nice advantages for OnStar.", "Itay Michaeli", "And maybe a question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Maybe I can sneak two in here real quick. First of all, can you talk a little bit about what do you think is the right size or the right percentage of sales in your daily rental business, on your slide there, you are talking about the right size of that. And also in the U.S., can you talk a little bit about your outlook for the passenger car segment, just kind of profitability going forward and how you are thinking about that market?", "John Stapleton", "Okay. So the right size of the rental business, I said that we are at 11% calendar year-to-date. The industry is at 14%. This is total rental sales as a percent of our total sales. So I would say that on average, we have seen the industry actually run somewhere 11%, 12%. 14% is a little high, so I would say what we would like to be more close to industry. In the past, we were at 17%. And that\u2019s \u2013 the plan is not to go back to that level, so more in line with industry. Relative to the passenger cars, it\u2019s extremely competitive. There is the ton of installed capacity right now in North Americas and a lot in the U.S., actually, relative to other OEMs the Hondas, the Toyotas, the Hyundais. So it\u2019s very, very difficult right now, especially with the gas prices. But that being said, I think if you look at the segment size compact car and mid-car, there is still like 4.8 million units on the United States, a huge, huge segments, they are declining, but they are still huge. So if there is ways that we can get that customer into that Malibu our Chevy Cruze, year \u2013 old or new, we will make a little bit more money, as I mentioned. But our \u2013 we will also try to up-sell. We \u2013 the person that bought that Toyota is a high likelihood that Camry, that they bought a non-GM crossover with it. We get them in to that Malibu, it\u2019s \u2013 we are going to work like crazy to get them into another General Motors Chevy product whatever, crossover. So there are other advantages, up-selling our other vehicles that will take full advantage of in this 4.8 million units segment, both compact car and mid-car.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Maybe I will sneak one last one in, John. It sounds like that you mentioned in your remarks that kind of in spite of the competitive pressures in sedans, you are still kind of comfortable, if I heard you correctly on the $1,500 variable profit improvement goal you have outlined for Cruze and Malibu, is there any \u2013 if you think about the next year crossover, I think redesigns that are expected, how should we think about the rough variable profit gap that you might look to target in those vehicles, I think you mentioned kind of 6 years to 8 years old today, is it similar to that $1,500 that you are trying to target with the Cruze and Malibu?", "John Stapleton", "Yes. I am not going to actually give a number out on the compact SUV or the mid SUV, new to old. We still hopefully will be talking about that in the future here. But given the age of the vehicle, they are \u2013 in some cases, they are relatively low cost vehicles for us. And so when we plow all the technology into the new models, it becomes more and more difficult to grow your margins. Again, I still think we can grow margins, I just \u2013 I am not going to give a number at this time.", "Itay Michaeli", "Great. I think we are out of time. So, I want to think the John, Steve\u2026", "John Stapleton", "If we can run the video.", "Itay Michaeli", "We actually have the video. So, we will run over the video after all.

This call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. At the management\u2019s remarks, there will be a question and answer period. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Jones, Vice President of Investor Relations at GM Financial. Please go ahead. ", "Steve Jones", "Thank you, Lois. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the \u2018Behind the Charts\u2019 presentation with GM Financial. Our featured speaker today is Chris Choate, Chief Financial Officer at GM Financial. Joining Chris for Q&A will be Susan Sheffield, Executive Vice President and Treasurer, and Connie Coffey, Executive Vice President, Corporate Controller, and Chief Accounting Officer. ", "Before we proceed, I must remind everyone that the topics we will discuss during this presentation will include forward-looking statements which are the company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to many assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ significantly from historical results, or from those anticipated by us. The most significant of these risks are detailed from time to time in the company's filings and reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our results may vary materially. ", "I will now turn the call over to Chris Choate. Chris? ", "Chris Choate", "Thank you, Steve, and welcome everyone this morning. We appreciate your participation. I will first touch briefly on the agenda. I am going to do a brief overview of GM, hit some key business drivers and then add some additional information before the Q&A. The purposes is to provide better insight into GM Financial as well as hopefully address some topics that we see frequently asked both at GMF and at GM. ", "So beginning with an overview of GM Financial, on Chart 5. GM Financial is General Motors\u2019 global captive finance company. We have earning assets of $64 billion with operations in 20 countries, serving 16,000 dealers worldwide. And our global footprint covers 85% of GM's worldwide sales. You see from the map of the countries in which we operate, our North American segment which includes the U.S. and Canada, and our international segment which I'll address which countries those cover in a bit. ", "As GM has pointed out in their communications over the last year or more, GM Financial is a very strategic business. We are very well positioned for profitable growth and contribution to overall enterprise value, and GM Financial\u2019s overall objective is to support GM vehicle sales while achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. ", "Turning to Chart 6, our organizational structure. GMF is consolidated with GM. Our results are adjusted in GM's financial statements to eliminate the effect of intercompany transactions. These eliminations may result in reporting differences between GM and GMF. At GMF, we do file standalone 10-Ks and 10-Qs with the SEC and we have two reporting segments: North America, again which I mentioned is U.S. and Canada, and our International segment which covers 12 countries in Europe, five countries in Latin America and our China joint venture. Really, in our international segment there are four primary countries of significance in Europe, that includes Germany and the U.K. and Latin America is Brazil and Mexico. ", "A couple of points on our China joint venture. We do own a 35% equity interest in the SAIC-GMAC joint venture in China. It is reported as equity income on the income statement and equity in net assets of non-consolidated affiliates on the balance sheet. In other words, we do not consolidate the operations of this JV into our GMF financials. This JV gives us an interest in the largest finance company and the largest auto market in the world. It generated $116 million and $36 million in equity income for the calendar year 2015 and first quarter of 2016 respectively, and it currently has earning assets north of $10 billion. ", "Turning to Chart 7. It's really a chart that describes how the GM Financial fits into General Motors' strategic priorities. Our goal is to help drive vehicle sales by offering attractive products and services with efficient delivery, very focused on enhancing customer experience and loyalty, integrating with GM initiatives to enrich customer experience, and increase retention and loyalty, support GM dealers and customers by providing financing support across economic cycles, and as I mentioned contribute to enterprise profitability. We do expect to be able to double our pre-tax income from our 2014 level which was approximately $800 million as our full captive penetration levels are achieved over time. ", "Chart 8 provides a bit of a historical look at GM Financial\u2019s evolution. Our evolution as a full captive is substantially complete and we are entering a full captive expansion phase. I won\u2019t touch on all of the activities and achievements across the period from 2010 when GM first acquired GM Financial, but we have moved into leasing into Canada, into a floor-plan product. A real key activity or a key event for GM Financial was the international acquisitions that began occurring across 2013 and were concluded with the China acquisition in early 2015. And really towards the back end of this timeline, we began to expand our presence in lease and prime lending as well, moving to full exclusivity on lease and prime lending in 2015 and early 2016. ", "Looking forward we're looking to increase our share of prime loan in North America, continue to grow our floor-plan strategically, expand our customer relationship management to enhance loyalty and retention. In our international markets where we really already have a dominant share, we're looking to hold that share and potentially expand product offerings in geographic locations over time. ", "Turning to Chart 9. Our penetration statistics both for North America and in our international operations. And what this shows is the last several March quarters of our penetration levels of GM's retail sales chains and the wholesale dealer penetration which is floor plan. So our penetration in North America, GM's retail sales is up over the last couple of years from 7% to 36% that has to do a lot with the increased leasing that we do for GM in North America. Our floor-plan penetration is up from 6% to 13.5%. ", "The other line here is GM as a percent of GMF\u2019s retail originations, so the flow of business that comes into GM Financial that's represented by GM in North America has moved from 50 or so percent up to almost 90% over the last couple of years. In North America we still do -- a decent percentage of our business is used vehicle financing, not necessarily associated with GM dealers, which is a very profitable business for us to continue engaging in. ", "In our international business, again we have really what is more like a full captive penetration presence. So our penetration in GM\u2019s retail sales in the international chain is in the mid 40%, up from a couple of years ago following the acquisition. Our wholesale dealer penetration is almost 100% as we really are fundamentally the inventory financing partner for GM and GM dealers in our international operations. And the percentage of our business that's represented by GM internationally is 86%, pretty flat over this time period. We do a small amount of used vehicle financing particularly in the U.K. ", "And our China JV penetration really has been moving steadily up since the acquisition, now at 23%, up from 16% a year ago. And something that we expect will continue to move up over time as that society and culture adapts to more financing products as a way to purchase vehicles.", "Turning to Chart 10. We have very strong operating results. There are several metrics on this page. Pretax income $815 million in \u201914 up to $840 million in 2015 and we're on track to slightly eclipse that $837 million from last year. We\u2019ve generally guided that we would be somewhere in or around $900 million for 2016. ", "Annualized net credit losses have been very stable over the last couple of years. First quarter of 2016, 1.9% for all periods reflected. In North America where we still have a decent composition of our portfolio represented by sub prime, our annualized credit losses tend to run in the mid 2% to upper 2% range. Our international losses tend to run less than 1% because it is almost exclusively a prime portfolio. ", "Origination volume here also has grown $21 billion to $38 billion year over year, $11 billion for the first quarter of 2016. We certainly would expect to see our full year originations in 2016 be well north of the $38 billion from last year. And our annualized operating expense ratio, which is important is to view how efficiently the business is being operated, has come down nicely. We expect to see that continue to come down inside of 2% as we build out the earning assets and are able to leverage our infrastructure more efficiently. ", "Moving on to the balance sheet on Chart 11. Ending earning assets continued to move up nicely from $41 billion to currently $64 billion, liquidity at $13 billion as of March quarter end. We're looking on liquidity to have roughly six months forward of available liquidity in the event we were unable to access the funding markets for any reason. ", "Tangible net worth at $7.2 billion is also up steadily over the last couple of years. As the first bullet point notes tangible net worth is net of accumulated losses on foreign exchange translations which is around $900 million at March 31, that certainly has an impact on our leverage ratio than on the bottom right, because tangible net worth is the denominator in our leverage ratio, our leverage ratio currently at 8.8 times is a measurement of earning assets divided by tangible net worth, that\u2019s calculated consistent with the support agreement which I'll have more to describe in a moment. ", "More detail on our earning assets composition on Chart 12. As the slide notes, our earning assets composition is shifting towards a full captive state. Lot of shifts occurring here all of which really are positive for overall asset quality, captive penetration and earnings stability over time. The percent of our earning assets related to financing GM new vehicles is now at 84%, up from 77% a year ago. That will continue to move up over time as we do more prime lending and leasing for GM in American markets. ", "We're also seeing a mix shift towards higher credit quality assets with the growth in prime loan and leasing in North America. The bullet point here notes that 17% of our earning assets at March 31 \u201916 were sub-prime versus 26% a year ago. That's a migration that we continue to expect to continue also. And then our earning asset expansion is shifting towards North America which is more aligned with GM\u2019s geographic sales footprint. ", "Chart 13, our funding platform. Here again a positive shift in the direction of unsecured debt which increases our unencumbered assets. Our strategy is to fund locally with flexibility to issue globally to support North American growth. We have multiple securitization platforms. Currently we have three securitization platforms in the U.S., two European platforms, all segregated by asset type and geography as I noted. We have a global senior notes platform that is a frequent issuer in the U.S., Canada and Europe. ", "We're well supported by 36 banks globally to provide us with almost $25 billion in credit facilities. As I've noted, our unsecured mix is moving in the direction of a 50:50 split which we expect to accomplish within the next couple of years. And again very active issuance profile, year to date we've issued $5.8 billion in public secured or securitization notes, and north of $6 billion in senior nodes. And you can see where we expect those to end for the year $10 billion to $13 billion in senior nodes and $11 billion to $14 billion in securitizations.", "Chart 14, we and GM are very committed to investment grade. We are targeting -- GM is targeting performance consistent with a single A ratings criteria. You can see in the table on chart 14, the ratings by rating agency, DBRS, Fitch, Moody's and S&P. You can see from the table that we are lagging an investment grade rating from Moody's which we\u2019re working very actively on to have that move up. ", "We did put in place couple years back a support agreement between GM and GMF which solidifies our position as a core component of GM's business and it strengthens our capability to support GM\u2019s strategy. The support agreement, very common between manufacturers and finance companies, doesn't require that GM own a 100% of our shares as long as we have debt securities outstanding. It establishes secured leverage limits based on net earning assets and also provide funding support for GMF if needed. ", "I noted our current leverage ratio of 8.8 times currently, the limit in the support agreement currently is 9.5, so we are inside of that leverage limit currently. The next step up would take the leverage limit to 11.5 times when our earning assets exceed $75 billion. If you recall we're currently at $64 billion. And then ultimately when we get north of $100 billion earning assets, our leverage limit would be 12 times. ", "We do expect there could be some temporary moving over that leverage limit in 2016. We don't expect to need to borrow the support bringing that back down because we would expect to be back in full compliance with that by the end of the year. And then as this note points out, the achievement of an investment grade rating is absolutely critical for our captive strategy execution because of the improvement in cost of funds and access to funding. ", "I\u2019ll now turn into the key business drivers, beginning on Chart 16. This just really lists the key business drivers at a very frankly simplistic level for our business. Obviously our earnings are driven by the size of our portfolio and the yield that we achieve on that portfolio, which has a lot to do with market conditions, GM market share, really the macroeconomic environment as well. ", "Funding costs is really what we pay on outstanding debt and fees associated with our unsecured bonds, our securitization funding and our credit facilities. Credit performance is obviously the underlying credit characteristics of the portfolio as those may be affected from time to time by economic conditions, servicing execution certainly has a role here as well. ", "Residual performance, really completely focused on the value of used vehicles in the market and then again I\u2019ve noted our operating expenses as we become larger and more efficient and able to leverage our infrastructure as the portfolio size increases. ", "Pretty simple calculation on the bottom of the chart 16. Pretax return on assets for GMF in 2015 was 1.7%, simply dividing our earnings before taxes by our average earning assets. Our ROA really varies by product level across all the different products we offer. It's obviously much more robust on sub prime than it is on prime or floor plan which has fairly narrow margins. But that is all very commensurate with the risk of the different products. ", "Now I am going to go through some of the income statement and balance sheet categories and just make a few brief comments on kind of what the income line statements and balance sheet statements have in them, focus maybe briefly on some of the drivers. ", "So beginning on Chart 18, on the income statement. Finance charge and leased vehicle income again is obviously driven by the size and the yield. It's impacted by what origination mix and credit mix we are targeting. It also includes the impact of loan subvention, including frankly how much loan subvention GM is directing into the market to support vehicle sales. ", "Our operating expenses are primarily headcount related. We don't have a significant amount of infrastructure, fixed investments we need to make outside of our IT area. As a relative percentage again, we expect to see this to moderate as economies of scale are realized. And leased vehicle expense is primarily depreciation on leased vehicles, offset by the accretion of lease subvention. Almost all leasing is subvented one form or another. So the benefit of that subvention effectively offset depreciation and runs through leased vehicle expense. ", "Of note here, we do mark our lease portfolio on a quarterly basis to try to capture any changes in the value of the underlying collateral so that we can effectively increase or decrease depreciation as necessary, so that we don't get caught with surprise and an impairment at some point in time down the road. ", "Continuing with the income statement on Chart 19. Really the key item here is our allowance \u2013 excuse me, our provision for loan losses. The provision is really a byproduct of the allowance which is on the balance sheet obviously, it\u2019s essentially a plug and reflects the expense necessary to maintain the allowance at levels adequate to cover probable losses. Our interest expense, again interest rate, fees, so on associated with our debt issuances and credit facilities, our ratings level obviously drives the amount of interest rate that we are able to issue our unsecured debt at. And then finally on the P&L, our equity income reflects earnings on our 35% equity interest in the China JV. ", "Turning to the balance sheet for GM Financial, beginning on Chart 21. Really the most critical estimate or item on our balance sheet is our allowance for loan losses. We do net that against our finance receivables. We have a lot of detail in our 10-Ks and Qs on how we determine that allowance for loan losses. We use a combination of forecasting methodologies that incorporate credit mix, volume and credit environment as well obviously as what we expect to see on recovery values on repossessed collateral. The allowance for loan losses is typically described and analyzed and discussed as a percentage of the finance receivables which again we do disclose in our periodic filings. Currently our allowance for loan losses is in a mid 2% range, we expect to see that come down as our credit mix migrates towards prime lending over time. ", "Leased vehicles, here again this reflects the amortized cost of the leased vehicles, which basically means the original cash cost less accumulated depreciation over time, all of that is net of subvention support payments. And then the related party receivables are cash payments due from GM where -- we originated a contract that had a subvention payment due and it just hadn\u2019t been made to us actually at quarter end. ", "Continuing with the balance sheet on Chart 22. Credit facilities, secured debt and unsecured debt, our warehouse credit facilities, impacted by how much debt we need to support growth. Related party payables, these are primarily for commercial finance receivables originated but not yet funded, kind of the inverse of the subvention receivables on the floor-plan side, and then here you see what I described earlier the accumulated other comprehensive income which includes foreign currency translation related to the strong dollar compared to other currencies, and does affect our calculation of tangible net worth and ultimately our leverage ratio. ", "Chart 23, a few bullet points related to subvention. We do receive subvention payments from GM at the point of origination. GM utilizes subvention as everyone on this call knows to enhance customer affordability. Payments are recognized as incentive spend by GM in the quarter in which they are made to us. ", "Subvention programs include two types: rate support for both loan and lease, and lease residual enhancement. For rate support this provides the customer with a lower interest rate on their loan or a lower money factor on their lease. The calculation of this subvention payment is based on the discounted value of the difference in the monthly payment utilizing the subvented and non-subvented rate and again we do collect that upfront at the point of loan and lease originations. ", "For loans, that amount is accreted into finance charge income over the life of the loan and for leases, the rate support results in lower depreciation over the life of the lease. Almost for all leases, we do receive some type of lease residual enhancement where GM increases the contracted residual value above ALG value at origination. This subvention payment is based on the difference between those two values. ALG as many of you probably know is a recognized industry leader in setting residual values which incorporate macro, industry and brand factors. And again that residual enhancement payment results in lower leased depreciation vehicle \u2013 leased depreciation over the life of the loan. ", "Chart 24 discusses our retail loan credit performance, already discussed it on a consolidated basis, this breaks out the credit performance between North America and International operations. The credit metrics reflect the credit quality of the underlying portfolio. North America has been favorably impacted by growth in prime originations. So loss rate \u2013 annualized loss rates in North America are down a bit year over year from 2.6% to 2.5%. There's a little bit of seasonality in credit losses particularly in sub prime where they are better in the spring and summer months, lightly weaker in the fall and winter months. And again our international operations, loss performance remains stable consistent with a predominantly prime portfolio. ", "Chart 25 focuses on the subprime industry, originations and losses. The table on the left -- the chart on the left shows total quarterly industry loan origination by credit here 680 plus being generally viewed as a prime credit, 679 viewed as a near prime or mid prime credit, and less than 620 being a subprime credit. And what the table shows is that the growth in auto -- industry auto loan originations over the last several years coming out of the economic cycle has been driven by increases in prime lending. Sub-prime lending coming out of the economic cycle had come close to that has yet to reach the level that they did prior to the economic cycle. That is really arguing against the concept of a subprime credit bubble existing in the market. ", "The monthly net credit losses on the right hand compares \u2013 these are comparisons of subprime securitizers of which GMF again is very active. These are FICOs below 620 and what this table shows is that GMF securitization data for sub prime is really outperforming our peer group. One thing that we wanted to note on this chart or call out as well is that since the acquisition of GMF by GM in September of 2010, almost six years ago, the average GMF\u2019s prime U.S. loan term has remained stable at approximately 70 months \u2013 excuse me, October 1. ", "Residual value on Chart 26. GM and GMF, really the supporting of residual values is a very joint effort between GM and GMF. GM\u2019s actions to protect residual values include, and this has been much discussed over the last several months and quarters, that the managing of fleet sales, actively managing new vehicle inventory, and maintaining disciplined incentive spending, all those have a downstream impact on residual values that GMF has to wrestle with as vehicles come off lease. ", "GMF has developed a robust end of term remarketing process. We have a private label online wholesale marketplace, GMF DealerSource provides a single source online for dealers to come and purchase pre-owned GM vehicles which are off-lease, rental vehicles and GM company cars. It's designed to support the GM dealer base while also maximizing resale values. The more vehicles that we can dispose higher up the food chain to GM dealers either at the local, regional or even national level keep those vehicles out of the wholesale auction markets where they will bring less value and therefore have a detrimental effect on residual value. ", "We're also working jointly through the use or developing alternative channels for off-lease, rental and company vehicles. One example of this is the GM factory pre-owned collection which basically allows consumer access to a subset of the vehicles that are available on the GMF DealerSource, so it\u2019s allowing consumers to come into that market and further support residual values through bidding on off-lease and rental vehicles. ", "Chart 27, expected growth. This chart is really an exact lift out of presentations that GM has made previously. It shows GMF\u2019s expected build and ending earning assets, really uses 2014 as kind of a baseline for what we collectively expect over the next several years. So in 2014 our enduring assets were $41 billion, we do expect that to more than double over time. Again we're $64 billion currently, so we are executing on this part of our growth strategy. ", "Earnings before taxes, again $800 million in 2014. I noted that we would expect to see that move up perhaps to $900 million or so in 2016. This reflects a substantial increase in expected GMF earnings by 2018, certainly something we expect to see as our full captive penetration levels are achieved. And then additional enterprise benefits are expected to be realized through an integrated customer relationship management strategy which will result in incremental sales and improved customer loyalty. ", "So Chart 28, which is sort of a wrap up chart on GM Financial\u2019s key strengths. We do have strategic interdependence with GM. We are absolutely a priority with GM to grow the business and expand our captive presence in North America, maintain our captive penetration levels internationally. We have a full suite of auto finance solutions offered in all of our markets with incremental growth opportunities, which includes additional product offerings and enhancements in some geographic expansion opportunities over time in our international markets. We have a very solid funding platform supported by investment grade ratings, along with the commitment by GM and GMF to running the business over time consistent with single A ratings criteria. Strong financial performance, balance sheet growth, liquidity, earnings, really all of our metrics are in fantastic shape. ", "And finally, we have an experienced and seasoned management team operating across business and economic cycles. ", "Finally we have a couple of charts 29 and 30 which provide information about where additional information can be available. We have a GMfinancial.com website with a very robust amount of information in our Investor Center and then obviously additional information available on SEC filings can be found referenced on Chart 30 as well as contact information for GMF and GM Investor Relations. ", "And that would conclude our prepared \u2013 my prepared remarks, I'll turn it back over to Steve Jones to kick off the Q&A. ", "Steve Jones", "Thank you, Chris. Given the team we have on the call and the focus on GMF, let me ask that you target your questions to those relating to GM Financial. Lois, would you please provide the Q&A instructions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Brian Johnson from Barclays.", "Brian Johnson ", "Yes, hi. It's Brian Johnson. A couple of questions. First, when you talk about residual setting and marking the value of the residuals to market; a couple of questions. One, just housekeeping, can you if the value of the residuals appears to be going up, can you recognize -- do you in effect lower your depreciation? Or do you have to wait till that's sold to recognize what would be a gain on sale on that particular unit? ", "Chris Choate", "We can moderate our depreciation rate to slow the depreciation on vehicles that are performing \u2013 that are called out by ALG as performing better in the wholesale markets, which is something we are seeing this calendar year relative to trucks and SUVs for example. We have moderated our depreciation rate a bit on those in order to \u2013 again the goal is to have things kind of come down to what they are really going to be worth at the end of the lease term. ", "Brian Johnson ", "And second question is how much, as you do those adjustments, forward-looking estimates are you making around that, e.g., we think there's going to be lease supply coming in or we think there perhaps will be a softer or stronger, I suppose, a softer market a year or two out versus we're just taking this month's auction results and mechanically applying those?", "Chris Choate", "No, ALG, again we use a third party to do this exercise, Brian. Certainly I just want to give a little bit of a plug and we are certainly developing as we go through time sort of our own expertise in data sets so we can make modifications to what we receive from ALG. But ALG \u2013 well, two things; first of all, ALG\u2019s upfront initial estimate of the residual which is what we initially said on our books as we\u2019re going to depreciate to, and then this quarterly marks that come in, that we tweak that initial estimate up or down really. ALG is not just taking auction values, it certainly feeds into what they are \u2013 that\u2019s a key variable that they are looking at as far as how they re-estimate or re-analyze the performance of any given vehicle trim level that are at a very granular level. But they are certainly taking into effect or taking into their calculations supply, off-lease, high SAAR lease to high trade-ins, gas pricing and the expectation of where gas pricing is going to head is another key variable. That\u2019s been frankly one of the variables \u2013 the gas pricing variable which has caused the outlook \u2013 improved outlook residual wise on trucks and SUVs to move up a bit, here in 2016, late \u201915, early \u201916. So it\u2019s not all just auction value kind of raw data what happened last month, last quarter, it takes that into effect and then lays on all these assumptions which we view as pretty conservative and appropriate at this point in time to estimate what that residual value is going to be one year, two years, three years down the road.", "Brian Johnson ", "Okay, second set of questions around sub-prime. Great chart on you versus the index. Can you maybe comment a few questions, one, strategically where do you see that used cars sub-prime support of non GM dealers going over time? Second, what are you seeing in the market in terms of competition in the new -- for that used car financing in particular some of the less well established, newer entrants or smaller players in the marketplace you don't seem to have the history of so you or Santander in this market. And then kind of how do you maintain -- and what impact is that having overall on delinquencies and performance, and then how do you kind of stay in the market and not suffer that same deterioration?", "Chris Choate", "Yes, a lot of questions here, Brian. You may have to correct me \u2013 tell me if I don\u2019t get to one of them but I think it's really kind of \u2013 ", "Brian Johnson ", "Well, one is strategically and one is just kind of short term what are you seeing in the market -- ", "Chris Choate", "Yeah, well, I'm going to answer the last and first. We at GM Financial have sort of particularly in the used vehicle financing space we have allowed our market share in that space to erode dramatically. I mean if you go back over a two or three year time period, our presence in that used vehicle financing space, as the market got a little frothier and really became too narrowly priced, not even so much credit expansion, but just we thought too narrowly priced, we just kind of have sidled off to the sideline a bit. We still have a presence but it's way down from what it was. So we think that certainly one of the reasons why we're outperforming this index that we showed in the charts is we just maintain a lot of pricing and credit discipline. And that's not to necessarily say that others didn't -- a lot of \u2013 and this is maybe partly in response to another part of your question, a lot of the newer entrants in the space and they do end up in the industry part of this index that we showed target a different level of subprime. So subprime is a word that covers a fairly broad swathe of territory generally from 620 FICO all the way down south of the 500 FICO. And so you have some of the newer entrants that necessarily have to grab on to the credit scale down lower in order to get a toehold in and have a viable value proposition to dealers. So it's not all apples and apples quite frankly. ", "Where we think \u2013 and we certainly read some commentary just in the last 48 hours on pullback in subprime and pull-back in consumer demand for subprime loans. I think it's a little more complex and kind of a blanket observation there. I mean if you look at the market data kind of month by month by month by month, there are any number of smaller and larger players that kind of mash on the gas and then pull back, it kind of ebbs and flows a decent amount. And that includes Santander and Capital One and Wells Fargo and Chase Auto Finance and us and Ally and all the other, not just the small guys, who will express through their buying habits, a little more desire for a certain credit tier, or credit mix in one month or two. And then for whatever reason sort of pull back on that a little bit two or three or four months down the road. And if you're an auto dealer, be a CarMax or somebody else you can certainly develop a view that the market is tightened just because one of your primary lenders may have had ebbed versus flowed over a certain period of time. ", "So I don't think there's going to be -- we certainly don't view at GM Financial that there's going to become a lack of credit availability and subprime. It's certainly possible and I think we would say hopeful that pricing will firm a bit in subprime in order to fatten the margins back up a bit. But I don't believe that you're going to see any dramatic tightening, I think generally credit appetite at least across the larger and more established players of which we and the others are rattled off, are those guys, we think it will be fairly stable. ", "Brian Johnson ", "And sort of related to that if, these small players you talked about, if they are pulling back a bit from the market would you and the other larger ones pick up the slack in used car? Or would there be a net sort of, and maybe it's more on the six- to eight-year-old car market, withdraw buying, lending support and therefore buying support and could that impact used-car prices and that would trickle up to sort of the three to five-year residuals? ", "Chris Choate", "Yes, well, I mean again six to eight years is sort of outside of the daily whack of much of the larger participants. So, yes, it would be the smaller guys, the newer guys that maybe are in that market, that \u2013 at the margin I suppose could have some input, another input to where used vehicle pricing is headed, again we and most others expect that to continue to moderate. But I would say more strategically important to GM Financial is as the market firms a bit more, pricing wise availability wise, whatever on the two to four year old vehicles, we again have kind of sat on the sidelines a bit, and view ourselves as having potentially some dry powder to move back in, and increase our market share in a stabilizing market. Again our main mandate is to support GM and fund GM new vehicles and leases, but this is a very profitable area \u2013 a diminishing part of our business but a very profitable part of our business that we would look again to recapitalize on in a market where some of these more disruptive newer guys kind of maybe fade away or some of the larger participants maybe in a rising rate environment we all kind of back up and raise rates so we can generate better returns. ", "Brian Johnson ", "So strategically it is a business that you will be staying in opportunistically? ", "Chris Choate", "Absolutely. Absent some calamity in the funding markets that make it incrementally more difficult and we have to allocate -- if we have to choose obviously we're going to choose to support GM new but as long as the funding markets are viable for us to be in this business we would expect to stay and GM absolutely endorses that. ", "Brian Johnson ", "Okay, and final question, again around business mix. Your floor plan penetration is obviously less than your subvented penetration because the dealers are the ones who have to be sold on you as a floorplan lender. We've often heard through the downturns that the wholesale support of the dealers has been [Indiscernible] helping the auto company through the downturn. So how are you thinking about your current penetration? Is that in terms of net interest margin, obviously losses are low, and ROA good business to go after? Or are you just sitting there saying okay, look, it is what it is now and should my -- should the large bank competitors who are providing floorplan now tail off as they are often getting downturns their commitment to dealers or going to be ready and willing to write that? Or is it something where you have shoe leather on the ground trying to drum that up? ", "Chris Choate", "It really is a combination. I mean we -- the returns in this business are abnormally low right now because of pricing competition really from everyone. We obviously are dealing with a large legacy provider of floorplan in this product channel as well. We are actively looking to grow the business, we're attempting to stay as price disciplined as possible so that we stay right side up and generate profits from the business. We're very -- we're okay with where we are now as far as having scale and size and ability to capitalize if and when the next downturn comes. So again it's kind of a combination, but absolutely agree with your last premise that there may need to be a bit more of a catalyst for us to increase our penetration from kind of the mid teens upwards to 20% or even north of that over time. And that maybe the economic cycle that we have to see to have that happen. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.", "Samik Chatterjee ", "Hi, this is Samik on behalf of Ryan. I had a couple of questions. The first one I really wanted your views on the automotive finance industry in China. On slide 9 you have indicated that your penetration there has increased year over year. So I sort of wanted a view on how you are placed relative to the other global JVs there and how do you see also [indiscernible] index there and what do you see in terms of potential of that market, like where do you see retail penetration sort of maturing for you guys there in that market? ", "Chris Choate", "When we first started looking at acquiring the interest in this JV, the penetration of the JV in that SGM sales channel was extraordinarily low, I\u2019d say, it was in the low teens type range, I want to say 9% to 12%, somewhere, when we first started doing diligence on this three years ago. Now it's in the mid 20% range, it\u2019s moved up quite a bit really just over the last twelve months or so. There's more subvention support being put into the market by the manufacturer which is a JV as well in China. GM and their Chinese manufacturing partner which are effectively the two partners that own the financing JV as well. So subvention has come more into the market to support the financing products which has made them relatively more attractive to Chinese consumers. My understanding and I don't have a real hard data on this but my understanding is that other financing providers, captives in the Chinese market have penetration levels that are there maybe a little bit north of 30%, and we\u2019re certainly moving in that direction and have taken some nice steps. ", "I don't think you'd find -- again I can't speak with to any of the luxury brands, again maybe some of the lower mid vehicles like GM and all, again I am not sure what Mercedes and all, they have as far as penetration there. But I think we still have some opportunity to move up from the mid twenty's into the 30% range, maybe even 40% over time. That part of it is cultural, again part of it is just GM and the Chinese JV partner and the management team, they are supporting the product and making consumers aware of it and a cultural assimilation of the product over time as well. ", "Samik Chatterjee ", "And just a small follow-up on the China business here. Are you able to comment on the return on assets in the China process maybe like North America where do we stand with some of the back of the envelope math I was doing shows a big difference between the ROAs there. ", "Chris Choate", "Yes I mean it's a very very prime book of business in China. So the returns \u2013 if you just did an asset level return there you\u2019d end up with something that much more approaches what we look at it at prime in the US. Pricing is -- net interest margins are probably better in China than they are in the North American market for any and all financing products, you're going to end up a little bit above, maybe in North American world. But again losses in the Chinese portfolio are less than 50 basis points right now. So the return profile is going to be fairly commensurate with that as well. ", "Samik Chatterjee ", "Okay, and can you comment on the opportunity of growth that you have in international outside China because it looks like some of your penetration metrics there are pretty full already. So I think you had mentioned something about product offerings being expanded. Can you sort of give us more details on that?", "Chris Choate", "Well, we are working actively to develop a bit more of a leasing presence in Germany, for example, where we\u2019ve introduced leasing product roughly a year ago, it's doing reasonably well. Mexico, similarly has a very nascent leasing product in it. There are some geographic opportunities. We added Peru in Latin America last year. We're looking at a handful of countries, smaller countries, they\u2019re not going to be massive \u2013 they are not going to be in kind of big four category that I mentioned earlier. But there are some opportunities in the European market, not necessarily anything on the front burner, now for us in the Middle Eastern or Eastern markets. So we're not necessarily targeting India or Australia but certainly those could come into view over time. Again mainly leasing capabilities in some of these countries, something called full service leasing which has almost an element of fleet management for businesses and consumers. So there's kind of a constant view of what can we do to support the OE. ", "Samik Chatterjee ", "And just, finally, a housekeeping clarification. On slide 27 where you show ending earning assets and your projection of total earnings before taxes, just want to clarify, is the doubling of pre-tax income target for 2018 for GM Financial? ", "Chris Choate", "Yeah, we kind of nuanced that here a little bit frankly. This slide was I think first used by GM a couple years back, as we were sitting in 2014 and we were kind of in the process of launching the full captive business. The reality is here in 2016 -- one of the assumptions that really underlay the doubling of earnings was in a rising rate environment makes the relative attractiveness of subvented product nice for consumers versus just borrowing from a credit union or a bank. We obviously are not in a rising rate environment. And so we're seeing relatively less subvention in the market which of course we get a 100% of. So the doubling of earnings is going to occur. We feel very confident that that will happen over time, whether we absolutely stick that in 2018 or it slides a bit to 2019 or so. I think it is a bit unclear at this point given we don't know dynamically where the interest rate environment may move over the next six to twelve months. Certainly the volume can swing around pretty dramatically from quarter to quarter depending on what GM has in the market. But it\u2019s just a little more nuanced on when we would expect to see that doubling occur. ", "Operator", "Thank you and our next question is from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. ", "Colin Langan ", "Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to sub-prime again, unfortunately. On slide 25, I mean do you have a view of whether you think delinquencies for the industry will get worse. When you talked about how some of it's not really apples to apples and we're looking at performance because there's been a lot more of the sort of lower quality sub-prime that's higher risk. I mean any color on how an apples to apples similar credit quality has done, is that more consistent with you and it's fairly steady year over year? And are you seeing, I think I don't know if you directly said, are you seeing the lenders exit at this point now that defaults have jumped up? ", "Chris Choate", "Yeah, well I will take the second one. I mean we're not seeing anybody \u2018exit\u2019. What you see again, just look at the data kind of month by month, you see lenders pull back a bit, you see appetite then reappear from those same lenders. I am not just talking about the smaller newer entrants that has had to do with a number of the larger entrants, going back to several years where there\u2019d be a lot of appetite and a bit of a pullback and maybe in a re-expression of that appetite. And it really hasn't again in our view been a race to the bottom from a credit perspective as much as it's been a willingness to take less net interest margin in order to grow an asset base by, again a lot by the lenders. ", "You know, apples to apples on credit. I'll just give you kind of the GMF, our data, our perspective. And again this is very consistent with what is out in the public and we would \u2013 so this will be obviously bit of an endorsement of that. Loans that we put on the books and this really is irrespective of credit tier, this applies across all credit tiers, sub prime, their prime even to a certain degree in prime, loans that we put on the books originated in 2015 with like credit attributes for loans that we put on the books in 2014 are performing a little weaker and 2014 is performing a little weaker than \u201913 and \u201913 is lower than \u201912 and you can kind of cascade this back, really all the way back to 2010 when credit performance was just pristine. We had tended to joke sometimes, you couldn't make a bad loan in 2010. So those all performed incredibly well and as you've gotten further away from the credit cycle, even without expanding your credit box really, you're just going to see normalizing trends in credit, be it delinquencies, unit defaults, the behavioral aspects of the consumer. And then you lay onto that when it comes to losses, that delinquencies and defaults, that\u2019s consumer behavior driven, those have begun to normalize kind of year by year by year back to levels that existed back in 2004, \u201905, \u201906 and then you lay on top of that the fact that year over year we've had a little bit of softening in used vehicle prices so the amount that we recapture and we have to repossess the vehicle and sell it, that that will lead -- that kind of I\u2019d say exacerbates but that contributes also to the net losses kind of moving up. ", "Again same credit for same credit, apple for apple you see a normalizing trend really across the industry certainly in GMF\u2019s data but it is nothing that we -- it's really nothing at this point that we look at as alarming, it\u2019s just kind of getting us back to what we're generally in our subprime business viewed as an expected credit profile. We've been \u2013 in subprime everybody has seen the benefit of tailwinds, those tailwinds are now not going as part, right.", "Colin Langan ", "That makes sense. Any color if you can look back further over like a 10- or 20-year period are the delinquencies concerning? I mean, obviously, I think you make a valid point that from 2010 you're going from extremely strong comp, I mean if over a longer period is this in line with history or \u2013", "Chris Choate", "No, our overall \u2013 let me answer them in two ways. A) the demographic of a sub-prime borrower today for us is generally better than what a subprime borrower looked for us ten years ago. They have better household income, little more stability on residence, a little more down payment going into the end of the deal. So we have a better through the door subprime consumer now than we did ten years ago. Part of that at GMF has been because our subprime borrowers now are \u2013 we\u2019re being more selective on used vehicle borrowers and you're probably seeing a little bit more of a self-selected better consumer coming in to buy GM new. But then the credit performance itself that we see out of our subprime borrowers now is slightly better. We're still slightly better than where we were with credit performance back say in 2005 and 2006. So there still is frankly \u2013 and kind of what we're looking at for 2016 is and maybe into early 2017 is kind of the final bit of that normalizing trend that I discussed, then things will kind of be back to what the world looked like ten or twelve years ago. ", "Colin Langan ", "Very helpful. Just last question, any concerns about leasing for the industry overall? There's a lot of hype we're at record leasing levels, do you think that's a concern as we go forward, do you think other lenders are taking on too much risk? ", "Chris Choate", "Yeah, I think and I believe GM would tell you that leasing has probably gotten to be a higher percentage of their overall sales mix than they would like to see sustained over time. It tends to be a slightly more expensive product for the manufacturer to support in the market. That comment relates to \u2013 that\u2019s a very GM specific comment. Certainly luxury makers are always going to have very high penetration of leasing. Again as I noted to Brian Johnson, I think in my first response we feel very confident at this point that the residual experts are properly bringing into account the supply and the used vehicle values and the gas prices and all the other things that will have a downward impact on residuals over the next three years or so. So we don't feel like we've created any extreme amount of exposure for the business, certainly it's very cyclical. And over time residuals have problems and there's usually some impairment taken but at this point we don't really see that that's going to occur over the near term. ", "Operator", "Thank you and our next question is from the line of Mike Levin from Deutsche Bank.", "Mike Levin ", "Good morning, guys. I wanted to see if you could help me understand some comments GM has made around the GMF business kind of after you guys ramped to full scale 2018, 2019 timeframe. You guys made comments that maybe upwards of 90%, 100% of the net income could be dividended back to the parent company. Just looking at your largest domestic comparison, they are arguably a mature business already today and are maybe only dividending back 10% or so of their net earnings. Just kind of -- would like to understand if there's a difference in the business, if there is a difference in the way that you guys view the growth over time or sustainable leverage ratios or just how to understand 100% dividends as a possibility versus what we kind of already see and hear? ", "Chris Choate", "Yeah, I'm not sure I can fully -- I'd love to give you a fulsome answer. We are -- and I think any analysis or thinking around this topic even at a GM level is just so far out there in time that it's really kind of impossible to say. I mean certainly in a very steady state environment where the portfolio is not going up, not going down, not having any kind of issues on residual values or anything of that nature, no investments in IT, whatever there, there can certainly be -- I don't know if it's 80%, 90% or 100% of dividending, is certainly mathematically possible. The reason why I say it's kind of premature, or we\u2019ve got at least three -- even though we get kind of into maybe a steady state by \u201918 or \u201919 we still will have to stay very focused on that leverage ratio and maintaining our ratings and all that probably for another couple of years even after that steady state. So I am not sure the math even works that quickly, there's even some the way depreciation works on leased vehicles and what types of tax advantages we take with that can play into when dividending becomes possible. ", "So again I'm obviously not here to just anything that GM may have said about when the possibility of dividending is -- it's really just so far out on the horizon to us at GMF where we need all those capital in the business for at least three if not more years, three or four years it's kind of hard to say. ", "Mike Levin ", "So I mean it's fair to say that the next three to four years zero dividends and then depending on where you are in terms of leverage and growth at that point, you might kind of -- ", "Chris Choate", "I think that's very safe to say.

After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Thursday, July 21, 2016.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Randy Arickx - Vice President Corporate Communications and Investor Relations", "Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2016. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we have included the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results.", "This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. And then we'll open the line for questions from the analyst community.", "Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Investment Officer, to assist in answering your questions.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Mary Barra.", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. I am extremely pleased to report that GM delivered strong earnings in the quarter that included record EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins in North America, record sales and strong margins in China, profitability in Europe, and records for net revenue, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins, earnings per share diluted-adjusted and return on invested capital.", "Let's take a look at the numbers. Net income increased over 150% to $2.9 billion as revenue rose 11% to $42.4 billion. EBIT-adjusted was up 37% to $3.9 billion. EBIT-adjusted margin was 9.3%, up from 7.5%. Earnings per share diluted-adjusted was $1.86, up from $1.29. Automotive adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion, and we had a record ROIC of 30.5% on a trailing four-quarter basis, and this continues to demonstrate the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework.", "Given our very strong first half performance and our current outlook for the second part of the year, we now expect 2016 full year EBIT-adjusted to be in the range of $5.50 to $6.00 per diluted adjusted share, up from the $5.25 to $5.75 range we announced in January.", "As I mentioned, our strong quarter was underpinned by outstanding performances in North America, China and Europe, so let me just touch on those briefly. In North America we gained 0.4 percentage points of retail share in the U.S. in the first half of the year. This is the highest of any full line manufacturer and I think it really indicates that our focus on more profitable sales is working. We had the best Q2 light truck retail sales in nine years and the best mid-size retail pickup sales in 11 years.", "Average transaction prices on full-size pickups are up $2,700 per unit to date versus the Q2 2015 performance, and our ATPs across all models and brands are up about $1,500 per unit. Expected continued momentum in H2 will be driven by the launches of the Cruze, the Bolt EV, the LaCrosse and the Acadia. And we will also have improved availability of pickups and crossovers.", "As we look at China, we are on track to sustain our strong margins this year. Our H1 sales are up 5.3% year-over-year to a record 1.8 million units, and this is really due to a really great mix of MPVs and SUVs, and also luxury vehicles that customers are signaling that they really like. Brands continue to grow. Buick and Baojun set quarterly records, with Buick up 40% and Baojun up 78% year-over-year. And our Cadillac sales are up 16% year-to-date. The GM SUV deliveries almost doubled in the quarter, and this continues to be led by two really strong products: the Baojun 560 and the Buick Envision.", "In Europe, the team posted its first profitable quarter since the second quarter of 2011. It was a great team effort across every single aspect of the business. Opel and Vauxhall outperformed the industry with a 7% year-over-year sales increase to 621,000 vehicles in the first half of this year. And we have more products coming in the second half with the new Zafira and the refreshed Mokka X.", "In addition to the top line growth we've reviewed so far, we are also on track to exceed our target $5.5 billion in cost efficiencies by 2018 when we look at it compared to the 2014 baseline. This will more than offset incremental investments in brand building, engineering, and the technology investments we're making as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond. In fact, this year alone, we expect approximately $2 billion in cost performance from non-raw materials and logistics. So again, I think you can look at it and see extremely strong performance across the entire business.", "We are also \u2013 as we do strong performance and continue to work to improve the core operations, we are moving very quickly to leverage our technical expertise and to lead and define the future of personal mobility with a customer focus. On the autonomous front, we completed our acquisition of Cruise Automation, and we began testing self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads with safety drivers. And this started in the San Francisco Bay Area. Cruise provides the unique software capabilities, and when you take that software technology combined with our own expertise, it is really accelerating our work in fully autonomous driving.", "We've also rapidly grown our shared mobility services. Maven city and residential car sharing has grown to now to five markets, including New York, Ann Arbor, Chicago, Boston and Washington, D.C., and GM and Lyft Express Drive on-demand car sharing has expanded from Chicago to Boston, Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. And Express Drive members have driven more than 2 million miles on the platform in just four months. And they are getting to experience the quality, safety and technology that our products and our brands have to offer. Later this year we'll install Express Drive fleets in Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco.", "Our demonstrated commitment to innovation and our autonomous work are really changing perceptions about General Motors and helping us, and specifically our Cruise Automation operations, recruit the kind of talented men and women from the tech sector that we need to really increase and drive our innovation and performance.", "So in summary, we had an outstanding quarter, and I am extremely proud of the team. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Chuck.", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Mary. I just want to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and the first half. In addition to the outstanding second quarter that we just posted, we also had a very strong first half for the company. EBIT-adjusted results for the first half grew to $6.6 billion, up $1.6 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.3% in the first half, up 160 basis points year-over-year. The positive results were broad based, with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first half of the year.", "To demonstrate the strength of our business over time, we have now delivered EBIT-adjusted of $12.5 billion and nearly 8% margins over the last four quarters. Our strong first half results were led by record results in North America, sustained strong performance in China, and a return to profitability in Europe. In North America, EBIT-adjusted grew to $5.9 billion for the first half, up $1 billion year-over-year. North American EBIT-adjusted margins continue to be strong at 10.5%, up 80 basis points year-over-year, and in line with our target of sustaining strong margins of 10% plus for the 2016 calendar year.", "As an additional proof point that demonstrates the sustainability and strength of our business, North America has achieved 10% plus EBIT-adjusted margins for four of the last five quarters, and over the last four quarters has delivered $12 billion in EBIT-adjusted with 10.7% margins. And fundamentally supporting our business is the U.S. light vehicle industry that is tracking in the low-to-mid 17 million SAAR range year-to-date, up 1.2% compared to the same period last year.", "We continue to believe the industry will remain strong. As for the rest of the world, China continues to deliver solid results, with equity income of $1 billion for the first half, about equal to a year ago, and net income margins were 9.6%. However, as you all know, macroeconomic conditions in South America and many parts of our international operations continue to be challenging. The team continues to work to offset these pressures, and we will continue to take the necessary steps to set up these regions for future success. A proof point is South America. In the first half of 2016, we narrowed losses by $170 million, despite a much more challenging economic environment fundamentally in Brazil.", "Moving on to Europe. The region achieved its second straight quarter of break-even or better results. In fact, not only was the second quarter profitable, but the region recorded EBIT adjusted of $131 million for the first half, up over $400 million on a year-over-year basis. Of course, one of the largest uncertainties we have in Europe is the impact of the referendum in the UK.", "And let me provide some commentary on Brexit. Clearly, things are still fluid, and there are a lot of unknowns. It is important that negotiations on the UK's future relationship with the EU are concluded in a timely manner, and all businesses will certainly benefit from free movement of goods and people, and continued free movement of goods and people.", "Certainly we've made substantial progress towards our target to break even by taking advantage of a recovering industry, cost optimization, and recent launches like the Astra and Corsa. Prior to the result of the referendum, we were on track to break even for the year, as evidenced by our positive first-half performance. The result of the vote has adversely impacted the British pound, and the uncertainty has put a strain on the UK automotive industry. If current post-referendum market conditions are sustained throughout the remainder of 2016, we believe it could have an impact of up to $400 million to the second half of 2016. However, it's important to note that the team remains focused on making progress on our turn-around plan in Europe.", "Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.2 billion for the second quarter and $1.7 billion for the first half, both about equal to a year ago. Important to note that capital spending was $1.1 billion higher in the first half of this year versus 2015 as we make investments in our portfolio in line with our previously communicated plan. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is expected to more than double in the second half of the year, and we remain very much on track to generate approximately $6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year.", "We also remain focused on investing in the business and increasing shareholder value for the long term. As Mary discussed earlier, our strategic investments in Lyft and Cruise Automation help us to build the foundation to lead and define the future of personal mobility for our customers. We're pleased to report that we closed on the acquisition of Cruise Automation during the second quarter. The deal consideration at closing was approximately $600 million, with $300 million paid in cash during the quarter and the remaining $300 million paid through the issuance of new common stock.", "Additionally, we entered into other agreements associated with retention of key employees and performance-based awards contingent on continued employment and/or reaching certain milestones from a technology and a commercialization perspective. Despite nearly $800 million in cash outflows associated with our investments in Lyft and Cruise in the first half, as well as higher CapEx, our automotive cash balance increased $1.6 billion to $20.1 billion, bringing our balance back in line with our target.", "Turning to our capital allocation framework, we continue to focus on driving shareholder value in the short and long term. We returned $1.5 billion to shareholders during the first half, including $1.2 billion in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases. Please note, because of the seasonally challenging cash flow in the first quarter and our desire to get back up to our target cash level of $20 billion by the end of the second quarter, we expected that our stock buyback program would be heavily weighted to the second half of the year.", "Because we are in a seasonal cash flow business, I would focus less on smaller levels of stock buybacks in a quarter and more on the overall plan. We will deliver on our commitment to buy back $5 billion of stock by the end of 2016. In fact, we intend to complete the $5 billion stock buyback commitment within or ahead of the original timeline.", "Finally, with regard to our outlook for the remainder of 2016, as Mary indicated earlier, given our very strong first half performance and our current outlook for the second half of the year, we now expect 2016 full year diluted earnings per share adjusted to be in the range of $5.50 to $6.00 per diluted adjusted share. We expect the second half of the year to be strong but slightly below H1 results, primarily due to uncertainties associated with Brexit.", "As we've shown, we've accomplished a lot already this year, and we are in great position for improved full-year profit and margin growth versus 2015, which would be another record year for the company.", "That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, everybody. Congratulations. Had a couple questions. First, on North America, clearly some very strong pricing positives this quarter. Just wondering if you can comment on how we should be thinking about that for the rest of the year, and specifically what's the thinking behind the more aggressive posture on pickup incentives. And then on Europe, presumably you've got some hedges that are offsetting the pound impact this year. So how should we be thinking about the kind of carry-over effect as some of those hedges begin to roll off?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Thanks, Rod. Starting with North America. Second quarter, strong pricing on both new launches as we expected and guided earlier in the year, as well as carry-over pricing and we took advantage of continued strength in trucks and SUVs.", "I would expect to see overall pricing moderate on a run-rate basis in the second half of the year. We'll continue to have strong pricing on our new product launches, but carry-over pricing on a half-to-half basis will be a typical headwind. I would talk about that in the context of we still expect very strong performance in North America in the second half and are still driving to 10%-plus margins. But that's kind of the big picture on that", "Relative to truck incentives and the incentive programs in early July, I want to just make sure, that is absolutely not a shift in our focus and discipline around incentives. That was nothing more than a tactic to kick off the model year 2016 sell-down as we get ready to launch both the model year 2017 trucks and SUVs as well as new products. So that's more of a tactic versus anything else. And again, you have to look at that in the context of our expectations for the second half of the year.", "On Europe relative to hedges, we did have some hedges in place that we put in place earlier this year that would cover some of the pound sterling exposure. The guidance that I provided on the second half of the year, kind of the up to $400 million headwind, reflects our \u2013 if the current economic conditions were to be sustained for the rest of the year. And the biggest driver of that is really the weakness of the pound sterling. That reflects any impact of the hedge roll-off as anything else. So that's an all-in number right now. Again, assuming that the current conditions persist through the rest of the year.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Is there any carryover effect as we think about the hedges rolling off into next year? Does the impact worsen?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, look. It is early days, and very uncertain. The way I think about it is, in the second half of the year, again, with no mitigating actions or anything else, the biggest impact is the pound sterling. That could be up to $400 million. It's roughly in the $1.30, $1.31, $1.32 range. You pick the day. I think, all other things being equal, multiplying that by two would be kind of a calendar year impact just looking at that specific driver.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And just lastly on mobility. How should we be thinking about GM's position regarding any future investment in Lyft at this point?", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So Rod, I'm not going to \u2013 there's been a lot of speculation. I'm not going to continue to speculate. But what I would say is that with the Lyft alliance, it is accomplishing everything we set out for it to do. In fact, it's exceeding our expectations. When you look at Express Drive, and I talked about how we're expanding the launch, that's something that is obviously positive from a Lyft perspective, but very positive for us because it gives us an opportunity to take vehicles coming off lease or coming off rental and put them into this, which is a better place to put the vehicles and also allows us to grow our residuals.", "Also, we are very committed to being among the leaders or leading in autonomous technology. Clearly the Cruise Automation was a big piece of that, and the fact that we've already got cars on the road I think speaks to that. And we do believe that autonomous will first be tested out in the marketplace in a sharing type environment, and the alliance provides us the opportunity to do that. So the alliance is delivering what we need it to.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning, Itay.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "So maybe just one financial and one strategic question. First, Chuck, just on the financial side, back to the $400 million Brexit impact. Can you just talk to what you're assuming for the UK and overall European auto market in the second half of the year?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I would say, again, very early days. But if I was sizing up the $400 million, I would say it's primarily the pound sterling. The UK market, our initial assessments for the second half, it could be up to 5% to 10% reduction. But it's very, very early days. And I would say our perspective, again, is the largest majority of that potential impact is pound sterling-related.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great, then just a quick one on North America. What is the net impact from the auction sales in the quarter? It looks like it probably helped your volume delta on slide 14, but hurt the mix. Do you have a rough number of what the net of those two are?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean, obviously, one of the reasons that we're executing to the retail-focused strategy is retail vehicles are more profitable than daily rent, and there's all kinds of long-term benefits, so \u2013 which would imply daily rental are not very profitable. And as I looked across the whole EBIT bridge, I'd say it's close to a push, Itay. The favorable volume is offset by unfavorable mix and some unfavorable costs that winds its way through just the variable manufacturing associated with that. So, close to a push.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Then, maybe one strategic question for Mary. As you roll out the autonomous Bolt EVs in San Francisco for the testing, can you give us sort of an early sense on what the game plan is in terms of deployment of your shared level for vehicles in the Lyft network? Initially with the driver, maybe the size and the timing and magnitude of this initiative?", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. We haven't announced the exact timing because we're going to make sure as we develop the technology, we're being gated by making sure that we have safe autonomous technology to put into the marketplace.", "We expect when we do that and we're working aggressively \u2013 I mean, I think the fact that we have the vehicles and we're able to so quickly integrate the Cruise Automation software into the vehicles I think speaks to the speed at which we're moving. But we do believe it'll be in a shared environment. There will be a safety driver in the vehicle as we demonstrate with miles earned and also customer acceptance. But we haven't put specific timing or quantity on that, more to follow on that as we continue to develop the technology.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. Thanks so much, everyone.", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Itay.", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Itay.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, guys. Just a first question on slide 14 on North America. I mean, as we look at the daily rental pressure easing in the second half of the year, is that the kind of thing that could actually become a little bit of a tailwind on a year-over-year basis as we get into early next year? And also in the context of these vehicles that you guys will hang on to on the leasing side, I just wondered if you could talk about lease penetration in the quarter, where you can see that going and how you might deal with a much higher level of lease return in the coming years?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Again, I would look at all of these in the context of we're driving this business for sustainable 10%-plus margins. We expect the second half to be strong like the first half was from a North American perspective. Clearly, one of the benefits of the cycling through the daily rental is some of the challenges that we had on daily rental auction losses. So I think that ultimately there is a number of moving pieces in the second half but certainly we would expect to see strong performance.", "Lease penetration thus far in the first half of the year for us has run in the 28% range or so, a little bit above historical levels. We would expect to see that moderate over time. And one of the reasons that we're so focused on building Express Drive, reducing daily rental and everything else is because we know that lease returns are going to increase, the used car market is going to normalize, and we're taking proactive actions to improve our residuals, improved our used car values for that timeframe.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's very helpful. And then a second question on the buybacks. We have the $5 billion commitment by the end of 2016. I'm just curious if you could just remind us where you are to date on those buybacks? And as we think about the potential to do more with the incremental $4 billion authorization, what sort of is the timeframe we should think about for the incremental $4 billion on top of the $5 billion?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. So we've purchased, to date, $3.8 billion. As I just noted, we are committed to completing the initial share buyback of $5 billion per the committed timeline, which was the end of 2016. We will do that as quickly as possible here in 2016. The increased authorization was through the end of 2017. Again, our capital allocation framework, relatively transparent to the extent that we are appropriately investing in the business and we maintain our $20 billion target cash and our strong balance sheet, available free cash flow will come back to shareholders. So, that will be the gating on how quickly we execute the second $4 billion.", "I'd also point out, and I tried to make note of that in my comments, we are dealing with seasonality from a cash flow perspective, so we always need to think that share buybacks will generally be weighted towards the second half of the year versus the first half, just because of the low seasonality in the first quarter.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Incredibly helpful. And then just lastly, Mary, GM has got a long track record of coming up with great technology way ahead of what is generally perceived in the market, but then, the commercialization and monetization of that technology doesn't always really come through. OnStar is a great example of a product that is now gaining steam, but it's been around for a long time. As you're working on all these new projects, I'm just wondering how you think about ultimately, really commercializing and monetizing above and beyond what you're doing right now. I mean, it seems like you're way ahead of the curve on sort of the testing phase, but just curious how you think about commercializing and monetizing these efforts going forward.", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think you can look across a couple of technologies. First, we continue on the journey with electrification, and I think launching the Chevrolet Bolt EV later this year, getting that into the marketplace, seeing the customer reception, when you really start to erase range anxiety with a 200-mile drive \u2013 200-mile capability and with, we believe, the industry's lowest cell cost. So that's something we're putting into the marketplace, capitalize on the fact that we think we have, in partnership with LG, demonstrated the cell technology \u2013 which, by the way, we own the IP for our cell chemistry \u2013 putting that into the marketplace. We're going to look to see how quickly that expands from an electrification perspective.", "From an OnStar, agree, I think we've in the last couple years really accelerated, have a true leadership when we look at having OnStar with that connectivity across four continents. And we're continuing to look at ways to monetize that and that's something that's accelerating. And then with autonomous, to your point, that's one of the reasons we did the Lyft alliance is we recognized early that the fastest way to get the technology into customers' hands, and to really learn and be driven by what customer expectations are is to get it into a ride-sharing fleet and get it out there. So I think we're demonstrating different behavior with how we're getting the technology and the innovation and the technological advancements we've done into the marketplace more quickly. And I will also tell you, that's something I focus on every day.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes. A couple of questions, somewhat related. First, it was kind of a soft SAAR last month. DSRs have been down on a year-over-year basis three months in a row. How are you seeing sort of the sales outlook just in terms of U.S. SAAR for the remainder of this year and then flowing into 2017?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. We have maintained our view that the U.S. industry is going to remain strong, in the mid 17 million kind of range through the rest of this year and kind of into next year. When we look at the leading indicators from an economic perspective and those indicators that really drive the auto SAAR, they continue to remain strong and favorable. And again, we would expect to see this improve in the second half and then continue to be strong in 2017. That's our baseline assumption, Brian.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And secondly, thinking ahead to a potential eventual downturn, what is your commitment to the dividend that you're paying now? You didn't buy back stock in part, we understand, because you wanted to maintain a $20 billion cash balance, but in a downturn, that might go down. Just how committed are you to the dividend through a downturn? Or would you seek to maybe limit the dividend and focus more on share buybacks?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think that's a hypothetical question, Brian, because it depends on the downturn, the depth of the downturn, the perspective on the view of the downturn. Clearly, as we think about a moderate downturn and we think about our cash balance and everything else, what we would like to be able to do in a typical moderate downturn, maintain investment and maintain the dividend without drawing on the revolver. All right? If those are the facts and circumstances at that point, I think that would be a guiding behavior or a guiding tenet that you can think about. But it really depends on the facts and circumstances of the downturn.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And kind of moderate, are you thinking sort of minus 10%? Minus 20%? Minus Great Recession numbers?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, Great Recession isn't moderate. So I would say, if you look historically and from a U.S. perspective, a moderate downturn is 20% to 25%.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. But so you would be willing to have cash go below $20 billion and use the balance sheet cash?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's why we have it.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay.", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, that's why we carry it.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And I guess it gets to when I think of your slide on investment case, and maybe this is a question more for Mary, should investors be looking at you more as an earnings growth play, or more as a dividend yield investment?", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I really think it's both. I mean, I think when you look at our core business that we continue to invest in, the fundamentals of having great cars, trucks, and crossovers that customers are signaling they want to buy, we're segment leading, winning a lot of awards, continuing to look at how do we capitalize on adjacency, on connectivity, on GM Financial, so strengthening the core businesses, and growing with using adjacencies and also in some other key markets.", "And then on top of that, being very selective in those estimates we're making, so we can take and build on the expertise that's fundamental in this company of integrating technology into vehicles and putting them out on the roads, that potentially have the opportunity to dramatically change \u2013 I'll say, the current business from an earnings perspective of what that new business is worth. So we are working on both. I would be very happy if people thought of us as delivering and doing both.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.", "Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning, everyone. This is Neel Mehta standing in for Adam Jonas. Just two questions for you. First, taking a look at the broader industry, it seems like GM has been fairly disciplined with respect to capacity additions in North America. Wanted to get your assessment on the overall industry's discipline. Is there any concern out there that we could see pricing headwinds down the road if there's too much capacity in the industry, even if SAAR remains relatively healthy and stable?", "And then the second question is, there's a growing concern out there regarding off-lease supply, particularly as we head into the 2018 timeframe. Can you talk about GM's potential remarketing strategy around these vehicles? And could your Express Drive or Maven programs be disposition channels for off-lease vehicles in the future? Thank you.", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks. Relative to industry capacity, pricing, and everything else, as you look over the last number of years and just track incentive spend as a percent of transaction prices, it's inched up a little bit as we look at the trend over the last number of years. Nothing alarming. It appears that, from our perspective, the industry has continued to be rational from that perspective. Our base case is that's going to continue. As a matter of fact, one of your colleagues just wrote a research report that would indicate that the OEMs are displaying a lot of incentive discipline, and that could ultimately have a bit of a headwind from an overall SAAR perspective going forward.", "So we still continue to see that. Obviously, there's puts and takes. There's always puts and takes, strong pricing in trucks, SUVs, crossovers, weakness in passenger cars, but by and large, we continue to see overall discipline. We're certainly going to remain disciplined. We're certainly going to continue to focus on capacity utilization. Hence, our focus on profitable retail growth versus fleet.", "Relative to off-lease supply, I think I answered that question, indirectly or directly, earlier. We are focusing on reducing our daily rental just to make sure that we are not adding to the used vehicle market, because that has a tendency to impact residuals, which then impacts off-lease vehicles.", "We have our Express Drive program, which specifically will use vehicles that are coming from rental and/or off lease, as the supply for Lyft drivers. And we think that's going to have a pretty significant take up. We have our factory pre-owned collection as well, where we're trying to go directly to customers instead of through the auction, and make available a used car fleet from General Motors Company cars, daily rental, et cetera. All of those are really to make sure that there's good supply/demand balance looking forward. And early days, but generally on track.", "Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize if I missed this, but any color on the purchase price for Cruise Automation? And any color on what you \u2013 the factors considering in making that kind of acquisition, since it's really more of a technology today?", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, from a technology perspective, as we look at autonomous, Cruise Automation is the company that we have been following for a couple of years now. And as we saw the progress, and a very specific technology from a \u2013 call it machine learning or artificial intelligence, that coupled with all the work we were doing, we felt it accelerated our ability to be first or among the leaders as we implement fully autonomous technology into vehicles. And so it was very specific. It was something we'd been watching for quite a period of time. And strategically, we thought it was appropriate and we did a complete make/buy analysis but we thought the work that we had observing would integrate very well and accelerate our efforts.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "And how much was the final price? I saw some different varying headlines on it?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "$581 million at deal.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just a follow-up, not to belabor the UK $400 million cost; that was a little bit higher than I was expecting. Are you including in there any offset from the fact that you have facilities in the UK that now have, at least in the near term, a cost tailwind as you sell into Continental Europe? Or any possible pricing offset as a lot of people in the industry will be facing challenges as you import into UK?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We have certainly factored in our footprint and manufacturing footprint. The fact is we import a heck of a lot more units into the UK than we export \u2013 manufacture and export out, so we're long pound sterling.", "There is very little pricing mitigation assumed in that $400 million for the balance of the year specifically because, number one, it's early days. Number two, before you can take pricing action, you have to sell through inventory and the overall inventory levels in the UK are reasonably high across all of the OEMs. And that will certainly be one of the items as we work through this and see how it develops that we will be looking at it, as I'm sure other competitors will as well, as well as cost and other mitigating actions. So primarily, as I said earlier, the $400 million, looking at our overall position, primarily weakness in the pound sterling and some industry headwind.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "And lastly, when I'm looking at slide 14 with the North America walk, any color \u2013 you kind of highlight in the comments that mix is mostly the rental impact. I thought with SUVs being so strong, that mix would be positive. Did that more than offset that impact? And any color on the fixed cost and other, the $800 million, is that a run rate we should consider going forward or is this something unusual in the quarter?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I'd say first off, mix for trucks and SUVs, this is a period-to-period adjustment and we've been in a pretty strong mix condition for the last year and a half, two years from a truck and SUV perspective. So the year-over-year comp is relatively flat from a mix standpoint. So, I would look at this mix number as being primarily related to the daily rental volume that rolled through volume.", "Fixed costs, that is very consistent with what we talked about. Incremental D&A because of our launch cadence and new investments, product launches, incremental launch costs from a marketing standpoint as we launch new products, incremental engineering, again in support of our very aggressive launch cadence. And in the second quarter we had pretty significant manufacturing launch-related costs and manufacturing costs associated with the earthquake as we were running a lot of weekends and everything else to try to make up some of that volume. So I would not take this $800 million and multiply it by four from a run rate perspective. I would expect to see fixed cost on kind of a year over year basis improve in the second half of the year versus the first half, year over year.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter.", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. On China, I know the margin is still strong, down year-over-year. And I think you called out significant pricing pressure. And it also seemed like the Baojun brand really stepped out, so that probably didn't help mix. I was wondering if you could just talk about if there's any change to the outlook there for the year. I think originally you said 2016 would be fairly flat with 2015. And then again, plans to make those margins sustainable beyond this year.", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, we have not changed our outlook for China. We continue to expect strong performance in China, equity income in the range of $2 billion consistent with last year, margins in the 9% to 10% range. Going forward, as we've talked about since early last year, the market is more volatile, the competition is obviously from a price perspective stepping up. We continue to believe that we can execute our plan including our product launches, improve mix from an SUV perspective, continuing efficiencies to maintain strong margins and strong equity income going forward. And we'll have more to say about 2017 early next year. I would say from where we're sitting today, we would expect to deliver the performance that we talked about earlier this year in China.", "Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then, Chuck, I think you mentioned some European cost savings to be put in place to offset some of the changes from Brexit. Can you provide little bit more color there? Does that involve sort of changing the footprint? Is it sort of straight tightening the belt, or what do you have in mind?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, first \u2013 again, I'll go back to the initial comments I made. This is early days, there Is a lot of uncertainty. We wanted to size up again based on the current economic conditions, what the impact would be for the rest of this year. And, you know that I think, based on today's assumptions, is not a bad planning assumption. We will look across the business, as we've demonstrated that we would do not only in Europe but in other parts of the world, to ensure that we are taking the actions that are necessary to drive these businesses to the kind of performance that we need to generate.", "The whole laundry list. We will look to optimize channel mix in the UK. We will look to pricing, and to the extent possible, price to offset any lingering FX exposure. We will look to optimize our overall cost structure, whether it's in the UK or Europe, to mitigate these things. And that may or may not involve footprint and others actions it will take. We'll look to optimize our material cost. I mean, we will go through the whole list of drivers. And the team has been doing that for the last three of four years, and we'll continue to do that. And this is another speed bump along the way, but we're just going to have to deal with it.", "Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then last one, sticking with Europe. I think you mentioned UK, again early stage, but could be down 5%, 10%. But based on your comment just now about the inventory levels there and how it's going to take a while for a price increase, is it possible or even likely that demand maybe gets a little bit better before it tails off?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I guess I'm not quite sure on your question. You mean demand...", "Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Well, if consumers wanted to get ahead \u2013 if consumers wanted to get ahead of a price increase?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Who knows, right? I mean, I think they're probably still digesting a lot of what's going on as well. The indications I'm seeing and reading, housing market has already kind of stalled a little bit over there. Consumers are sitting on their wallets. It's just very early days, and something that we're going to have to monitor very closely.", "Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thanks. Congrats again, guys.", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.", "Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. This is Samik on behalf of Ryan Brinkman. I have two questions. The first one is on China. You had, I mean, pretty strong margins there. But what we are also seeing is the regulators push that market towards investing and launching new energy vehicles. So I just wanted to check with you how you're positioning your product portfolio for these incentives that are available on new energy vehicles going on a continuing basis. And also if you have any view on the extension of incentives on smaller engine vehicles in China in 2017.", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, from a new energy vehicle perspective, we already have vehicles into the marketplace. And we have a launch cadence that we plan on putting out that will continue to expand on that. Again, leveraging the technology that we have, the low cell cost. So I think you'll see us looking and having a comprehensive portfolio from an electrification perspective, taking advantage of the incentives and the opportunity there, but also very important to meet the regulatory environment. So that is work that's well underway. And then, as it relates to the...", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Look, the announced program is through the end of 2016. Clearly, we're staying engaged to the extent possible to get intelligence on whether that would be extended into 2017 or potentially terminated early. I think there's a lot of uncertainty around that point in time. So again, we have not changed our view that it's going to come off December 31. But that's something that we closely monitor. And if there's something meaningful to report at that point in time, we will.", "Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, and the second question I had is there are some early signs here emerging over the last couple of days that the midterm review for the CAFE standards, you might get some relaxation there as well with authorities, sort of acknowledging that the 2025 targets are difficult to achieve with the current mix of vehicles that are being sold. Any updated thoughts there, any discussions, and is that likely to be a tailwind compared to your expectations?", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We continue to work with the government and provide input from \u2013 as we do this mid-term review, which I think was a very important step when the program was put in place with the new targets to have this mid-term review. We clearly have identified a portfolio where we can meet. But a lot \u2013 what everyone has to remember is that it also depends on what customers actually buy. And when you look at the current environment, that drives it as well.", "So I think we're going to have a good discussion as we do this interim review. But I want to reiterate, we have done a lot of work to have the right portfolio. But I think we also have to make sure that the targets comprehend that customers ultimately choose what vehicles they're going to buy.", "Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for taking our questions. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Albertine with Consumer Edge Research.", "James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Great. Thank you so much for taking the question, and congratulations again. Wanted to ask on South America, if I may. Just an update on the endgame there. It looks like you've done a great job with respect to cost controls. Seems like there's some cushion there. You've narrowed losses over time. But it also seems, at the same time, that you're transforming into this business of new technologies and potentially some new monetization channels. So wanted to understand the prioritization of GMSA as it relates to maybe the next medium-term five-year period or so.", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, over history, South America has been a very important business for us and has delivered strong performance. We have a very strong product portfolio there and with a lot of model year refreshes that happened this year that are very, I'll say, economically done from a capital deployment perspective. We have a very strong distribution network. I think the strongest dealer body. When you look across the globe, the Chevrolet brand is incredibly strong.", "So we have a very strong core business franchise in South America and I think the team has done a very good job over the last couple years of really looking at the market conditions, taking cost out, again on all drivers. It gets to the point that Chuck made when we were talking about Europe. We've run that play. We've demonstrated success in South America of really looking at how to take cost out and how to drive an increase from a revenue perspective.", "So we see that business as important. Obviously, disappointing right now with the macroeconomic conditions that no one knows for sure how long they last, but they're lingering. But we're well positioned and have seen improvement in the first half of this year from the first half of last year even in a more difficult macroeconomic environment. So, very important business for us and we know that it has huge potential as we move forward.", "As it relates to technologies, whether it's connectivity we've already deployed and we'll continue to grow that over the next couple of years. We'll continue to also see what the receptivity is from an electrification perspective, and from an autonomous perspective. But it will be customer-driven. Clearly, we have the technology and the capability to do it.", "James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Great. I appreciate that color. Just two quick housekeeping items, if I may, as a follow-up. First, do you have any plans similar to your peer, key peer in Ford, to break out your digital strategy or technology strategy as a separate segment? And then secondly, as we're thinking about fixed versus variable cost assumptions, I think Chuck alluded to this earlier, but if we're doing a break-even analysis for the next few years in your U.S. business, what are the right percentages to bake in now considering all the improvements you've engineered over time? Thanks so much.", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, relative to segment reporting, we have no plans at this time to change our segment reporting. Obviously, that's something that we continuously evaluate as the characteristics of the business changes. So the quick answer is, no, on any change to segment reporting at this time.", "I'm not going to give you our fixed variable perspective on a go-forward basis. I would say from \u2013 our real focus is to continue to maintain break-even point in the U.S. at a 10 million to 11 million SAAR, and that is driven by variable profit improvement and the overall level of fixed cost. I would say, importantly, when you look at cost, look at North America in either the second quarter or the first half of the year, factor in what we categorize as fixed cost versus the material performance, the commercial performance, cost performance is relatively flat. And we grew our margins, which means that variable margins improved as well. And that is supportive of maintaining a low break-even point. So, I kind of think about cost overall, both variable costs, especially the performance aspects of that, the commercial performance against fixed cost increases.", "James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Well, thank you so much and best of luck in the coming quarters.", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our last question for today will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.", "Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everybody.", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi.", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey.", "Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC", "So just a point of clarification first on, I guess, your implied guidance for the second half when you sort of \u2013 essentially guiding to a little bit of a softer earnings in the second half? Is that entirely the risk from Brexit which you quantified? Or is there anything else that you're looking at, and in particular is there anything in North America sequentially?", "Charles K. Stevens - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, okay. First, we're going to \u2013 our expectations are we're going to have a very strong year. We had a very strong first half, and when I look at second half versus first half, the fundamental driver is seasonality, which is largely, even pre-Brexit, was a European issue. We were shut down in Europe, to a large extent, in the third quarter, and then there's the holidays and Brexit. Those are the two biggest factors of the second half versus first half.", "North America had a great first half. We expect North America to have a great second half, continued strength. And again, our overall expectations, improved profitability year-over-year, improved margins, improved earnings per share, $6 billion of free cash flow, another record year. And the performance that we generated in the first half is supportive of that, and that's why we took our guidance up as well.", "Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC", "Great. That's helpful. And then I guess on the Lyft partnership, obviously seems off to a pretty good start. Can you share with us what sort of milestones or maybe concrete obligations of the partnership we could expect over the next few years? Are there any specific things we should be looking for?", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think when we put together the alliance it was built on four aspects. One was what we're already doing with Express Drive. Two, the power of using the vehicles that have the capability that OnStar provides. That's already underway. There's an opportunity to cross-market, and I think that's something we're just beginning to look at. Clearly getting Lyft's customers into our vehicles through Express Drive gives them exposure to the cars from a styling, from a technology \u2013 the whole value proposition that we have across our brands in GM products, and then demonstrating autonomous capability in a sharing environment. So those were the four pillars the alliance was on. As I said, those are all on track and are accomplishing exactly what we intended to do.", "Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC", "That is great to hear. Thank you.", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mary Barra.", "Mary Teresa Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, operator. And I want to thank everybody for participating on the call today. I think if you step back and look, not only this quarter, but what we've demonstrated over the last several quarters, we really have very strong earnings power in this company, and I think, that demonstrates why GM is a compelling investment opportunity. We know the industry well. We know it comes with challenges and twists and turns, but we also know it comes with opportunities. I think we've shown in this quarter and quarter after quarter that we have the right mindset and are holding ourselves accountable to overcome headwinds, to seize opportunities and to meet our commitments with no excuses.", "The leadership across the company, which I'm very proud of, are pushing themselves to beat the targets we put in front of us. They want to win and they want to continue to drive value for our customers and for our owners. So we'll continue to execute our plan with discipline to keep driving profitable growth, generating strong returns on invested capital, and creating shareholder value as we really focus on putting the customer at the center of everything we do. So thanks again for your participation in our call today.", "Operator"], "Symbol": "General Motors Co. (NYSE:", "Period": "Q22016", "Month": "07", "Year": "2016", "Date": "2016-07-21", "Target": 0},

Pam also works on the autonomous technology and vehicle execution team at GM so two very exciting topics and we\u2019ll look forward to discussion today. Pam will provide presentation you should all have it up here and plus on the Company\u2019s Web site and if anybody does need our legal disclosure of Citi we do have that out upfront and if you can\u2019t find them please let me know we will get them out to you. So with that, we\u2019ll do some Q&A after Pam\u2019s presentation. And I want to now welcome General Motors back to the tech conference and Pam I\u2019ll turn it over to you. Thank you.", "Pam Fletcher", "So thank you Itay for hosting this conference and allowing us to speak to you and your guest. First, I\u2019d like to take a moment and tell you about my team and the work that we do. I lead the team that is completing the final production tweaks for the Chevrolet Bolt EV in preparation for retail production later this year. The Bolt EV is a perfect representation of what GM can do when it comes to advanced technology. It will be the first affordable long range electric vehicle with more than 200 miles of range on a single charge priced at under $30,000 net full federal tax incentives.This is an incredibly exciting time for my team and for GM technology is transforming the industry at a record pace. Autonomous technology is no longer a thing of the distant future and that future is happening now and you\u2019ll see in a moment what we are doing, the work we are doing to accelerate it.", "We saw this as a recipe to break the code on electric vehicles. Certainly long range affordability functionality performance and connectivity. In particular, when it comes to range, we know that consumer\u2019s consideration of electric vehicle goes up substantially at 150 miles of range and goes up very significantly at 200 plus miles of range. So at this point many would seriously consider replacing their conventional vehicles with an electric vehicle. Affordability, we set the price target at $30,000 after the incentives to be on par with many internal combustion engine equipped vehiclesthat would be the point to really take it to mass market. And with functionality, we designed every detail of the Bolt EV with functionally in our mind. From the design to the integration of battery pack, the air dynamics of the interior, interior has a maximum carbon space of 56.6 cubic feet rivaling the best in this segment.", "I\u2019ve already discussed the range and the price point. However, the Bolt also excels when it comes to performance and features to achieve these targets. For instance, it will accelerate zero to 60 under seven seconds I\u2019d like to say, the beauty of EV is kind of what you only experience when you drive one is that kick in the pants that you get, when you step on the accelerator it\u2019s that maximum torque that you get at zero speed from electric motors and what make many comment that EVs are fun to drive and that is a big part of our recipe at General Motors.", "And so not only zero to 60 under seven seconds 50 to 75 miles an hour, which is a passing type maneuver in 4.5 seconds. We have connectivity and infotainment that features include a large 10.2 inch, so bigger than a large iPad customizable touch screen display, Apple CarPlay Android Auto that we\u2019ve all come to expect and EV Mapping with charge station not only locations, but availability and service status.", "The rear facing camera mirror so think about the rear view mirror, as we've historically called it, now replaced with a camera based system that gives you this incredible 180 degree view but what's better than that is it literally makes everything behind you disappear, so when you look in that rear view mirror you don't see your children behind you, you don\u2019t see the head rester behind you, you don't see the pillars that are at the rear of the vehicle so just giving you this immense view of what's going on behind you. 360 degrees surround vision which gives you that bird's eye view, 360 degrees from on top of the vehicle for better improved safety during low speed driving and when you're parking and the many safety features that we've come to not only expect but love such as forward pedestrian and collision alert, side blind zone alert, lane keep assist rear cross traffic alert.", "The battery, you know in the electric vehicle world everybody wants to talk about the batteries and battery here's a great story, hopefully at the end of my remarks you'll see that the whole car is really a great story. Certainly the battery and this is actually what it looks like, it's a flat pack in all areas where the occupant space is affected, the double stacked cells at the back are really under the rear passenger seat and this is what drives the performance of the vehicle.", "From the how we got to this packet performance its cost really is driven from our many years of Volt experience, our Volt consumers between 2011 and 2016 have driven 1.4 billion miles in electric mode, they've driven even more if you count those few times when people use the range extender but 1.4 billion all electric miles and per our warranty incident tracking we have replaced zero cells for wear-outs. We are very proud of that as you can imagine, we get asked about battery cost a lot and as being responsible sort of for the business case of these products things like warranty accruals have decreased dramatically since the time of the generation one Volt where in 2010 we launched a car through the experience of history that we have this warranty performance that I just proclaimed.", "Even the warranty accruals that we have, have dropped dramatically certainly the inconvenience to customers because they're not going through the inconvenience of the battery wear out that so many fear yet we really haven't experienced that and we're happy that our customers are having a good experience.", "A lot of is enabled because we have a battery lab, it's literally across the street from where my office is, the largest battery lab of any automakers here in the country over 80,000 square feet. We've been using that lab utilizing that lab since before the gen one Volt, so before 2010 I say every time we take people through the lab which happens fairly often I say this is where we predict the future and the beauty is that future that we predicted back in end of 2010 when we launched on the first generation Volt is coming through today exactly as we predicted. We continue to use that lab we continue to have that be a great tool in how we predict the future when we get even larger formats batteries. Cars that don't have the range extender back-up. So this experience along with our partnership with LG Chem has given us what we believe to be a leading position in the industry as it relates to performance and cost and batteries.", "Here's the Bolt EV it's on a fast timeline, it was first shown as a concept at January of 2015 at the North America International Auto Show, exactly one year later, January 2016 it was introduced by our CEO, Mary Barra at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. At that time we provided a drive opportunity to more than 100 not only journalists but analysts and I know, Itay you had the opportunity to drive a car, many other analysts that are at this venue did as well. That, I mean think about what I actually just said, these were some of our first, these were actually the first prototype vehicles that we had built they represented the I'll call it production map but they're hand built, with a lot of prototype parts but at this point our experience is such that, when those cars came together they were pretty darn good, I mean good to the point that, had a lot of the opportunity to put many of you and journalists in it to get a feel for what is this car really about. So, see, last time we saw it by a production announced and literally the week later, back in Detroit at the North American International Auto Show.", "So, in a moment you're going to see we have Bolt flowing up the assembly line today with retail production on-track for the end of the year.", "[Audio/Video Presentation]", "So, a short but sweet video, the point is we're living up to our commitments to bringing Bolt to life here before the end of the year, it's exciting Ed Whitacre is the Chief Engineer it's a little bit gut wrenching but it's here and we're excited and hope many of you get the opportunity to drive one very soon.", "So, not only are we expanding our products portfolio but also expanding our business models and the way that we interact with our customers, one way is through ride sharing, so initiatives where the car comes to you, you don't have to drive if you don't want to, ride sharing is one example of changing the economic efficiency of transportations of assets that's going apply to you not only privately owned assets but commercially owned assets, of course this is all enabled through connectivity.", "And so talking about ride share, we started to bring out some of the story actually at CES, because we've been talking about the Bolt EV I will call it more in its traditional form-factor as our products for use by individuals, by families, but the reality is sharing has been in mind for this car since its inception and so, I could walk here around the car and show you a lot a little details that are kind of -- you might look at them if weren\u2019t thinking about sharing and not notice them or maybe not even care, but when you start to put, get the sharing mindset, all of a sudden these things make sense. So, the flat battery pack, I'll talk about why that's so important and the spacious interior, seating for five, unprecedented rear seat room in this size of a vehicle. The car has what we say a small exterior footprint and a very large interior spaciousness and so perfect for that urban environment, where as you know the real estate is precious but certainly you want to be comfortable when you're inside that vehicle, lot's of creative storage solutions to meet people's needs, like a cargo space behind the rear seat with connectivity.", "Your phone could become your key you can access the vehicle through ride share with our app and then the passenger comfort. So let me come back to that flat battery pack so it's not just that it's flat it is like who cares that it's flat. The reality is if you have, if you are setting beside the car and you have the doors open and you look there is literally no step over today go look at each of your own cars when you go to get in it and you probably notice that there is literally a step over like a sill. And we don\u2019t have that so not only do we not have the step over we have taken and if you look at that drivers\u2019 door or look at that rear door we have literally sculpted the car around the interior to maximize that opening space, because think of a car where people are getting in and out a lot more than if it were used by only on one person, so I mean there is an example of something that you are going to -- might yawn at.", "But if you are getting in and out of a car a lot that matters, there are no obstructions in the floor across that rear seat. I mean there are other cars in production out there with flat packs but you might see an obstruction here the notion is. Literally you can slide across that seat maybe the curve is on the left on the right I mean actually they are on both sides just today and here in New York City and so we have been trying to think forward to how people would utilize the car in a sharing experience. And then lastly you could say well why electric and there is all these I will call it unsung benefits of electric think about it, it's quite, it's smooth I mean it creates this perfect cocoon to go about your errands go about town in so we really think that this the right recipe not only for the consumer EV but also with ride sharing.", "On top of that our investment in Lyft has enabled us to grow our ride sharing services with this partnership it is accomplishing everything that we wanted to including implementing and expanding our express drive short-term vehicle rental program and working towards deploying autonomous vehicles into an on demand network.", "Bolt EV plays a significant role in GM plans for vehicle autonomy. Autonomy will fundamentally change the way our customers interact with our vehicles AVs autonomous vehicles provide many potential benefits. Customers enjoy and desire the convenience of car based transportation, however not everyone wants to own can own or can operate a car, so autonomous vehicles provide them with an option.", "As there aren\u2019t many people or I should say there are many people who don\u2019t have access to the mass transit that you may experience here in New York and other major metropolitan areas. Or they may live in cities where the monthly tuck in fees just make car ownership literally out of reach, so AVs can expand economic options for people and businesses through this new form of transportation, and while autonomous vehicles could bring all these powerful benefits to travelers and businesses alike the most important benefit we see is absolutely safety.", "More than 35,000 people die every day on roads I am sorry every year in roads in this country, and more than 90% of those deaths are caused by human error, so autonomous vehicles can have a real impact on saving lives. There you go, we've already begun testing our preproduction versions of the Bolt EV equipped with full autonomous capability on the public roads in San Francisco that you see there on your left and Scottsdale Arizona on the right. So some of those these are prettier ones, some of the same vehicles that some of you may have driven in Las Vegas in January, were repurposed and literally are operating with autonomous capability today.", "Our recent acquisition of Cruise Automation in San Francisco, whose product features include provision steering, car linked tracking, adapted speed cruise control, collision avoidance provides us with a team of talented software engineers who are creating the algorithms and the code to bring full autonomy to life and deliver autonomous technology in an on-demand ride-sharing service. What really attracted us to Cruise was not only the capability that they\u2019ve already developed, but the fact they were doing it, I call it in the wild of San Francisco right, literally on the downturn streets of San Francisco, the most or one of the most complex environments to try to build and deploy new technology.", "General Motors is well underway to delivering products and technologies that will transform mobility as we know it and again Itay and all the guests in the room, I want thank you for the opportunity to talk to you. And maybe, we\u2019ll have a few minutes for some questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "A - Pam Fletcher", "Just a reminder, the engineer in me he doesn\u2019t do this often. Just a reminder, all materials are covered by our forward-looking statements.", "Itay Michaeli", "Well, yes thank you very much ma\u2019am for that presentation. We\u2019ve got about 20 minutes for Q&A. So if there is a question just feel free raise your hand I think and then we\u2019ll get into it, so first question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "You didn\u2019t mention the charging time. What is the charging time for the vehicle?", "Pam Fletcher", "Good question, so DC fast charging you get about 90 miles in 30 minutes. People always wanted to a lot of full charge, I will tell my own experience driving the car for many months. When you get the 200 plus miles of range, you rarely get a full charge, you can opportunity charge at your convenience in the event you need it to nine hours, but frankly that\u2019s not really the story.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. So then, and I know that these are usually talked about in tandem the idea of a shared autonomous fleet and an electric vehicle. In that context I wrestle with the application of, if you\u2019re going to need x-number of hours to recharge it doesn\u2019t that make it harder to get the really high utilization level that you have been targeting in a shared fleet context?", "Pam Fletcher", "Yes. So that\u2019s a very interesting question, I actually confirm that the nine hours a quoted was at level 2, 240 Volt charging by the way. Interesting question, so charge times are always, it\u2019s kind of like you\u2019re boat, it\u2019s never, your boat is never long enough, charge times are never short enough. But the reality is, if you look at the way people use the car even in the shared space, the charging times don\u2019t become so onus, because think about the urban environment, what\u2019s your average mile an hour right, what is the average mile an hour the route that you take span time. And so we feel very comfortable with deploying myself on the Bolt EV with its range and charging technologies on-board it to satisfy the requirement. There is another side benefit of using EV. All of that, all those sensors and that compute platform, the beauty is, we\u2019ve on-board we\u2019ve got a lot of capabilities to power all those systems. And I think there is a lot to be said to for that environment that I talked about. The fact of that, it is in the end it\u2019s about, in the end or it\u2019s going to differentiate yourself on the user experience and having this I think wonderfully pleasant environment is a great foundation for that.", "Itay Michaeli", "Question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Looking forward into the future with driverless cars, if something goes wrong like an accident, has it been ironed out about whose responsibility is it, is it like the software's responsibility is it GM's responsibility or like the sensor company's responsibility or how does this all get flushed out if there ever is a problem in the future?", "Pam Fletcher ", "Yes, so in cases where there is an automated driving system on the car, that system we see as being designated as the driver and if there is an incident where the driver is deemed to be at fault then the manufacturer of that automated driving system that would be their responsibility.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I think year-to-date you spent about 800 million in cash on M&A and minority investments all centered around electric vehicles and ride sharing and so forth. I guess as we think forward to 2017 and given what you've shown us here you're pretty far advanced in developing these vehicles, how do you think about how much more you can spend, where are your holes, what do you need to acquire, what do you need to do to kind of get you over the finish line?", "Pam Fletcher", "Yes so bear with me, I have an answer for you. So when we look at deployment of autonomous vehicles we think there's five key elements. There's connectivity, you need a vehicle architecture capable of delivering the service that you want to provide, you need not only manufacturing knowhow and capability but capacity, you're going to test me here, you need an on demand network and you need last but not least the autonomous technology and so I started with connectivity.", "So General Motors has over 20 years of connectivity experience with OnStar more than any other auto maker we've deployed over 3.5 million for GE LTE equipped vehicles more than all other automakers combined so we feel that we've more than got that requirement addressed. We just talked about a vehicle platform, sharing isn't something we thought about yesterday, I talked about in the early planning stages in crafting up what the Bolt EV would be. We had sharing in mind and so I talked just a few moments ago about how we are moments from putting that car into commerce, we're at the stage that I call polishing the rock, at this point of time so more than well on our way there I talked about manufacturing knowhow and we've got a 108 years of manufacturing knowhow.", "We've got a manufacturing facility at our Lake Orion township facility in Michigan that is already tooled so we've already spent that capital already tooled to produce the Bolt EV should we have capacity needs beyond that it's well equipped we can add additional shifts so we think we're well along our way on that third element. When it comes to the on demand network our alliance with Lyft has brought that to us and we're already working with them in multiple cities. We've already deployed multiple cities with express drive around the country as well as other activity and then lastly autonomous technology I talked about Cruise Automation, we've got cars already operating on the roads today, more coming literally every day, and so I just walked you through the five elements that we think are required and really we think we're frankly better positioned than anyone else to deliver.", "Itay Michaeli", "So, maybe I'll kind of continue upon that question, so I think did GM talked previously about wanting to do or planning to deploy fully autonomous vehicles in a ride sharing application over the next few years, can you just provide an update on that? And then maybe as a follow-on to that, truly the economics improve when you move to driver lists, can you just talk about how Cruise and the Lyft partnership potentially help you in that eventual quest whether it's data collection to deploying vehicles in a Lyft network or the work that Cruise has done in on the Bolt?", "Pam Fletcher", "So, today, we're collecting data today on the cars that are already employed I talked a moment ago about, we have pre-production of Bolts already equipped with autonomous capabilities, we've updated them with Cruise Automation hardware/software, they're gathering data, we're working with Lyft more than working with, heavily engaged in -- we already have on-demand ride share in practice in many cities throughout the country and preparing that for when the days of autonomous come about.", "Itay Michaeli", "And as thinking with on par thinking with the Bolt in a ride share environment, is that, you may be able to through your Lyft partnership to accrue more drivers because of some of the advantages that electric vehicle has in terms of operating cost, is that part of it as well, or is it really more for the user experience that you referenced in the presentation?", "Pam Fletcher", "Yes, so, we're -- just to be clear, we're talking about a Bolt EV, not a Bolt AV, and so deploying a Bolt EV and you're absolutely right, and so when you look at -- when operator obviously assesses what's going to be the operational cost when they choose the car to employ themselves in ride sharing, so, and let\u2019s just call it average kind of numbers if you think of fairly efficient combustion engine equipped vehicle, maybe that's a $0.09ish a mile kind of operating cost and when you go to something like a Bolt EV more like a $0.03 a mile, so, significant benefits for an operator.", "Itay Michaeli", "Sure, and then may be what was your question regarding?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Are you going to be rolling out a supercharge network, or your own network of charging stations?", "Pam Fletcher", "Okay so you have asked the question right here?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Right here.", "Pam Fletcher", "Well hi.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi.", "Pam Fletcher", "Yes so, charging is a great topic, someone else already had a couple of questions there. So, there's many parts of the industry where we feel -- where we compete, right, we have competitors and we're on the playing field competing. There're certain areas that we feel for our customers benefit collaboration is the right model and charging is one of those areas and so General Motors along with most other automakers has adopted the S.A.E. standard. So, as infrastructure rolls out many will be able to utilize that. Now in the case of ride share obviously to make that work, charging in the right locations is important and so we'll assure that that's in place and that could be working with others, or doing it ourselves. But this idea of collaboration we think is really a better recipe for consumers. You have got to make it convenient for them.", "Unidentified Analyst", "You talked about the -- I'll say a question in, there's a five kind of pillars you need to get there I think one of them was connectivity, how about OTA in general and for the Bolt EV, the roll out of what vehicle kicking in some of the [Multiple Speakers]\u2026", "Pam Fletcher", "Yes so you are talking about over the air\u2026", "Unidentified Analyst", "Over the air\u2026", "Pam Fletcher", "Yes over the air programming and so the Bolt EV, will have over the air software download capability.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay could you talk about the used cases in I think for the\u2026", "Pam Fletcher", "No [Multiple Speakers] no but absolutely. So, let me go into kind of the next that what the next question would be and that is around cyber security and so we take that very seriously we were the first major automaker to establish a dedicated cyber security team. Our Chief Cyber Security Officer Jeff Massimilla, is the Vice-Chairman of the Auto ISAC Alliance along Cyber Security, so we take it very seriously and we really wanted to get we have got all necessary safeguards in place to do so that we would do over the air programming on safer and securely and so that will come out on the Bolt EV.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay and how about I'll sneak one more product question on the Bolt level 2 and level 3 plans? I know Super Cruise is an explosive launch next year, any plans of Super Cruise on the Bolt or maybe just can you talk about the AVAS and other sort of semi-autonomous features of? ", "Pam Fletcher", "No great question. So, at GM, we view these driver assistance features and which can go clear up to full autonomous driving. All those layers provide increasing safety and increasing convenience for our consumers and so we've not talked about much of it in detail but we are well on a roll to rolling out layers of this increasing driver assistance features globally, so something to look forward to.", "Itay Michaeli", "So, generally speaking about EV both may be at a industry level or GM. How you see the penetration basically North America and Europe and China perhaps over the next five years and particularly to how you see the penetration split between vehicles the consumers own versus maybe more of a ride share environment given some of the potential advantages EVs do have in a ride share?", "Pam Fletcher", "Yes, so that's a big question. So how do I see a penetration so EVs are an interesting space. We see the best path to adoption to date has been experience, sort of the butts-in-seats approach. People don\u2019t know what to expect and having misconceptions and so when they actually get in an EV is typically their perceptions are -- they walk away surprised and delighted, and so the only problem is that's a slow path to adoption. So the opportunity for a ride share exposure to EVs I think is terrific from the standpoint of more people experiencing them and some of these intangibles the conversation is usually around it's usually around range, it's around target time, it is around better life. And there is always intangibles that really take -- that cause the surprise and delight factor everything from fun to drive to the smooth and quite that are hard to describe by words really I have tried being in the seat that is tried to deliver that through words and you can\u2019t do it. And I really see whether it's in EVs and the ride share or the autonomous experience on an EV really helping with that. As we look around the globe there are ever more stringent regulations coming about for many reasons. Congestion in some of our major cities around the world, it\u2019s just unworkable right to get around. We see vehicles being limited in certain city areas just to deal with congestion. We see certain more punitive approaches to being able to drive there with those carbon taxes et cetera. So that and obviously the pollution and air quality is the obvious one. So you take the culmination of those and not only EVs, but then you talked about ride share and then you talk about autonomous you are going to really start getting at a multitude of issues with what we think it\u2019s a pretty compact efficient product and technology layering.", "Itay Michaeli", "And how about just -- you mentioned in the slides leading battery costs. If you want to expand on a little bit more, but also kind of where you see that going in the next few years, particularly as you start to ramp up some volume.", "Pam Fletcher", "Yes. So I sounded there a little bit on just kind of how we got to where we are with batteries, not only just. We didn\u2019t, it had great results with our consumers that own our cars with large format batteries today, not by accident, by a lot of science and testing and trying to predict the future. And so that only helps us know how and where to push the cost curve, because in the end you still want that consumer experience to be great you want to get that performance and cost and from our standpoint we need the same. And so we talked about, I don\u2019t know a year or so ago something around approaching $145 kilowatt hour in the 2019 timeframe and we believe we\u2019re ahead of that at this point. And that\u2019s a great position to be in and as the needs to roll out and deploy ride share AVs address global regulations really increases.", "Itay Michaeli", "Sure. Maybe back on the business question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And actually a slightly different question about EV, and it\u2019s potential especially for you. Which is that what are the dynamics with the dealerships? Dealers don\u2019t like selling EVs, because it\u2019s not a profitable thing long-term cars have fewer parts, the dealership therefore makes less revenue on people bringing it back and getting it fixed. And so often I have heard people coming and saying I mean shouldn\u2019t EV and they cross-sell to something else immediately, because they don\u2019t want to sell an EV. So how do you think about that dynamic, if you ever really wanted to be aggressive in this area? When you know that all the dealers will make less money servicing an EV over its life and they don\u2019t want to do that?", "Pam Fletcher", "Well, first, I\u2019m not validating some of those comments I wouldn\u2019t make some of those statements that you made. What I would say is, our dealers ", "are all huge partners for us, I mean that is an advantage that we have. The fact that we have many dealers throughout the globe to work with our customers on ", "a one-on-one basis or even if what they want to do it face-to-face, if they want to do it remotely through the Internet et cetera. We have, we have tried to create a great situation with our EVs as we have, our strategies around high voltage service and safety. We started with protocol a long time ago when we had two mode trucks, we continued that out to really help dealers be able to reuse not only the training that they had and their technicians but service tools et cetera so -- and our dealers participate with us on many fronts not only the initial sale but addressing questions that consumers have. So I -- we tremendously value our dealers and I guess I wouldn\u2019t attest to some of the comments that you made.", "Q - Unidentified Analyst", "Back to autonomous, there's been a lot of I guess discussions -- this is a busy month in August in the autonomous news front. We had discussions about how it's all going to play out in terms of does it start with geo-fenced areas first and expand on out, perhaps in the rideshare environment? How do you see the -- once you start to deploy some of the Level 4 vehicles over the next few years, how do you see the timeline for the industry and General Motors in particular around that? Maybe to that -- to the extent of regulations and the regulatory framework comes into play, I'd maybe love to get your thoughts on that as well.", "Pam Fletcher", "Yes so many comments and there are questions so at General Motors we absolutely see, we think the right answer for deployment of autonomous vehicles is in a ride shared network. We think this provides a great opportunity to have a very orderly roll out. It gives an opportunity for consumers to experience the vehicle without a commitment for purchase we think it gives a chance for our consumers to get all their questions answered and experience the cars and so we're really excited to get that moving, we have got some cars on the road today and we don't see that being in the distant future by any means. Much near-term than I think envisioned. At the same time the other part of your question was you talk about the deployment of the ride sharing.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Sure. Just to continue on that thought around once you have those vehicles out there in a rideshare environment, they're performing services, they're collecting data, what has to happen to go to sort of the driverless last [Multiple Speakers]?", "Pam Fletcher", "Yes so this notion of deploying on our on demand right share network, I talked about getting customers familiar at the same time it\u2019s about frankly us learning about their experiences because in the end we think we're going to win or lose on the user experience and so with our first generation Volt we used a customer advisory board where we very early on, earlier than traditionally we were able to put consumers, every day people into Volt experience and how they would use the car, what they liked, what they didn't like and could address that and I think with autonomous we have a lot of great ideas and imagination about how to utilize an autonomous on demand ride share network for consumers\u2019 benefit but we know that there's probably more great ideas out there and so this sort of a roll out I think is a win-win for consumers and for the manufacturers.", "Itay Michaeli", "And then one more on the Bolt, you talked about ridesharing; we mentioned the Lyft network. How about leveraging or using the Bolt in the Maven car share network? Are there plans for that as well?", "Pam Fletcher", "Great idea.", "Itay Michaeli", "So that's an affirmative? Okay.", "Pam Fletcher", "Absolutely, yes we talked about a second ago of cost of operation and so we believe that we will be a great experience for the riders and we think it'll be a great experience for the operators. So, Maven is a perfect spot to put Bolt EVs to use.", "Itay Michaeli", "Sure, and maybe, we've got about a minute left, but I wanted to -- maybe I'll sneak one more in. I think to an earlier question you kind of mentioned, Pam, that GM really is the one that's going to lead this. So I thought maybe we could kind of summarize the key points of why you think that is on the autonomous, connected, and, of course, ridesharing.", "Pam Fletcher", "Yes we really believe that those five elements I talked about are necessary for a successful deployment of an on-demand rideshare network and frankly we think we lead and are well positioned in all of those, with respect to connectivity, we've got more connected cars than anyone else in the world right now. We've got a vehicle platform appropriate for the kind of usage and a ride -- autonomous rideshare network, we've got a plant that's already tooled and operating and can add capacity if we need it. We've got the on-demand network capability right now for our alliance with Lyft and lastly our effort combined with Cruise Automation really have leap forged us toward the deploying autonomous technology. So, those five things together are all each on their own could be onerous and we really think we're the best positioned to take those and put them together in on this on-demand rideshare autonomous network.", "Itay Michaeli"], "Symbol": "General Motors Company (NYSE:", "Period": "Citi20", "Month": "09", "Year": "2016", "Date": "2016-09-20", "Target": 0},

Please go ahead, sir.", "Randy Arickx - General Motors Co.", "Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2016. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.

Thank you very much for joining. GM delivered strong earnings and achieved several third quarter records that included net income, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins, EPS diluted-adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow.", "Here are just a few of the year-over-year highlights. Net income increased 104% to $2.8 billion as net revenue rose 10% to $42.8 billion, which is an all-time record. EBIT-adjusted was up 14% to $3.5 billion. EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.3%, up 0.3 percentage points and EPS diluted-adjusted was up nearly 15% to $1.72. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.8 billion, up from $0.8 billion last year and ROIC adjusted of 30.6% on a trailing four-quarter basis was an all-time record continuing the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework.", "Given our outstanding performance this year, we are on track to deliver a record 2016 on top of a record 2015 and a very strong 2014. In addition, we expect to be at the high end of our full-year EPS diluted adjusted guidance of $5.50 to $6 per share.", "We also completed our initial $5 billion share buyback commitment a quarter early and we'll be purchasing additional shares in the fourth quarter.", "We had very strong performances in North America and China. So let me cover a few of the highlights. In North America, our disciplined retail-focused strategy is paying off. U.S. retail share grew 0.4 percentage points for the highest Q3 share in five years. Chevrolet posted its best Q3 U.S. retail performance in 10 years and Buick's best in 11 years.", "Our Q3 ATP of almost $36,000 exceeded the industry by nearly $5,000. On the incentive front, although we are operating in an extremely competitive environment, we remain committed to our disciplined go-to-market strategy with a focus on retail customers and Chuck will have more to say about that in just a few minutes.", "We also announced the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV range of 238 miles at a price of $37,495 before tax incentives. So the final cost to customers can be under $30,000 depending on their tax situation. We also have eight of the 2017 North America car, truck and utility of the year semi-finalist. We have the Cruze from Chevrolet and the Bolt EV, we have the GMC Acadia, we have the Cadillac CTS and XT5 and the Buick LaCrosse, Cascada and Envision.", "I would also say just yesterday, we had very strong results from consumer reports for Buick. Even with the volatility from a market and pricing perspective as we look at China, China was able to post year-to-date retail sales through September \u2013 and through September GM and its joint ventures delivered 2.7 million units, which is up 9% year-over-year. We had six new launches from our Chevrolet, Buick and Baojun brand.", "Buick and Baojun set Q3 sales records, driven by the Excelle GT, the Envision and the Verano Notchback and also for Baojun driven by the Baojun 560 and the 730.", "In Cadillac, retail sales rose a record 79% in the quarter on strong sales of the XT5, the XTS, the ATSL and our year-to-date retail sales for China are up 35%.", "For Europe, through the first nine months of the year, we broke even. In fact, at the end of H1, we were on plan to breakeven for the full year. Because of the UK referendum and the resulting devaluation of the British pound, we continue to expect that we will incur about $400 million impact in the second-half of the year, and the team is working extremely hard to minimize the effect of this headwind. But, even with the Brexit situation, our Opel, Vauxhall brands continue to show strength. Through September, sales are up 5% year-to-date on the Astra's strong performance. And we also have introductions of the refreshed MOKKA X and Zafira that are laying the foundation for future growth.", "In addition to the progress I reviewed so far, Q3 \u2013 through Q3, we have realized $3.7 billion of the $5.5 billion target in cost efficiencies by 2018 and this is off a 2014 baseline. These savings will more than offset incremental investments in brand building, engineering, and the technology investments we are making, as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond. Because of the progress we've made, we are confident that we can exceed the $5.5 billion target and we intend to use these additional savings to offset our investments in the future of personal mobility where we see tremendous return potential.", "We also are seeing positive results on our strategy to consolidate global architectures and powertrains. Production of the Cadillac XT5 and the GMC Acadia. The first two models on our new crossover platform are nearly fully ramped up and the new Buick LaCrosse, Baojun, (7:20) Malibu on the mid-sized platform and the Chevrolet Cruze Hatchback variant is launching on the new compact car architecture.", "Because these new global architectures and powertrains are so efficient from a mass and a fuel economy standpoint, we can use them for multiple lifecycles and this will enable significant reuse of our capital and the ability to deploy elsewhere in the business. From the perspective of talking about personal mobility, we are leveraging our technical expertise in the core business to lead in the future of personal mobility for our customers. We are expanding our EV leadership with the Chevrolet Bolt EV and the Opel Ampera-e. They both go into production this quarter, and they'll surprise a lot of people in terms of performance, range, connectivity and styling.", "We are also testing 30 self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads in Scottsdale, Arizona and San Francisco with autonomous vehicle trainers. Our Maven personal mobility brand has seen rapid growth through its launch nine months ago. We expect to be in 15 markets by the end of 2016 with nearly 10,000 vehicles, and we've launched three services on the Maven platform, the City, Residential and Express Drive variants. 70% of Maven's customers are millennials that live in urban areas, and nearly 90 employees, 60 who are from outside of General Motors, 40% are millennials and they have collective experience of launching over 40 startups and as a team hold 117 patents. So, we really have an energized team running our Maven business.", "When we look at connectivity, we are building on our 20-year lead with OnStar. We expect to have nearly 12 million connected customers globally by the end of the year, and we've transitioned the OnStar RemoteLink app to our vehicle brands. Customer engagement is up with 150 million interactions year-to-date versus the 135 million we had for all of 2015. And lastly, we have nearly 500 customers that have enrolled in our Smart Driver service since its launch in July. They can use this service to autonomously (9:32) seek insurance discount for good driving practices.", "So every winning quarter we continue to demonstrate what the earnings power is of General Motors. The team's performance this quarter is further evidence that we are doing what we say we are going to do. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Chuck.", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Thanks, Mary. I'd like to provide some perspective on the quarter and our results through the first nine months of the year. In addition to another record quarter, we also put up some very strong results year-to-date. EBIT-adjusted through September grew to a record $10.1 billion, up $2.1 billion on a year-over-year basis. EBIT-adjusted margin was a record 8.3%, up a 110 basis points year-over-year. The positive results were broad-based with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first nine months of the year.", "Our strong year-to-date results were led by record results in North America, sustained strong performance in China, and breakeven results in Europe. And our performance year-to-date clearly demonstrates that we're on track to meet our commitment and deliver another year of strong results. In North America, EBIT-adjusted grew to a record $9.4 billion for the first nine months of the year, up $1.2 billion year-over-year. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was a record at 10.7%, up 20 basis points year-over-year, and in line with our target of sustaining strong margins of 10% plus for the year.", "In fact, North America has achieved 10% plus EBIT-adjusted margins for five of the last six quarters. The underlying strength of the U.S. industry continues to support our strong earnings in North America. We expect the U.S light vehicle industry to be in the low to mid 17 million SAAR range for the year. And we also continue to expect the industry will remain strong, albeit in a plateau environment over the next number of years.", "However, given the recent increased interest in industry incentive and inventory levels, I'd like to spend a few additional minutes to share our view. Cleary, we recognize the industry is increasingly competitive, especially as consumer preferences are shifting away from sedans and more towards SUVs and trucks. We've remained absolutely committed to our disciplined retail-focused go-to-market strategy, and we have demonstrated that by managing supply and demand, and through disciplined pricing. In fact on average, our third quarter incentives as a percentage of transaction price significantly under paced the industry. GM was up 30 basis points year-over-year, but the industry was up 80 basis points year-over-year. Furthermore, our transaction prices increased at approximately twice the rate of industry during this time period.", "Q3 incentive levels were influenced by our sell-down of the 2016 model year vehicles, resulting in a model year changeover pace ahead of where we were last year. Current model year product now makes up more than half of our dealer inventory, which is approximately 15 points better than last year's status at this point in time. Our aggregate dealer inventories are up year-over-year, increasing the availability of our recently launched products, like the Cadillac XT5, GMC Acadia, and the Chevrolet Cruze and Malibu. And given our dealer footprint, our days supply is well-positioned at 79 days, as it's important to have sufficient inventory as we move into the strongest seasonal pickup market, coupled with holiday-related downtime in Q4.", "Looking ahead to Q4 and beyond, we would expect aggregate dealer inventory levels to remain higher than a year ago, as the industry remains strong and we build dealer stocks ahead of our upcoming crossover launches in 2017. We also expect days supply to fluctuate before moderating by year-end. Having said that, as we've demonstrated in the past, our inventory levels will be dictated by matching supply with demand. We will continue to watch inventories closely, especially cars, and will take actions if and when required. We also expect our incentive levels to moderate in Q4 as we benefit from a higher mix of newer model sales, increased availability of our most recently launched products, and an expected strong finish to the year for U.S. industry SAAR levels.", "As you may have already seen, incentives as a percentage of transaction price for the industry are trending down in October, per J.D. Power's mid-month data. And our incentives as a percentage of transaction price are also expected to trend down as we progress throughout the month and the rest of the quarter. It's clear our go-to market strategy is working, and we remain confident in the health of the U.S. industry.", "Okay. Let's move on to the rest of the world. China continues to deliver solid results, with equity income of $1.4 billion for the first nine months of the year, about equal to a year ago, with net income margin remaining strong at 9.3%. In South America, as you all know, macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. We continue to work to offset these pressures and take the necessary steps to set us up for future success. Our efforts are paying off. In spite of the challenging environment, worse than what we experienced in 2015, the team has narrowed losses by nearly $300 million this year compared to 2015.", "Shifting to Europe. Despite the ongoing effects of Brexit, the region posted breakeven results for the first nine months of the year, an improvement of $500 million year-over-year, and the best performance year-to-date since the third quarter of 2011. Clearly, we have made substantial progress towards our breakeven target in 2016. However, we continue to face headwinds related to the UK referendum. And as all of you know, the British pound continues to fall to lows not seen in decades.", "As we indicated back in the second quarter, we continue to estimate that Brexit could have a negative impact of up to $400 million in the second half of 2016, which includes over $100 million already incurred in the third quarter. The team continues to remain focused on making progress on our turnaround plans in Europe, and we will continue working to partially offset these headwinds to the best of our ability.", "Turning to cash flow and capital allocation, adjusted automotive free cash flow grew to $5.2 billion for the first nine months of the year, up $2.7 billion year-over-year. These results include an increase of $1.5 billion in capital spending, as we make portfolio investments in our product lineup consistent with our previously communicated plan.", "As a reminder, Q4 cash flow tends to be weak due to seasonality, however we remain on track to generate approximately $6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year. Our strong cash flow generation and earnings growth continues to support a significant return of capital to shareholders, in line with our capital allocation framework.", "We've returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through the first nine months of the year, including $1.8 billion in common stock dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases, completing our initial $5 billion program ahead of schedule. We expect to repurchase additional shares in the fourth quarter as we work towards the $4 billion in share repurchases we committed to completing by the end of 2017.", "Finally, with regard to our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Given our very strong year-to-date results and our current outlook for Q4, we now expect 2016 full-year diluted earnings per share adjusted to be at the high end of the $5.50 to $6 range per diluted adjusted share. It is clear that we've accomplished a lot already this year, and we fully expect 2016 to be another record year for the company.", "We're in the process of finalizing our 2017 planning assumptions, and we'll provide you with additional color in January on what to expect for the year. However, we do expect a continuation of strong earnings in 2017, as North America's results will be favorably impacted by our strong launch cadence of new crossovers, as well as a continuation of positive cost efficiencies around the globe.", "That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli, Citi.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.", "Good morning.", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Good morning.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. So, Chuck, can you \u2013 just on 2017, I know, it's early for guidance in detail, I think, the slides do still talk about GM expecting a kind of positive earnings trajectory. So the initial thought is that earnings can still go up next year versus this year, and then maybe if you can give us a little bit more detail on the various kinds of puts and takes to think about when modeling 2017?", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Yeah. Itay, we'll have more to say on \u2013 at the Deutsche Bank Conference in January, specifically around the details on how we see earnings shaping up in 2017, but with that said, absent an unforeseen economic development either in the U.S. or China, and we certainly don't foresee any, we would expect GM to deliver improved EPS diluted-adjusted in 2017, which is consistent with what we've been talking about for some time now.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. That's very helpful. And then just secondly, can you help us a little bit more to think about how you're thinking about China in the fourth quarter, given the environment and the tax incentives, as well as what you're kind of seeing in terms of inventory levels and pricing going into the fourth quarter?", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Well. I would say, there is certainly a little uncertainty around the tax incentive, and the way that will \u2013 when that may end, and that's had an impact on the strength of the Chinese market calendar year-to-date. Absent some announcement by the government, we'd expect Q4 to be strong as well in the range of 9% to 10% up year-over-year. We've seen, so far in October the industry in sales continue to run very well. We still expect to see strong equity income consistent with our guidance to generate about $2 billion of equity income for the year, and pricing continues to be a significant challenge. We've been able to offset that on a year-to-date basis with improvements in mix and continued material cost efficiencies. So it feels to me kind of more of the same in the fourth quarter, consistent with what we've seen in the first three quarters of the year.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "That's very helpful. And just lastly maybe strategic question for Mary. I think, last month, John Zimmer from Lyft kind of predicted that the majority of Lyft's rides will be autonomous within five years. I was curious if that's \u2013 that comment is part of your plan with Lyft in terms of the on demand network partnership? And maybe, if you could give us an update on kind of how you're looking at the trajectory on these efforts going forward?", "Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.", "Sure. We are making great progress on the autonomous development. As I mentioned, we have a fleet now running, not only in San Francisco, but also in Scottsdale, so 30 vehicles on the road. And that's important because it's not just the miles, but it's really the experiences and the scenarios that they continue to learn every day and I'm very pleased with the team's performance.", "As we look at launching autonomous into the marketplace, we believe it will first happen in a controlled environment, in a ride-sharing environment, hence the alliance that we did with Lyft, as well as the work that we're doing with Maven. But as we see it going into ride sharing, that's because it will be geo-fenced, you're going to have limitations with speed and other limitations, and that's why the ownership will stay with the company in these first models as we continue to learn.", "And so, that path is very much on track, but I will say what is going to gate our launching of autonomous vehicles into the marketplace for consumers is safety. And we are working very hard with the experience that we have to do that in the safest manner possible because it does then really address the issues that we have of over 90% of fatalities in today \u2013 in today's U.S. streets are human error. And so, we think we can make a big dent on that so we'll be gated by safety, but once we feel that we've got the right system, we're working with our regulators, we have the scale to put those vehicles into production extremely quickly.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "That's very helpful. Thanks so much everybody.", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, everyone. I had a couple questions. One is just, I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit on the outlook for pricing and profitability in North America. Yeah, you've done a very good job of keeping inventories at good levels and have had really good results on pricing. Of course everybody is noticing some increasingly aggressive actions from competitors, Ram (23:50) incentives are at 16% of average transaction prices. This quarter we're seeing a number of retailers talking about margin compression in new. This morning FCA talked about over 600,000 units of additional truck capacity in 2018, and I think, IHS is projecting something like 13% increase in GM production in Q4. So I was hoping, just in the context of all these things that we all see, can you talk about, number one, the GM production outlook and maybe a little bit more on the levers that you can pull to sustain 10% margins in North America as we look out to next year?", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Yeah, sure. Let me start kind of at 10,000 feet and work my way down a little bit. I already spoke to our inventory level, and we feel our inventory level is appropriate given our dealer footprint, and what's really driven the increase in inventory which is filling out inventory on newly launched products and new entries that we didn't have before like the CT6 or the Envision as an example. And continuing to work on inventory for our compact crossover so that we have sufficient supply as we look to change those models over in 2017. From a pricing incentive perspective, clearly the market in general is getting more competitive and there is some aggressiveness from a truck perspective, but I step back and look at the overall strength of our three-truck strategy, the light duty, heavy duty and mid-size trucks, we've been able to maintain discipline around that, grow retail share and increase our transaction prices in spite of some of this, and I think, it's fundamentally driven by the very, very strong product, relative to the truck capacity coming on stream. We could sell more vehicles, if we have more vehicles from a truck perspective today, and hence one of the clear focus areas on the retail side of the business. You also need to peel the onion a bit on where are we \u2013 where is the industry actually adding capacity, is it in trucks, is it in SUVs, is it in crossovers, because again we believe we're well-positioned. We have dominant share in full-size SUVs and our full-size pickup trucks continue to perform very well.", "To your last point or how do we continue to see earnings be sustained from a North American standpoint, and I think, there's two or three fundamental drivers to that, Rod. Number one, we're running at different play and it's generating different results. We're very focused on retail in a very disciplined way. Our retail market share is up, we're less reliant on less profitable daily rental, and that's showing up in our results.", "We also have our very, very strong product launch cadence, so this year we fundamentally rolled over our entire passenger car portfolio, and next year we'll start the strong launch cadence of completely refreshing crossovers, small, compact and mid-size over the next 12 months to 18 months; and that's critical, that's a lot of volume, it's highly profitable and we expect to see that.", "We also expect to see continued improvements from a cost standpoint. North America fundamentally enjoys the large benefit of that $5.5 billion of cost efficiency, and as Mary indicated, we're looking to drive that even higher and that's going to be fundamentally from a material performance, logistics performance and we'll continue to streamline manufacturing and SG&A. Taking all that together, we're confident and constructive that under a plateaued industry environment that we can continue to sustain strong margins in North America like we have done over the past couple of years.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. And could you confirm that what IHS is calling for vis-\u00e0-vis GM's Q4 production; and on a separate track, if you can maybe talk a little bit about scenario planning for China? Right now your volume is up 9%, there's been some margin pressure, which you guys have pointed to, but you're keeping earnings flat. I'd imagine that some \u2013 to some degree there is some demand pulled forward. So if we were to think about a flat market in China or something significantly flatter, what would \u2013 how would that effect GM's equity earnings outlook?", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Yeah. Let me \u2013 when you're talking about fourth quarter production, are you talking about total or trucks or what?", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "IHS is calling for North America production in the fourth quarter for GM, last I checked I think it was an October update of being up 13% year-over-year. I'm not sure if that's correct, but it seems like a fairly big increase just given the trends that we've been observing?", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Yes. We worked through the launch cadence of our recently launched products, we would expect overall production to be up in the fourth quarter marginally from the third quarter, and obviously what plays into that are the Christmas holidays and everything else, but we would expect production to be up. Relative to China and the specific questions around planning assumptions in China, we've been able to maintain strong equity income and strong margins through continuing to launch new products, improved mix, and material performance which is fundamentally offset price headwinds.", "Obviously, this year the industry is running stronger than we expected, because of some uncertainty around the purchase tax incentive, if that was to end and the government was to announce an end to that, our planning assumption would be that \u2013 there could be some volatility in maybe the first quarter and second quarter of next year, but then we would still expect the industry to continue on that growth path towards 30 million units and as we've talked before, a little bit more volatile growth pattern and in the kind of low single digit range over the next number of years, again it really depends on what's announced from the government's perspective, we have no insight on that. We certainly expect the pricing dynamic to continue and that's why we're so focused on our product launch cadence and I would say similar to the U.S., our product launch cadence in China is heavily weighted towards SUVs and crossovers over the next number of years as well as Cadillac products which is going to help from a mix standpoint. All that said, more to say in January around specifics, but we would expect China equity income to continue to be strong. We would expect margins over time to be compressed. They're at somewhat unnaturally high levels at from an industry perspective for the foreign OEMs, but still be generating strong overall equity income.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, guys.", "Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.", "Good morning.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a first question on truck pricing, because there seems to be some hyperbole around elasticity of demand to pricing. I'm just curious, when you think about pricing on trucks and what you're seeing in the competitive environment, I mean if one competitor cuts price, do they tend to pull forward their own demand or do they tend to conquest sales, I'm just trying to understand what's going on here, because it really \u2013 there seems to be a belief that price cutting can drive significant conquesting and I'm just curious how you think about that?", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Well, I think that you really need to peel the truck market down almost cab type by cab type and trim level by trim level, because price elasticity in our view becomes less relevant the more you move up from a trim level perspective and a cab level perspective. First, truck buyers are the most loyal of any customer. The loyalty rates of truck buyers are north of 60% and generally you are in the 50% range, so that's first, you are dealing with that aspect.", "Second, where there seems to be the most elasticity is at the very low end of the market. So, regular cab work type trucks and things like that, and I think that, you saw some of that play out last year when one of our competitors was very aggressive and we were losing share at the lower end, but still generating strong profits and good transaction price growth. And I think that's what we're seeing play out. So, I wouldn't paint the whole truck market pricing dynamic with one brush, you almost need to look and peel that onion back a layer or two layers. We're still performing exceptionally well up-level crew cab \u2013 our new up-level additions and higher trims that we're rolling out, and we've seen improved transaction prices and improved, actually, profitability on the current truck platform on a year-over-year basis and \u2013 despite some of the challenges at the lower end of the market.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that's very helpful. Then just a second question, could you just give us your leasing levels in the third quarter in the U.S., or sort of a percentage of sales? And what you think the industry roughly was in the quarter?", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Yeah. The industry was \u2013 and this is broad strokes, John, but I think directionally correct, in the 27%, 28% range, and we're a little bit lower than that from a leasing perspective in Q3. 24% for us, and that's down from highs earlier this year of close to 30%. So, typically we would be a few percentage points below the industry average just because of the mix, less trucks are leased. So \u2013 but that's kind of where the dynamic's at \u2013 and what we're seeing is, lease penetration at an industry level is up kind of the same amount that subvented financing is down, right. As the market is dealing with low interest rates and people are still looking for payments that they used to get through subvented financing.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it, that's helpful. And then just lastly, I mean, on cap allocation, I personally would pretty much agree with the way that you're going after this. But clearly what we're seeing in the stock is there \u2013 the market is maybe disagreeing with cap allocation and where we are in the cycle. I'm just curious, would you ever consider storing more of this cash on the balance sheet to create a larger buffer and maybe calm some market concerns which appear to be out there, given what the stock is doing, and maybe taking advantage of a buyback or redistribution of capital to shareholders as the cycle progresses and maybe goes to the downside, or are you going to stay in the stalwart path of sort of $10 billion roughly of net cash and excess free cash flow above and beyond that will just be redistributed through buybacks?", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Yeah. We did a lot of work around our original capital allocation framework in the targeted $20 billion of cash. We looked at the business. We looked at what it was going to take to run the business through the cycle, to ensure that we can continue to invest appropriately through the cycle, because that's one of the lessons learned, and to ensure that we could maintain the dividend through the cycle, through a typical 25% downturn. That is the basis for our targeted cash. We will continue to reevaluate that depending on market dynamics, but \u2013 and we do on a regular basis, but there was a lot of work to come up with that $20 billion.", "And fundamentally, we're making all the investments that we want to make from a capital spending perspective. We're making the investments we want to make from an innovation technology standpoint. And at the end of the day, $20 billion is what we really need to run this business and manage it through a cycle, maintain the dividends. So under that construct, what's available from a free cash flow perspective should come back to our owners, and we also have a revolver. Obviously, our intent was not to draw that in a downturn, but that's an emergency backstop in the event of some unforeseen issue or a deeper-than-typical downturn, and that's available to us as well.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I am sorry, Chuck, just one follow-up on that. I mean, you talked about $20 billion of gross cash. You didn't mention the net cash. I mean, is there a potential that you would consider taking on some leverage to buy back the stock? I mean, right now the market cap is 2.8 times your trailing EBITDA, it's pretty inexpensive growth basis right now.", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Yeah. Going back to our overall capital allocation framework. First and foremost, invest appropriately in the business through the cycle to drive, sustain 20% plus return on invested capital and invest in the future for technology and innovation. Second, maintain an investment grade balance sheet, and we're targeting to run the company at a single A rating, because we think that's the right thing to do from a financial risk management perspective and to support GM Financial, which will ultimately lead to significantly improved earnings at the finance company, but also at the car company. So, we don't \u2013 we feel today, when you look at our overall external debt and our \u2013 the position of our underfunded pensions, that we have the appropriate amount of leverage. We do not want to overlay financial leverage on top of operating leverage in this business, because that's another lesson learned from the last significant downturn that we went through.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's very helpful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks for taking my question, which is on Europe. I think that the guidance back in July was maybe $400 million of Brexit impact in the back half of 2016 or $800 million annualized, but it looks like you called out just $100 million in 3Q or more like $400 million annualized. So, with a quarter's worth of results in Europe post-Brexit, do you now have a different assessment of the annualized financial impact? September SAAR in Western Europe, I think, was like the strongest since May of 2009. I wonder if maybe when you guided to the annualized impact back in July, if perhaps you had assumed lower industry volumes that have yet to, at least so far, materialize.", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Yeah. Let me go back to what we talked about in July, because I think it was you that asked the question, Ryan, when we were talking about the $400 million impact in the second half of the year and you kept pushing me on, what's the calendar year impact. And I think I said early days, but an indication would be, take the $400 million and multiply it by two, right. A full year impact of the second half, pound sterling only, without a lot of insight on what was happening from an industry perspective and everything else.", "And I'll circle back to that in a minute, but I just wanted to kind of set the foundation for that $800 million. It wasn't a well-studied kind of guidance. It was a general directional answer to a conservation you and I were having on the last earnings call. We did guide to the second half impact of $400 million. We are holding to that guidance. What manifested itself was $100 million in the third quarter. So, that would leave a residual $300 million in the fourth quarter on the basis of our crystal ball today on where we're landing from a pound sterling perspective. The reason, it was more backend loaded, obviously, we had some hedges in places that helped in the third quarter to mitigate that to a certain extent.", "And the pound is we can further, since we provided that guidance. So, we still expect, for the second half of the year, in the range of $400 million headwind associated with Brexit, primarily related to the pound sterling and that's primarily now a fourth quarter issue, about $300 million of that residual would fall into the fourth quarter, which will certainly make our challenge of breakeven in Europe very, very difficult especially when you think about the seasonality of earnings and everything else. Just looking at the pound sterling impact itself. Pick an exchange rate, at the end of Q2, we were at $1.28, $1.29. The last I checked this morning, we are at $1.22. There is a several hundred million dollar headwind on our long pound sterling position that in and of itself in 2017 if I was picking a point today would be significant. But there are number of actions that we're working through with the European team to mitigate as much of that as we can. More to come, in January, but certainly the environment in Europe is challenging and uncertain, and very volatile at this point in time.", "From an industry standpoint, I agree with you that performance in Western Europe has been strong and strong through the third quarter and frankly it was even strong in the UK, but again when you look at the sales, there were a lot of fleet sales in Q3, a lot of very unprofitable fleet sales in Q3. We didn't necessarily participate in it, but there is a lot of inventory being kind of unloaded.", "I would expect and we still expect to see the industry pull back as we exit this year and go into next year to a certain extend as OEM start to price. We raised prices 2.5% on October 1, our intelligence suggests Volkswagen followed, not to that full level, but followed as well. And that \u2013 in and of itself along with consumer sentiment issues should \u2013 will drive some pullback from an industry standpoint. So, we'll have to see how that plays out.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Very helpful color. Thank you. My final question is on consolidated international operations, looks like the loss there narrowed quite a bit sequentially, that was actually the biggest difference versus our model. So what is the plan and sort of the cadence to walking this region back to say breakeven? Maybe remind us of the timing and the magnitude of the savings coming from winding down manufacturing costs in Australia and if you could share if there are any other catalysts or step changes in profitability in the region that investors might have to look forward to?", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Well, I would say, our approach in all of our operations, including the consolidated operation is to put in place, a path to drive these businesses to viability and appropriate returns, and if not to take action. And exiting manufacturing in Australia was one of those. We should be through that by the end of 2017, all else equal that would be worth a $100 million to $150 million a year in savings from a manufacturing cost perspective once we exit that activity. Again scheduled at the end of 2017. We've already exited or significantly downsized our vehicle manufacturing, car manufacturing activity in Thailand. We ceased manufacturing in Indonesia. I would suggest we are looking at all of our operations there and as we've indicated in the Q, there could be additional significant restructurings, depending on whether we can identify the path forward, because we're just not going to absorb the kinds of losses that we've seen there on an ongoing basis. So, I would suggest there is likely more actions to come.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, Mary. I got one for you first and I'd be particularly interested in your answer to this question as an engineer by training and profession. So, as the ADAS \u2013 and the question is about ADAS, cars still with steering wheels but a lot safer, and our dialog with suppliers and regulators, especially as these systems mature in the market and they get the data to show the vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian empirical data the reductions are very significant, sometimes 30% or 50% depending on the accident. My question for you is, Mary, how much does it cost per unit to make your vehicles order of magnitude like a third safer, 30% or 50% safer? Is it hundreds of dollars, is it a thousand, or is it in the thousands of dollars, just order of magnitude?", "Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.", "So, Adam, we don't really disclose that type of pricing from a technology perspective. What I would say is if you look at our vehicles, there's tremendous safety features on them already, whether it's airbags or the lane detection, emergency braking, rear object detection, and even when you back up from a perpendicular perspective. And a lot of the technologies on the vehicle today that we have put on and offset to a large extent the technology for safety are finding cost improvements, material cost improvements and just overall design and efficiency of the vehicle.", "And the way I look at it is all this technology is making the driver safer today on the roads. We'll continue on that journey, but I think the real step function happens with autonomous, because you really then get to a point, again, if you've implemented autonomous very safely and really understand all the dynamics that will happen, there's an infinite number of situations that drivers and our vehicles will see and how you respond to those is going to be critical. That's where you get the step function improvement. So I don't see it as it's $300 gets you this, $500 gets you this. That's not really the way we look at it. We continue to look at how do we incorporate the safety technology into the vehicle, looking at affordability today, and I would call that the evolutionary path, and then autonomous is more of the revolutionary path, and we're working to drive those costs down, but again we have ensured those in detail.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. The reason why I ask is because, although fully autonomous is a noble initiative, and it's coming and to get the real 95% to 100% type reductions, it seems we can't \u2013 if there are technologies that are vastly easier to implement and more affordable in an ownership model that can lead to a 50% reduction, that's worth implementing as well. It just raises industry questions about the insurability of the vehicles that you're selling today without these systems and the value that they would have in the secondhand markets. We'll continue that discussion.", "Maybe, Chuck, a question for you then lastly. You mentioned the goal of $6 billion of adjusted auto free cash flow. When I look year to date, though, and take the $10 billion of automotive operating cash flow and I take out CapEx, I get a number of $3.2 billion. So I guess when you say adjusted, there are some changes you're making to that number; because you're not implying you're going to make almost $3 billion as free cash flow in the fourth quarter. Is that fair?", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Yeah. The noise in that is pension. So...", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. All right.", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "So we funded that with debt, so you just add the $2 billion, so the $3.2 billion you get $5.2 billion of free cash flow ex-pension contribution.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Because I guess the big investor question we're getting is, that is a competition for the cash, right. And even if it's not every year, they are with some regular frequency. So like last year you made $5 of earnings; but the free cash flow per share, including the pension contributions and a lot of other unusual stuff, was about $1.30. So there was a big gap. You're narrowing that gap this year. Maybe if you include the pension funding, you get to close to half like (49:13) to maybe if you do $6 plus of earnings and you do $3 of free cash flow a share, but you still have that gap. So the question, Chuck, is will this gap be narrowed so that your $6 or so of earnings can really reflect cash earnings as well? And what are the factors you think that can drive the narrowing of that gap? Thanks.", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Yeah. First, just, let's go back to the pension just to be clear, that was a debt-for-debt funding, right. And for display purposes, on a GAAP basis, it's taking out of operating cash flow, obviously free cash flow would add back in because it's debt-for-debt. So the $5.2 billion is the right adjusted free cash flow number and consistent with our $6 billion target free cash flow at the end of the year and that's what we'll apply to our capital allocation framework.", "When you look at our overall difference between EPS and cash, obviously, we have cash taxes, and that's going to be and have been roughly $1 billion a year. Capital spending is higher than D&A, because we've underspent for a number of years and it's going to take a while to catch that up. And pensions; at the end of the day, we have pension income that is non-cash that gets reversed. So I would say that, as we look forward, the way I think about it is our conversion ratio should improve on a go-forward basis, because incremental EBIT is highly levered to cash flow on a go-forward basis and that's what I've talked about before.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "So the gap has got to be driven by operational improvement. There is nothing else in the adjustments that you see improving that gap. That's how I'm interpreting that.", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Well, over time, there will be puts and takes. D&A is going to obviously catch up, and our cash tax rates or our ultimate cash tax payment will increase versus where we are today over time, and we'll start to accrue GMF dividends. But over the next two years or three years, it's going to be operational improvement and leverage.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks, everybody.", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes. Good morning. A quick housekeeping question and then a more strategic question. Housekeeping is, Chuck, you had mentioned fourth quarter production could be sequentially up. Just to clarify, IHS forecasts a lot of (51:53) 14% year-over-year in 4Q in North America. That's down somewhat sequentially just given the holiday. So just wanted to clarify what you're expecting.", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "So we expect sequentially 2016 Q4 versus 2016 Q3 to be up slightly, maybe 3% on a FUS basis, right, our factory unit sale basis, which would be production plus imports versus 2015 Q4, it looks like we'll be up 150,000 units or so, all things equal, on the basis of our outlook right now.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. The more strategic question is China over the summer has made more noise about new energy vehicles. Europe, culminating in the German Bundestag floating an idea of eliminating ICE sales by 2030. So (52:57) just three propositions. One, do you think there is a realistic possibility that China and Europe actually get the EV penetrations mid next decade, well ahead of the U.S.? Two, given their penchant for favoring the home team, how are you positioned? And in particular, we hear most of what you're doing around electrification and autonomous for U.S. markets; but how are you thinking about those internationally? And three, how do you think it's going to affect the mid-term to longer term profitability of those regions?", "Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.", "So clearly, we believe that China is going to lead in the penetration of electric vehicles into the market, and that's why we've announced that we have 10 new energy vehicles coming out. I would say we're also the only OEM that actually manufactures batteries in-country right now. Clearly, we have the strength of the products that we have available to sell globally, with the second generation Volt as well as the Bolt EV and the Ampera-e, along with many other electrified products in China.", "So we definitely see that trend. I think one of the things, though, and this is where we also have an advantage with our PATAC Engineering Center, that we can really leverage the supply base and that volume in China to really help us globally from a electrification perspective, and we intend to do that.", "I would also say, from a European perspective, we definitely are seeing more of a move, and we'll be announcing the Ampera-e next year that, with some of the different issues associated with emissions, there is a much stronger interest and focus on electrification.", "We clearly think the highest market will be China. I think we'll see progress in both the U.S. and Europe. I would also say, though, we've got some very good diesel products that we're launching, both cars and trucks, that are getting very good market reception. And so I think it's too soon to exactly call how the penetration is going to be, but definitely probably more significant than we thought maybe a year or two ago.", "And clearly, we've got to get the scale and get the engineering work done, that we can have minimal impact from a margin perspective.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And I guess, similar for autonomy, do you think China will accelerate and, maybe not surpass the U.S., but pull even with it, just given the density of the populations in the urban centers?", "Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.", "Again, there's so many issues that have to be resolved to be able to say who is going to be first. Not only is it getting safe technology deployed \u2013 and I think we're in a excellent position, that we intend to be among the first or the first with safe autonomous vehicles. And then we do have the capacity to build those at scale. But you have to look at how the regulatory environment will impact around the globe, and in China, there are certain restrictions to mapping technology as well. So I think there is a lot to play out to right now call who is going to lead.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our final question today comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. The first question was just on the incentive spending commentary in North America \u2013 or in the U.S. I guess, that you mentioned earlier, down as a percent of ATPs in the fourth quarter versus third quarter. And you mentioned the October data point. But, first of all, isn't that always the case at this time of year as the model mix changes? I guess what I was wondering is if you could give us a sense of, if you believe, on a like-for-like basis, incentive spending for the industry and for GM will be flat, up, or down on a year-over-year basis in the quarter?", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Well, I guess I would just look at the trend year-to-date. The trend year-to-date is that the industry, the incentive spend as a percentage of transaction price through the first three quarters of the year is up on a year-over-year basis. Off the top of my head, 60 basis points to 70 basis points, so somewhere from a 10.6% to 11.3%, we're generally in that range as well, maybe 11.4%.", "I would expect, and you're right, typically, depending on how the model changes are going for all of the competition, Q4 has a tendency to ramp down a little bit, because you've launched the new model of your vehicles, for us specifically, because we're in really good shape from that perspective, but we'd expect the industry broadly to follow that same trend. But I'd also expect on a year-over-year basis, it will be up, consistent with what's happened in the first nine months of the year.", "Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Okay. And then one quick one on the free cash flow guidance, which I know you reiterated for this year; and I think back in January over 16 to 18, you called for a $6 billion to $7 billion range. A, I guess I want to understand if you think that range is still valid? And then I know, Mary, at the beginning of the call, you said some investment might be funded by greater-than-expected cost efficiencies. But can you give us an indication of how much within that $6 billion to $7 billion is actually a headwind from spending on items such as electrification, autonomous, or other ventures?", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Well, one, we'll have more specific guidance on beyond 2016 in January, but generally speaking, we would expect to generate strong cash flow over the next number of years, and we haven't changed our perspective on that. And this year's $6 billion is, we're on track to deliver that. Relative to this, the second question, and I'll let Mary speak to it as well. But free cash flow is after we make investments and everything else. So, obviously, if we expect to continue to maintain strong cash flow, that's after we've funded investments in autonomous or engineering for autonomous or future technologies, just as \u2013 broadly speaking.", "Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.", "That's absolutely correct.", "Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yes. I guess what I was wondering is, said another way, how much higher would it have been if you weren't making investments (59:35)?", "Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.", "Yeah. I kind of figured that was your question. And I'm not quite ready to \u2013 think we're ready to go out and start to saying, we're investing X on autonomous vehicle or future technology engineering, because you got to kind of \u2013 what technology are you speaking to specifically? I would suggest, versus the previous plan as we really started to ramp up. Our activities around autonomous vehicles, the amount that we're spending does not have a B attached to it.", "Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.", "And I would also say, the efficiencies that we're seeing when you can reuse our contextures that we have on \u2013 that are launching or have on the road right now and you look at the development costs to do the next-generation architecture versus reusing, that's all as I mentioned, investment that can be redeployed in the transformative technology.", "Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thanks lot, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Randy Arickx.", "Randy Arickx - General Motors Co.", "And I'll hand it over to Mary for closing remarks.", "Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.", "Great, thanks. Thanks, everybody, for participating. I hope you can see we are working hard to make sure the core business is operating in a very disciplined fashion and we have the opportunity for continued strong performance. And that is key because we are then investing in the transformative technologies that we've just talked about, building on our leading connectivity, building on the strong options that we have in the marketplace now and we'll continue to launch with the Volt, with Bolt EV and with other electrification products, as well as our work in fuel cells. We are being very aggressive from an autonomous perspective and leveraging the knowledge that we have to do that safely, and then also from a sharing perspective with both the alliance with Lyft and with Maven. So we understand this is a ever-challenging global marketplace, but I hope that you see that we are a very focused and disciplined leadership team and we're going to continue to execute our plans and drive profitable growth.", "I really appreciate everybody participating today and I look forward to talking to you next year.", "Operator"], "Symbol": "General Motors Co.
