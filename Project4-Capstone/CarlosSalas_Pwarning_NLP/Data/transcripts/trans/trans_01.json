I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Tommy Thomas, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.", "Tommy Thomas - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, Christy. Good afternoon and welcome to PerkinElmer's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. If you have not received a copy of today's earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until November 19, 2015.", "Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings.

To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call that are not reconciled to GAAP in the attachment, we will provide the reconciliations promptly.", "I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we delivered strong financial results during the third quarter. We grew revenue on a constant currency basis by 10% and grew organic revenue by 6% with 7% growth in Human Health and 5% growth in Environmental Health. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 16% on a constant currency basis, and we continued to expand adjusted operating margins.", "Through the first nine months of 2015, we are tracking well to our financial guidance provided in January despite some incremental headwinds in a few end markets. The success we saw in the third quarter reinforces PerkinElmer's strategy of innovating across our core capabilities of detection, imaging, software and service, which allows us to build strong market positions and attractive end markets.", "Our deep market knowledge and breadth of scientific capabilities means we can deliver targeted solutions to our customers, fueling breakthroughs that help improve quality and longevity of life. I would like to highlight a few examples from the third quarter, where our unique capabilities continued to support our customers in the critical work they perform. In the area of imaging, we are working with a number of top-tier research institutions in cancer immunotherapy through advanced research and the interaction between mechanism of host and disease.", "Using PerkinElmer's vector multispectral imaging platform combined with our novel multiplex labeling reagents and image analysis algorithms, these customers are now able to visualize and quantify the complex relationships between cancer and immune cells in samples of diseased tissue. Critically, these interactions are shedding light on important biological pathways at the heart of immuno-oncology such as PD-1 and PDL-1 that are enabling some of the most promising new cancer treatments.", "Additionally, during the third quarter we expanded our relationship with the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Science in Victoria, Australia. Researchers there are relying on a number of our analytical instruments and lab automation systems to study the impact of inhaled oxytocin on preventing or treating postpartum hemorrhage, a leading cause of mental mortality or maternal mortality.", "In the area of research, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies recently purchased our suite of high content imaging and informatics solutions to screen their vast libraries of compounds and assays, the activity of small molecules and biologics on suther (4:33) phenotypes.", "PerkinElmer scientists and engineers have developed a way to read out this activity at the cellular and sub-cellular levels and combined with our advanced machine learning based software, we're enabling this customer to automate and rapidly deploy image analysis across large numbers of samples.", "The key element behind our ability to meet customers' big data challenges has been the development and validation of enterprise informatics solutions to enable the integration and management of these rich, complex, multivariate data sets. I've shared this particular example because it reinforces the value of offering unique imaging and detection capabilities as well as the analysis visualization and collaboration software to understand, interpret and share relevant information.", "Increasingly, our research customers are realizing the value in our full solutions that draw upon our entire portfolio, including informatics, OneSource services and advanced imaging and detection products. In the third quarter alone, business with our top research global accounts, which comprised about 10% of our sales grew mid teens. This ability to combine detection analysis software and service has been one of the cornerstones of our newborn screening business for many years and is why PerkinElmer solutions and expertise are vital components in global healthcare agendas.", "Our newborn screening franchise continued to make good progress in the quarter to support customers' needs to expand screening. In Kyrgyzstan, a new program was established that will serve about 250,000 births per year. We also helped to bring skin testing to more countries piloting menu expansions, and in our medical lab in Suzhou, China is meeting pent-up demand for neonatal, prenatal and infectious disease screening across China.", "During the third quarter, we continued to introduce new products into the market, as we are committed to both responding to and anticipating change through a relentless focus on innovation to solve customer challenges. In the third quarter, we debuted our Opal tissue staining kits, which are part of our new Phenoptics workflow offering and includes staining capabilities, imaging technologies and image analysis software to help customers in the fast growing area of quantitative pathology. As I mentioned previously, these capabilities are enabling researchers, oncologists and pathologists to better characterize immune cells and tumor cells within tissue in ways not previously possible.", "During Q3, we also launched Signals for Translational, which is a cloud-based informatics platform for pharmaceutical researchers that aggregates, manages and analyzes experimental and clinical data from multiple sources. Signals for Translational helps scientists better progress from data acquisition to biomarker discovery and validation as they develop drugs tailored to patient's individual needs. And with the growing majority of top global pharmaceutical companies engaged in translational work. We see PerkinElmer's Signals platform as a key enabler in this field.", "In addition, we introduced the TGA 8000 analyzer for advance materials characterization. This is a prime example of how we are evolving our detection capabilities so that PerkinElmer customers can better progress from samples to answers and insights. The TGA's range of applications includes determining contaminates in products or in their packaging. To answer an increasing need across the customer base, this instrument runs on new software for high sensitivity thermal analysis and features remote status monitoring.", "As we move ahead, we see clear opportunities that benefit from positive long-term trends across human and environmental health. In the near-term however, we are balancing our long-term enthusiasm, while closely monitoring several areas of uncertainty. Among the strongest tailwinds are the biotech and pharma markets, where our global account approach and product offerings give us access to attractive areas bolstered by heavy customer investment.", "Additionally in China, while the overall economy is slowing, the criticality of our solutions directly address long-term priorities for the country. Last week's announcement of the end to the one child policy should noticeably boost our business over the next several years. Furthermore, the government's focus on ensuring a cleaner environment, safer food and overall access to healthcare will hopefully translate into positive impacts for both local funding and China's next Five Year Plan.", "In Europe, a number of countries' economies are stabilizing, although the current immigration issue could redirect spending in certain sectors. And lastly, the US is on track for solid growth as we close out the year.", "On the other hand, a significant headwind in the short-term is Japan's deteriorating economy as funding delays are causing very weak academic and government spending. Our medical imaging business also faces tougher market conditions than it has in years past. More recently, customer ordering patterns for this business have become incrementally challenging, creating further softness in the fourth quarter.", "Furthermore, as you're all aware, the strength of the US dollar is posing challenges for emerging countries such as Brazil. This is coupled with the drop in oil prices, forcing oil-producing countries to normalize demand, potentially softening future revenues and curtailing research and spending on improving healthcare.", "On balance, we are optimistic about the macro conditions but recognize some markets remain challenging. Based on our guidance for the fourth quarter of 3% to 4% organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $0.86 to $0.89, we would deliver full-year results of 8% revenue growth in constant currency, organic revenue growth of 4% and adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis of approximately 13%.", "However, just as important as these financial results, we continue to make excellent progress in advancing the strategic priorities of the company and improving our operational and technical capabilities. Our success to date positions us to deliver on our commitments to our customers and shareholders while driving our mission to improve human and environmental health.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to give more color around our Q3 results and fourth quarter guidance.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our third quarter results and details around our fourth quarter 2015 guidance. Given the continuing impact of foreign exchange on the comparability of our results, I'll once again provide much of my commentary on a constant currency basis in order to better portray the results in the quarter.", "For the third quarter, we reported approximately 10% constant currency revenue growth and 6% organic revenue growth with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 6%. As we have previously communicated, there was an extra week in the third quarter and we estimate the impact of that extra week on organic revenues was approximately 2%.", "Adjusted revenues were $563.6 million in the third quarter as compared to $542.9 million in the same period a year ago, driven by broad-based demand. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.60, up 16% on a constant currency basis from $0.57 in the comparable period a year ago. Looking at our geographic results, we experienced mid single digit organic revenue growth in the Americas and Asia and high single digit organic revenue growth in Europe.", "Year-to-date, organic revenue growth has been mid single digits across all three regions. We are pleased to report that our results in Europe have shown positive organic growth in the last five quarters and we expect demand in Europe to remain stable for the balance of the year. In China, revenues grew high single digits organically and we remain comfortable with our full year outlook of high single digit organic revenue growth.", "As to our operating results, third quarter adjusted gross margins were $47.2%, up 40 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by volume leverage, mix and productivity gains. For the nine month period, gross margins improved by 50 basis points on a constant currency basis.", "Third quarter adjusted SG&A was 24.8% of adjusted revenues, essentially flat over the same period a year ago. For the first nine months of 2015, SG&A is down 50 basis points on a constant currency basis, the result of continued operating leverage and from our indirect spend initiatives.", "Research and development spending in the third quarter was up modestly as compared to the same period a year ago, driven by continued investments in innovative new product development and incremental investment at Perten. Year to date R&D spending is up approximately 30 basis points on both a reported and adjusted basis as the impact from FX was immaterial.", "Overall, we were pleased with our operational performance in the third quarter as we expanded our constant currency adjusted operating margins over 50 basis points and approximately 70 basis points year to date. We're encouraged by our third quarter margin expansion given the difficult comparison from the prior period.", "Net interest and other expense in the third quarter was approximately $12 million, impacted by higher than expected foreign currency losses in the period offsetting a favorable adjusted tax rate for the quarter of approximately 19%. We expect our adjusted tax rate for the full year to be approximately 20.5%, which is consistent with our performance year to date.", "Switching to the segments, third quarter organic revenues in our Human Health business increased approximately 7% and Environmental Health organic revenues grew approximately 5%. Year to date, organic revenues have increased 5% in our Human Health business and 3% in our Environmental Health business.", "From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 61% of reported revenue in the quarter with diagnostics contributing 28% of revenue and research 33% of revenue. Organic revenue growth from our diagnostic business increased high single digits off a double digit comparison in the comparable prior year period. This was driven by continued strength in our newborn screening franchise offset by flat organic revenue in medical imaging due to difficult prior year comparisons and customer ordering patterns.", "We continue to be encouraged by the broad acceptance of our new cassette and CMOS offerings, but expect a challenging fourth quarter due to softening demand within the radiology and radiation oncology end markets. We expect these conditions to persist through the first half of 2016, but anticipate the softness to be partially offset by demand for our new cassette and CMOS product launches.", "We once again experienced strength across our diagnostics offerings in China, growing double digit in the quarter with a strong performance in our newborn screening and prenatal business. As Rob mentioned, we're pleased that China has announced the elimination of the one child policy, and we believe that this should have a positive impact for our diagnostics offerings over the next several years. Our Haoyuan blood screening business had an excellent quarter of growth, albeit off a low base. We're hopeful that the adoption and enforcement of nucleic acid testing begins to ramp more quickly in the coming months, but visibility as to the exact timing remains unclear.", "Organic revenue in our life science solutions business grew high single digits in the third quarter, driven by strong instrument sales and high content screening and imaging, strength from our informatics offerings and robust growth at our OneSource multi-vendor services in spite of a very difficult prior year comparison. We continue to be pleased with the double digit growth we're seeing with key global pharmaceutical and biotech customers, the result of our efforts since early this year to better combine our research, informatics and OneSource multi-vendor service offerings into targeted solutions.", "Globally, we continue to see stability in academic and government end markets, while pharma and biotech markets have improved with the exception of Japan, which continues to experience weak demand.", "Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented approximately 39% of reported revenue in the quarter. Revenues grew 5% organically. Our third quarter results benefited from increased food and environmental demand with stability in industrial end markets, driven to a large extent by success from our inorganic, Perten and material characterization offerings.", "We're pleased to report that Perten had another good quarter. I recently visited with the team in Sweden and came away more bullish about the opportunity to expand our addressable market as we look to develop more dedicated food analyzers combined with our FTIR capabilities with Perten's core technology. We believe there are a number of additional cross-business opportunities as Perten benefits from the broader global reach and footprint of PerkinElmer.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the third quarter with approximately $1 billion of debt and nearly $200 million of cash. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million of our outstanding shares for a total consideration of approximately $72 million. We exited the quarter with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times.", "Turning to cash flow. We continue to see strong cash collections, offset by additional inventory requirements. Year to date adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations was $189 million, essentially flat versus the same period a year ago. The increase in working capital reflects additional inventory related to new product launches, including our relationship with Waters, as well as normal seasonal patterns. We expect these levels to decline over the balance of the year and continue to expect our full year adjusted free cash flow to net income ratio to be consistent with our guidance provided earlier in the year.", "Overall, we are pleased with our year to date performance as revenues grew organically 4%, gross and operating margins expanded 50 and 70 basis points respectively and adjusted earnings per share grew 15%, all on a constant currency basis. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we believe we were well positioned across the majority of the portfolio to deliver another solid top and bottom line performance despite a couple of areas of softness, specifically medical imaging in Japan as well as the strengthening of the dollar.", "As a result, we now expect our fourth quarter reported revenues to be in the range of $610 million to $620 million, which represents approximately 7% constant currency revenue growth and organic revenue growth in a range of 3% to 4%. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.89, which represents approximately 9% constant currency growth at the midpoint.", "For the full year, we're narrowing the range of our adjusted earnings per share to $2.56 to $2.59, with the midpoint maintained at $2.57, representing 13% constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth. For modeling purposes, you should focus on the midpoint of the revenue adjusted EPS guidance ranges, as our most likely view for the fourth quarter.", "This concludes my prepared remarks. Christy, at this time we could open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. I guess my first question is really on capital deployment. So Rob, you've talked about having $1 billion of M&A capacity for the next few years. You've talked about the deal pipeline being robust, but acknowledged that valuations are still pretty high. I think while it's only been a few quarters since you outlined some of the criteria, the activity has been somewhat limited. Would you be willing to share how you're thinking about the deal pipeline today and when you might pivot to other ways of deploying capital, if the opportunity to pursue M&A remains limited?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. So as you mentioned, we continue to feel like we've got a good pipeline. I would say it's again as you mentioned, I think some of the valuations have been a little challenging. So one of the things, I think Andy talked about it, we did buy some shares back in the third quarter. I think it was about $70 million or so we spent on share repurchasing. And the way we're thinking about this is, obviously as the deployment of the capital from an M&A perspective gets delayed, obviously in the quarters we continue to generate more cash flow. So we're getting more comfortable with the idea of saying we can take shares out and still maintain significant capacity to do M&A. So that's why you saw in third quarter, we started to get a little more aggressive on the share buybacks. And so I think if we continue to be unable to do some things on M&A perspective, we would continue to return the cash back to shareholders through share buyback.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Is there some point where you might thinking about doing something more meaningful in the form of a buyback?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think we continue to feel pretty optimistic about our ability to do some things on the M&A perspective. So hopefully, we'll see how things change, but as of right now, I think given our view that we think we can get some things done here, probably unlikely to see something where it would be a big share buyback, but I think doing a little bit of both I think is probably what I would expect going forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. This is actually Joel Kaufman in for Issac. Just to start off first with margins. Obviously the margin story has progressed nicely over the past couple years. Could you maybe just clarify exactly what are the key operational initiatives you guys are focused on going forward to drive that next leg of margin expansion aside from driving just top line growth?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Well, I think a key part of it is the leverage we're going to get from the top line. We've always said that's really about half of what we think we can deliver from a margin expansion perspective. We also have talked quite a bit about indirect spend. Year to date we actually on a constant currency basis have saved $10 million year over year on our indirect spend initiative. So we're actually a little ahead of schedule there. Obviously, all this has been impacted somewhat by the change in FX rates, but I think overall we still feel comfortable with that cadence of 60 to 80 basis points, 70 to 100 basis points of margin expansion going forward, assuming reasonable growth.", "We also have rolled out some lean initiatives. I think that's going to help drive some of the progress on the gross margin side, specifically within the factory. So I think you're going to see really three pieces, continue tight controls over SG&A. I think you'll, it continue to see margin expansion on the gross margin side through factory enhancements and efficiencies. And then the leverage we get from the top line and hopefully that's also going to end up continuing to be a positive mix as we're seeing Human Health grow at a faster pace than Environmental Health and they have higher margins.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. And then just one on Europe, appreciate the comments you guys made earlier there and calling out the strength and in the region. Should we be thinking about that as just easing comps or a broader improvement in underlying demand?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I actually think it's a little bit of both. I mean clearly we're getting the benefit of a difficult 2014, but I think at the same time, we mentioned the fact that we are seeing some stabilization in demand, and so I think going forward, we feel pretty good about the pace of growth in Europe. I would say the only area that we're sort of watching a little closely here, and again I think we called that out a little bit, is with the recent pressure on the immigration, we're a little concerned that you could see some shifting of prioritization and to the extent that that may impact some of the incremental spending going into healthcare and research. But generally speaking, we feel pretty good about the demand profile in Europe.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Bryan Brokmeier of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.", "Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi, good afternoon. Furthering the question on M&A. Have you seen, you said you've seen challenging valuations, but some other companies in the space have talked about seeing some of those valuations come down, start to pull in a little bit. Some companies are starting to be a little bit more reasonable given the pullback in the space. Are you seeing that as well? And then secondly you also I believe talked about having about $1 billion in capacity to do M&A. Is that still how you'd look at it despite the recent share buybacks and sort of other things you've done with your capital deployment?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I would say on the valuation side, possibly, I mean probably for us the fact that the IPO market is getting a little bit more challenging probably with the smaller private companies, I think that's helpful. I think for some of the more public companies, I don't think the valuations expectations have changed much at least from my perspective. With regard to the $1 billion, I mean the way we think about that is both our borrowing capacity as well as our free cash flow generation over the next couple years. And I think the combination of those two leads us to believe that we could probably spend up to $1 billion.", "Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Great. And what areas that you most focused on? You recently I guess that's been about a year now since you did the Perten acquisition. But is food safety still an area where you're focused on or are you more taking a look at on the Human Health side such as diagnostics and your biopharma business?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well I think first of all, one of the good things I think about PerkinElmer is both businesses I think have attractive aspects from an end market perspective. So clearly the environmental side, whether it's food or even in some of the applications within water, I think we continue to be \u2013 I think are very attractive. On the Human Health side, I think both the area of diagnostics, anything we could do to expand our franchise there. And selectively within the research areas again and then I would say the other area which really cuts across both is the area of software and informatics. So I think across the majority of the businesses, we would looked to be adding there from a bolt-on acquisition perspective.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Mira Minkova of Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi, good afternoon guys. Thank you for taking my question.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Maybe, let me start with your organic growth guidance for the fourth quarter. It seems like a bit of step down versus what you've done in the last couple of quarters, 3% to 4%. Appreciate that you had mentioned the comments on Japan, medical imaging. Is there anything else that we should be considering that may be happening in the fourth quarter, and also what are you assuming for budget flush there?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So first of all, we're not assuming any budget flush in the numbers that we are forecasting. But I would say probably three things, and you mentioned two of them. One is clearly medical imaging and Japan and we probably think those combined are probably a 150 basis point headwind. And then I would say the third thing is if you recall, we had fairly strong Q4 last year. So we are cycling against a pretty strong comp. So, I would say the combination of those three things is something that we're considering when we give the guidance.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Got you. And on the change to the one child policy in China, obviously that you called it out, it must be a good thing for you. Help us, if you could please remind us how big your China neonatal business is right now, and how would you think about the impact?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So first of all, I would say I think the impact longer term is going to be very helpful. When you think about 17 million children born in China, the potential for that to grow and maybe grow fairly significantly I think is real. I think the real question is, how long or what's sort of the ramp, and of course I think that's a difficult thing to quantify in the short term.", "One of the things we have done is we've gone back and you may recall in November of 2013, there was a relaxation of the one child policy for parents who were only children. And if you look over the last two years, there has been about 1.4 million of those parents that have applied for second children. That represents a little bit more than 10% of the parents that were actually eligible to do that. And if we go back and look at our business, that probably tracks pretty well that we think that had about a 12% to 15% impact on the growth in the newborn screening business. So again, if that's sort of a proxy of what's going to happen this time, you're going to see an increase, but it's going to be a fairly slow ramp. Hope that's helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, with all the focus on new products, I guess can we get an update on what you're seeing in contribution from all the new products you launched earlier this year?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we feel very good about the progress there. We talked about it in the beginning of the year, about a $30 million or $35 million contribution incrementally in 2015, and we think we're going to exceed the top end of that range. As we look at through the Q3 and what our expectations are for Q4, we think we'll be north of the $35 million incremental benefit.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. And do you have any anecdotes about the kind of synergies you now see (32:33) informatics and some of the other businesses? I know you've kind of moved around different pieces of the business lately, but an update on the synergies you're seeing there?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah well, a couple of them I sort of mentioned in my prepared remarks when I talked about the progress we're having with the sort of pharmaceutical companies. When we think about historically, we would have provided them say imaging equipment and now by packaging that together, we have customers now that are not only ordering our imaging equipment, but ordering some of our software, specifically sort of high content imaging software as well as Spotfire licenses and even in some cases enterprise related software. And if you look at the key global accounts, the top 20 global accounts where we've combined our informatics, OneSource and product offerings, those customers are growing mid teens through the first three quarters of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Arias of Citi. Your line is open.", "Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, guys. This is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Dan. Rob, question for you. I mean on the margin \u2013 Rob or Andy. On the margin front, I mean strong organic. I know the mix was probably a little bit less favorable just because it was 61% versus 62% last year. But was still surprised by the soft incremental contributions here despite the strong organic pull through. So what were the dynamics there that maybe softened that? Was it one-time items? Was it mix, or was there something else in there?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I would say first of all, if you look at the beat on the top line, that fundamentally came in two areas. One is OneSource, and I think Andy talked about this was very strong. So we saw very strong growth in the OneSource offering. Again potentially benefited from the point earlier, where we're sort of combining it with OneSource in the product offerings and that has lower incrementals.", "I would say the other thing to point out is when we talked about the incremental higher revenue from the additional week, that also comes at relatively low margins. Because if you think about it, you're amortizing the cost sort of again 1/52 over that period of time, and the revenue for those additional days is much lower. So again the flow through on the incremental revenue from the week and the incremental revenue from OneSource lowers the flow through. Having said that, if you look at our EPS growth on a constant currency basis, it was still 16%.", "Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Appreciate it, and a two pronged one. One, the Europe comment that you had, are you guys seeing any softness because of a massive influx of refugees or is that just kind of a long tail? And the other thing is, can you just contextualize maybe the Opal tissue contribution cloud-based stuff, the launch that you did in 3Q with next year? Just early color, market, addressable market size, et cetera.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah so I would say, so first of all, I don't know that we're seeing anything directly from an orders perspective, but I would say we're hearing it in discussions with customers. So I would say it's a concern; at least it's a concern of the customers. But I wouldn't say we're seeing any hard evidence of that today. But I think obviously something we're aware of. I think with regard to the imaging opportunities, I think the way we think about that today is largely in the research use only, and I think in that, it's probably a $30 million to $40 million market opportunity for us. I think the greater market potential is to get it into the clinic. And that's something we're talking about and discussing internally, whether we make that investment or partner. But I think the significant growth opportunity there would be more in the clinical side. But having said that, we do see a nice $30 million to $40 million market on the research use only.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Rob, we've seen in the market more entries into the service side of the business. Are you seeing greater competition because of your success in the service strategy you deployed quite a while ago?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know that we're seeing any more competition. I guess my view is the competition has always been pretty formidable. But as I sort of mentioned before, we continue to do quite well. OneSource had a very strong quarter in Q3. And if you look at sort of year to date, they're growing well in the sort of mid teens or better. So we continue to do well and I think it has to do with not only I think the reputation and execution capability of the team, but also as we increase our capabilities around software informatics and again package it with this global account focus. We continue to see significant opportunity to grow that business.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "And then lastly on the reagent side, I know that's been lower growth that you've liked in the past. How do you feel about your product mix now on the reagent side of your portfolio?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well I would say on the Human Health side particularly on research, that's been a real area of focus from an R&D perspective, sort of late 2014 and 2015, and we saw nice traction this quarter. So I think our reagents were up about, I'll call it low to mid teens in the quarter. Obviously diagnostics was strong; we saw strong in research. I think environmental is still an area, and it's less research and it's more consumables. We're seeing decent growth there, but we still need to get that up as a percentage of our revenue. But we were pleased with the performance, like I said particularly on the research side this quarter as some the investments we made in research and development were providing us benefits.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hello.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hello.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hi, Derik.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Can you hear me? Hey.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Can you give a little bit more color on the medical imaging business? I mean are those products a little bit higher margin? and I guess what overall percentage of your sales is the medical imaging business?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So medical imaging is probably I think call it 8% of our revenue, depending on the quarter, but in that sort of general range. If you look at medical imaging, you can think about it in three markets, there is the radiology market, there is an oncology market, and then there is I'll call it an industrial market. And roughly speaking, we'll call that a third, a third, a third. We continue to do very well in the industrial market. I think that's a combination of some new products we've gotten out there and I think we continue to capture share there. I think the challenge that we face is more in the radiology and oncology.", "And I would point out a couple things. First of all, obviously this is a business while we continue to think is very attractive, has a demand profile that's probably more volatile than the rest of the other PerkinElmer businesses, largely because it serves a more capital-intensive end market. So again, while we think it's an attractive business, clearly differentiated capabilities and overall serving attractive markets, it is going to have a little bit more volatility because of the capital intensity of their customers.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. That's helpful. And did I hear you correctly, you felt like the medical imaging business would be down in at least until the second half of next year?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think we believe it will be down in Q4 and we're not really getting into 2016 guidance now. But I would say it's probably going to be stronger in the back half of 2016 than it is in the front half. Unclear whether it'll actually be down in the first half of 2016.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dane Leone of BTIG. Your line is open.", "Dane Leone - BTIG LLC", "Hi. Thank you very much for the update. So kind of a bigger picture question here. You guys have a good diversity of businesses, where you are a leader in those businesses and that's served you guys pretty well, especially over the last couple quarters versus peers in terms of some volatility. I guess the strategic question is, you guys have flexibility and can be pretty nimble into moving into new markets. What's the appetite for moving into some of the higher growth, higher margin markets more aggressively like clinical diagnostics, perhaps point of care, molecular or more of the core genomic space?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I guess the way I would describe that is, when we think about sort of philosophically the portfolio in businesses that we're sort of attracted to, I would say we think about a couple things. First of all, is it a business that fits well with PerkinElmer. And what I mean by that is, is it consistent with our mission and vision around human, environmental health. The second thing is, is it attractive from the end-market, again does it have differentiated capabilities, are the financial returns attractive, and then finally, are we appropriate owners, meaning can we make it better, are we willing to invest in it and what does it do for the overall portfolio.", "So I think a number of the areas that you mentioned, I think probably fit all those from the standpoint it's consistent with the mission, obviously attractive growth, in some cases we'd have to understand and make sure the financial returns are appropriate. And I think a lot of them would fit well with what we do. So whether it's additional investments in clinical diagnostics or et cetera. Just finding the right assets and making sure the returns make sense relative to the price. But I think all those areas and a majority of those areas are ones that I think we would find attractive, if we thought the asset fit well with what we're trying to achieve and we could make sense out of the financial returns.", "Dane Leone - BTIG LLC", "So if we think about the success that you've had with the Caliper transaction, moving into new markets or adjacencies, do you think it's a better strategy to work in maybe a smaller part of the market and then broaden out, say like starting in single cell and then broaden out, or go with a very broad platform technology to kind of make the first footprint there?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well it's a little hard to generalize overall, but I would say our success has been generally more in areas that are sort of more niched, where we can be differentiated based on capability and rather than taking on some of the larger players in let's say molecular diagnostics or some of the broader areas.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, guys. Thanks for all the color here and thanks for taking the questions. Just two pretty simple ones from me, one for Rob and one for Andy. Rob, the commentary that you gave on the health of the different end markets was really thorough and really helpful. Would it be fair to say that as we roll it all up, I mean thinking about where we are at health end markets as we look out over the next several months, is it in total roughly the same in terms of the end market growth outlook as a year ago, the moving parts or the sub-components just differently mixed in terms of what's a growth driver or not? And if not then how might you compare the profile, the aggregate end market growth now to a year ago?", "And then my second question for Andy, I wondered if you can give us any sense, based on what you're seeing right now in terms of currencies, what the currency impact on the model might be in 2016, broad strokes, top line margin, earnings impact. If you have any rough sense, it would be very helpful. Thanks guys.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So let me take the first one. So I would say, if we're talking about markets from a geographic perspective, I would have a tendency to agree with you, which is there is sort of pluses and minuses. But I would say the geographic end markets, meaning sort of North America, Europe, emerging markets, sort of puts and takes, but they're probably fairly consistent with what we would expect it in total.", "When I think about the sort of application or the end markets from a customer's perspective, the one exception I would say would be in medical imaging. So I think diagnostics is probably about what we thought, maybe marginally a little bit better. I think research maybe is marginally a little bit better. I think environmental is probably okay and maybe the industrials are a little bit more challenged. So maybe that all balances out. But I do think particularly in the back half of the year, medical imaging is probably being a little \u2013 we're finding the markets a little bit more challenging. So on the margin, if you think about that being 8% of our business or so, it's creating a little bit of a headwind, call it 50 to 100 basis points.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And Steve on your second question, we're in the midst of rolling up our annual plan right now, and obviously the distribution of that revenue and profit is going to have a significant impact on the impact of FX. I will say for the fourth quarter, given where the euro is right now and where some of the other currencies, larger buckets are, it's probably a $0.015 to $0.02 of headwind for us in the fourth quarter that's factored into our guidance. But that's how I would characterize it at this point.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Hey guys. Rob, you've been around in business for a long time. I guess, how would you characterize where we are in the cycle? I'm thinking more in the environmental businesses and maybe some of the industrial pieces, where we are in this cycle versus maybe the last cycle. It seems a bit tough to figure out with the US stronger and obviously all the emergings challenged. I mean I guess one, how has it made you think about the positioning of that part of the business longer term, and where you want to play and where you don't want to play? And two I guess, how does it make you think about investments in some of those emerging markets that are kind of going through a recession or recession-like behavior as we speak?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I would say if we're talking about environmental specifically, and we can talk about the other, but the environmental specifically, I think there is parts of that market that continue to be challenged. Right, so we talk about the industrial end markets. And so consequently, what we've talked about and what you've seen us do is to become more focused on where we're going to invest. So if I go back a number of years ago, we were investing across the broad range of technologies and capabilities with environmental. And we would argue that we probably had 12 different product lines across environmental and of course the service applications as well.", "I think as we have gotten more concerned about the \u2013 and I would say most importantly the industrial side \u2013 when you look at things like \u2013 although we're not big in oil and gas, obviously petrochemical and fine chemical \u2013 fine chemicals is an area for us, and some of the offshoots of those, that we want to get more focus in areas both from a technology perspective and an application. So obviously our move with partnering with Waters, where we just said, it doesn't make sense for us to continue to invest in liquid chromatography. We're not strong there. And so that's how I sort of think about it. So I think on the environmental side, what you will see us is more focused, invest in areas where we think we have strong market shares or strong technology capabilities. And in the other areas, we'll either partner or sort of deemphasize.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Perfect. Thank you guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Great. Good afternoon everyone. This is actually Alex Nowak filling in for Bill today. So we have seen some slowing US birth rates in our recent checks. And I was just wondering, can you offset the slowing growth with either menu expansion within the space or from an increase in the number of tests (49:50) the Affordable Care Act?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I would say our data doesn't necessarily support a declining birth rate. Our data would suggest that birth rates are sort of stable, maybe increasing slightly. But the answer to your question is that, yeah, we're always looking to continue to expand the menu. And of course we've got broader offerings that we can provide, whether it's in the software side or continue to build out additional capabilities that we can offer the lab. So I think there is always an opportunity, or we believe there is always an opportunity to continue to grow the business almost irrespective of the birth rate. But having said that, our data would suggest that US birth rates are, like I said, flat to up slightly.", "Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay great. And then this one might be a little hard to tease out since China is ramping so rapidly. But two questions. First in China, did you see any slowdown in the birth rates because of the Year of the Goat. And then second, does it set you up for an easier comp to allow you to repeat the screening performance from this year or even accelerate it?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, the answer to this question is yes on both. We did see a reduction in birth rates because of the Year of the Goat and we do believe that will provide an opportunity to accelerate growth in 2016.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush. Your line is open.", "Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Hi there everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. First on the macro tone in the Chinese business, we've seen some wobbles there from a number of other players. Can you just talk us through the hospitals and end markets there and why you may or not be as sensitive to a harder landing in the region?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So if you think about our diagnostic business in China, it's fundamentally \u2013 I'll call it four businesses. You have the newborn business, which I think continues to grow because you've got adoption rate. So more children are being screened and you've got menu expansion, almost irrespective of birth rates. And we talked about that on the prior question. So I think we can continue to grow there because as we've said on calls in the past, they're still doing only a handful of tests in China. And we're optimistic there for a couple of reasons. We're starting to get some traction around mass spec. And we've mentioned in the past that we got CFDA approval for our GSP which is our automated workstation there. So we think we can continue to drive good growth there and in fact we've seen \u2013 I think in third quarter was sort of mid teens. So we feel good about that.", "Similarly, same dynamics I would say on the prenatal side. So I think we continued both the penetration and the ability to do more there. And similarly, we saw similar type growth on the prenatal side. And then the third area would be in blood screening. And as Andy mentioned, it's off of a low base. But we're going into we think a pretty significant tailwind as the government will start to enforce the mandate of that screening and of course we're one of five that have the capability to do that.", "So last year, it would be on the infectious disease. That's probably the one area where potentially you'll see some slowing on if there was an overall sort of economic slowdown potentially. But again, we see a lot of opportunity to continue to penetrate and expand there. So, but I would say of the areas that we operate in, in the event there was a \u2013 use your words \u2013 hard landing, I would think that's the one that probably is most susceptible to some impact.", "Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Great, thanks. And then a follow-up on one of the last philosophical M&A questions. Given your experiences with Signature Genomics in the past and also NTD Labs, what's your appetite to own a diagnostics lab service business? Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well of course, the two ones you mentioned weren't great, although I think NTD had done okay. I think the issue with Signature was not necessary the lab per se, it was the reimbursement side of things. So I don't know that we would have a particular issue with a service lab per se. I think we just got to make sure that the reimbursement is clear. And so, and of course, outside the US we continue to be quite excited about opportunities in places like India and China. So I think the service lab would be something we would look to invest in, if as long as we had clarity around the reimbursement.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hey guys. This is Steve Breman (54:52) on for Tycho. Thanks for taking the question.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Unknown Speaker", "First wanted to ask on the softer spending just in Japan, which is obviously continuing to be felt throughout the sector. Can you just give us some more color on what you're seeing kind of on the ground floor and is there any hope for any type of recovery in 2016?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So yeah, I think there's hope for recovery in 2016. I would say we're not very optimistic with hope in 2015, because it just seems like the spending is just not being released. And so particularly on the research side is where we see it challenging. And so I would say at this point, we're not expecting any recovery or clearly in Q4. And like I said, we're in the process right now of thinking through 2016. But yeah, I think there's a possibility you could see some recovery in 2016. So we'll just have to wait and see, but I would say clearly not for the last quarter here.", "Unknown Speaker", "Got it. And then I apologize if I missed this, but do you have any updated thoughts on China's new Five Year Plan as the broad themes begin to be disseminated? Obviously still waiting on a lot of details, but seems like environmental initiatives are going to be a key part, so if you could just briefly talk about how that might benefit you.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, that's our sense. As you probably know, I don't think they're going to make it public until March, I believe, so we're waiting to see. Our sort of intelligence and the people on the ground tell us that some of the key areas that we're focused on will continue to be a high priority, so whether it's environmental, whether it's food safety, access to healthcare. So we feel pretty confident that will continue to be key priorities for the government, but probably until March or if they start to leak some of the information out, we really don't have any particular insight.", "Operator", "Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rob Friel for any further remarks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Very well. Thanks for your questions.

Rob?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.", "I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer delivered a solid performance in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a particularly successful year, one in which we delivered significant value for both our customers and shareholders.", "Looking at the fourth quarter specifically, we grew organic revenue by 3% and, on a constant currency basis, grew revenue by 5% and adjusted earnings per share by 11%. We also achieved strong operating cash flow of $126 million, which represented growth of over 30% over the fourth quarter of 2014.", "For the full year, we grew organic revenue by 4% and, on a constant currency basis, grew revenue by 7%, expanded adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points, and increased adjusted earnings per share by 13% to $2.55. All these financial metrics met or exceeded the goals we established in January last year, despite a more challenging economic environment than anticipated.", "In addition to our strong financial performance, we also achieved excellent progress against our 2015 strategic priorities, addressed critical customer needs throughout our end markets, and expanded our capabilities technically, organizationally, and geographically. Moreover, our increased emphasis on innovation is now recognized throughout the industry and has resulted in a number of impressive awards.", "For example, our Phenoptics platform for quantitative pathology was named one of the top 10 innovations of 2015 by The Scientist magazine. And our NexION 350 ICP mass spec was chosen as the best new spectrometer by SelectScience at last year's Pittsburgh Conference.", "As we enter 2016, I'm excited about the opportunities I see to advance our mission and profitably grow the company. While we expect challenging global economic conditions to continue, our hard work up to this point has positioned us well to both invest in several compelling growth opportunities and, at the same time, deliver consistently attractive financial results.", "Specifically, rapidly changing technologies and analytics are playing a more pivotal role in healthcare and science than ever before. Growing populations are demanding better access to expanded healthcare offerings and safer food, while regulatory changes are focusing on the health of our families and the environment.", "The strategic priorities we have set for 2016 support the objective of improving our financial, organizational, and scientific capabilities, enabling us to make an even more profound difference around the world. For this year, the majority of our efforts will be focused on three areas. First, investing where we believe we have the most significant opportunities to increase, maintain, or capture leading share positions.", "Second, we are concentrating and expanding resources to accelerate our current momentum in driving innovation. While some of our competitors compete based on scale and scope, we are directing our efforts towards serving high-growth markets with differentiated capabilities, which we believe will in turn create greater customer value.", "A large part of what differentiates PerkinElmer is our ability to offer novel solutions that leverage the combined power of our technical capabilities and deep application knowledge. This year, we are increasing our efforts to more effectively collaborate with our customers and thereby enhance their scientists' discoveries or, in some cases, jointly enable breakthrough technologies.", "Third, we will continue to drive operational effectiveness globally by implementing a multi-faceted approach aimed at improving processes, simplifying our supply chain, improving quality, and driving efficiencies. This approach, combined with an imperative to continually enhance the organization's talents and skills, will both advance our competitiveness and improve profitability.", "Before Andy provides more color around our financial results and 2016 guidance, I would like to discuss the key strategic areas of focus and the investments we are making to support our future growth.", "With a broad set of offerings, it's important to differentiate our investments and focus on the programs that we believe will best advance our mission and provide the greatest opportunity for healthy financial returns. For 2016, these areas of investment include reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics, food quality and safety, and laboratory services. I'd like to spend a few minutes on each of these four areas.", "Our first area of focus is reproductive health. Worldwide today there are over 130 million babies born every year. Sadly, the majority of these newborns are never screened for serious but treatable metabolic disorders. As a result of the lack of testing, hundreds of thousands of newborns annually are afflicted by life-altering conditions that, in some cases, lead to a premature death. We believe this presents a significant opportunity for PerkinElmer to make a difference. And we are investing to expand who we test, how we test, and for what disorders we test.", "For example, many specialty and top pharmaceutical companies are increasing their focus on developing therapeutics for rare, early childhood diseases. As more treatment options become available for these rare diseases, we are developing this critical screen test needed to implement them.", "Many times these tests are developed in partnership with these pharmaceutical companies, enabling early disease detection and ultimately providing more children with the opportunity for a healthy start to life. We are particularly excited about the development work currently underway for assays that detect spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and lysosomal storage and immunodeficiency disorders.", "Also within reproductive health, we are investing in prenatal testing. We recently announced our acquisition of Vanadis Diagnostics, which is developing a novel NIPT platform based on digital analysis of cell-free DNA. After a period of investment, we will be able to offer our customers a next-generation solution that gives wider access for NIPT for expecting mothers, with a cost-effective simplified workflow that many biochemistry laboratories can easily run.", "In emerging market diagnostics, we see significant opportunities to leverage our channel and capabilities by expanding our infectious disease testing portfolio. We're developing new tests, including multiplex bead-based genotyping assays for respiratory panel, hepatitis B and C, and HPV, as well as an HIV quantitative viral load PCR assay. We're also continuing to expand our Haoyuan blood screening business in China and leveraging our medical lab in Suzhou to expand its testing menu.", "Turning to the rapidly growing food safety segment, we are prioritizing our efforts to strengthen our franchise through the success of our Perten acquisition and by expanding our detection capabilities to better help customers analyze food quality and authenticity.", "This year, we will continue to invest in our detection solutions and leverage our extensive application knowledge and proprietary library of sample calibrations. These investments will bolster our position as the market leader in protein and moisture analysis, enabling robust quality of valuation to be performed across each step in the supply chain of food products.", "Recently, we were able to transform our benchtop infrared technology used to determine food moisture levels and batch analysis and deploy it as an online continuous analyzer to measure quality in the production of final products. We're also working with a large number of major global food producers to ensure that food supply is genuine, unadulterated, and free of residues and other contaminants. We believe this capability will increasingly become more important as governmental regulation and public concerns grow.", "Finally, in the laboratory services, we will continue to invest in our OneSource and informatics capabilities, as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers seek to outsource their laboratory services to drive efficiencies and externally collaborate on the scientific research through advance open innovation.", "Specifically, we will invest in our leading electronic notebook platform to facilitate collaborative research and in high-value scientific applications such as our TIBCO Spotfire software for harnessing big data. In addition, we will expand our clinical analytics capabilities and develop new solutions for translational research and personalized medicine by leveraging our Signals platform, which integrates disparate data sets into a single platform for data discovery.", "On the service side, we will continue to develop our integrated service capabilities which can effectively align lab operations to improve scientific outcomes. Through these investments, we look to expand our work with existing and new pharmaceutical and biotech customers, as well as establish our service in additional end markets.", "To fund these potential significant opportunities, our 2016 operating plan incorporates an increase in R&D, while also generating healthy margin and EPS growth. While Andy will discuss our 2016 financial outlook in more detail, we are forecasting overall end market conditions to be similar to what we experienced in the latter part of last year, with some minor puts and takes.", "Consequently, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 to $2.75, which represents constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% at the midpoint, based on corresponding organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%. Despite our plan to increase R&D by about 10% or 40 basis points of revenue, we are forecasting constant currency adjusted operating margin expansion of 50 basis points.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy to discuss our financial results and operating plan in greater detail.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our fourth quarter and full-year results, as well as details around our 2016 first quarter and full-year guidance.", "Given that foreign exchange has had a material impact on our financial results throughout 2015, I will once again provide much of my commentary on a constant currency basis in order to better portray our year-over-year results.", "For the fourth quarter and full year of 2015, foreign exchange negatively impacted revenues by $32 million and $142 million respectively and negatively impacted fourth quarter and full-year adjusted earnings per share by $0.08 and $0.25 respectively, versus the comparable period a year ago.", "For the fourth quarter, adjusted revenues were approximately $608 million, which represents cost of currency revenue growth of 5%, organic revenue growth of 3%, with FX negatively impacting revenue growth by 5%.", "Adjusted earnings per share was $0.86, up 11% on a constant currency basis from $0.85 in the comparable period a year ago. Please note, since we provided fourth quarter guidance in October, foreign exchange further impacted fourth quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $5 million and $0.02 per share respectively.", "The trends we saw through the first three quarters of 2015 continued through the fourth quarter.

For the fourth quarter, Environmental Health organic revenue grew approximately 5% with Human Health increasing 2% as compared to same period a year ago.

Medical imaging grew low-single-digits in the quarter as demand for our CMOS and our new cassette panel was offset somewhat by weakening demand in radiography and radiation oncology end markets.", "Looking at the performance of our Diagnostics business in China, our Haoyuan blood screening business had an excellent quarter, which included a significant number of instrument placements, and we look forward to helping ensure a safe blood supply in China in 2016 and beyond. Overall, our Diagnostics business in China finished the year with broad-based growth and delivered a double-digit growth performance in the quarter.", "Organic revenue in our Life Science Solutions business grew low-single-digits in the quarter, driven by strong U.S. sales and continued robust growth in our OneSource multi-vendor services offering, despite a very difficult prior-year comparison.", "Geographically, within LSS, Japan continues to be weak and was a major drag on overall organic growth. In contrast to Japan, we were encouraged by the double-digit growth we experienced with our key global pharmaceutical and biotech customers.

Operator, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question is from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thank you for taking my questions. On Human Health, that was where my model was a little bit off for the quarter. I think the organic growth came in around like 2%. And I was thinking it was going to be in the 3% to 4%. What was the driver of the lower performance in Human Health in the quarter?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think it was fundamentally \u2013 comparisons to Q4 last year, we had very strong growth in Human Health last year in a couple of the areas and I would say that was probably the overlying issue.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. And I think, if you recall last fourth quarter, we talked about some revenue being pulled in, which created this very difficult comp. It was about $5 million. So, that obviously was another piece that we had to compare against in 2015.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, essentially, when you look at the full year, Human Health and Environmental Health both grew about the same. So PerkinElmer was a 4%, Human Health was 4%, and Environmental Health was 4%. So, in any given quarter, there can be some sort of above and beyond either because of comparison purposes or, as Andy talked about, things can move in and out of the quarter. But actually it was fairly consistent when you look at the full year.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then the first quarter versus the full-year guidance on the organic growth, I think the first quarter's 3% and then for the full year it's 3% to 4%. Can you comment a little bit about the cadence as you go through the year as you expect a little bit more of a back-half weighted? And then, maybe a little bit about the seasonality around customer order patterns in the first quarter? And is there typically little bit more of conservatism from some of your customers in the first quarter knowing that they can put some orders off into the rest of the year?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think as we think about the cadence of the growth, clearly it'll be a little stronger in the back half. Some of that is just a function of we've got some new products coming out as we saw in 2015. I think, again, we had some large sales in the first quarter of last year that we're sort of cycling up against, particularly in the area of informatics.", "And so, I think as we think about it, we'll see it a little bit stronger. I think we're also a little concerned about the economic conditions in the first quarter relative to what we see for the full year.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Rob, I actually wanted to jump off on that, the point that you just alluded to, as you referenced macroeconomic conditions in the first quarter. It would be helpful if you could just isolate what you've seen in terms of the macro impact on the outlook and how that's evolved over the last 90 days or so. And then, to the extent you're looking for improvement over the balance of the year, can you give us a little bit more of a view on why it is that you're embedding that in the outlook?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So maybe it'd be helpful to just sort of walk through the end markets a little bit, both from an application perspective and a geographic. But I would say, just specifically with regard to the beginning of the year versus the latter part of the year, I would say it's fundamentally in a couple of areas. I think as we've talked about in the past, medical imaging I think has a little bit of a stronger headwind in the first half of the year. So we think they could be down sort of high-single, maybe low-double-digit. And we believe we'll see that recovered in the back half.", "And I think you'll also \u2013 when we think about Japan, Japan I think again we expect to see a little bit more challenging in the early part of the year. And we think that's going to moderate here in the back. One of the reasons is because, again, we get easier comparisons in the back part of the year. So I would say those are the big contributors.", "But to just sort of walk through the end markets in particular, I think in the case of the pharma/biotech market, we saw a good 15%. We grew sort of high-single-digits. We think that continues to be a strong market for us, maybe gets a little bit difficult from a comp, particularly on the OneSource service side. But we've got some new systems coming out in the sort of middle of the latter part of the year. We've got some new liquid handling, some cellular imagers, and some reagent kits that we're excited about. So we see that probably improving in the back half but moderating, but continuing to be a pretty strong market for us.", "Academic was sort of low-single for us last year. We think that improves a little bit clearly in the U.S. because of the NIH budget, but continue to see probably flattish in Europe. That probably stays fairly consistent through the year.", "I think, in the food market, we've seen good strength there, probably mid- to high-single-digits for 2015. We think that continues. The Perten integration going well. We started to go up against some difficult comps in China because China was particularly strong for us. But we think that probably stays fairly consistent through 2016.", "I think the area that we're probably most concerned about is the industrial end market. And for 2015, it was sort of mid-single for us. I think, going into 2016, we think it's probably going to moderate here a little bit. And so I think we're a little concerned, particularly in the first half of the year. And so we're calling that to be sort of more low-single-digits with probably more pressure in the early part of the year and maybe improving here a little bit in the back.", "And then finally, on the Diagnostics side, I think we feel pretty good about that. Throughout the year, that was strong for us in 2015 and we think that continues to be strong, whether it's newborn, whether it's our infectious disease in emerging markets or prenatal. We think they all see pretty good strength here going into 2016, probably both in the first half as well as the back half.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then I'll dovetail on that very briefly here. As it relates to China and the hospital environment in China, are you seeing any signs that that has stopped the sort of pace of improvement that we've seen here lately? Or is that continuing to get a little bit better?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No. I think, for us, we continue to see nice growth in China. Now, some of that may be distorted because of the strong wins we're seeing in the blood screening area that Andy alluded to. We're seeing very nice interim placements there, and so we're quite excited about. So it may have to do with our mix of business, but we continue to forecast a strong growth in China. And of course, on the newborn side, we continue to see nice growth there as well.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Really helpful. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Miroslava Minkova with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Let me start with the top-line growth outlook. I appreciate all the commentary on the end markets. However, historically you have started with a slightly higher, more like in a 3% to 5% growth range. And you've talked about accelerating growth towards the mid-single-digit average. Can you maybe sort of give us the puts and takes a little bit? Why 3% to 4% this year? Is it all about the industrial markets? And how much would that be weighing on your overall top line?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think that's probably the majority of the caution, I would say, going into 2016 year as we're \u2013 as I said, industrial for us grew mid-single-digits in 2015 and. as we sort of look at it right now, we're a little concerned about that. So we think that's going to be in the sort of more low-single digits. So I'd say that's probably the largest contributor to it.", "I would say also on the margin, I think we've talked about that medical imaging will probably be a little slower than what we've seen historically. So I would say those are the two changes. But as we think about the 5% versus 3% to 4%, we still feel like it's in that sort of 3% to 4% range. So I wouldn't say \u2013 I wouldn't read a significant deceleration into that.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And you gave us a lot of color on the areas where you're investing. You've stepped up R&D investment over the past year and it sounds like you're stepping them up again in 2016. Can you give us your thoughts about should you be sustaining these investments in the context of the current macro environment? And how should we think about your product flow in 2016? Can you sustain this as it has been the last few years? Or should we be seeing a more cautious stand, given where industrial markets in particular are?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would say it's a couple of things. First of all, as I sort of alluded to a little before, we see some great opportunities in some of our end markets, so whether it's in the reproductive health, whether it's in food, whether it's emerging diagnostics or the laboratory services. And we think it would be unfortunate to not invest in those opportunities because we think there'll be potentially significant growth down the road. That's number one.", "I think the second thing is we're starting to see I think good insight into the opportunity to expand gross margins. I think it's an area where, if you look over the last couple years, while we've had good operating margin expansion, it's largely come from leveraging of our operating expenses. And as we've done some factory rationalization in shipping in the past, we're now sort of going into the factories themselves and driving Lean initiatives and focusing more on the supply chain. And so I think we're more confident that over the next couple years we'll be able to see improved gross margin and use that to sort of, in some ways, invest more in the businesses.", "And I would say the third aspect of it is I think we're trying to be more focused on where we're investing. And I think what you'll see going forward is a more concerted effort to invest in those areas where I think we've got leadership positions and terrific capabilities. And so I think it's a combination of all those things.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Sounds good. And maybe if I could sneak in a final one. The foreign exchange surprise on the bottom line, you called that out, of about $0.02 per share. It seems like at least relative to my motto, that wasn't that big of a difference on top line. Was there something about the mix of currency that happened this quarter? Where was the surprise?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think if you look at relative to when we guided in October until the end of the year, you saw some significant movement on foreign exchange, not only with some of the major currencies, but probably in particular in the emerging markets. So I think when you look at our split of our international, of course we've got a fairly heavy concentration in emerging markets, and if you look at the movement that's occurred in the fourth quarter, it's been much more significant on the emerging market side.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you, guys. And I'll get back in queue.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey. Good afternoon.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hey, Derik.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, a couple of questions. So, looking at the \u2013 if I heard you right, Andy, you said 40% reported operating margin expansion in 2016. So, that's about 18.1%-ish in 2016. So can we talk a little bit about forward operating margin expansion, and that 20% target? I mean, obviously, FX has been a huge hit to the margin target that you laid out back there (35:02). So can you just put this in terms of thinking about the longer-term trajectory, where's this going? Is 20%, 22% still in the cards?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think it is. I think we've made a conscious decision, though, as Rob mentioned, to invest some of that back. Our goal is not to get to 20%, 22% at all cost. So we're investing some of that back this year. But I think, underlying all this is the fundamental growth that I think still supports the 60 basis points to 80 basis points. And I think we're going to derive potentially more upside from that with some things that are going on in our gross margin that Rob just mentioned.", "So I think, at this stage, it may not be completely linear, but I think two things. One is we're going to continue to do the things that drive operating margin, whether that be Lean or indirect spend. But I think a lot of these investments that we're making in new products are going to start to convert into revenues that are going to be higher margin as well.", "So I think, if you look at it from a three-year or four-year point of view, which is the way we look at it, we still feel very, very good about our ability to hit that 20% to 22% operating margin.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. So I want to talk a little bit about the acquisition you just did, the Vanadis for the NIPT technology. So, a couple of questions on this. First one is, what's going to be the incremental R&D spend to sort of get that to market?", "I mean, I know just looking at the white paper that they have out, I mean I know there's a proof of principle. And they've had some clinical trials \u2013 clinical data that's out. But it still actually looks like it's a ways. Like, what's the investment, what's the timeframe before that's going to be ready for prime time?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I would say, if you look at the incremental R&D investment we're talking about this year, probably half of it or so is coming from Vanadis. And we're quite excited about the opportunity here. And the way I would describe it is, I think we understand the screening market probably better than anybody, with our work in newborn and prenatal. And our sense is, it's critical to focus on the workflow.", "So, rather than just looking at the detection technology, you've got to look at sample collection all the way to the patient report. And while we feel that NGS is identified with NIPT, it's identified a significant need and opportunity to provide an alternative to invasive screening.", "Our concern all along has been that the complexity of NGS, at least how it's done today, is not conducive to sort of large scale population screening. And therefore, we thought, and we've been looking for and continue to look at different technologies in a way that's sort of democratized non-invasive screening. And our sense all along is it's got to be a simpler format, a simpler work flow and one that can be sort of deployed into the labs that are out there today.", "As you may know, there's probably 1500 biochemical labs in the world doing clinical tests either through newborn or prenatal. Our sense is probably 100 or less than 10% are actually doing some kind of NGS per clinical testing. So, clearly, we need to define or I think there needs to be a simpler work flow and that's what excites us about Vanadis. It's simple, it's automated. You use basically one instrument. But to your point, it's early and so we need to invest, but we're quite excited about it. And it fits well within our current prenatal capabilities and channel.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "No. I mean, certainly, it fits in with your work flow. I mean the readers and microplate reader. Just the question I have on it, I guess, from a technical standpoint and maybe you may need to go with this offline, is that I know it does a \u2013 you take the cell-free DNA fragments and you convert them into circles like that. And I guess it's like what's the efficiency in terms of doing the conversion and the rolling circle like this? And then we can \u2013 this is may be too technical, but I'm just curious to see if it's high enough efficiency to sort of deliver the counts that you need on this.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think our guys have looked at it. And, of course, the other thing, it uses imaging technology with fluorescence, and we understand that well. But to your point, it's early days and we'll continue to invest in it, but we're quite excited about it. And this is a team that's been successful in the past and so we're feeling pretty good about.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. So, first topic is margin expansion. You've guided us to model, I think it's 50 basis points of constant currency operating margin expansion. This is a bit below what I think many were expecting. So, two parts to just trying to get at this topic. One, does this guidance fully capture the margin relief associated with the inventory issues you're working through last year associated with the Waters' LC deal?", "And then, secondly, keeping in mind that part of the reason margin isn't higher is that you plan to hide an investment in R&D. You've been talking about your R&D investment leading to new product acceleration at the top line. Really is that being a major driver to revenue growth or revenue acceleration? It's not apparent based on recent results and your guidance that this is happening. So can you just talk about whether you did hit your 2015 new product revenue target of $35 million and what's embedded into 2016 revenue guidance for new products?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Okay. Doug, this is Andy. Maybe I'll take the first part of the question and Rob will take the second part of the question. Our stated goal is and continues to be we think we can, with mid-single-digit growth, drive operating margin expansion in the 60 basis points to 80 basis points, some cases higher.", "We made a conscious decision this year because of a couple of what we think are very promising R&D programs to invest. And so, that is really the headwind to the margins. We're going to continue to try to drive more, but I think we feel like it's prudent to come out with a number that we feel like that we're comfortable with, at least at this point in the year.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. And what I would say is, first of all, relative to the NPIs, I think we've talked about that we've exceeded the $35 million that we laid out early in 2015 from the new product. I think it was probably closer to $40 million actually when you look at the results. And I would say, as we go here in early 2016, we think we'll do at least that amount, if not more. So I would say the new products are doing well and we're getting them out into the marketplace.", "I think the thing to consider though is, and I've sort of mentioned this in the prepared remarks, is we set some goals together \u2013 put some goals out there in January that talked about 3% to 5% EPS growth margin expansion. And despite some of the challenges from an economic perspective, we met or exceeded all of those.", "So I would say the NPIs are doing well, but of course some of the things where some of the other end markets have been a little bit more challenging from a macroeconomic perspective is offsetting the progress we're making on the NPIs.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And one more. The commentary on industrial exposure, I mean I think we're all hearing what's going on in the news and seeing some of the data. But your commentary is a bit more negative than I think what we've heard from others in the group thus far. Your percentage of sales exposure isn't all that different from the diversified tools peers.", "So I'm just trying to get at what's driving this for you? And why would this be tougher in Q1 and improve over the year? Sorry to be basic about this, but it's just hard to understand why this would be a temporary cyclical industrial concern. Is it comps? Or is it something else? Thank you.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So maybe I'd sort of clarify. So let me separate. The industrial concern is one of a full-year concern. And as I said, it's as simple as we grew mid-single in 2015 and we think that moderates to low-single. So, that's not necessarily a Q1 issue. The Q1 issue is more tied to medical imaging and some sort of large revenue recognition that we had in informatics in the first quarter. So those two are separate. The industrial one is more of sort of an annual issue.", "I don't know if it's unique for us based on our product mix, but we are a little concerned about it. To your point, it's not a huge exposure for us. But on the margin, it could be 30 basis points or 40 basis points of growth there. And then, I think the other one is we're concerned about the comp on pharma. And so, instead of growing high-single-digits as we did in 2015, we probably think that moderates to sort of mid-single.", "Those are basically the two things as we look into 2016 versus 2015 that we think are different.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "All right.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. It's actually Patrick Donnelly in for Tycho. Maybe just looking at the China screening market, can you talk about the impact from moving \u2013 the Year of the Goat last year was a bit of a headwind, moving through Year of the Monkey this year. Maybe just talk through how the birth rates were impacted last year and what kind of tailwind that could lead to screening revs this year?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, if we look at 2015, births in China were down about 10%. So we think it recovers that and maybe goes a little bit more. It's a little hard to parcel that out specifically because you've also got the one-child relaxation. But our sense is you will see births up this year relative to China, and whether that's high-single-digits or low-double-digits, it's probably in that type of range.", "Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, staying in China, just on the nucleic acid testing market, there was a delayed implementation there. Can you just talk through where we stand with the tenders and what the impact on 2016 could be from that market?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So we saw a very strong tender activity, particularly in the fourth quarter. And so, to a large extent, while we slowed down early in the year, I would say they sort of more than made up for that with the strong activity in the fourth quarter. And I think as we \u2013 or as Andy mentioned in his comments, we are very pleased with our win rate there. So our expectation is as we sort of get to the latter part of 2016, we'll start to see some of the ramp up in the reagents.", "Normally what we've seen historically there's probably a six-month implementation to when they get the instruments put in place and sort of they run some controls and tests and those types of things. So our expectation is we'll see the benefits of the win that we saw in fourth quarter in the latter part of 2016.", "Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Are you still thinking that business could ramp to call it $50 million over the next three years?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Yeah.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "That's right. Yeah.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We feel good about that.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "We're north of $10 million this past year and with these placements in the reagent flow coming through, it'll ramp really quickly.", "Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks. Andy, just I wasn't sure I exactly understood your answer. So, for 2017, do you still think you're going to do 20% operating margin?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "2017? No, I didn't \u2013 I actually wouldn't respond to that. We were talking longer term. But I would say, given the investment and depending on where FX is, I think it's still the goal. But I think if FX continues to be a headwind, it's going to be a difficult goal. And again, as I mentioned before, we're not really trying to get to 20% just to get to 20%. We're trying to do it in a fairly logical, methodical way and invest back. And again, we made a conscious decision for 2016 to make those investments.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Sure. I get that. Your target before had been 20% and from your previous answer it wasn't clear to me. So, yeah, we should adjust for FX and maybe some of these investments in terms of what we're thinking about for out margin in 2017.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think that's fair. I mean, if you go back to our 18% guidance, I mean we came in at 17.6% that year and the difference was FX. So, I mean, there are going to be things that impact our ability to get there, but that's still our goal is to stripping that out and get to 20%.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say, John, we're trying to control the things that we can control, and obviously FX is a difficult one to do. I think if you went back and tried to do it on sort of a pro forma basis based on a euro of $1.25 or something when we set this up, my sense is we probably could get to the 20%. But as we sit here at $1.10 for the euro or whatever, I think that's going to be more of a challenge.", "The other thing is, when recently in January we came in and rather talked about a 2017 target, we've talked more about a longer-term 2020 target and felt like we could go another 400 basis point to 22%. So I think that's how we're modeling it. As we model that, we had R&D going up the 6% of sales or a 50% increase in R&D, and the way we're offsetting that is we expect 300 basis points of gross margin expansion and about 150 basis points of SG&A.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And then, Rob, PerkinElmer has obviously been on a journey for a while and I think you made a distinct point to say, look, you're not trying to be all things to all people. You want to focus in the four key categories where you think you can be a real leader in your markets.", "And I'm just curious, as you've done the analysis and thought about the strengths that you want to have as a company and the leadership positions, how does \u2013 is it about throwing more money in some of these categories? Is it about being smarter in some of those categories? Is it about \u2013 is there more you can do from a business development standpoint, maybe divesting out of certain assets and utilizing those funds to invest more of the M&A to increase your competitive position? I'm just kind of curious internally how you kind of come to the decision to jack to boost the R&D spending?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Well, first of all, I think it's all the above. I mean, but some we have more control over than others. So, in some of the more attractive areas or areas where we have stronger positions, we'd like to be more active on the business development side or M&A side, but again that's hard to predict. So we'll continue to look there. But, in the meantime, we'll try and control the things we can control. And so some of that is where we see opportunities and we want to be able to do that.", "But, as I mentioned before, this is always going to be a balance for us. I mean, we're not \u2013 it's going to be rare in a situation where we would come out and say we're not going to grow margin or EPS at all. But I think we're constantly trying to walk a balance between making sure we're returning cash to the shareholders and expanding operating margins, but at the same time investing in those areas that we think have great long-term prospects.", "So it really gets down to focus and prioritization. And so one of the things I was trying to lay out earlier is to say, look, I think you're going to see a much more differentiated and focused investment profile at PerkinElmer going forward. And I think the four areas that I identified are ones that are clearly getting a disproportionate part of the investment. And for the foreseeable future, I think that'll be the case.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "And just one last one on that, a bit of a follow-up. You mentioned, Andy, I think 50% of your cash flow to buybacks. Should we assume \u2013 is there anything in the pipeline that you think could happen from an M&A standpoint? And should we assume that those four categories that you listed is where you'd be most interested from an M&A standpoint as well? Or is there a chance you'd go to a new pillar?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think that's right. I mean, this is half our free cash flow we still have. As I mentioned, we're 1.7% net debt to EBITDA, so we still have some leverage as well. And we think we have a number of things in the pipeline. So I would say it's really no different than any other time we've gone to it in a year.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "I'm just going to touch quickly on a question that was sort of just asked. But as you think about the sort of transformation of the asset, and it's very clear you're kind of prioritizing growth here and that obviously makes sense given what longer term drives value.", "I guess, as you've seen some of the transactions already year-to-date in the market within or around some of the areas that you play, I guess when you think about your ability to execute at least maybe something moderately larger. Because it's been a bit of time since we've seen you do something more than sort of a small tuck-in. Is it always price, is it sort of a debate internally on fit, is it maybe not the right time?", "I'm just trying to get a sense for \u2013 again, given just the multitude of stuff that we've seen, I'm not asking you to comment on anything specifically, as you think about it, the various reasons? And then what's likely in your mind changed to allow you to maybe do something a little bit more substantial? Or are we okay with sort of just the small tuck-ins?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I would say, first of all, it starts with strategy and fit, right? I mean I think, when we think about our acquisition pipeline, we set forth our priorities or what our highest priorities are and then we look for the assets that will continue to build our capabilities in those applications or end markets that we think are most attractive and fit best with our strategy. So I think it starts there. Then, of course, if you decide a strategic fit, it then gets the valuation and can we get good financial returns.", "And of course, one of the things we're always looking at is the alternative is either to invest back in the company or quite frankly invest in PerkinElmer by buying back stock. So, that's the process that it goes through. But, clearly, it starts with a strong strategic fit and attractive assets.", "I mean, as you pointed out, I mean I think going forward, and I think we've said for some time, probably the more likely scenario is we do more sort of bolt-on transactions, and maybe bolt-ons by their nature hopefully get bigger. But as I think, when we look at the opportunity or the alternative to do something larger, either because of fit, strategy or valuations, we don't see much out there quite frankly.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Makes sense, Rob. And maybe I can just sense from the degree of the questions, obviously maybe modest disappointment on sort of the 8% FX neutral growth. I mean, it seems to me in this environment that that's a reasonable outcome given the investments. But I guess, as you think about the go-forward, I'm not asking for specific long-term guidance, but one would think, again to my prior point, the investments you're making should ultimately yield better top line and then hopefully then more margin expansion.", "So, I guess, as we think about the next few years, obviously going forward, I mean clearly your goal is to be at a materially higher earnings growth rate, correct? I mean, I guess when you were debating this with the board, was the trade-off, yes, we may be less on currency neutral this year, but the hope is this will yield a better outcome than where we were maybe prior to these investments going forward?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think, absolutely. I mean I think the goal is that we make some investments this year, but that puts us in a stronger position going forward. And so the thought here is that, as you go out a couple years, both the top line and the corresponding EPS growth accelerates. And so, I mean that's the purpose of sort of taking it up.", "So, again, it was just some significant opportunities we saw in the marketplace and we think now's the time to make the investment. And even though, let's say, relative to our historical track record the EPS growth is a little lower, we think it's the appropriate investment to make. And over time, we think this will yield significant financial returns and a stronger company.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Makes sense. Thanks, Rob.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dane Leone with BTIG. Your line is open.", "Dane Leone - BTIG LLC", "Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Just a point of clarification in terms of the commentary. Do you guys consider 3% mid-single-digit growth or low-single-digit growth?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I mean, generally the way we think about it is we would say sort of 4%, 5% and 6% as mid and 1%, 2%, and 3% as low.", "Dane Leone - BTIG LLC", "Okay. So, kind of in that context and in line with some of the other questioning on the call, how do you think about the natural growth rate? You guys have been kind of on that mid- to low-single-digit rate for a while now. And arguably, by comparison, other peers in your group kind of have put up some higher growth, even despite being conservatively larger.", "Do you feel that you might just be kind of investing in structurally lower growth markets and maybe you need to kind of consider or reconsider where you're kind of focusing over the long term for exposure?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I guess I would maybe initially take exception to your premise. So I guess, if I look back six years, I can only think of one year where we grew less than 4%. So I would say five years of the last six years we grew mid-single-digits.", "Dane Leone - BTIG LLC", "Okay. I mean, do you think that kind of 4% is the right growth rate?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think you've got to look at it, first of all, if you go back a couple years it was higher than that, but I think you also need the consideration is, if you look over the last couple years, I'm not sure the macroeconomic environment was one that, when you look across the globe, particularly lately in the emerging markets, it's been a little challenging. Of course, 28% of our revenue \u2013 and this is something we've worked on because we think longer term it's got strong prospects, but with 28% of our revenue in emerging markets, places like Brazil, Russia, et cetera, that's created a little bit of a headwind.", "So, actually, I feel pretty good with despite what we've seen in some of the challenging macroeconomic environments that we've been able to put 4% organic growth up. Feel pretty good about it quite frankly.", "Dane Leone - BTIG LLC", "Okay. So, in terms of the growth rate, do you think 19% without the FX adjustment is the right operating margin if we look to 2017 now?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I don't know that we want to get into sort of forecasting 2017 or 2018 or 2019. I mean I think what we've said is here's our forecast for 2016. I think, going forward, our expectation will be we'll continue to invest but we'll get, hopefully, good gross profit and gross margin expansion. And again, we've set a goal out there by 2020 to be at 22%.", "Dane Leone - BTIG LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. First question...", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Bill.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Hi, there. First question, Rob, I guess, can you help us think a little bit about the academic market in Japan, kind of what are you seeing and are we starting to see any funding shake loose?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the academic market in Japan has been challenging for us, probably all of 2015. I was there a little while ago and I would say I'm not optimistic we're going to see a big turnaround there anytime soon. I would say, maybe the back half. I would say the only thing that's potentially happening is the comparisons obviously get easier this year. So maybe we'll see some release of some funding, but I think it continues to be challenging.", "I think what we're seeing in our business is the consumables still to do okay, but I would say in the capital equipment area is where the challenge has been. And unfortunately, in Japan, for us it's probably more of an instrument play than it is a consumable play. So we're hopeful that we'll see some improvement soon, but I'm not optimistic at least in the first half of the year.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Got it. Understood. And then, and you can probably categorize this as somewhat of an oddball question, but it's certainly garnering a lot of press. So, Zika virus, if we think about newborn screening, kind of how much exposure do you have in South America and are you guys keeping an eye on this at all? Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean, Brazil for us is not a large, that's probably the majority of where our newborn screening business is. We're growing in Mexico. But I would say there's sort of pluses and minuses, I mean obviously to the extent it reduces birth rate, that's not great. But I would tell you it is increasing sort of awareness of the whole sort of newborn health and newborn screening. So we're actually getting a number of inquiries as to sort of the opportunity to focus more and more on the newborn screening in Latin America. So it's obviously an unfortunate situation currently, but I think longer-term it is raising some awareness.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good afternoon, guys. Appreciate you guys taking the question.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "There's been a lot of \u2013 yeah, there's been a lot of inquiry around M&A so far, but I was interested in maybe exploring divestitures. I think you guys probably don't get enough credit for having been proactive, modifying the portfolio over the years. I'm curious if divestitures are in any way part of the operating plan over the next few years to hit your goals on the financials.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think as we become more focused and prioritize our investments, I think there probably will be a couple product lines that over the next year or two years probably become strategic for us. So, I mean, I don't know if it'll be a significant amount of revenue, but I wouldn't be surprised if in 2016 and probably in 2017 you see a little bit more focus on the portfolio, which will entail disposing of some of the product lines.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And then maybe a follow-up on the organic growth side. You had a lot of questions around the sort of sustainable organic growth rate. Do you guys need to do M&A to hit that mid-single-digit range that you aim for, just in the context of the current macro? Or do you think some tuck-in M&A would be needed to get you to that mid-single-digit range? Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I don't think so. I mean I think as we look at the portfolio we have and we look at the end markets, and I think one of the things we didn't do (1:03:24) is just sort of shift the weighting a little bit. And obviously that's \u2013 part of the way we're doing that is through investment. But we have a number of our businesses and product lines that are growing well into the high-single-digits and low-double-digits. It's just that we've got to grow out in some of the areas that are a little bit slower growth. We've talked about it in the past.", "I mean we've got a strong position in radiochemicals and radiometric detection. It's a great business. We make a lot of money. But that every year probably grows low to mid \u2013 or declines low- to mid-single-digits. And so we've got a couple of those that obviously put a little pressure. But so over time as we shift the weighting to the higher growth areas, I think mid-single-digit is the appropriate number for us.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks a bunch.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Afternoon. Thanks for the question. Rob, just to go back to the industrials, are you able to put some numbers to the impact of what's going on in the energy sector on your GC and your ICP-MS franchises? I do appreciate that the exposure is smaller, but kind of just trying to better understand the effect that rate closures and oil prices are having, as we read what our energy guys are publishing.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say the industrials exposure for us across the company is probably in the maybe 10% or so. So it's not a huge number. If I was sort of prioritizing industrial exposure, it starts with sort of fine chemical and petrochemical. So oil and gas is sort of a little further down.", "I think where we're seeing it though, so it's not specific to oil and gas or sort of natural resources. It's the sort of knockoff effect that I think it's having. So we're seeing the impact of some countries that are relying on oil revenue. Clearly, they're pulling in. Clearly, in the emerging markets, the lower dollar or the stronger dollar is having an impact. So I think the concern on the industrial side for us is more broad-based than it is specific to oil and gas.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah. Thanks. First one for Andy here. Could you give a guidance number for free cash flow for 2016? And then you talked about using half of that on buybacks. How should we think about the pacing of buybacks during the year?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I think, for 2016, we're going to shoot for what we've always shot for, which is one times net income. So, that'll be about $300 million of free cash. This is the first year we've had a three handle on our operating cash flow. So we hope that this year we'll have our three handle on our free cash flow.", "So, that's basically $150 million in buyback. I think you'll see that through the year maybe a little bit more front-loaded, but it will probably average to a weighted average share count of 111 million shares. So you can kind of do the math on that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Leonard with Leerink. Your line is open.", "Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC", "Thanks. I was hoping you could perhaps elaborate further on the sources of the 70 bps in gross margin expansion you're expecting in 2016. Rob, I think you made a comment about Lean earlier, but I thought there might be more to say.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say a number of things we're doing. Some of it is Lean and the in fact through we did get more efficiency, and where we'll see that is sort of expand our capacity. And then consequently we were looking at actually pulling some stuff that we've outsourced historically in, so we think we can get some savings there. I think clearly in the supply chain is I think we've talked about before. When we were moving in a number of the factories, we've been probably or we weren't as aggressive on the supply chains. So we're putting plans to do that.", "And then I think the other thing that will help is clearly the mix shift as we \u2013 partly the new products come out also as we sort of focus on these areas that have a tendency to be higher growth and higher margin. So I think the combination of those will make up the 70 basis points. I would say we're assuming for 2016 very little price. And so I know if we can get some price, that'd be great. But our assumption is that price is pretty flat for us. And so it's really coming from productivity and mix.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Rob, earlier in your dialogue, you had mentioned the software acquisitions coming together along with your other focused M&A in Life Science. Can you talk about how the software business looks, like Cambridge and Spotfire, and kind of that convergence point you're starting to see?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think it continues to perform well. It had a good 2015. I think we're forecasting probably high-single-digits for it in 2016. And our strategy in the informatics area is that we've built some great capabilities around the ability. For example, Spotfire is a very powerful tool with data. And then, of course, we've got our electronic notebook, which is great at sort of collaborating the data.", "And so what we're doing now is building that bridge, because the challenge is getting access of that data sort of easily. So what we're looking to do is take \u2013 if you think about ELN as a data repository and you think of Spotfire as the ability to give you good analytics and visualization, we're now working on that sort of in between that gap. So our approach is to make sure that we get the right data to the right people very easily in sort of a scalable, very useable format. And we're getting a lot of receptivity around that, and we're building some terrific capabilities.", "And then when we do that, it allows us to better leverage what we're doing on the instrument side and build that linkage. So we fundamentally create the informatics and the software to allow people to take data out of a repository, analyze it real well, and then we facilitate getting that information into the repository through our instrument in imaging and other capabilities. And we're seeing a fair amount of receptivity with a number of our customers.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.", "Joshua Waldman - Cleveland Research", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. It's actually Josh in for Steve tonight. Just making sure I didn't miss it, did you guys provide a tax rate on the quarter?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "We did. It's for the year. We basically said flat to 2015 or 19.5%.", "Joshua Waldman - Cleveland Research", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Sachin K. Kulkarni - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. This is Sachin in for Brandon. Thanks for taking our questions. Will you discuss the strength in operating margins you saw in the period, particularly in Environmental Health? Was it a lot stronger than we had in our model? And speaking of like the 50 bps of core operating margin expansion for the year, would you divide that up between like Human Health and Environmental Health?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure. For the quarter, on the Environmental Health side, we saw a couple of things. One is we saw a very positive mix shift into MATCAR (1:11:09), and we also talked about some licensing revenue, very high margin. And then we also did a lot of work in the fourth quarter around some cost controls. And so I'd say that's about half and half.", "And again, they had a fairly easy comp from a year ago. It's kind of the flip of that with Human Health where we saw very, very strong margins in the fourth quarter of 2014, so a much more difficult comp for them. So, a little bit of the comp, a little bit of the mix and some cost controls.", "As far as the 50 bps, I think that it's fairly evenly split. If you look at the full year for 2015, I think both businesses contributed. I think if you move forward to 2016 and look at the margin expansion, you're going to see more of it coming out of Environmental Health because we're really making the investments in the Human Health segment.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. If you look at the four areas that I highlighted, three of those come out of Human Health: so the reproductive health, the emerging diagnostics and the laboratory services. So clearly there's much more investment going back into Human Health this year, and so the majority of the margin expansion we expect will come out of Environmental.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question is from Bryan Brokmeier with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.", "Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Rob, could you elaborate a little bit on the strengths, the level of strength you're seeing in the newborn screening market in the U.S.? And the benefit you might be seeing from any more \u2013 if you're seeing any more states expanding their test menus, including anyone yet adopting LSD screening?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I would say, first of all, the strength that we've seen historically has been probably more outside the U.S. than in the U.S. I mean U.S. is growing, but if you look at the strength it continues to be in emerging markets in China and those types of areas. What I was referring to was the number of investments that we're making in the LSDs and the TMV and those types of things, which we're excited about, but you're probably not going to see those into the U.S. market probably till end of 2016, 2017 at the earliest. So these are investments that you're probably not going to see.", "The U.S., the growth there is coming from our SCIDs platform that we introduced about a year or so ago. So, like I said, we're excited about these investments. We think they continue to build out our strong position in the marketplace. But I think a number of these will not have meaningful revenue in the U.S. probably till 2017 because generally what we're doing with these tests is probably going to Europe first. So we'll see them introduced in Europe probably as a CE-marked IVD and then you'll see it later in the U.S.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions. So I'll now turn the call back over to Rob Friel, Chairman and CEO.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you very much. First of all, let me wrap up by again thanking you for joining us this afternoon.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures we plan to use during this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is also available as an attachment to our earnings press release. To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.", "I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on PerkinElmer's strong start to the year, in which we delivered solid financial performance and gained significant early momentum on our 2016 strategic priorities.", "Turning first to our financial performance, we exceeded our revenue and profitability expectations for the quarter, despite a macroeconomic environment that remains mixed. We grew organic revenue by approximately 4%, which was fairly evenly split between Human and Environmental Health. We also experienced a good expansion of our gross and operating margins and increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% or $0.56. As a result, we have raised our topline and earnings per share expectations for the full year.", "While Andy will discuss our first quarter financial results and end markets in more detail, overall, our markets are performing similarly to the latter part of last year, and are in line with our expectations. While the conditions of the few market segments are a bit mixed, these are areas that for the most part impact a relatively small portion of our overall business.", "For example, during the first quarter, our revenue from industrial markets declined low single digits, due somewhat to tough prior year comparisons, but also to weaker customer demand. Fortunately, this was more than offset by better than expected performance in the food market, particularly in China and in a number of emerging markets.", "We also continue to see persistent headwinds in certain geographies, such as Brazil, Japan and Russia. However, in the first quarter, revenue from these countries represented less than 5% of our aggregate revenue. As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to believe it is prudent to expect a fairly moderate growth environment, with continued volatility in both industrial and emerging markets.", "Before turning the call over to Andy, I'd like to highlight some of the progress we made towards our strategic priorities for this year as well as provide some examples of how our offerings continue to help make a profound impact on human and environmental health. As I reiterated during last quarter's earnings call, ParkinElmer's unique value stems from our ability to offer novel solutions that help customers unlock insights by leveraging the combined power of our scientific and technical capabilities with deep application knowledge.", "In addition, by disproportionately directing more of our resources towards the high growth areas of pharma and biotech services and solutions, reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics and food quality and safety, we believe we can accelerate organic revenue growth beyond the mid-single digit rate, drive sustainable margin improvement and reduce the effects of near-term macroeconomic volatility.", "This focus has enabled us to target solutions that are solving some of our customers' most significant real world challenges. For example, in the first quarter, we introduced our Operetta CLS cell imaging system. This system combines PerkinElmer's proprietary automated water immersion technology with direct LED illumination, enabling up to four times higher sensitivity and finer resolution for phenotypic cell assays. Recently, our cell imaging systems have been selected by the University College of London, Cambridge University and Oxford University, in connection with a collaborative study to better understand the molecular and genetic mechanics of dementia.", "In addition, researchers in Brazil and the U.S. are utilizing our Operetta and JANUS liquid handling systems, to screen compounds and inhibit the infection and transmission of the dangerous Zika virus. Another important offering from a research imaging platform is our recently introduced Synoptic's quantitative pathology system which allows quantitative and spatial imaging analysis. Last month, an article in the New England Journal of Medicine showcased how scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center at John Hopkins leveraged our platform to understand immune response to an anti-PD-1 drug for Merkel cell carcinoma.", "In addition, a second study published by Genoptix, a Novartis subsidiary, indicated that a Multiplex IHC test using our platform to measure not only PDL-1 expression, but also the interaction between cancer cells and PD-1 positive immune cells leads to a better prediction of immunotherapy response for melanoma and potentially other cancers versus current single flex IHC tests. Both of these studies reinforce our belief that our Phenoptics offering is substantially differentiated in its ability to identify and quantify cancer immune interactions, therefore better enabling our customers for precision medicine.", "In the area of diagnostics, we continue to see significant opportunities in reproductive health, particularly in emerging markets. In the first quarter, we opened a new laboratory in Chennai, India, which broadened our diagnostics offerings to respond to India's growing demand for easier access to technologies that screen for and help diagnose prenatal and neonatal conditions. The lab will provide a comprehensive menu of diagnostic screening services for hospitals, maternity nursing facilities, diagnostic labs and clinicians.", "In newborn screening, global adoption of our gold standard automated screening platform, the GSP, continues to grow. In particular, our GSP pilots are going well in China as the country ramps up its automated screening capabilities. In addition, as additional countries expand their testing menus, more of them are implementing our market-leading SCID [Severe Combined Immunodeficiency] test.", "In China, our Haoyuan business won a number of government tenders in the first quarter, as customers work to meet the nucleic acid testing mandate coming into effect. We are proud that through the deployment of our industry leading Cheeta (08:10) molecular blood screening system, hospitals will help ensure the safety of China's blood supply.", "Consistent with our strategy to focus our efforts on our very best opportunities, last week we announced the divestiture of our U.S. prenatal laboratory screening service business, NTD, to European Scientific. Through this divestiture, we can now better concentrate our diagnostic efforts on developing innovative maternal fetal health technologies and solutions for the U.S.", "Outside the U.S., we are continuing to provide kits, technologies and services through a variety of channels focused on improving health outcomes for babies and expectant mothers. Within food testing, we grew our Perten franchise with the acquisition of Delta Instruments. Delta is a Netherlands-based manufacturer of infrared analyzers and flow cytometers for dairy products. This acquisition broadens our portfolio to now offer the most complete range of analyzers used for measuring nutritional components in somatic cells in milk. We are also expanding Perten's addressable market organically by leveraging our core PerkinElmer technical capabilities.", "Most recently, Perten transformed a single-use analyzer into an in line solution to monitor product quality for a major consumer goods manufacturer. The consumers (sic) [customer's] (09:32) already purchased a large quantity of instruments, primarily to test moisture levels during process control.", "While the Delta acquisition was small, we continue to look for more substantive bolt-on acquisitions in our higher priority markets. We have a solid pipeline and hope to close one of those transactions during the remainder of the year. However, as you saw in our press release, during the first quarter we bought back $150 million of stock, as we believe we have the cash flow generation and leverage capability to both bolt on strategic attractive assets and return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Another key strategic priority for us is driving productivity and operational effectiveness. We've been aggressively deploying Lean principles throughout the organization. Within manufacturing we are upgrading our procurement practices and improving cross-site collaboration. While early days, our Lean applications in operations are starting to free up manufacturing capacity, which will enable us to in-source key assemblies at very minor incremental variable cost. In addition, reusing an in-sourcing initiative to accelerate value engineering and further reduce product cost by driving commonality and component standardization across a number of important product lines.", "Furthermore, we have consolidated the management of transportation activities, which is yielding impressive initial results. The early benefits from these actions have already started to positively impact our margins and are responsible for some of the better than expected financial performance in the first quarter.", "So to summarize our first quarter, I would note the following: Solid financial performance, particularly in the areas of margin expansion; good progress on focusing our investments in the most attractive growth areas; the advancement of implementing a multifaceted approach to improve operational effectiveness; and lastly, the return of 50% of our forecasted free cash flow this year to our shareholders.", "As we move ahead, our strong first quarter momentum reinforces our confidence in the growth investments we are making, our ability to meet our financial targets and our success in serving our customers around the globe.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Andy.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our first quarter results, as well as details around our second quarter and full-year outlook.", "Starting with the first quarter, we were very pleased with our strong start to the year, as solid execution on a number of key initiatives afforded us the opportunity to make a meaningful investment across a number of new growth opportunities, and still deliver solid financial results. For the first quarter, adjusted revenues were $539 million, representing organic growth of approximately 4%, while FX negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 2% or $10 million.", "Adjusted earnings per share was $0.56, up 12% from the comparable period a year ago, and $0.06 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. The strong operational performance contributed approximately $0.05 per share of the beat and was primarily the result of volume, favorable mix and price as well as the incremental impact from our Lean and productivity initiatives.", "Non-operating items contributed approximately $0.01 per share versus our guidance and were comprised of a lower share count and favorable FX, each of which contributed approximately a penny, but were partially offset by approximately a penny resulting from a slightly higher tax rate in the quarter. I'll go into a bit more detail on several of these items later in my prepared remarks.", "As Rob mentioned earlier, the trends we saw through the latter part of 2015 largely continued through the first quarter of 2016. Looking at our end markets, we continued to see healthy demand from pharma and biotech, stable academic and government spending, as well as strong demand for food and environmental applications. Our product mix was also balanced with consumables, reagents and instruments all growing mid-single digits organically.", "Looking at our geographic results for the first quarter, our overall performance was balanced as we experienced high single digit organic revenue growth in Asia, mid-single digit growth in Europe and low single digit growth in the Americas. In the BRIC economies, first quarter organic revenues increased high single digits compared to the same period a year ago, driven by strong China results, more than offsetting continued weak demand in Brazil and Russia. Overall, our emerging market demand has remained resilient.", "We are pleased with our solid results in China, as organic revenues grew double digits in the quarter with broad-based strength from both our Human and Environmental Health segments. Our Haoyuan blood screening business had another strong quarter of tender wins, while Haoyuan instrument placements completed in the second half of 2015 are now beginning to drive reagent demand. On the Environmental side, strength in food and environmental testing solutions were the key contributors of Environmental Health's solid performance in China.", "As to our operating results for the quarter, adjusted gross margins were 48%, up 30 basis points, driven primarily by the success of higher margin new products, successful pricing and Lean initiatives and volume leverage. We continue to be encouraged by the traction we are seeing from our Lean activities.", "Adjusted SG&A was 25.1%, down 80 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by productivity actions and the ongoing success of our indirect spend initiatives. As we guided for the full year 2016, our first quarter reported research and development spending was higher by approximately $2 million as compared to 2015, driven by core investments in our four strategic initiatives, along with R&D funding supporting Vanadis, as we announced last quarter,", "Overall, we were very pleased with our operational performance and execution in the first quarter of 2016, as we expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 100 basis points on top of our incremental R&D investments.", "Looking below the operating line, first quarter net interest and other expense was $11 million and our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 21.5%. The higher tax rate was a result of the geographic distribution of profits and had a negative impact on adjusted earnings per share of about $0.01 in the quarter. We still expect our full year tax rate to normalize over the balance of the year to approximately 19.5%.", "Consistent with our comments in February, we completed the buyback of 3.2 million shares of the company's stock for a total consideration of $148 million during the quarter, leaving 2.7 million shares remaining for repurchase under our current board authorization. The timing of the acquisition of these shares was modestly accelerated and will have a positive impact of approximately $0.01 per share for the year.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $210 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of two times. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $32 million as compared to $38 million in the same period last year, due primarily to the timing of payroll and benefit expenses, as well as higher working capital requirements supporting future new product introductions. For the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted free cash flow commitment of $300 million.", "Turning to our segment results for the first quarter, Environmental Health organic revenue grew approximately 5%, with Human Health increasing 3% as compared to the same period a year ago. From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the first quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue, and Life Sciences Solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.", "First quarter organic revenue growth from our Diagnostics business was driven by healthy mid-single digit growth from our core diagnostic franchises, partially offset by a mid-single digit decline in medical imaging. We continue, however, to see increasing demand for a number of new CMOS applications as the team continues to successfully diversify the medical imaging portfolio.", "Organic revenue in our Life Sciences Solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, while core research grew mid-single digits. Pharma and biotech continue to be the key contributors, both growing high single digits. Growth was broad-based globally with continued strengths from our OneSource service franchise. We continue to experience solid demand for core products with particular strength in reagents, which grew at a double digit rate in the quarter. We've also been very pleased with the demand for our new product introductions including our high content screening platform.", "Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represents approximately 38% of adjusted revenue, we are pleased to report that revenues grew 5% organically for the first quarter of 2016. Our results benefited from the timing of strong demand in our Food and Environmental Testing Solutions; however, we expect this growth rate to moderate somewhat in the second quarter. We continue to be delighted with the performance of Perten and the positive customer feedback we've received on their new in-line testing solution for moisture measurement. As Rob mentioned, we expanded our food analysis franchise through the recent acquisition of Delta Instruments, a provider of analytical equipment and solutions for the dairy market.", "Looking at segment margins, Environmental Health margins expanded 470 basis points, as strong mix, prior year restructuring actions and solid operational execution were key contributors to this performance in the quarter. Human Health margins were 21.2%, a decline of 80 basis points, largely due to planned growth investments and mix, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing initiatives impacted at the end of last year.", "Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2016, we believe we are well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance with continued stability in a majority of our end markets. For the second quarter of 2016, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents organic revenue growth of roughly 4%. Second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.65 to $0.66.", "For the full year, we now believe our organic revenue growth will be approximately 4% or $2.32 billion. Looking at margins for the year, we now expect gross margins to expand approximately 70 to 80 basis points and operating margins to expand 60 to 80 basis points, with R&D continuing to represent a year-over-year headwind of approximately 40 basis points.", "Regarding our adjusted earnings per share outlook, we are increasing the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.10. The $0.10 increase is comprised of our first quarter outperformance of $0.06 per share coupled with an estimated $0.04 per share from a more favorable foreign exchange. As in prior quarters, the methodology for calculating the impact of foreign exchange movements on our operating results is based on an average of FX rates over the last month of the quarter, and we will continue to be transparent as to the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results as we move through the year.", "And finally, the impact from the acceleration of our share repurchase in the first quarter is expected to essentially offset the dilution from the sale of the NTD lab services business, which was a little over a penny.", "As a result of these factors, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from the range of $2.65 to $2.75 to a new range of $2.75 to $2.85 with the midpoint of $2.80. As always, when assessing our adjusted EPS guidance range, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see our results playing out.", "This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Hey guys. This is actually Bill March on for Paul. How are you guys doing?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good. How are you?", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "I'm doing well. Thank you. First question, maybe if you could in terms of capital deployment, with the acceleration of the share buybacks in the quarter, maybe a little bit insight or color around what you see for the rest of the year?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I would say, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our view is, we would hopefully be able to get something done from the standpoint of a bolt-on acquisition. I mentioned the fact we feel good about our pipeline of opportunities. And so, that's our first preference. But clearly, if we are unable to get that done let's say over the next nine to 12 months, then I think we'd probably look to continue to buy back shares.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Got it. And then maybe just in terms of China, I know heading into the year, you were seeing, say maybe as going from double digits to high single digits growth, maybe an update on that outlook and how both sides of the portfolio are tracking?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, I would say, we continued to see very strong growth in China. China for us, in the first quarter was up sort of mid-teens, and it was very broad based. So, both on the Environmental side as well as the Human Health side, we saw a double-digit growth in the quarter. And even within if you looked in Human Health, it was broad-based between sort of diagnostics and research. So, we continue, I think, to enjoy the advantage of being in some very attractive markets from the standpoint of the funding of the Chinese government, and again, I think this was reinforced with their recent five-year plan.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Got it. Thanks. Have a good night.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.", "Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Hi, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First, just on free cash flow, it was down a little bit year-over-year. Just was wondering, are you still expecting roughly $300 million of free cash flow for this year? And then, I have a follow up.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, sure. I \u2013 well, let me tell you a little bit about free cash flow. I mean, first off, the primary driver of the difference year-over-year was the timing of our payroll. That'll normalize in the second quarter. We did have some additional working capital; as you guys remember, we had a very strong fourth quarter. There was a little bit of build of working capital; some of that was in support of new products that are going to be coming out in the second half. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we are still committed to a free cash flow of $300 million, which is essentially one times our adjusted net income.", "And one thing I'd like to add just as a clarification. When I was doing my prepared remarks, I was handed a note. I said our full year revenue \u2013 we were going to be $3.23 million \u2013 that should be $2.32 billion; just wanted to make that clear.", "Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks so much. And then, just following up on a comment from Rob. Rob, you made a comment about the potential to expand revenue growth beyond mid-single digits. I was just wondering if you could provide a bit more color there because that would obviously imply a step-up from what the company has done historically.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. And I think just goes back to conversation maybe we started a couple of quarters ago, where we said strategically what we want to do is disproportionally invest in those \u2013 and I think we've identified four key areas \u2013 where we see both more significant opportunities to grow the topline and the profitability of the company, and where we think we have a very strong shares and core capabilities.", "Just to give you an example, if you look at about 75% of our revenue in the quarter, it would've grown high single digits; and largely in the areas that we've sort of identified as those higher growth areas. So, we've got a situation, where is, we're going to continue to invest in those and hope those \u2013 to make those a bigger portion of the company. And then obviously over time, we think the overall growth \u2013 organic growth \u2013 could hopefully average up to a higher number. Now, this won't happen in the next quarter or two, but we think, as you look at it in a couple years, our goal here is to get from mid-single digits to maybe high single digits.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. It's actually Joel in for Isaac. Could you guys provide any update on the timeline of the commercial rollout of your NIPT initiative? And then any comment on whether the divestiture to Eurofins played into the strategy in anyway?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I would say, in reference to the Vanadis, it's still very early days. We've owned the company now for probably four months. And what I would say is first of all, we're very pleased with the individuals and the team. We're on track relative to our milestones given that it's only been fairly early. And I would say, the one area where I think we continue to be very pleased with, we saw some good synergies both on the imaging side with our imaging people out of Hamburg as well as in the chemagen sample prep. So we think \u2013 we were pleased that over the last couple of months \u2013 we were able to confirm what we thought were significant opportunities to get some synergies from our capabilities as well as theirs. So, I would say, still early days and this is probably something that will not be a significant revenue until late 2017 or early 2018, but indications on track.", "I would say, with regard to the NTD divestiture, that was really, I would say, somewhat different. And I think what to a large extent drove that was sort of a strategic decision that as we continue to look at services with, I'll call it regulated services within U.S. or U.S. testing labs, it just didn't seem like a strategic opportunity for us for a number of reasons.", "One is, fairly significant regulatory and compliance infrastructure required. So, we had a lab that was sort of less than $20 million in revenue and was requiring a fair amount of infrastructure on a regulatory and compliance cost. By selling NTD, it effectively eliminates all our exposure to either federal or private payer reimbursement, and so that was a big consideration.", "The other thing was, as we thought about our customers would be better served by a company with a broader capability and, quite frankly, a stronger commitment to the U.S. services market. And then finally, I think. And maybe this is somewhat related to the Vanadis development is, as we ultimately develop new products and new capabilities in that marketplace, we want to be able to offer that to more channel partners.", "And so, I think it was a combination of all those that led us to conclude that it makes sense to sell the NTD lab services.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And then, maybe turning to food safety, how are you guys thinking about the underlying market growth rate there? And then, just given your investments and the commentary on the tuck-in pipeline, what type of margin should we be expecting from these bolt-ons, and then maybe from this business longer-term?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I would say we feel very good about the opportunities in both the food safety and the food quality analysis area. And as we've sort of talked about in the past, Perten has been sort of growing sort of high single digits. And we actually saw a little stronger growth than that this quarter, so we continue to be very bullish on the food area. And we are excited about the Delta tuck-in. While it wasn't a large acquisition, it did bring us some good capability around flow cytometry, and it actually is used for looking for bacterial infection in milk. And when you think about the connection with Perten, they both have sort of common customers as well as a very common business model. So we think the margins in those businesses can be sort of high teens, low-20%s.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey, I think, you called out two different growth rates in LSS \u2013 one for LSS as a whole and then, the other one for core research \u2013 and I just like \u2013 I was thinking, what's the difference?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Within LSS as a whole, we have core research and informatics and service. And so, the core research grew at a mid-single digit rate; when you combine the three pieces, it grew at a low single digit rate. Informatics had a very difficult comparison in the first quarter and that's really what drove the difference between mid and low single digit.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay, great. That's helpful. And as you talk about potentially simplifying the business and focusing on four key areas, I know previously you've talked about radio chemicals being a flat to down business. What's the size of that now and has that continued to decline or has it stabilized?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, it continues to decline a little bit sort of low single digits. I would describe that as a business that declines from a volume perspective and we continually try and get price, so we offset some of the volume decline with price. But it's a business that probably declines low to mid-single digits on a sort of an annual basis. And right now, it's $80 million to $85 million in revenue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hi, Derik.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So, good margin expansion, good progress there. I'm just curious, as you start thinking about \u2013 on the out years \u2013 and I'm making the assumption that the economic malaise and the slower growth environment won't last forever. So, you did 4% organic revenue growth, 12% EPS growth this quarter. What's the model to sort of think about going forward on this? So if we get back to 5% to 6% organic revenue growth, what does that sort of contribute to on the EPS growth and EBIT margin growth, when we look out?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think what we've said longer term is sort of mid-single on the topline and probably mid-teens on the bottom.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Is that \u2013 was that inclusive of the share buybacks?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Well, it probably is not inclusive of capital deployment, whether that's share buyback or acquisitions. I would say that's the fundamental sort of operating rhythm of the business. So, if we can grow the topline, call it 5%, we think we can probably get mid-teens on the bottom line. And then, capital deployment would be additional, whether that's bolt-on acquisitions or share buybacks.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And then just sort of one follow-up from a bigger picture's perspective, I know, obviously the new China five-year plan is focused on a number of areas, like environmental and food where you are. There's also clear evidence of the Chinese want to build out their Life Sciences businesses and they're trying to do some acquisitions in some certain areas and this is \u2013 I'm just wondering \u2013 are you seeing any sort of threat from internal development in China, technologies being acquired, things being copied. I mean, how do you sort of \u2013 what do you sort of think is the outlook for that considering that \u2013 I'm not going to say that some of the instruments in that market are not high-tech, but I don't know if you need the latest cutting edge instruments for some of those areas. Just your thoughts on the Chinese competition question?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, I would say, if it's specifically around the research market, I would say we don't see a lot of copied, because quite frankly \u2013 ours, I think, I would put in the high-tech category, right? I mean, when we think about our research products, it's cellular imaging, it's high content imaging, it's fairly sophisticated technology. So, we do not \u2013 or we haven't up to this point run up against local competition.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Rob, I just want to start and \u2013 you guys put up a nice first quarter \u2013 the tone at the beginning, a little bit more muted. At this point of year, is this just caution around everything we see in the press or is there anything else that you're keeping an eye on specifically?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would say, if you're talking about caution maybe from a topline perspective, I think a lot of it is, again, if you just look at some of the macro factors out there, there's a lot to be concerned about from the standpoint of PMI, whether you look at the global number or whether you look at the U.S. numbers, it's a little bit. But we've \u2013 I think global PMI was the second weakest reading during the last 40 months, down to like 50.1. Production growth slipped to a 16-month low in the European Union. So, I mean, there's a lot of economic numbers out there that gives you a little bit of concern. Contrast that with, I mean, we feel good about our business and we continue to like the areas we operate in. But I just think when you look at some of the economic indicators out there, there's \u2013 it's prudent to be a little bit cautious.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah, that's fair. And then, just one more on what you're seeing in terms of the underlying birth rates maybe in different geographies. Have you seen China start to show some improvement? And then, everybody's favorite topic, Zika, whether you've seen that in any particular markets as well? Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say in the case of China, our people there are suggesting that probably something in high single, low double digit is what we would expect from a birth rate. In the U.S., we're seeing something in the sort of 1% to 2%. And I would say, clearly in Brazil, we've seen a dramatic drop in the birth rate there. Now, it's not a huge business for us, but we're seeing probably a 30%, 40% drop in birth rates in Brazil. And now offsetting that to some extent, I mentioned the fact that we are selling some of our research products into that analysis, but clearly that's impacting us in Brazil more specifically and a little bit in the South America area.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mira Minkova with Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Let me go back for a moment to the very strong Environmental business performance in the quarter. It was pretty impressive, particularly that early in the year. Can you maybe give us a little bit of more context behind of \u2013 besides food testing. What did so well in the quarter, how sustainable is it and in the context of your cautions commentary in industrial markets last quarter, how did industrial do? And I do have a follow-up.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I would say, there was \u2013 I would say sort of three drivers to the Environmental strength. One was food; the other was sort of Environmental generally, so more in the sort of air and water area was also a good grower. And then I would sort of spike out China specifically; I talked about the fact that China was double digit growth for us. So, those are the sort of three big drivers.", "If you look at industrial specifically, it was down low single digits, and I would say the driver to that was, one, very difficult comparison, so it was up high single digits in Q1 of 2015. And then the other area was we saw a little bit of weakness in what we would call sort of material characterization, which is largely in areas like polymers, maybe a little bit in sort of paints and chemicals. And I would spike that out from the sort of product perspective.", "Whether it's sustainable or not, I would say we are not forecasting that type of growth to continue in the year. I mean, I would say that we think Environmental sort of moderates probably more to a lower single digit growth, as we look at in the sort of second, third and fourth quarters.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. And on the gross margin, to what extent was the improvement driven by your Lean initiatives or the Lean program, and when might we see a bigger impact from Lean?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think you're going to see that impact from Lean grow as the year progresses. We've said most of our gross margin impact is really going to occur in the second half of the year as these initiatives are rolled out. I think the Lean initiatives probably were about a third of the improvement in the first quarter. I think we did have some pricing initiatives within our Human Health business that contributed another piece and then the incremental volume was probably the third piece.", "I think you're going to start to see the Lean initiatives and the productivity initiatives being implemented, within operations, start to accelerate in the second, third and fourth quarters. And as we said, we think our gross margin expansion for the year will be somewhere in the 70 to 80 basis point range. So, being 30 in the first quarter, you can see, it's a fairly rapid acceleration through the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citibank. Your line is now open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi, guys. This is actually Brian (40:05) on behalf of Dan. Just jumping a little bit further into EH, I thought it was interesting how strongly the op margin was in the quarter. Correct me if I'm wrong, I think it might be the strongest in at least over five years. So, I just kind of want to see how that run rate goes or should pace going forward, especially in light of the weak China renminbi, et cetera, and if you can give any color around, if that had a drag on EH performance?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, I would say, again, going back to some of the comments we've made previously, where we said we wanted to be very focused in investing in where we saw the greatest growth opportunities. At the same time, we wanted to make sure that we were getting our cost structure appropriate for what potentially could be a slower growth in some of the other areas.", "So, you may recall that in the back half of 2015, we took some restructuring actions in the Environmental Health area. And so, I think they've got a cost structure now that hopefully will allow us that margin performance that you saw in the first quarter should be sustainable through 2016 and going forward.", "Unknown Speaker", "Was there any net dilution from the renminbi there that dragged down results given the highest revenue...?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, not material.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Not material.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. And then lastly from me on the services side, is there any large contracts that are coming up this year and can you give us any color across the board on retention rate or at least how retention...?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say in any given year, there are some large contracts that come up \u2013 would rather not get into those specifics \u2013 but I would say these are generally three year contracts, so in any 12 months period, you're going to get some big ones. Our retention rate generally is very high. I would \u2013 so call it north of 85%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is now open.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "Good afternoon guys. So, I just wanted to clarify.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon, Ross.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "On the paddles business, can you just kind of provide us with sort of your thoughts on the pacing for the remainder of the year? And obviously, there's been some mix challenges in that business, how you're sort of thinking about the medium-term growth outlook for that sub-segment even though it's small?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think as \u2013 I think we alluded to it a little bit \u2013 it continues to have a little bit of a headwind. It was down low single digits in the quarter. I think that's probably going to be the case in Q2 again, maybe even a little bit more than that, maybe high single digits. I think as we get to the back half of the year maybe that improves a little bit. But I think our belief right now is for 2016 that's probably flat to down low single digits. And it's just facing some very challenging short-term market headwinds, but at the same time it's got a great team and they continue to execute well. So, the profitability, even given the headwinds from the topline, they continue to sort of operate it \u2013 operating margins above the corporate average. And the challenging thing, you know Ross, that this is the one business where we're component supplier, and obviously, selling into the large hospital CapEx market, it just \u2013 unfortunately a little more volatile than the overall portfolio \u2013 but bottom line, it's a good business.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "Fair. And then Andy, I don't know if I missed it, what's your view on cash conversion for the year?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "We \u2013 we're still committed to our delivering one times adjusted net income, which is essentially $300 million. And I had talked earlier about that we had a very strong finish to the year, which did impact us a bit in the first quarter. Most of it is timing, and we've already seen some of that reverse. We had some higher inventory builds for supporting some new products; we think that'll flow through. So, at this point, there's no reason to think we shouldn't be able to hit that one times adjusted net income or $300 million.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "Awesome. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Last quarter, you positioned 2016 as an investment year. You did that coming off a quarter where you came up a bit light of your expectations. You set revenue guidance at a pretty low level for the year. Three months later, there's a bit more operating leverage in the quarter than expected and you're bumping growth guidance. So, while R&D investment did grow, I think, it was about 5% in the quarter, I am wondering if you held back on investment in the quarter at least early on, given the uncertainty and concern that you acknowledged back in the Q4 call in February? And now as we look ahead, given that you grew better than expected in the quarter and you guided up expectations, should we expect investment to ramp from here and maybe even more so if you see more upside?", "I guess I'm just trying to figure out if we're getting ahead of ourselves given that while you did beat Q1 expectations, organic growth was still only 3.5%, 4% against a favorable comp, which I know you want to do better. And while bumped-up guidance is definitely a step in the right direction, it's still only for 4% growth. So, I am just \u2013 I guess wondering \u2013 whether you feel comfortable at this point ramping up investment pursuant to objectives?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, there's a lot of questions wrapped into that comment. So, first of all, we didn't hold back any R&D. I mean, to some extent, we knew it was going to be ramp up in \u2013 during the year anyway because you're sort of hiring the people and sort of spending the money. But, what I would tell you is, while it looks like our R&D went up roughly $2 million in the quarter, actually it went up $4 million in Human Health and it was down a little bit in Environmental. So, we've been ramping up fairly significantly.", "I would say the difference between three months ago and now is not necessarily the fact that we slowed down R&D \u2013 and I think Andy alluded to this to some extent \u2013 it's actually we're seeing the benefits of our productivity and Lean initiatives sooner than we thought. And I would say that's the fundamental reason why we beat in the first quarter. And that's why we felt comfortable taking the entire beat in the first quarter and flowing it through.", "But to your point, with regard to will we continue to invest? That's the plan and we continue to expect that in 2016, R&D will be 40 basis points higher as a percentage of revenue than it was in 2015.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Rob, that's super helpful. And if you actually track ahead of plan again at the topline over the next couple of quarters, should we think that you're more likely to reinvest that, given some of the things you're excited about in terms of growth drivers for the out years? Or should we expect kind of a normal balance of reinvestment as well as letting it flow through?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think there'd be probably a normal balance. I mean, there are obviously \u2013 there are some things that we'd like to do \u2013 but one of the things I think I mentioned in the beginning of the year was, we purposely wanted to take our R&D up because we saw some terrific opportunities to invest it in. So, where we saw the opportunities, we're funding them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with UBS. Your line is now open.", "Harris Iqbal - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. This is actually Harris on behalf of Jon, appreciate the question. Kind of a follow-up to your comments earlier on NTD. As you continue to refocus the portfolio, can you walk us through maybe more broadly, everything in that, which product lines make sense for PerkinElmer versus divesting and how far along would you say you are in that process?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I don't know that I want to get into specific businesses, we're either going to keep or sell on the call, quite frankly. But I would say, we have discussions continually with the board regarding whether we're the right owner of the assets. And I would say, right now as we sort look across the portfolio, we think we're right owner. However, if a better owner is willing to pay us a strategic premium to be the better owner, we're willing to look at those types of things. But I think I sort of articulated why we thought NTD made sense to sell, but as of right now, all the businesses we have we think make sense in the portfolio.", "Harris Iqbal - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Thanks. A couple on the international front, I want to start with Japan. Your commentary there seems a little more cautious and maybe some of the peers that are kind of guiding for status quo to maybe a slight improvement. So, wondering kind of what's behind that? And then in Europe, we had another negative data point from one of the smaller cap tools companies tonight on equipment in Europe. Just wondering what the risks are to that business? And then lastly in China, I didn't hear you quantify what you thought the government tenders on that could do this year, but if you can give any color around that, that would be helpful.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, let me go through. So in Japan, I mean, we were down sort of low-mid single digits in Japan; that's better than what we saw in 2015, but we're still concerned. I think what we've said in the past is, at least in the latter half of the year, we get easier comps. So, I think our view for Japan right now is sort of flat, maybe down a little bit. For us, we're seeing pretty good strength in Environmental, but continued headwinds in Human Health. And a lot it is because we think the academic funding is still not flowing. So, we will continue to be cautious on Japan. But like I said, I think it probably gets better in the second half of the year.", "Your question on China with regard to the blood screening, I think as Andy talked about, we had a very strong quarter there. And I would say when we think about 2016 versus 2015, we think that business at least doubles. And I think we've said in the past, that we think over the next couple of years, it's a $50 million business; we think we're well on track to achieve that. So, again, we feel very good about that business. We feel very good about the traction that business is getting and we feel very good about the percentage of tenders we're winning.", "Your other question I think was around Europe and was it specifically on product, tell me again, Tycho.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. It was just more on equipment in Europe, I mean, we have two negative data points from tools companies that have missed on system sales in Europe, so I'm just wondering what \u2013 if there's any risk to kind of your outlook there?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Europe for us was sort of mid-single digits and it was fairly even balanced between Human and Environmental Health. I think probably service grew a little faster than products, but I mean, nothing more than just sort of the overall macro concern that we I sort of highlighted before. If you look at some of the data coming out on the sort of production growth in the PMI, it makes you a little cautious. But I think we still feel like Europe's stabilized and should grow in the sort of low to mid-single digits.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess first question, you mentioned the birth rates are down historically in Brazil 30% to 40% as a result of Zika. Obviously, it's an unknown here in the U.S. in terms of how this could expand, but there is some data out to suggest that you could be looking at multiple mosquito species as vectors and so, how are you guys thinking about that as it relates to the potential impact on overall screening in the prenatal space? Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say we're not really factoring that in in any sort of forecast. I mentioned that I think in the U.S., it was up 1% to 2%, and I think that's what we've assumed in our forecast. We'll see. If that starts to have a more dramatic impact and we see birth rates decline a little bit, we'll sort of adjust accordingly. But I would say right now, that's not our assumption.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. And then, thanks for the color on the blood screening \u2013 Tycho's question. Do we have a target for when this should be fully penetrated within the China blood collection...?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know that it'll ever be fully penetrated because I think it will continue to grow. But I would say probably 2017 is the \u2013 is where \u2013 you'll probably see sort of a slowdown in instrument placements. But you'll still continue to see sort of reagent growth there, we believe.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah. Thank you. Andy, just a question on the pricing environment. I think you said, strong pricing in Human Health, but I guess, could you give an update more color there and how about pricing in the Environmental side? Thanks.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I would say, we typically across PerkinElmer, get pricing specifically around reagents and consumables and some pricing around service. Instruments have been a little bit more of a struggle. On the Human Health side, we implemented some new pricing programs and some discounting programs within our sales organization late in the fourth quarter last year, and we've rolled those out across geographies and we're starting to see the traction, first in the U.S., and we think we'll start to see traction in Europe and Asia to follow. But that's really where it's been focused.", "I think we'll probably take some of those learnings and port those over to Environmental Health as well. So hopefully, we can see some upside there. But I'd say, right now, in the consumables and reagents, we do get price typically, and then, of recent which I spiked out, we got some product price on the Human Health side.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say, I think we were a little bit pleasantly surprised by some of the price that was sticking. And we think to some extent, hopefully that speaks to the differentiation nature of some of the new products we are rolling out. So, I think a lot of times when you look at your ability get price, I think that hopefully reinforces the competitive nature of the product. And so, we saw it on a research side; later this year, we're looking to come out with some new products on the Environmental side and hopefully use that as a way to get some price. But I would say on the Environmental side, the price continues to be a little challenging until we get some more of the new products out into the marketplace.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. And then, can you break out how much you got from new products in the quarter, how much revenue?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It was about \u2013 what we would calculate is about $18 million.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi. Good afternoon. Could you provide some color on your microfluidics business, particularly around, if you're seeing a disproportionate penetration of bench-top sequencers versus some of the higher throughput NGS systems? And in what types of labs are you seeing the most interest?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So the microfluidics business did quite well in the quarter. I think it was up high single digits. I would say it was fairly broad-based. So I think we saw that growth across. I mean, I don't know that I can give you specifics into what types of labs that went into, but I would say we continue to see good growth in the microfluidics. And clearly, the NGS labs is a targeted area for us, but I couldn't give you the split.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. And you seem to have \u2013 I think a lot of your businesses had pretty solid growth. I don't know if you really talked a lot about where you're the most surprised, either positively or negatively? Could you get into that?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean on the topline side, we really didn't beat by that much, so I wouldn't say there was a lot of surprises. We spiked that a little bit on food, so food was probably a little bit better than we thought. And also I would say China probably came in a little stronger than we thought. But relative to the topline, we were maybe a little bit better, but not significantly.", "I think the real surprise this quarter that we talked about was really on the margin side and I think that really relates to the fact that we're starting to see the flow-through of some of the actions that we put in place, latter part of 2015, a little sooner than we thought.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink. Your line is now open.", "Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC", "Thank you. Rob or Andy, I was hoping you could give us an update on how to size your newborn screening exposure around the globe. So how much of your business is exposed to Brazil versus North America versus elsewhere in your newborn screening?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Brazil newborn for us is in the \u2013 it's less than $20 million.", "Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC", "Okay. And Rob, can you talk about where ViaCell fits into the business now? I believe part of the rationale back when you acquired that company, was that there were some synergies between ViaCell and in NTD in terms of call point?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I would say, first of all, ViaCell in some instances, a stem cell transplant is a cure for some of the things that we uncover in our newborn screenings. So, I think there is a good tie there, and I think first of all, it ties well into our mission from the standpoint of Human and Environmental Health, so I would say that.", "And I would say cord blood is an area that I think for 2016, we believe there may be some opportunities here that \u2013 to see some nice growth. We've been participating in some studies and we could see some positive movement here in cord blood, I think, in the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "At this time, I'm showing no further questions.

As we reach the midpoint of 2016, I'm pleased with PerkinElmer's performance here to date, having successfully driven growth, expanded margins and generated strong cash flow. Specifically, during the second quarter we increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% to $0.67 per share, expanded adjusted gross margins by 90 basis points, and adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points, and came in at the midpoint of our guidance with revenue of $573 million.", "Our solid results reflect excellent operational execution from an outstanding team of employees around the world, as well as our focus on the most compelling growth investments and our continued commitment to outstanding service for our customers. Consequently, despite the ongoing mixed macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth this year and achieve our top-line growth targets.", "In addition to our financial results, I was also pleased with the progress made on our strategic priorities during the second quarter. As a reminder, the majority of our efforts this year are focused on three areas. First, driving innovation collaboratively with our customers to better leverage combined technical and application knowledge to create truly differentiated solutions, resulting in tangible customer value. Second, investing where we believe, we have the most significant opportunity to increase, maintain, or capture leading share positions. And third, continuing to drive operational effectiveness to advance our competitiveness and improve profitability.", "Turning first to innovating with our customers, a good example of this approach is a recent collaboration with the Genome Institute of Singapore, focused on advancing precision oncology. The institute aims to develop a high-throughput screening platform to predict therapeutic sensitivity in tumor models in real time, with the ultimate goal of translating precision oncology research results into the clinic. To do this, its researchers are utilizing a number of PerkinElmer products, including our automation and liquid handling solutions, as well as both our tissue and cellular imaging platforms.", "In China, a major dairy company will now use our solutions to verify nutrients, test vitamin content, and detect heavy metals in their products. This is an excellent example of where we were successfully expanding our addressable market in the food quality and safety area by leveraging the collective strength of our inorganic capabilities with Perten and Delta's expertise into new applications and products.", "In the fast-growing area of reproductive health, we are working with a number of states in the U.S. to facilitate the screening of lysosomal storage diseases, or LSDs, enabling early detection of these rare inherited metabolic disorders in compliance with the HRSA-recommended newborn screening panel.", "We also recently introduced several new products to strengthen our core offerings. These include the Avio 200 ICP spectrometer, which is the smallest analyzer of its kind on the market.

During Q2, we launched an NGS 3K assay, which runs on our LabChip Touch microfluidic platform. This assay delivers the highest sensitivity at the lowest DNA sample concentration, providing customers with improved sample quality control for their sequencing experiments.", "We also expanded our NGS capabilities with the recent acquisition of BioScientific, a company based in Austin, Texas, that provides biotechnology solutions for food and feed safety testing and life science research. The acquisition builds upon our food franchise with the addition of immunoassay-based technologies that detect pathogens, toxins and other contaminants. Additionally, Bio's laboratory preparation offering for next generation sequencing broadens our NGS workflow solutions.", "To drive innovation, we once again increased our R&D spending in the second quarter and are on track to increase R&D as a percentage of sales by 50 basis points for the full year. As we have communicated previously, we are concentrating a greater portion of our growth investments in four priority areas. These areas includes food quality and safety, pharma services and solutions, reproductive health, and emerging market diagnostics, and represents roughly 40% of PerkinElmer's total revenues. The benefits of this strategy is already paying off. In the second quarter organic revenue for all four of these areas grew by greater than 10%, and in each of these areas the rate of growth increased sequentially.", "Andy will cover this in more detail, but the strong growth we experienced in these businesses helped offset headwinds in the industrial (7:45) markets as well as declining demand in medical imaging. Going forward, one of the keys to our ability to accelerate top-line growth rates will be further expanding these priority areas as a percentage of total company revenue.", "Turning to our progress on operational execution, we have experienced excellent gross margin expansion during the first two quarters of this year. Our multifaceted approach to achieving cost excellence, enhancing quality, and providing customers with a superior experience continues to pay off with incremental efficiencies and productivity improvements.", "First, we made good progress in the second quarter with a new team implementing Lean throughout our manufacturing sites. Second, we just launched design for excellence and product lifestyle engineering initiatives to both enhance our new product development approach, as well as deploy new standards for product reliability. These initiatives involve R&D and manufacturing working together, and will enable us to deliver greater customer value and competitiveness through designing and manufacturing our products more cost effectively.", "As we move into the second half of the year, we anticipate an economic environment that will provide both opportunities and challenges. On the positive side, we continue to see accelerating growth for our diagnostic business as a number of our initiatives are expanding both our share and addressable market. In addition, our OneSource business continues to benefit from the growth in pharma spending and increased outsourcing. And our food analysis business is benefiting from increased synergies across our portfolio as well as the overall growth of the market.", "However, creating headwinds to these trends are continuing concerns about the industrial end markets, as GDP and PMI numbers remain concerning, as well as medical imaging continues to face declining market demand. As a result, we are maintaining our second half organic revenue forecast, and our adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged as well.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to discuss our Q2 financial results and forecast in more detail. Andy?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon everyone. Consistent with previous quarters will provide some additional color on our end-markets, a financial summary of our second quarter results, as well as details around our third-quarter and full-year outlook.", "Starting with the second quarter, we continue to be pleased with our operational execution. The success from key Lean and indirect spend initiatives have afforded us the opportunity to make meaningful growth investments across the portfolio and still deliver solid financial results to our shareholders. For the second quarter, adjusted revenues were $573 million, approximately the midpoint of our guidance range of $570 million to $575 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.67, up 12% from the comparable period a year ago, and above the high end of our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.66.", "Overall, the quarter played out essentially as expected. Looking at our end markets, we saw accelerating diagnostic demand, healthy pharma and biotech sales, and strong growth in food. This strength however was partially offset by softer than expected industrial end-market demand and a weak performance in academic and government, primarily in the U.S. due in part to a difficult double-digit prior year comparison.", "Looking at our geographic results for the second quarter, we experienced double-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, low single-digit growth in Europe and low single-digit declines in the Americas. We continue to be pleased with our results in emerging markets, where second-quarter organic revenue increased mid-teens compared to the same period a year ago, driven by a strong performance in China, which more than offset weak demand in Brazil. Overall, our emerging market demand continues to remain resilient.", "As to China specifically, organic revenues grew double digits in the quarter, with broad-based strength from both our Human and Environmental Health segments. Within Environmental Health, our Haoyuan blood screening business had another solid revenue performance, with strength expected to continue into the second half of 2016. On the Environmental side, food and environmental testing solutions were the key contributors to Environmental Health's solid performance in China.", "As to our operating results for the quarter, adjusted gross margins were 47.9%, up 90 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by successful Lean initiatives, volume leverage and mix. We remain encouraged by the progress we're seeing from our Lean activities.", "Adjusted SG&A was 24.3%, essentially flat over the same period a year ago as a percentage of adjusted revenue. We continue to believe that we can successfully leverage our G&A at a rate approximately half the pace of our revenue growth. Looking at Research and Development, second quarter spending was approximately $2 million higher than the same period last year, driven by ongoing investments in our four strategic initiatives: emerging market diagnostics, pharma and biotech services, food, and reproductive health \u2013 including R&D funding supporting Vanadis, an acquisition we announced in the first quarter.", "Overall, we were encouraged by our operational performance in the second quarter as we also expanded adjusting operating margins by approximately 50 basis points, while still funding incremental R&D investments.", "Looking below the operating line, second-quarter net interest and other expense was approximately $5 million and our second quarter adjusted tax rate was just over 18%. Our first-half 2016, adjusted tax rate was approximately 19.7% and remains in line with our expected full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 19.5%.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $250 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.8 times. In July, we announced the successful completion of a \u20ac500 million senior note offering. With a 10-year tenor and 1.875% coupon, we have efficiently extended our overall weighted-average debt maturities by approximately 3.8 years. While we do expect some modest dilution related to this offering, we anticipate covering the incremental interest cost through our ongoing operational initiatives.", "We were also pleased with our strong cash flow generation in the second quarter. Total operating cash flow for the first half of 2016 was $128 million, as compared to $101 million in the same period last year. For the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted free cash flow commitment of $300 million. I'd also like to note that our board recently approved a new two-year $8 million share repurchase authorization that will replace the current repurchase authorization that was set to expire in October of 2016.", "Turning to our segment results for the second quarter, Human Health organic revenue grew approximately 6%, with Environmental Health declining 1% as compared to the same period a year ago. From an end-market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the second quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and Life Sciences Solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.", "Second-quarter 2016 organic revenue from our Diagnostics business was driven by double-digit growth in our core diagnostics franchises, with China and India both up over 25%. As mentioned, we continued to make significant progress in our Haoyuan business, with strengthening reagent demand now supporting recent instrument placements highlighted in previous quarters. In addition, we successfully captured a number of key neonatal wins in Pakistan, Jordan and Poland, which also contributed to this performance.", "Within medical imaging, we see increasing demand for a number of new CMOS applications as diversification efforts within the portfolio gain traction. However, the business overall declined high single digits in the quarter due to continued weak hospital CapEx demand.", "As expected, organic revenue in our Life Sciences Solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, driven by strength in pharma and biotech and further bolstered by broad-based demand in our OneSource and informatics franchises. As mentioned, academic and government spending in the U.S. was soft in the quarter, due in part to a very strong double-digit comparison to the second quarter of 2015.", "Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented approximately 38% of adjusted revenue, organic revenues declined 1% for the second quarter. Growth was once again led by our food testing offerings, which grew double digit in China, but was offset by softer than expected industrial demand. We continue to forecast improving but modest growth for the second half, bolstered by a number of new product launches that Rob mentioned earlier.", "Looking at operating segment margins, the results were essentially in line with expectations. Environmental Health margins expanded 160 basis points as strong mix, prior year restructuring actions, and solid operational execution all contributed to this performance in the quarter. Human Health margins were essentially flat, largely due to planned growth investments and mix, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing initiatives implemented at the end of last year.", "Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2016, we believe we are well position to deliver another solid financial performance with an expectation for continued stability in a majority of our end markets, partially offset by softer demand from industrial end markets.", "As a reminder, we are cycling up against an extra week in the third quarter of 2015, which contributed a benefit of approximately 200 basis points to our revenue performance last year. Accordingly, for the third quarter of 2016, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents organic revenue growth of roughly 2% to 3%, which is consistent with our previous outlook. Third-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.67.", "Looking at our outlook for the full year, the majority of our businesses are expected to deliver solid results, and while we expect that the soft industrial demand experienced in the second quarter will continue, we continue to expect our organic revenue growth to be approximately 4% for the year, and we are maintaining our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, with a midpoint of $2.80.", "This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time we'd like to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Thank you. And our first question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Great, thank you. Can you provide an update on the China blood screening? Is there future placement opportunities there? And how is it ramping with the existing instruments that were replaced in mid-2015?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, the China blood screening business had another strong quarter in Q2, it actually more than doubled. And so we're starting to see the reagent flow-through of the instrument placements in the tender that we won in 2015.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "To add to that, we are probably two-thirds of the way through the tender process, but there are still tenders out there. We continue to capture our fair share of those. And we continue to believe that we will be able to see increasing reagent flow through, and that obviously is helpful for the margin.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Okay, got it. And then, I know Brazil newborn screening is a small piece of the business, but are you seeing any impact from the birth rate slowdown from Zika?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I would say, clearly, our Brazilian business has been hit fairly significantly there. I think it was down greater than 25%. I guess, if there's any good news, the Brazilian business is getting so small that it's becoming somewhat irrelevant, but yeah, there's been a severe impact on the newborn screening business there.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Afternoon, guys. Thanks.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hey, Dan.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Rob, it looks like you might have been \u2013 hey, Andy \u2013 a little bit light relative to your 4% organic forecast for the quarter, maybe a half point or so by my math. So, without splitting hairs, would you say that that was due to Environmental Health? Or was it more of a split between Environmental Health and some of the declines you saw in medical imaging? Just trying to see where you have your model.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say, it was probably a combination \u2013 it was a combination of both of those. I would say Environmental was a little light. And we continue to see challenges on the industrial end-markets. I think in the beginning of the year, we highlighted that we're a little concerned about there, and I think we figured that could be down sort of mid single-digits. We're actually seeing a little bit greater headwind than that.", "And then, medical imaging also, I think we handicap that as sort of down slightly, and we're seeing again probably something like high single-digit growth declines there. We did see some offsets though, China was clearly stronger than we thought, and the majority of the diagnostic business was stronger than we thought. But as you said, on balance it was a relatively minor impact there. Maybe Andy, just want to cover that for a second?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, yeah, we gave guidance at the end of the first quarter for the second quarter of $570 million to $575 million, and if you look at the midpoint of the range, which is where came in, really to get to 4% organic you kind of needed to be slightly north of the midpoint. And in addition, in the quarter we had a little bit of a tailwind from FX, maybe it was $1 million, but in order to round up to the 4% versus the 3%, we really needed to be at the high end of the range. But just to kind of be clear, we're talking about $2 million, a little less than $2 million, or about 0.3 percentage point, which really swung the difference between three and four.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Got it. So even less than a half a point there is what we're talking about, okay. And then maybe just as a follow up, Rob, I think last quarter you quantified new product revenues as $18 million or so. Would you care to comment just on how, A, this looked for this quarter for new products, and then maybe how that number tracks through 3Q and 4Q?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, similar number. I think actually for the second quarter it was around $17 million from an incremental perspective. I mentioned the fact that the Avio 200 came out really towards the latter part of the quarter, so we're excited about that. We're starting to see early traction. And then as we get into the second half of the year, some of the new products coming out of the research area just start to gain some traction. So one of the reasons I think we feel optimistic about the back half, and sort of a slight acceleration in the organic growth rate, is because of the new products and the expectation that they'll accelerate from an incremental revenue contribution perspective.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Mishan with KeyBanc, and your line is open.", "Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure.", "Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey, around medical and imaging, I know you guys supply into the OEMs, but do you have a sense of kind of which regions are driving the weakness? I think the U.S. \u2013 on the U.S. capital spend and hospital capital spending side has been pretty stable and robust, but emerging markets, Europe have been fairly weak. Do you have a sense of what's really causing it for you?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say our weakness is largely more in Europe than it is in the U.S. And then again as we've tried to expand out the breadth of our medical imaging capabilities, I would say clearly on the CMOS and the industrial side, we continue to see good growth. The challenge has been really more in both oncology as well as radiology. So it's sort of limited in those areas, but outside there we continue to see pretty good growth.", "Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And then, just to clarify, I think you said, you though that Core Diagnostics was up double digits. When you say Core Diagnostics, is that just excluding the medical imaging? And if you're able to get medical imaging back to flat, you're running it at a double-digit rate there? I'm just trying to understand...?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, yes in fact. The difference between Core Diagnostics is, it excludes medical imaging, and that was double digit organically in the quarter.", "Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for the time here. Just a few clarifications on my end. One, the new repurchase authorization, can you give us a sense for the pace at which you're thinking about executing on that? And then second, maybe also for Andy, could you give, us in dollars or in basis points, what the contribution was in the quarter for M&A? And then I have one for Rob.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I can answer probably the first two, and then I'll let you ask Rob's question. On M&A, it was basically immaterial. So for modeling purposes, we will not have anything to really report there. As far as the other question \u2013 I just blanked on it. What was your first question?", "Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Share count.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Share count. We don't \u2013 we tend to be fairly opportunistic with our share repurchase. Our first preference continues to be around M&A, and we feel like we've got a pretty good pipeline. So as far as capital deployment, that is and will continue to be our preference. I think it's just really more it was a matter of timing, we had the Board together last week, so we elected to get it reapproved. But it is a two-year timeframe for those, and so we do re-up those. But there isn't any formalized program that is being contemplated at this point.", "Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then, Rob, just to sort of dovetail with that, on the last call you made a comment about a medium-term plan for mid-teens earnings growth, and I believe there was a clarification as to whether it was excluding cap deployment, and now that we have a little bit more clarity on cap deployment with the buyback authorization, I wondered if you'd just care to talk us through how that \u2013 it might or might not impact your thinking about medium-term earnings growth? Thank you.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think what you're mentioning is, on the last call we talked about sort of the business model, and I talked about how we think through the cycle, we like to be a sort of mid single, call it 5% revenue growth or organic revenue growth, and if we were to achieve that, what kind of bottom line improvement would we see there? And we said probably mid teens. And then depending on what we did with our cash flow, whether we bought back shares or made incremental acquisitions, to what extent that would add to the EPS growth or accretion.", "And I think we still feel good about that model. What you're seeing in the first half of the year is sort of 3%, 4% organic growth, we're generating 12% EPS growth. So I think we feel confident if we can get the organic growth up 100 basis points or so, that we could sort of make that 15% EPS growth sort of achievable.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great, thanks (28:24). On the debt that you raised, Andy, is that primarily for the buyback, or also just kind of meant to be opportunistic for other things that might come up?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "When we initially went in to this, and we're looking at our capital structure, we really felt like we wanted to have more fixed-term debt, especially given the rates, and if you looked at the Euro rates of recent, they seemed very attractive. And so the purpose at this stage or the use of the funds at this stage is really to pay down the revolver, and if you read some of the filings we're also amending and extending the revolver, so we'll end up with about $1 billion of what I would consider fixed-term debt, the tenor of this is 10 years, so we have increased those terms by about 3.8 years in total for the two debt offerings we have out there, and that leaves us with about $1 billion on the revolver for whatever purposes we might use that for.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And then, Rob, is there \u2013 it feels like, from everyone that's reported to date, hearing kind of mixed messages on industrial, and I recognize that the specific exposures of each companies are not always comparing apples-to-apples. But when you think about industrial, like expand that to include food and environmental and the like, can you just give a little bit more clarity on what you're seeing? I know we all see the PMI, but just kind of what you're seeing or feeling there in that broader market. Thank you.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I would say, first of all, just for just for clarification, when we talk about industrial, we're talking about a more limited subset. So we would consider food really separate, and we would consider environmental, which for us is largely air and water, would be separate as well. So our industrial is really around sort of petrochemical, chemical, very \u2013 little bit of semicon and a little bit of oil and gas, but that's sort of the majority of our industrial.", "And, I think if you recall, in the beginning of the year, we were a little concerned not only about the macroeconomic trends, but also in 2015, our industrial grew mid single-digit, so we suspected we were going to have a difficult comp. And so I think we modeled in something with sort of mid single-digit declines, and as I mentioned previously, we're actually seeing something that's more like high single-digit/low double-digit declines. And our indications, and the information we're looking at, would not suggest that's going to change for the foreseeable future. So one of the things we're assuming in the back half of the year is that, in fact, industrial headwinds continue as they have in the first half of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Hey, guys. This is actually Bill on for Paul. How you doing?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "I wonder if you could just talk a bit about the food safety business. What are you seeing in that end market? And have you seen any pickup in demand or conversation since the last FSMA law went online in May?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I think as we mentioned previously, food was very strong for us in Q2, it grew double-digit, sort of in mid-teen area. I would say that's a combination of probably three factors. One is, I think the overall market is strong and growing, and I think a lot of that is just continued awareness and media recognition of some of the issues around food. So clearly, the food companies are investing in that area.", "I would say the second area is, we continue to see significant investments coming out of China. So if you look at the food in China specifically, that was very strong. And the third area I think is unique to PerkinElmer, and I think the combination of the offerings we had historically in Environmental, combined with Perten and combined with Delta, and I gave an example specifically with a dairy company we're working with in China, is allowing us to better penetrate and provide some novel solutions to the customers. And so I think it's a combination of all three of those that's driving this very strong growth we're experiencing.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Great. And then, maybe just one on the industrial side. With oil prices kind of stabilizing, what are you seeing in terms of that end market? Is that part of the headwind you're facing, or is it maybe other sub-segments of the industrial market?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say, as I mentioned previously, oil and gas is relatively small for us. It's a small subset of our industrial, so it doesn't really drive a lot. I think what you're \u2013 the impact on the oil price, and in fact we've seen a little bit of a decline here, I would say more recently, it's probably more just in general confidence and the impact it has on sort of the macro effect. I think there's a general view as oil comes down, it does have a dampening effect on the overall economy, at least from a business perspective. But as far as direct exposure for us, the oil and gas, it's small.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Got it. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks. Rob, if I go back to the beginning of the year, you were one of the two companies talking about a potential recovery in Europe in the back half of the year. Can you maybe just share your latest thoughts on that? I mean, I know some of it's dependent on new products, but are you still expecting a pickup in the back half of the year?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say, when we look at the geographic split of our revenue growth, actually Europe was pretty good in the second quarter. I think Andy talked about sort of mid single-digit, and if you look at where the research was strong, diagnostics were strong, and the thing that sort of depressed that to a large extent was medical imaging. So we're seeing some pretty good growth already in Europe, and our expectation is we'll continue to see some good growth in the back half of the year. So I would say from our perspective, Europe has stabilized and actually picked up a little bit relative to what we saw in the latter part of the 2015 and in the first quarter.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then now that you've had Vanadis for a few months, any updated thoughts on how that's going, and are there milestones we can track ahead of maybe 2017 or 2018 launch?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I would say we continue to be enthusiastic about the progress we're seeing there. I think as I mentioned in the past, we think we've got a terrific team. They continue to make progress on the development of the offering there.", "I would say the one sort of significant milestone is, what we wanted to do with the Vanadis technology was not only continue to develop that to a commercial product, but also to integrate it with some of the PerkinElmer offerings. So it uses imaging capability, and we've been able to integrate the Operetta; it obviously uses some sample preparation for the NGS side of things, and we're using chemagen. And so that's been a sort of a great win to sort of move a lot of their capabilities onto the PerkinElmer products. But we still feel on track, and probably late 2017 is when you'll start to see the product come out, with sort of KOLs and a beta, and probably be revenue in early 2018.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, good afternoon.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "A couple of housekeeping questions. Hello?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. So, a couple of housekeeping questions. So, first of all, what's your sort of expectations for FX, the remainder of the year? And sort of full-year impacts, top and bottom line?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "For next quarter it's probably $3 million or $4 million on the top line and de minimums on the bottom, and I think that's probably got to be \u2013 maybe \u2013 it's maybe going to be neutral on the top and the bottom in the fourth quarter. So I would say, right now, based on the rates today, it's not much of a change from what we've seen. Obviously there's volatility, what we would update that if that changed, but as of right now, I don't see a big swing.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And what was the $5.5 million gain on the \u2013 the gain you had on investments?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "That was related to the sale of the NTD business earlier in the quarter.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Okay. Got it. Okay. And I guess, just sort of going on with Tycho's question. LS, you're looking for low LS, negative low single-digit growth in U.S. this year. I guess, sort of what \u2013 in this quarter. Can you talk about sort of like the pacing for the remainder of the year for the U.S., and sort of how you're looking at that market?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well I mean, if you look at the declines in the U.S., it was largely the industrial side that we talked about, a little bit in the sort of research area. Now as we look at the first couple of weeks of July, or at least a month of July, we are starting to see a little improvement of bookings in those areas, so we're cautiously optimistic. But I would say as we think about the U.S. for the latter part of the year, we think it probably maybe stabilizes at flat, but we are not forecasting significant growth.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I want to start and ask just a little bit more color on OneSource, how the service revenue was in the quarter, and then are there any notable contracts are evaluating at this point just through the end of the year that we should be looking for?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, OneSource had another good quarter. I mean, even though it comped against a strong, sort of mid-teen growth last year, it continued to grow double digit, so we continue to see nice progress there as we've talked about in the past. We think to a large extent our differentiation revolves around not only our capabilities and proven track record, but also the analytical capabilities we have with our informatics offering.", "With regard to contracts, I would say at any given time we have a number of contracts that are coming through, and the back half of the year is not any different. So rather than spike out any particular ones, I would say, it's a continual process. I think we've mentioned in the past that a number of these contracts, or I'd say the majority of the contracts are sort of three-year tenure. And so in any given quarter we probably have a couple that are coming to, and we continue to be optimistic about our ability to either maintain the ones we have or win the ones we don't.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. And then just a two-parter on margins. Nice growth in the Human Health business, I thought there might be a little bit more margin expansion. I know you talked about some of the business investment there. Could you maybe quantify the amount of the new R&D going through that business versus the Environmental Health? And was there any change to your guide on R&D for the full year? Thank you.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think that \u2013 this is Andy. The majority of our incremental R&D is going towards Human Health, and a big piece of that is with the Vanadis acquisition. That will continue. I think you're going to continue to see our R&D, year-over-year, certainly higher. This quarter we were up 2%. I think that type of level of 6% or just north of 6% will probably continue in the second half, at least that's what the current outlook is. And again, we're not focusing all of our R&D in Human Health, but a big portion of the incremental R&D spend is in Human Health.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. And I think the way to think about for the full year, we're assuming that R&D as a percentage of sales goes up about 50 basis points.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI, and your line is open.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Hi, good afternoon, guys. I guess in the context of something we've talked about before, you have a few parts of the business that had fantastic results, you have a few parts of the business that are struggling; some have struggled for some time, like panels. I mean, as you think about sort of portfolio reconstruction and how you're feeling about your general mix of assets, and I guess you have not done much recently on the M&A side \u2013 do you feel like you're making enough progress?", "Obviously you're doing a lot of internal investment to get the growth rate higher, but to sort of get this mix to kind of an optimal level. I mean, is there stuff where you'll look and you say, well, I'd maybe contemplate that not being part of the Perkin portfolio, but I haven't been able to find the right asset yet? I'm just trying to figure out how you're thinking about the whole portfolio construction.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think that's a fair observation. And I would say not only we haven't found the right asset yet, but in a lot of instances, we're looking at what is the appropriate time to sell the asset. So I wouldn't be surprised if two years from now there's parts of PerkinElmer that probably aren't continue to be the part of the portfolio. And one of the things we're looking at is we continue to focus on the higher priority areas. We're sort of challenging ourselves on, let's say, some of the core product offerings. And particularly, to the extent that we think in order to be more competitive, it requires either greater scale or significant inorganic investment to, say, either accelerate market diversification or product diversification.", "And so, obviously we evaluate the potential return of those investments versus possible commitments to overdrive other areas, right? And so ultimately if we determine those investments, they'll make sense relative to other alternatives, there probably should be another owner. And to your point, I think we focused a lot of time over the last maybe 24 months in making sure that we're optimizing the profitability and the growth prospects as we own it; at some point, to take it in the next level, it probably requires a different owner who will be willing to invest more inorganically in the business.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "That's fair. Thanks, Rob.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.", "Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Hi, good evening guys. Two questions for you. First, I was wondering if you can just provide any color on some of the recent smaller mass spec acquisitions you've made, and how those fit in with the business? And then secondly, if you could remind us what drove the strong academic and government spending in the U.S. a year ago that you're comping against this quarter?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I'll take the first one. So I mentioned one in particular, we made a, call it a relatively small acquisition here recently, a company called BioScientific. Revenue for this year will probably be, I don't know, $11 million, $12 million, something like that. But we are excited about it because it brings two capabilities, it has a portfolio of NGS Library Prep kits, they go on both Illumina and Ion Torrent, they're particularly good at nucleic acid isolation, and their expertise particularly in increasing enzymatic efficiency. So we like that capability.", "They also bring some strong capabilities around the food area, and in a particularly in the area of detection of microbial and industrial contaminants. And we like that portfolio of assets as well. So small deal from a revenue perspective, but we're excited about the capabilities that they bring, and again, complementary with two of the higher growth areas that we've identified in the past.", "And we'll continue to look for those types of things. As I've said in the past, my preference would be something a little bigger, but clearly those capabilities are things that fit nicely into the PerkinElmer portfolio, and we'll continue to look for those and hopefully we'll be able to accelerate their growth and drive higher profitability.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And you know, the answer to your second question, last year we saw a significant growth in our in vivo imaging business. There was quite a bit of funding that came out during the quarter a year ago, and that really was the key driver to what was essentially double-digit growth in the prior year.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. First one was on the Medical Imaging business. You guys commented on some of the pressure you're seeing there, and I was hoping you could maybe dissect a little bit what end-markets might have driven those, to the extent that might have been narrow or broad-based? And then, second to that, what's baked into your guidance for the balance of this year in that business?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, the headwinds are really in two areas, it's in radiology and it's in oncology. And on the flip side of that, we continue to see strong growth in the, I'll call it the non-medical applications, as well as our CMOS business continued to do quite well. And that's largely in sort of surgery, and increasingly going in the dental. So, those markets continue to grow nicely. Unfortunately they're not large enough to more than offset the challenges we see in the oncology and radiology area.", "And so to mention, I would say through the first half, we've seen sort of mid-to-high single-digit declines, and to a large extent that's what we're expecting in the back. And that is a change, because I think previously, clearly in the first quarter, we thought there it would be some moderation of the pressure, and that our expectation was that in the back half of the year that we'd get medical imaging flat, maybe growing low single digits.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you. And then, just to follow up on the services side of your portfolio, you called out some of the strength in OneSource and Informatics. And I'm curious if you could maybe update us on your go-to-market strategy for those two businesses? I'm wondering if you're in a position where you're cross-selling those to the same accounts, or perhaps selling them in a bundle. Just thinking about how you are monetizing those growth opportunities? And as part of that, the margin contribution as Informatics in particular grows, I imagine the gross margin's quite attractive. So I'm wondering if it's starting to move the needle on operating margins as well.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, last year, we announced the creation of LSS, which was really taking the product business on research, our Informatics business, and our OneSource business, and combining them under one front-end structure. As a part of that, we also established a global account team, and we've been building and investing in that team for the last, now it's probably been 18 months.", "And if you look \u2013 I think we commented in 2015, we saw nice growth in the global accounts. If you look at the second quarter, the global accounts were up about 10%. And so it's a combination of going through our Informatics customers and introducing in the OneSource, and then vice-versa on the OneSource side, and then also to the extent possible trying to drive some product revenue as well. I would say at this point we're seeing much better cross-selling between Informatics and OneSource than we are in the product side, but we'll continue to drive that. And I think it's an opportunity down the road.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks, good afternoon. Rob, more of a bigger picture question. Do you guys track, or do you have a statistic around sort of what you view as your current vitality index, and where is that today relative to maybe where it was three years ago or so? Because you're increasing the spend, but it seems like the core growth is still in the 4% range. How do you think about the returns that you're getting on that incremental investment?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, so we do track it, so our vitality index is in sort of the low 20s. It's been relatively flat over the last couple years. And so what's happening is, while we are adding some new products clearly into the marketplace, some of the ones from the sort of 2010, 2011, 2012 vintage, in some cases we're \u2013 very strong growers for us are coming off. So it's actually requiring us to get a fair amount of incremental growth. I think we talked about in 2015, sort of $40 million of incremental. Now our expectation is as we get sort of into the 2017-2018 timeframe, we'd like to see that into mid and high 20s. But I would say it's taken a fair amount of work just to sort of offset what was a pretty strong class of new products in the sort of 2010, 2011, 2012 timeframe.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Then one for Andy, the Environmental Health margins in the period improved pretty nicely despite the modest organic decline. Were there any one-time benefits to that improvement? And then secondarily, any update you can share as far as the net interest expense expectation for the year?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "There really were no one-times. If anything, they had stronger operating margin expansion, but they had some higher comp expense. Their results were a bit better, so the compensation related to that was higher. So I don't think there were any unusual items. And I think we're going to continue to see good solid margin expansion in the second half, in EH.", "As far as incremental interest expense, we said it's going to be the impact of, it's about a penny, and we said we were going to essentially cover that with our operating results. That would be just related to the incremental interest.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier with Cantor Fritzgerald. Your line is open.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. India is probably the largest newborn screening market that you still have left relatively untapped. Would you provide us with an update on the status of your pilots and programs that you have established there, and the percentage of the market that you've now penetrated, and any competition that you've encountered?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, as you pointed out, India is a significant, probably 27 million births. So we talked about three pilots that we started about a year ago; two of those have moved into what I'll call active use. In addition, we have several local states that have started a newborn screen test, really looking at six disorders. We placed systems with two other states, but they haven't started their pilots yet.", "If you look at our diagnostic revenue in India, it was up 51%, but having said that, it was off a very small base. So we're starting to see some good traction there, but I think, as I think mentioned in the past, it's going to take some time to get that to a sort of a sizeable number, but at least the trends and the indications continue to be very positive.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "And how much of the regions \u2013 of the other regions within India looking at those pilots and considering starting their own, or to go all out into routine use?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, our approach has been to sort of both talk at the federal level, because ultimately for this to be broadly adopted, it's got to be sort of approved and suggested by the Indian sort of Federal Health Ministry, as well as working selective states. So it's really working both of those, and we've got a fairly significant effort in driving that.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & and Company. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, good afternoon, guys. So, I guess just a quick one to start. China and India both were strong in the quarter. Could you just give us what your expectations are for growth in the second half in terms of what you embedded into guidance?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I think in China, we went into the year saying that we thought it was going to be sort of low double, and given the strong growth we saw in the second quarter, we've taken that up a little bit. But we haven't sort of assumed that the 20% continues. So I would say maybe we've taken it from sort of low teens to sort of mid teens. India, again because it's such a low base, I would say India we're probably in the sort of 15% to 20% range.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And I guess sort of related, in the past, sometimes when we flip the calendar and get into the early days of the new \u2013 of a new China five-year plan, there is a pause in demand. Ultimately this has, at least historically, been followed by a pretty big ramp-up in demand in areas that are prioritized within the plan. You looked really well-positioned, given the focus on a number of things, including but not limited to, food and water testing, as well as increased funding for things or increased focus on things like neonatal testing.", "I'm just wondering, in the early days are you hearing or seeing anything that suggests we should be contemplating this dynamic? And is that something you factored into guidance? Or at this point, are you thinking that things may actually get going in the new five-year plan a little more smoothly than maybe we've seen the last couple of times?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Our assumption is the latter. I mean, our assumption is that it's going to be more sort of advertised or smoothly built-in. And again, because we've seen nice growth here more recently, our expectation is that we're not going to see any kind of incremental benefit from the rollout of the new five-year plan.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Emily Stent with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions. I just have one. So now that we're seeing local Zika cases in Florida, are you seeing any impact on birth trends in the U.S. or any other main geographies?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No. I mentioned earlier that clearly Brazil, we've seen our business there be reduced significantly, but we have not seen any indications at this point that it's impacting U.S. birthrates. Our data would suggest that births in the U.S. are still growing in the sort of 1%, 1.5% range. But in the case of Brazil, we're seeing a significant decline.", "Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And there are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rob Friel, for any closing remarks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Great. So, first of all, thanks for the questions, and I'd just like to conclude by reiterating that we feel great about our progress during the first half, as well as the long-term opportunity to accelerate growth over the next five years.", "At the same time, we continue to be inspired by the terrific impact that we continue to make for our customers to improve lives and the world around us.

Rob.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. This afternoon I would like to discuss our third quarter financial results as well as give an update on the progress of our strategic priorities.", "During the third quarter, we continued to drive strong operating margin expansion and EPS growth. However, our top-line performance was disappointing. Specifically, adjusted operating margins increased 190 basis points to 18.9% and adjusted EPS increased 13% to $0.68 per share over Q3 last year, while revenue was $548 million, representing a reported organic decline of 2%, and flat when excluding the extra week in the comparable prior period.", "Looking first at our end markets, we are seeing market conditions consistent with what we have experienced over the last several quarters. In the areas where we have prioritized as attractive long-term growth opportunities which include reproductive health, emerging diagnostics, food analysis, and pharma services, we continue to see strong demand. However, in government and academic, as well as industrial, environmental and medical imaging, end market conditions continue to be challenging.", "Relative to Q3, our revenue performance was negatively impacted by the additional week we had in third quarter last year as well as a more significant headwinds than expected in radiochemicals and our inherently more capital-intensive businesses, including Medical Imaging and Environmental Health. While most of the headwinds are market-related, we believe that our decision to deprioritize certain slower growth segments of the portfolio is negatively impacting revenue growth in the short-term.", "Fortunately, from a profitability perspective, the significant traction we continue to generate on operational improvements more than offset this temporary revenue shortfall. In addition, because the areas we are focused on not only grow faster, but also generate much better incremental profit flow-through, the company will inherently become much more profitable as the portfolio continues to shift in the direction we have outlined. This is reinforced by both our Q3 results as well as our financial results through the first nine months. Year-to-date through the end of the third quarter, our growth areas of focus are averaging low double-digit organic growth with operating margins of greater than 25% and incremental profit flow-through in excess of 45%.", "Year-to-date, absolute revenue growth is $5 million or 2% organic growth, while adjusted operating income has increased $19 million resulting in gross and adjusted operating margin increases of 100 basis points and 110 basis points respectively, and adjusted EPS growth of 12%. Furthermore, the margin and EPS growth has been achieved while we have increased our spending in research and development by 7%, or 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue.", "As we reflected in our third quarter results, we are disappointed by the top-line performance but pleased to see the operational execution continuing to improve gross margins and the ongoing validation of the financial benefits from our portfolio realignment. We will continue to seek inorganic growth opportunities through bolt-on acquisitions and strategic partnerships that support our investments in these areas, as well as review the composition of the portfolio and prune where appropriate as we shift the portfolio to higher growth and profitability.", "In addition to the inorganic moves, we continue to accelerate this transition by fueling organic growth through increased R&D as well as other organic moves. In that regard, we announced a significant change in our organization at the end of September, providing what we believe will be a more effective operating structure to facilitate this portfolio shift and better position PerkinElmer to strengthen our core product offerings and better align with our customers' requirements.", "As of the fourth quarter, Diagnostics is now a standalone segment, and we formed a new segment, Discovery & Analytical Solutions or DAS. The DAS segment combines our former Research and Environmental Health businesses. These new segments have now replaced our previous Human Health and Environmental Health segments.", "Looking specifically at the Diagnostic segment, we have now fully consolidated our clinical business offerings which are subject to regulatory oversight. We see significant growth opportunities across reproductive health, emerging markets, and infectious disease markets, as major macro trends generate over $2 trillion in healthcare spending each year.", "Year-to-date, our Diagnostics business is growing about 10% organically, with our top-10 Diagnostic customers growing about 20% over the last 12 months as we continue to drive our reproductive health and emerging market Diagnostic strategy. And as we continue expanding our capabilities in these diagnostics areas, such as our Vanadis non-invasive prenatal testing currently in development and on schedule, we are confident in our ability to open up new opportunities for growth.", "Additionally, as part of the recent reorganization, we formed an applied genomics group within Diagnostics by aligning our company-wide genomics offerings to better serve the fast-growing genomics market, particularly next-generation sequencing. Through this consolidation, we can now more effectively differentiate PerkinElmer as an integrated provider, helping customers with their preclinical and clinical applications. Ultimately, applied genomics will provide an enhanced sample to sequence or workflow proposition for NGS applications. The DAS segment on the other hand will be able to better coordinate how we serve our applications-focused customers, especially within pharmaceutical and biotech services and food analysis, which we believe will be strong catalysts for future growth. By changing how we are organized, we are taking the next step in our evolution to drive improved customer focus, facilitate more value-added collaboration, and deliver breakthrough innovations.", "During the quarter, we also continued to advance our efforts to improve our operational efficiencies across the organization. While Andy will provide greater detail on the financials, we delivered stronger than expected gross margin improvement in the quarter. Increasingly, the integration of R&D and operations will become even more critical to how we deliver value for our customers, as we more thoroughly synchronize the design and manufacturing of our products. A key driver of our success is our implementation of Lean as we continuously work to enhance our manufacturing, supply chain, and business processes. Andy will share more details on the actions we've been taking, and we are already seeing early wins from our projects targeting quality, cost, capacity, cycle time, and productivity. In the quarter, we also were able to successfully leverage our SG&A spend to fund our increased research and development expenditures.", "With regard to innovation, we continue to introduce new products into the marketplace, as offering truly differentiated solutions is an important component of our strategy. Based on our performance in the third quarter, we remain confident that our new product introductions this year will generate an incremental $40 million in revenue. In addition, we continue to increase the importance of new products and innovation throughout the organization.", "During the third quarter, we held our second annual innovation summit, which brought together over 175 of our top scientists, engineers, and product managers with several key customers to facilitate collaboration and sharing of ideas. At this event, we also recognized 25 PerkinElmer associates who were responsible for securing two or more patents over the last 12 months. The recent organizational changes announced at the end of the quarter should permit a more efficient use of our R&D spending, as well as better enable us to prioritize our spending toward higher growth areas. These changes, combined with our commitment to increase R&D spending as a percentage of sales, should accelerate the increase of our vitality index over the next several years.", "As we approach the end of 2016, our ongoing operational improvements in the business should help mitigate the impact of softer, near-term macroeconomic conditions. Meanwhile, we will continue to direct both our organic and inorganic investments toward our four key strategic focus areas, shaping our company into a faster organic grower with higher margins, stronger cash flow, and lower volatility. But given softer demand for analytical equipment, and as we work through the realignment of our portfolio, we remain cautious on the top-line. We are, therefore, forecasting low single-digit organic growth for the fourth quarter and adjusted EPS of $0.85 to $0.87. Assuming we achieve this guidance, our results for the full year would be organic growth of 2%, adjusted operating margin expansion of 90 basis points, and adjusted EPS growth of 8 to 9%.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Andy.", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Thanks, Rob and good afternoon, everyone. I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our year-to-date and third quarter results as well as details around our fourth quarter outlook.", "As Rob mentioned, our third quarter performance was mixed as revenues fell short of expectations; however, we continue to make very good progress towards improving our operational effectiveness, allowing us to deliver significantly better gross and operating margins along with strong adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, up 13% from the comparable period a year ago. For the third quarter, adjusted revenues were $548 million representing an organic revenue decline of approximately 2% from the same period a year ago, while year-to-date organic revenues are up approximately 2%.", "Looking at our end markets for the third quarter, we continue to see broad based strength in Diagnostics, healthy pharma and biotech demand, lower than forecasted academic and government sales, and essentially flat industrial revenues. We did see significant softness in environmental capital spend, particularly at the end of the quarter, as well as in Medical Imaging, which declined double-digit.", "Year-to-date, we've seen significant strength in our focus growth areas as we saw better than expected low teens organic growth in food, double-digit organic growth in Diagnostics, and low single-digit organic growth in pharma and biotech, in line with our expectations.", "In contrast to these strong performances, Industrial, Academic, and Government markets have been slower than expected, experiencing low single-digit organic revenue declines with Environmental experiencing a marked deceleration towards the latter part of September. Medical Imaging remains challenging, and has underperformed versus our initial expectations entering 2016.", "Looking at our third quarter and year-to-date results by geography, emerging markets remained resilient with organic revenues growing high single-digits in both the quarter and year-to-date, while developed markets softened, declining mid-single digits in the quarter.", "Strength in China and India continued with organic revenue growth greater than 20% and 10% respectively in the third quarter with a similar performance year-to-date. We believe that our focus in continued investment in emerging market opportunities is a compelling strategy and we are actively looking to increase our presence in those higher growth geographies.", "As to our operating results, third quarter adjusted gross margins expanded 170 basis points to 48.9%, while year-to-date adjusted gross margins expanded 100 basis points to 48.3%, driven by solid productivity gains and a positive mix from strong Diagnostics and Informatics growth, particularly in the current quarter.", "We have broadly rolled out strategy deployment and Lean initiatives across the organization with the aim of making meaningful improvement in operational efficiencies and product quality. In addition, we have made incremental investments in Lean talent, assembling a global team of experts focused on teaching and implementing key principles and process improvement tools across all aspects of the company.", "As a result, we're starting to see early successes as we more efficiently manage operating cost, which is reflected in lower scrap and warranty expenses year-to-date, as well as the creation of additional capacity within our manufacturing operations. This incremental capacity has afforded us the opportunity to bring in-house a number of previously outsourced manufacturing activities, reducing overall product cost and thereby contributing to incremental gross margin expansion. We see this momentum building in the coming months and years as we expand these efforts across all of our manufacturing and service operations, giving us increased confidence in our ability to meet our long-term goal of expanding gross margin by more than 300 basis points by 2020.", "Moving to our operating expenses, we continue to leverage SG&A and reinvest in R&D. Third quarter adjusted SG&A was down 90 basis points with R&D approximately 50 basis points higher than same period last year. The extra week in the third quarter of 2015 was comprised of a full week of incremental expenses, coupled with more modest revenue growth, and this had a positive impact on our year-over-year operating results. Year-to-date, adjusted SG&A is down 50 basis points, driven by prior restriction activities and indirect spend initiatives, while incremental R&D investments are focused on new product development, primarily within reproductive health. Overall, we were very encouraged by our strong third quarter and year-to-date operational performance as we expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 190 basis points and 110 basis points respectively.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with net debt of approximately $800 million and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.8 times. We feel we have significant flexibility to create further shareholder value through M&A and we are actively looking to close on transactions in the coming quarters.", "Our operating cash flow generation remains strong with year-to-date operating cash flow of approximately $200 million, as compared to $160 million in the same period last year. We are beginning to see improvements in our working capital performance driven by system enhancements, which are facilitating our collection efforts, as well as our Lean initiatives, which are helping to lower our global inventory requirements.", "Turning to our segment results for the third quarter, Human Health organic revenue was essentially flat, with Environmental Health declining 5% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, Human Health organic revenue was up 3%, with Environmental Health flat as compared to the same period last year.", "This will be the last quarter we will be operating our operating segments in this format. For the fourth quarter of 2016 we will report our segment results as Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions, or DAS, and we expect to have restated results posted to our website ahead of our fourth quarter analyst conference call.", "From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the third quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and Life Sciences Solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.", "As I mentioned earlier, we had strong and broad based demand across our Diagnostics portfolio, which resulted in a high single-digit organic revenue growth in the third quarter. All of our Diagnostics franchises continue to experience healthy growth, led by Haoyuan blood screening, which grew over 50% in the quarter. We also saw strong demand for our new India lab services and forecast that demand to continue.", "As Rob mentioned, our top-10 Diagnostics customers in both developed and emerging markets continue to rely on PerkinElmer for their critical needs, with sales over the last 12 months growing over 20%, further validating our reproductive and emerging market strategies.", "Organic revenue in our Life Science Solutions business declined low single-digits in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the extra week in the comparable period last year, which disproportionately impacted our OneSource service offering. We experienced modest growth in academic and government end markets in the third quarter, as pharma and biotech markets remained resilient after adjusting for the extra week.", "Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented approximately 38% of adjusted revenue, organic revenues declined 5% for the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, we introduced new products at analytica China and this region continues to be a standout for analytical equipment demand. However, slower than expected results in the U.S. and Europe more than offset this strength.", "Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2016, we believe that our focus on continued operational improvements can help us weather the current slower growth environment. We continue to expect to see solid growth in our Diagnostics business, partially offset by slower than forecasted academic and government demand, as well as somewhat softer economic conditions in developed markets. As a result, we are slightly widening our fourth quarter revenue guidance to a range of $610 million to $620 million, representing low single-digit organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $0.85 to $0.87.", "This concludes my prepared marks. Amber, at this time, we would like to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Your first question comes from Jonathan Groberg from UBS. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks a million. So, Rob, can you talk \u2013 I know in kind of your more recent comments you obviously had highlighted that you saw some weakness in Europe. From your comments here, didn't sound as much as \u2013 that you were calling things out geographically; it sounded like you were talking a little bit more around your growth businesses versus your non-growth businesses. So can you maybe just talk maybe a little bit how that quarter you saw develop and if there's anything kind of geographic that stood out to you on the top-line?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Sure. So I would say, first of all, as the quarter played out \u2013 and I think Andy mentioned this a little bit in his prepared remarks. You know, sitting here in sort of the second week in September, we are sort of tracking pretty well to what we would ship historically during a quarter. And again, just to remind everyone, particularly on the instrument side, it has a tendency to be fairly back-end loaded where the service and the reagents, let's say our Diagnostic business, is more consistent through the quarter, but clearly the instrument business is back-end loaded. And again, probably second week in September we were sort of tracking maybe even a tad better than what we had historically seen to get to the sort of 2% growth that we had guided to. I would say the last couple weeks of September, we saw particularly on the capital side, a fairly amount of deferrals or push-backs \u2013 push-outs. And I would say, we've seen that in the past, but normally there was the ability either to pull things in or to readjust and still achieve our revenue number. And unfortunately, we were unable to do that in the last couple weeks of this September. So the real shortfall was on the capital side of things, and our sense is, in talking to some of our customers, is there was a real interest in delaying capital purchases unless it was absolutely necessary. So whether it was capacity or replacement, we did get a sense that there was some deferral in the back part of September.", "To your point on the geographic side, we saw that clearly in most all developed markets. The one area that continued to spend through the entire quarter was China. As Andy mentioned, China was up over 20%. And we saw that fairly broad based. But I would say, outside of China, we did see this capital-intensive side of the business definitely suffer here as we got into the latter part of September.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "And then just sticking with the top-line for a second more, I think you said your kind of forward growth initiatives were up double-digits. And if I remember correctly, I think that's maybe around $1 billion or so of sales. So that means that the other parts of your business, which is a little over 50% would have had to have been down double-digits. You are talking about maybe accelerating some of your corporate development initiatives. How do you, I guess kind of handicap where you are in the cycle when the right time to sell some of these businesses might be versus trying to improve? I guess I'm trying to think about your \u2013 you seem to be a bit more vocal on the capital deployment side and pruning the portfolio side, so I'm just kind of curious how you are thinking about the timing of those actions.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Right. That's a good question. Let me just clarify one thing. So the 10% growth that you referenced on the growth businesses are really year-to-date. And so, the growth business, while they did grow, were probably more in the mid to high single-digits. Again, every aspect of our portfolio was impacted by the additional week over last year. And so that's why, to some extent we are trying to look at this over a little bit longer period, at sort of year-to-date numbers, because I think the Q3 is clearly distorted because of the extra week last year.", "But I think directionally your comment is correct where obviously the growth side of the business is doing very well, and we continue to have challenges on the sort of core part of the portfolio. To some extent, that was one of the reasons we moved to the reorganization. We talked about the benefits of having the clinical business and sort of the more application businesses together, and I think it does drive collaboration and it allows us to serve our pharmaceutical and food companies a little bit \u2013 the customers a little bit better.", "But the other aspect of it is, when Research and Environmental was separate, it was a little harder to be more aggressive on pruning some of the product lines, because as those businesses were separate we became a little bit of a sub-scale in areas like front end and some of the other areas. So I think one of the things that this reorganization does I believe, is allows us to get a little bit more aggressive on the pruning side in addition to the other benefits of the collaboration, the R&D, the manufacturing scale, and serving our customers. The other thing obviously is, we want to make sure as we prune the portfolio that we've got a great foundation to build upon. And so it was important for us to get the organizational structure right. It was important to get our operating execution right, so that again, as we make the portfolio moves that we're not as disruptive to the bottom line. We recognize as we make these portfolio moves that we will disrupt the top-line, but we're trying to do as best we can to maintain the margin expansion and the EPS growth that we've talked about.", "Therefore, it was important to make sure that the flow or sort of way that this was staged was to make sure that we had the organization, the operation and execution, and then we could start to be more aggressive on the pruning of the portfolio.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, thanks. Could I just \u2013 and one last one if I could sneak it in?", "Rob, do you mind just \u2013 I think it's a nomenclature thing maybe to some degree, but I think what you said around environment \u2013 can you just remind us what you include in environmental, because some firms, well, they talk about industrial versus environmental, I think not everyone is talking about the same thing. You mentioned your food business was strong. And so, can you maybe just clarify kind of when you talk about environmental being weak -", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Yeah, no I think that's fair because we do split food from environmental and from industrial. And so when we talk about environmental, we're talking about something in \u2013 about 10% of our revenue, and it's largely in air, water, and soil. So that's how we would define environmental, whereas food, because \u2013 as that's become a big area of focus for us, we have sort of separated that. And then we have, industrial would be \u2013 the other areas, which would be more for us, petrochemical, fine chemical, and those types of areas.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks, Rob.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just as we take some of the commentary and try to put it all into context, it would be really helpful if you could speak to the businesses, excluding instrumentation. Do you have a view on what consumables growth \u2013 maybe consumables and other repeatable business growth was in the third quarter and how that compared to the first half?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Yeah, so the consumer business grew. Services was sort of flat to up a little bit. And of course services is probably the business that's most impacted by the week. So \u2013 of course that gets distorted a little bit as \u2013 the consumable business. And the instrument business was down sort of mid-single digits. So again, it was really more of a capital-intensive period. And of course if you look at the areas outside of Diagnostics, then you can imagine, the instruments was down even greater than that.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then just looking at the margins, were there any concentrated cost actions taken in the quarter, given the environment that we should contemplate as we think about the sustainability of margin expansion? Thanks a bunch.", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Sure. Well, Steve, this is Andy. We had two things \u2013 we obviously had very strong gross margin, and we had very good SG&A leverage. On the gross margin side, we are seeing an acceleration maybe slightly faster than we had forecasted going into the quarter from our Lean initiatives. So I think, of the upside we saw in the quarter versus our guidance, about a third of that was due to productivity gains. And then the rest of that was really more mix, where we saw high growth in our Diagnostics and Informatics franchises.", "On the SG&A side, a lot of it was around our indirect spend initiatives. We did want to go in with a bit of cushion, so we did accelerate some of our cost controls in the quarter. I think that we'll continue to do that, and we also had some favorabilities, given the comparison last year with the five weeks \u2013 the extra week of cost. But that was probably less. So I think we'll continue to have that as a lever, and I think that was really the primary reason we saw the upside to our forecast despite the top-line decline.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Dan Arias from ZE (30:05) Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, hi, good afternoon. Rob, what's your outlook for the Medical Imaging business at this point? Is that a down double-digit business for the year, and, I guess, how far are you thinking you might be from a trough at this point?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Well, I would say \u2013 I think Andy mentioned it was down double-digits in the third quarter. We're not forecasting that it continues at that rate. And I think it sort of improves a little bit here in the fourth quarter, probably still be down sort of mid to high single-digits is what our current forecast. And the whole key for that business is to continue to get some new products out into the marketplace. We've got a new cassette product that we are getting out and to continue to diversify away from some of the end markets that are a challenge; I would say specifically the radiology end market. So, getting more into some of the industrial applications and some of the other areas that we are seeing some growth. But our forecast right now for Q4 would be more sort of mid to high single-digits, which, again, that would put them down for the year in that sort of range of sort of high single-digits.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then maybe on the newborn screening business, specifically in India, if we look ahead to 2017 revenues, do you think that you can start to benefit from tests per birth going up there once we get through the pilot programs, or as we think about next year, should we think about that being a 2018 contributor and not necessarily something that falls into the 2017 timeframe? Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Well, newborn screening continues to do very well for us. It has a strong Q3, and if you look at year-to-date it continues to do quite well. The growth drivers are both in the developed areas, to your point, Dan, where we continue to expand the menu, and we continue to see nice traction there, as well as the emerging markets. Particularly, China continues to see very nice growth. We're seeing growth both in the birth rate, which is up fairly significantly during 2016, as well as the expansion of the menu in China. And as we've talked in the past, we continue to see opportunities in other emerging areas that have expanded. So I think we continue to feel like the newborn screening area should be a high single-digit grower going into 2017 and beyond.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks. Rob, can you provide a little more color on the environmental drop-off? I know you said it was U.S. and Europe, but any additional color? And then, across the portfolio did you see any improvement in trends in October?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So, I would say the environmental shortfall was \u2013 again, going back to my comment, was everywhere other than China. China, we continue to see good investment in the sort of air, soil, and water. So outside of China, it was fairly broad based; it was both in the U.S.; it was Europe. It was down fairly significantly. I think some of that might be a little bit of product positioning for us, where we had scheduled to get some new products out, and while they got out, they got out late. But clearly, Environmental was in the developed areas, a headwind for us in the third quarter. With regard to October trends, I would say, we saw October trends improve up from the back half of September, but still, concerning to the point where \u2013 again, given the significant miss on the top-line in Q3, we just thought it was prudent to be sort of conservative here as we guide on the top-line for Q4. So, a little bit of improvement in October, but not, I would say significant.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then on guidance, can you help reconcile the fact you beat this quarter on EPS, but the midpoint of the EPS for next quarter goes down by $0.04. Are you baking this metric into -", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "I think it's a function of the concern on the revenue. I think we still feel like we can do a good job on the operating margin, but again, because we guided conservatively on the revenue side, we just thought that EPS guidance was the prudent.", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "And I think the other piece of it, the difference between \u2013 sequentially between the third and the fourth quarter is the mix. Within the fourth quarter we're going to see more of an impact from Environmental Health than we had in the third quarter, where we saw very strong Diagnostics and Informatics revenue.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, good afternoon.", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Good afternoon.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So, as you think about pruning the portfolio, given the strong margin expansion that you have seen there, can we assume that anything that you prune will be basically neutral to EPS?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Well, I think that \u2013 we're trying to get the portfolio in a position from a margin expansion perspective that the pruning of the portfolio will be minimally impactful on the EPS. I think it's probably difficult to say that it wouldn't have any impact.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Right.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Now, if we turn around and say, we take the proceeds and use it exclusively to buy back shares, that's a possible way to do that. But I think right now it would be challenging to sort of say, by selling a business and reducing the revenue that it would not have any impact on EPS.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And the share buyback was my next question in terms of sort of what are your plans. It sounds like you are looking for more M&A opportunities. Would you talk a little bit about the buyback plan, what's the share count implications for the year?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Well, I think as we said in the past, our preference would be to continue to sort of add bolt-on acquisitions to the portfolio. Having said that, our share buyback would be determined on basically how we see the sort of size of the realistic acquisition opportunities and sort of availability. And to the extent that we think there are some realistic opportunities to improve the portfolio, I think that would be our preference. To the extent we don't see those, or that the size of those are such that we could do both, then we would buy back share. And I think we've done that in the past and will continue to do that in the future.", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So I think if you're looking at the share count for this year, we're going to be similar to where we were in the third quarter, about 110 million shares for the year.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Co. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, good afternoon. My first question is I guess a bit of a follow-up to Derik's last question. Andy, in your prepared remarks you did indicate that you are actively looking at acquisitions that could close in the coming quarters. Could you just refresh your M&A parameters when it comes to size of deal, growth profile, willingness to take on dilution? And I'll pause there.", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Sure. Well, I think first and foremost, it has to fit the strategic framework of the company. We also then look at, from a financial perspective, returns. We still look for greater than our cost of capital returns on deals we've made. We've been unfortunate enough to generate those types of returns on the deals that we've undertaken. I think the ones that we think we could close in the coming months will fit that criteria, and from an accretion dilution perspective it's highly unlikely we would do a diluted deal, especially in today's market. I think we really look more at our ability to generate those return on invested capital numbers.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, thank you for that. And one \u2013 I guess one other question. Would you be willing to disclose what licensing and royalty revenue was in the quarter and how does that compare to the last couple of quarters? Thank you.", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "In the third quarter of this year, it was essentially zero. And as far as our expectations going into the fourth quarter, it's going to be minimal. I mean as far as incremental, we obviously get revenues periodically through the year, but as far as significant incremental changes, no. And we did talk about, last year in the fourth quarter we did have some incremental licensing revenue in the quarter. We don't expect something like that to repeat.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Great, thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. First question. Rob, you mentioned softer several times in your prepared comments and then also talking about the realignment being \u2013 or enabling you guys to prune some of the businesses faster. Can you help us think a little bit about the framework in terms of the transition with some organic products coming through the pipeline? And recognizing you don't have a perfect crystal ball around pruning, but is this something that we should be expecting to see here as soon as the fourth quarter, or is this more 2017 continuing on to 2018? Just trying to get a framework. Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Yeah, I would say with regard to inorganic moves whether it's selling or buying, it's hard to predict the timing on those because obviously it's not something that's totally within our control. I would say that's one aspect of it. I would say the other aspect of it is, as we think about making moves, and again, this would be either buying or selling, we want to make sure that to Andy's point it obviously makes strategic sense, but also, we want to make sure that we're sort of optimizing the return for shareholders. And when we think about that optimization, we want to make sure that it's both on a pre-tax and an after tax basis. And sometimes that requires transactions to take a little longer than I think we would all like. So I would say, again, that sort of speaks a little bit to the timing of it. But I would say \u2013 could we see something here in the fourth quarter? We could. But if not, we'll probably see something in the early 2017 timeframe. But again, it's hard to put specific timing around those, because it's not things that are totally within our control.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Understood. And then just two quick ones for me on the product side. With respect to blood screening, kind of where are we in China right now with the full transition to screen their entire blood supply with NAT? And then secondly, the sample-to-answer workflow for sequencing, when might that be available? Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So I would say on the blood screening, we continue to do very well there. The Chinese government has instituted the mandatory blood screening this year, and so we're seeing sort of a nice ramp up there. We continue to see strong growth, so that business continues to operate well. If you recall, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we had a lot of instrument placements and we're now seeing the revenue flow from that. So that business continues to do quite well. And we continue to feel good about our opportunities to sort of expand there. Oh, and the sample to sequencer is \u2013 I would say we have components of that today, but there's a couple areas we think we've got to sort of develop and add to. To give you a timeframe, it's probably into the sort of mid-to-late 2017 timeframe.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.", "Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Good evening and thanks for taking my questions. Just had a couple for you. First, Andy, was wondering if you could \u2013 was there any impact from, like incentive comp here in the third quarter? Just thinking, as you accrue incentive comp in the first half, has anything reversed here in the third quarter that benefited SG&A?", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "No, there was nothing reversed.", "Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay. Perfect. And then secondly, Rob, you made a comment about $40 million of revenue from new products. What timeframe were you thinking the new products would generate that revenue? Is that a 2017 event, or -", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "No. That's a \u2013 so we came out in the beginning of 2016 and said we were looking to add $40 million of incremental revenue from new products. And what I was commenting is, based on what we are seeing through nine months, we feel like we're going to be on track to achieve that. So, it was just sort of reconfirmation of the fact that we think we'll be able to add $40 million as a result of new products that were sort of launched in the past 12 months.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi, good afternoon. How has OneSource performed, and is there any (43:25) of benefit from grouping that business back with the Environmental business?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So OneSource continues to perform well. I think if you look through the year, it's up sort of high single-digits. So it continues to do well. I mean, Q3, again, because of this one-week impact, wasn't as strong for OneSource. But, again, when you look at year-to-date, it continues to do very well. And we do think that service, in general, will benefit by regrouping Research and Environmental back, because if you recall, couple years ago we sort of split it apart. And I think it has caused an issue relative to some of the areas where we don't have the density, quite frankly. And I think by putting it back together, that is one of the benefits we think we'll get from the new organization.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. And on terms of the new product revenues, I thought \u2013 I don't know if I have these numbers correctly, but I thought that you'd indicated that you had $35 million in revenues in the front half of the year. So if that's correct, does that mean that you're only generating sort of another $5 million in the back half of the year from new product?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Well, I tell you, I don't recall that. I recall having a discussion around $35 million in 2016 and saying we were growing at \u2013 I mean 2015 and growing at the $40 million. So we'll just have to go back and \u2013 circle back and get that.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "All right. I thought it was $18 million in the first quarter and $17 million in the second quarter but \u2013 okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on the new product question. Just curious if you could quantify how much contribution, either on absolute dollar or percentage terms you expect in fourth quarter organic growth?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "You know, I think it's been running in the sort of $10 million to $12 million a quarter, to tell you the truth. So I would assume it's going to be similar to that in the fourth quarter.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on capital allocation. If we just look back the last few years, you guys have been pretty opportunistic on buying back stock when you get a good chance. Given your earlier comments on the M&A aspect, wondering if we get to some point in the first quarter and you aren't able to close a deal that you want. Is it possible that we might see some use of your cash to buy back stock?", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Yeah, Isaac, this is Andy. We obviously look at the tradeoffs between M&A and buybacks as well as the timing, and if we see some of these slowing, I think we're going to generate some pretty strong cash flow. So I could see us taking some shares out of the system if the M&A doesn't come as quickly as we'd like.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Hey, Rob, on the re-org with the split of Diagnostics and then can you talk to specifically the analytical instrument business? I know you have always enjoyed a pretty top position in the world, but what do you want to accomplish with analytical, you know, manufacturing, distribution? What are your thoughts there?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So I think, to your point, we want to continue to be sort of the top player in that. I think PerkinElmer has got a good brand in analytical instruments. I think the opportunity we see of putting it together with the research is, in a couple end markets I think we'll be able to hopefully drive better coordination, particularly in the pharmaceutical area where we go call on those customers on a research \u2013 sort of drug discovery area, we think we can get some leverage. I think the service thing we talked about, I think specifically in food where we have some assets, again it \u2013 sort of we're in the research area, but are also in the historical Environmental area. So I think we should be able to continue to sort of try and be at that preeminent position, particularly in the areas of, like inorganic, materials characterization, and thermal. I think those are the areas where I think we've got a strong position and hopefully we'll continue to maintain that and grow it.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "And then on the China business for Diagnostics, it's been obviously a success story there. What are plans on that? And also, what are you \u2013 are you seeing that market pick up with the release of the five-year plan in March? I mean \u2013 so can you talk to the dynamics following the release of the plan, and, you know, what do you want to do next in that market?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So we \u2013 I would say we have continued to see very strong growth in China. I don't know that I could sort of attribute anything to the release of the five-year plan. I would say where we've seen it a little bit more is on the research side in areas like this precision medicine initiative, and an increased focus on food. They've come up with some new regulations on food where they are looking at the entire food chain. I would say, there I think we have seen a little bit of an inflexion, probably a positive. But Diagnostics has been strong, continues to be strong there. And I think we're well positioned in sort of several facets. We talked about newborn; that continues to do well. We continue to see very strong growth on the prenatal or the maternal fetal side.", "Of course, we mentioned blood banking, and then of course our infectious disease area. So I think across those businesses, I think we feel good about it. So one of the areas where we're focused on is, we are seeing increased pressure on local manufacturing of products. And I would say, to a large extent we're in a good position there, but we just want to make sure we continue to have the majority if not all of our Diagnostic products manufactured locally. So that's a big focus for us, to make sure, as it becomes more challenging, both from government tenders as well as local competition that we've got a strong capability to produce everything and fundamentally design everything in China.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow-up on the capital equipment commentary and just dig in. Do you think any of the softness was simply timing-related? And how does that roll into the fourth quarter guidance you gave?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Well, we do believe some of it is timing. It's hard to determine at this point how much of it was. There's \u2013 I would say, at this point a lot of the information we have is sort of more anecdotal, right? You hear people talk about, you know, are they deferring things until after the election? Are particularly academic or government budgets on hold a little bit? So we're sort of anxious to see whether or not if that happens. But probably some of it was deferred spending until a little bit more certainty from whether it's a geopolitical or economic condition. Because we do believe some of these things are \u2013 that were sort of pushed off, will be needed or required at some point, again, whether it's for capacity expansion or just replacement.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. And there has been a little bit more noise on the academic/government side this quarter. Is it more nuanced within that, either by product categories or academic versus government? Just any additional color would be great. Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "For us, it's probably more on the academic side than it is government. And we can tell you, the area we see it probably most acutely is in our imaging area. And for example, I think you saw virtually no S10 grants over the last 90 days, so we clearly have seen a slower funding environment on the academic side. And we saw it, as I said, again, mostly in the research area.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Catherine Ramsey from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, this is actually Emily on for Catherine. So I guess turning towards newborn screening, how many tests per birth are you seeing right now in China, India, and the U.S.? And then how have birthrates been trending in comparison to last year?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Okay. So in the case in China, it's starting to vary fairly significantly. I would say if you look back a couple \u2013 maybe a year or two ago, it was either two or four. We are starting to see certain areas like \u2013 particularly around Shanghai and a couple of the large cities start to implement mass spec, so we have seen a ramp up in almost sort of a bifurcation. You still, out in the West, continue to see in the sort of two to four area, but on the East, and particularly in the large cities, you are starting to see menus now get up to sort of 15 to 20. But I would say on average, in China right now we're probably six or seven. But there is sort of a movement into higher menus.", "In the U.S. right now, the standard of care is 29, as you may know. We're probably in average in the States in the sort of low-40s. And then if you look in India right now, we're only testing right now. We've got four pilot programs; two of those pilot programs have moved into actual full-fledged programs, and to the most extent, of those four, they are in the sort of four to six range as far as the menu. So it varies a fair amount. Obviously, U.S. is by far the highest number.", "Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks. And then the birthrates in comparison to last year?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So the birthrates, I would say globally it looks relatively flat, and I would say similar in the U.S. for us. Earlier in the year, we were seeing a little bit of a \u2013 sort of a positive trend on rates. We've seen that come down a little bit now, and I would say that's flat. China is very strong; China has probably mid-teens growth rate. And when our people in China sort of dissect that, we think probably about 10% of that \u2013 or 10 points of that is because of the sort of change in the zodiac sign, and we think probably 5 percentage points is because of the second child.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Mishan from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Aubrey Tianello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey, guys this is actually Aubrey on for Matt. Can you hear me okay?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Sure. Yeah.", "Aubrey Tianello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that the decision to deprioritize certain areas of the portfolio is also slowing sales growth a little bit faster than you expected on your last guidance update. Could you maybe just parse out how much of that impacted the third quarter and your guidance going forward versus a change in market demand?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So I would say, to determine that precisely is hard. But we believe it's having an impact, because as we've sort of announced some of these changes, we have seen for example in the sales organization or in some product management, we have seen a little bit of turnover, not probably unexpected, and so we're backfilling with individuals there; I would say are more consistent with the strategy. But we think some of that disruption is having an impact, I would say probably more in the sales organization or product management. I don't think I can give you a exact number, but when we look at \u2013 clearly in Environmental Health, we think that had an impact.", "Aubrey Tianello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Got it. And then I just wanted to touch on free cash flow. Are you reiterating your guidance for $300 million? And if so, what gives you confidence that you are going to see an inflection in the fourth quarter?", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Well, I think that if you look at last year \u2013 our most significant quarter is the fourth quarter. For us to hit the $300 million, it's going to require some very significant working capital improvement, given the slightly lower earnings. I think the team is basically been tasked with still delivering the $300 million. I will say it's going to be a bit harder. But that is our goal, and if we can do somewhat similar to what we did a year ago, we should be very close. So, we are not coming off of it at this point. It's just becoming a little bit harder. And really that's overcoming a fairly weak first quarter of this year. So, again, we're sticking with the $300 million, but it's becoming more challenging.", "Operator", "And your last question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Rob, just a quick question on the pharma business. I know you noted it was up low-single-digits in the period, but any chance you could parse out the deviation in mix between equipment and instrumentation and in the software and service components, which I imagine were much more stable in the period. Any change in the end markets? And then I got one follow-up for Andy.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Sure. Okay, so if you look at \u2013 as you said, software informatics saw good growth in the quarter. Service grew, but not what you would normally expect in sort of the high single digits, I think because of the weak \u2013 one less week year-over-year, but this still grew (57:11). And we saw pressure, mostly again on the capital equipment side, so whether it was in plate readers \u2013 I mentioned the fact that imaging was down a little bit on the academic side. I think on the high content side we continue to see growth, and, of course, radiochemicals was a drag.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. So then, Andy, one for you. In terms of the EPS bridge for the year, is there anything specific that contributes to the higher purchase accounting adjustment in terms of the bridge between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the year?

We define our free cash flow as the amount of cash generated from operations which was $8.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 in excess of our capital expenditures of $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, and any net of proceed from sale of assets which was zero in the fourth quarter 2015.", "We also announced a global cost reduction program during the fourth quarter of 2015; we should expect savings of approximately $6 million pretax income from this action resulting in a significant 2016 increase in net earnings and EPS in 2016. The restructuring cost of $3.6 million was partially paid in 2015 and should continue through the third quarter of 2016.", "As you already know, we announced and close our Stress-Tek acquisition in the fourth quarter. Ziv will talk some more about that in his comments. And finally in the quarter as part of the Stress-Tek acquisition, we secured $25 million in term loan and $30 million available revolving credit facility jointly with JPMorgan, Citizens Bank and Wells Fargo.", "Now in Slide 4, moving on to some additional consolidated financial results. The year-over-year increase and adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 is attributable to higher volume of $1.5 million, $700,000 of cost reduction programs offset by negative effect of exchange rate of $1.9 million. ", "Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $16.4 million, or 27.9% of revenues as compared to $18.3 million, a 30.4% for last year's fourth quarter. This decrease is primarily due to the positive impact of foreign exchange rates of $800,000 and $1.1 million of lower headcount and other cost.", "Looking at operating income on adjusted basis, without restructuring costs and acquisition cost, you can see that a 7.7% an increase from 3.6% in the fourth quarter last year.", "Included in other income and expense in our press release this morning was $500,000 of foreign exchange losses primarily to Canadian dollar during the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $300,000 of foreign exchange losses in the fourth quarter of 2014. The operational tax rate was 30% in the fourth quarter of 2015, for the 2016 fiscal year; we expect the operational tax rate to be in a range of 25% to 27%.", "The company recorded a $12.4 million non-cash income tax charge related to evaluation allowance recorded against certain deferred tax assets.

We spent $8.7 million for our share repurchase program in the year 2015.", "Moving on to Slide 5, we remained focused on our strategy of growing the top-line through organic growth and pursuing additional acquisitions as well as improving profitability by increasing efficiencies and reducing cost.", "With this focus and execution, we should be able to achieve the milestones in the slide within three years. ", "With that, let me pass for other comments on to Ziv.", "Ziv Shoshani ", "Thank you, Bill. An important part of our strategy is to grow by developing new product offering and our advanced sensors continued to gain traction. This platform which is part of our FTP segment in which we developed a few years ago is reporting revenue increase of 44% for the full year of 2015 versus 2014. Beside the slowdown in oil and gas and exchange rate of bank, I'm very pleased with the continued acceptance of this new sensor platform as it offers enhanced performance to customers in conjunction with an efficient manufacturing platform.", "We enhance product innovation in 2015 with the intention of extending existing product line based on customer demand. Such as precision current sensors in transductive for OEM customers. In addition to organic product innovation, we announced and completed our acquisition of Stress-Tek recently. We are an excellent treat for our onboard weighing products line and they are well respected in the industries they serve, predominately in North America. Stress-Tek offers an extensive line of load cells and they design and manufacture the electronic integrates with the load cell and sensors to produce complete onboard weighing measurement solutions. With expected cost synergy, we anticipate that Stress-Tek's annual EBITDA will increase to approximately $3 million over two years. ", "To support our scalable business model and make significant progress, our cost structure we announced global restructuring plan late in the year. While we incur the restructuring charge of $3.6 million which impacted the fourth fiscal quarter 2015, we expect that our actions will improve the overall efficiency by lowering operating cost by approximately $6 million annually. ", "All-in-all, we have taken positive, definitive actions in 2015 to grow the top-line and improve efficiency despite the global conditions that have created a challenging environment for us, our customers such as a strong US dollar, low oil and gas prices, low commodity prices, China economic slowdown and very low steel capacity utilization, the lowest since 2009. ", "Following the most recent global industry report the average capacity utilization in 2015 was 69.7%. In Q4 of 2015, the utilization was at 64.6% compared to an annual average of 73.4% in 2014. All the major steel mill around the world has cut back their capacity by 3% to 7% except India. In 2016, according to JPMorgan economic research, the world will continue to be divided by region and by sector. We developed economies doing better than emerging ones. And within each country service sector, business is generally doing better than manufacturing. ", "The key source of uncertainty in the outlook is China, which saw significant slowdown in their core industrial side of its economy in 2015. And conditions have the significant this inflationary effect on the global economy. We do expect a slow global recovery to continue but until robust demand environment emerges, we will continue to focus on driving top-line results through innovation and acquisitions and focus on increasing efficiency and cutting cost. ", "Moving to Slide 6. Moving on to the operational trends. Let's start by comparing consolidated year-over-year and sequential results. The company's overall book to bill was 0.95 in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 1.0 last year and 0.97 in the third quarter of 2015. Total orders for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $56.2 million, down $4.3 million or 7.1% from $60.5 million last year and up $0.5 million or 0.9% from $55.7 million in the third quarter of 2015.", "Moving to Slide 7, some details on our reporting segment, the FTP segment had the book to bill ratio of 0.97 for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 1.02 for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 0.9 for the third quarter of 2015. Sequentially orders increased by $1.1 million or 4.4% from the third quarter of 2015, reflecting an increasing the Americas and Europe partially offset by decreasing Asia. ", "The FTP gross margin was 36.5% for Q4, down from 37.3% in Q4 last year and down from 42% in the third quarter of 2015. The FTP gross margin decreased from a comparable prior year period was due primarily to $0.7 million of negative exchange rate, offset by a volume increase of $500,000. The sequential gross profit margin decrease was due primarily to lower volume of $0.7 million, $0.5 million of additional cost for expansion of our advanced sensor platform and other one time cost of $400,000. The FTP segment backlog was 2.6 months compared to 3.0 months last year and 2.6 months in the prior quarter.", "Looking at the Force Sensor segment, the book to bill ratio was 1.0 for Q4 compared to 0.97 in the fourth quarter last year and 1.03 for the third quarter of 2015. Sequential orders increased by $0.6 million or 3.9%. This increase came from all regions, Asia, the Americas and Europe. The gross margin for the segment was 20.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus 21.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 21% in the third quarter of 2015.", "The gross margin for the quarter decreased from the comparable prior year period primarily due to $600,000 of lower volume. Despite increasing revenues, the sequential gross margin percentage decreased due to reduction of inventory of $1.8 million. The Force Sensor segment backlog was 2.2 months compared to 2.1 months in the prior year and 2.4 months in Q3.", "For Weighing and Control System, the book to bill ratio was 0.89 for Q4 compared to 1.01 in the fourth quarter last year and 1.05 for the third quarter. Sequentially orders decreased by $1.2 million or 7.1% primarily from Europe and Asia, partially offset by the Americas.

Acquisitions continued to be a focus of the company growth strategy and as I mentioned, we are actively looking for opportunities. From an organic performance perspective, we will continue to focus on new product development to improve our top-line and continue our initiatives to cut cost and improve efficiencies. Based on the actions taken to date, we are expecting to see improved performance even given our current global market conditions. ", "In light of the global economic forecasts and continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies, we expect net revenues in the range of $56 million to $61 million for the first quarter of 2016. Our expectation for fiscal year 2016 is for adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.80 to $1, at constant exchange rates. The annual EPS guidance includes the following. Constant exchange rate at an average of the second half of 2015 in a fairly stable business environment versus the second half of 2015. Some top-line assumptions excluding Stress-Tek, we account for a modest volume increase in 2016, low to mid single digit versus 2015. We are looking cost realization of our global restructuring plan. ", "With that, let's open the line for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator ", "[Operator Instructions]", "The first question comes from John Franzreb with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead. ", "John Franzreb", "Good morning, everybody. Yes, first of all, I want applaud you on offering up guidance for the year, that's a great step. But I actually want to start with the end of 2015 is part of my questions. Firstly can you talk a little bit about the restructuring program, the timing of the realization, how we progressed on the year and when do you expect to be fully completed at the your optimal margin profile? ", "Ziv Shoshani ", "Okay. The restructuring program has -- if I -- three phases. Phase one has completed I would say at the latter part of Q4 of 2015. The second phase I would say has been already completed at the beginning of February. And we are looking for the completion of the third phase by the end of the second quarter. So based on this restructuring plan and I am not implying that they may not be more structuring plan coming into future, we should expect to see the full effect of the cost coming in Q4 of this year. ", "John Franzreb", "Got it, got it, perfect. And regarding the Stress-Tek's acquisition, can you talk a little bit about decision behind the purchase and what else you are seeing on the M&A front? ", "Ziv Shoshani", "Okay. Regarding Stress-Tek, we have known Stress-Tek for a long time. They have been a competitor to our SI onboard business. We, Stress-Tek and asked -- we did serve a similar market. So by acquiring this company by definition we have enlarged our market share for onboard weighing business in North America mostly for the logging business but also to an extent for waste management. And the fact that we have also gained broader sales channel in order to introduce our truck and VanWeigh platform which originally has been developed in Europe. So in essence by acquiring Stress-Tek we have a much larger market share. We have broader sales channels to introduce new product in TruckWeigh and of course as it has been stated already earlier, we are looking also at cost synergies by consolidating all our onboard weighing operations in one location. So we should expect to see savings on the cost side as well. ", "John Franzreb", "Ziv, when do you expect that business to be accretive to EPS?", "Bill Clancy ", "We believe that it should be accretive fairly quickly if not within the first three months definitely the first six months. ", "John Franzreb", "Perfect. Thanks Bill. I'll get back at queue. ", "Operator ", "The next question comes from Sarkis Sherbetchyan with B. Riley & Company. Please go ahead. ", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Yes, good morning. So just real quickly as well on Stress-Tek. The annual guidance that you provided also the Q1 guidance does that includes any contribution on either on the top-line or from the cost out from Stress-Tek? ", "Ziv Shoshani", "The EPS guidance includes the total company's performance for 2016 which should include Stress-Tek financial role into VPG financials, yes. But please bear in mind that initially when we have reported Stress-Tek financial prior to the synergies, there were $1.1 million of EBITDA therefore the vast majority I would say predominately the EPS will be driven by the results for VPG.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Good. Understood. And I think the financials you had disclosed in the release, and I believe it was $9 million in sales and $1.1 million in EBITDA as you mentioned. And I think you mentioned $3 million in two years on the EBITDA side. Can you maybe talk about what the annual sales growth rate was for the company? And what do you expect going forward for Stress-Tek?", "Ziv Shoshani", "The annual sales growth for the company was fairly modest due to the fact that the smaller company, they were growing at GDP level, the fact that they were very small privately held company while -- with very limited resources, they were not able to invest, nor in new product or platforms or no in open -- neither in opening new sales channel beyond the United States. So we do expect the post acquisition beyond the cost synergies that with our sales worldwide sales channel we would be able to enhance the growth of the revenues of Stress-Tek by at least I would say 50% of their historical run rate.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "And over what period of time? ", "Ziv Shoshani", "Once we realized all the synergies, the cost synergies which will happen in the next two years, I'd expect that starting 2017 as we are going to roll out also the new platform into the US like the TruckWeigh which was initially came onboard, we should expect already in 2017 to see an enhanced growth, sales growth at Stress-Tek.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Very good. And just my final question before I hop back in the queue. Can you maybe talk about the business trends you are seeing here in Q1 to date and also how you expect the business segments to perform as we progress through the year? Thank you. ", "Ziv Shoshani", "Okay. Looking at Q1 because we only provide guidance for Q1, we do expect to see a fairly stable business environment for the first two reporting segment in regards to FTP and in regards to Force Sensors. We haven't seen any dramatic changes despite the fact that there must be a nice --should indicate some good signs of recovery, good signs of better demand from the large OEMs in regards to Force Sensors. I should say that overall we do see fairly, still fairly stable business environment. Regarding the WCS, we unfortunately and based on the information that we all that I've indicated earlier in the call, we may see another or further slowdown in the steel market. So for the rest of the product line, I think that we should expect to see not necessarily in Q1 but as the yield moves on we should see a better business environment and we should and this is why I did indicated we should expect from a volume standpoint an increase to low to mid single digit. We do expect to see a volume increase except one singularity which is the steel market. This is the only market that we don't see any -- at this point any light at the end of the tunnel. And we made the further softening result.", "Operator ", "The next question comes from Kyle Mori with Grizzly Rock Capital. Please go ahead.", "Kyle Mori", "Good morning and just want to commend management on the cost cutting initiatives and the organic growth in this environment. My question relates to acquisitions versus other use of cash. How do you consider your IRR for other usage of cash other than in organic acquisitions including share repurchases and what would cause to continue to acquire strategic asset at very high multiples similar to the Stress-Tek multiple? ", "Bill Clancy ", "Okay. Our capital allocation, I mean we are definitely as Ziv talked about, we are growing organic acquisitions play a key role and all then secondarily would be the stock buyback. Many acquisitions when you look at -- like for example if you look Stress-Tek, we basically paid without the real like $40 million worth of business that would generate, $3 million of EBITDA over two year period. So on that perception the buying at a 5x, 6x EBITDA is not bad. We firmly believe that by growing through acquisitions that will enhance our value which should enhance shareholder value going forward. I don't know Ziv; you want to add anything to that. ", "Kyle Mori", "So my question is if you -- are you planning on selling that real estate? ", "Bill Clancy ", "No. No. At the moment like Ziv mentioned we are consolidating all of our onboard weighing into that one facility thereby saving cost elsewhere to add this. ", "Ziv Shoshani", "I would like to indicate regarding the real estate, I understand that was not -- this was fairly unusual that we have acquired also the real estate beyond the business. The decision to acquire the real estate was fairly easy due to the fact that we had our appraisal in order to understand if how much, what is that expected lease cost that we would pay if we had to lease the building vis-\u00e0-vis occupy the building or even further on consolidate even more function and more operation into that building. And the fact of the matter that the lease cost were I would say slightly over 10% of the cost of the building, therefore this was from a cash standpoint a much better investment than to pay on an ongoing basis slightly over 10% of the building cost for the ongoing lease. So this was more for pure financial decision that did allow us to optimize the cash investment vis-\u00e0-vis paying lease cost. Regarding M&A I would like to indicate that during the last couple of years we've looked at many, many companies. And the fact that and we were even at the very late negotiation with few of them. The fact of the matter that we were very disciplined in not overpaying and meeting our internal rate of return and our ROI ratios. The intention is to continue to do that during the next -- the near future and we do believe that we would have opportunities to acquire companies at a very good EBITDA multiple which would meet our IRR and ROI ratios. ", "Kyle Mori", "So how do you think about the value of your stock i.e. is repurchasing stock here accretive to your IRR and ROI ratios? Because when I look at the multiple paid and we can talk about real estate all we want, $1 million is on let's just call it 15 if you want a back up the real estate at 15x EBITDA multiple which is certainly dramatically higher than your stock. So how do you think about share repurchases versus inorganic acquisitions? ", "Ziv Shoshani", "Okay. So our feel is as follows. We do believe that the existing or the current stock price is in a way undervalued and our EBITDA multiple is fairly low. Of course, one way to change that in the future is to increase our revenues as well as increasing our bottom line, our EPS. We already took steps and actions in order to -- at least from an organic standpoint to change that. We do believe that with acquisitions we would be able to change also the EBITDA multiple. The fact is that we are using cash and not equity implies that I do believe that this would be a way to change the EBITDA multiple for the company in the future, but I should also mention that we did the stock buyback this year and on an ongoing basis needed, this is also one of the ways we intent use our capital, also for stock buyback but all-in-all if you look at it this is not a complete strategy because stock buyback could take you so much if the expectation and the intention is to grow top-line and bottom line, it has to be done only by innovation, cost reduction and acquisition to accelerate growth.", "Operator ", "[Operator Instructions]", "Operator ", "The next question comes from John Franzreb, is a follow up for Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead. ", "John Franzreb", "Hey guys. Couple of quick questions. One, how much of your cash is here in the States versus overseas? ", "Bill Clancy ", "John at the end of the year probably approximately 10% to 12% of the cash is in the US. The remainder is outside the US.", "John Franzreb", "Okay. Kind of -- got it, and when I am looking at your SG&A line in the fourth quarter, it kind of dropped noticeably both on the sequential and year-over-year basis. Could you just talk a little bit about that what's going on there? ", "Bill Clancy ", "Yes. I mean when you compare year-over-year, I mean the drop, I mean of the $1.8 million drop, half of that was primarily due to the foreign currency. We had lower headcount and some reductions in bonus accruals and legal fees. I think going forward when we look at -- I mean we understand G&A quite well. One more we realize including Stress-Tek, we are probably backed in about for annual basis of about $74 million a year. ", "John Franzreb", "Got it. And where do you stand now on the advanced sensors production relocation, where are you in the process?", "Ziv Shoshani", "Regarding advanced sensors, we have made significant investment this year and next year we are going even to increase our capital investment in regards to this product line. This year, if you may recall John the advanced sensors was a combination of transitioning existing product into the new platform as well as new applications. I should indicate that some of the new application took up very, very rapidly and very nicely. So we are in a full capacity at this point. So the only thing I can say is that if we have finalized 2015 closed to $5 million revenues in Q1, the run rate would be close to $8 million to $9 million and by the end of this year we should be over $15 million, $16 million, just for this product line. So it's coming up very, very rapidly. We are in a way if you want to call it sold out and we are adding -- we are adding more staff, we are adding more equipment and by the way some of the extra cost in the inefficiencies we have incurred in Q4 was due to the fact that we have hired many new people, we have installed many more equipment which to an extent reduced their inefficiency due to the learning curve. But this line is doing extremely well. And the expectation is to continue and to double revenue year-over-year.", "John Franzreb", "So this business in of itself is about half of your organic growth for the -- in 2016?", "Ziv Shoshani", "You are correct. You are correct because we have to take into account the fall back or the further slowdown in the steel market. ", "John Franzreb", "And the balance of the organic growth, is it new contracts that are coming onboard. Can you kind of discuss the balance of the organic growth profile? ", "Ziv Shoshani", "The balance of the organic growth is predominately coming from two growth engine. One is the TruckWeigh and VanWeigh which have discussed quite extensively in prior quarter. And the other one we do see some signs due to those OEM, if I -- and I go back to the Force Sensors reporting segment. That the Force Sensors OEM during those difficult times we have been designing more and more project. We do see many of them coming to fruition and we do expect to get many more order at those transductive OEM which we are it's also supplier.

The year-over-year decrease in adjusted gross margin of Q1 2016 is attributable to the negative effect of exchange rate of $500,000, inventory reduction of $400,000 and labor inefficiencies of $300,000.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $18.1million, or 31.9% of revenues as compared to $18.7 million, or 33% for last year's first quarter. This decrease is primarily due to saving related to our previously announced cost reduction program, mainly lower headcount of $500,000, the positive impact of foreign exchange rates of $400,000, lower cost of $400,000 mainly fees offset by $600,000 of additional selling and general expenses cost associated with the acquisition of Stress-Tek.", "Looking at operating margin on an adjusted basis, without restructuring costs and other acquisition cost, you can see that is at 3.6%, a decrease from 3.9% in the first quarter last year.", "Included in other income and expense in our press release this morning was $400,000 of foreign exchange gains primarily Canadian dollar during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $1 million of foreign exchange losses in the first quarter of 2015.

An important part of our strategy is to grow by developing new product offering and our advanced sensors line continues to gain traction. This platform which is part of our FTP segment in which we developed a few years ago is reporting revenue increase of 95% in the first quarter of 2016 versus the 2015 first quarter and approximately 42% from the fourth quarter of 2015. I'm pleased with the continued acceptance of this new sensor platform as it offers enhanced performance to customers in conjunction with an efficient manufacturing platform.", "We continue to focus on optimizing the profitability of the Company despite the global conditions that have created challenging environment for us and our customers such as the strong U.S. dollar, low oil and gas prices, low commodity prices and China economic slowdown and the very low steel capacity utilization at the end of 2015, the lowest since 2009.", "According to the most recent global steel industry report, the average steel capacity utilization at the end of March 2016 was 70.5%, up from 64.6% at the end of 2015, but still below 71.8% at the end of the first quarter in 2015. It's an encouraging sequential trend that we will continue to monitor.", "The economic recovery in Europe continues, but the global context is less conducive than it was. The external risk for the European economy caused by the possibility of slower growth in China and other emerging economies, worsening geopolitical tensions and abrupt moves in oil prices weigh on a rebound. The increased risk associated with the domestic EU development including uncertainty ahead of the British Referendum in June also delays prospect for recovery.", "Outside of the EU, U.S. Manufacturing PMI is to its lowest level over 6.5 years in April, and production volume was close to stagnation, amid the renewed slowdown in the new business growth.", "Moving to Slide 6. Moving on to the operational trends. Let's start by comparing consolidated year-over-year and sequential results. The Company's overall book-to-bill was 1.03 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 1.05 in the first quarter last year and 0.95 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Total orders for the first quarter of 2016 were $58.6 million, down $0.8 million or 1.3% from $59.3 million in the first quarter of last year and up $2.4 million or 4.3% from $56.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.", "Some details on our reporting segment, the FTP segment had the book-to-bill ratio of 0.98 for the first quarter of 2016 compared to 1.12 for the first quarter of 2015 and 0.97 for the fourth quarter of 2015. Sequentially, orders increased by $0.3 million or 1.0% from the fourth quarter of 2015.", "The FTP gross margin was 42.3% for Q1, up from 41.4% in Q1 last year and up from 36.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The FTP gross margin increases from the comparable prior year period was due primarily to $0.9 million of higher volume coming mainly from distribution and OEMs in the Americas and Europe. servicing the test and measurements and avionic, military and space end markets.", "The sequential gross margin increase was primarily due to $0.5 million of saving from our previously announced cost reduction programs and $0.4 million of fourth quarter adjustment. The FTP segment backlog was 2.6 months compared to 3.4 months last year and 2.6 months in the prior quarter.", "Looking at the Force Sensor segment, the book-to-bill ratio was 1.06 for Q1 compared to 0.98 in the first quarter last year and 1.0 for the fourth quarter of 2015. Sequential orders increased by $0.2 million or 1.3%. This increase came from the Americas and Asia, partially offset by Europe. The gross margin for the segment was 18.4% in the first quarter of 2016 versus 21.8% in the first quarter of 2015 and 20.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015.", "The gross margin for the quarter decreased from the comparable prior year period primarily due to $0.7 million reduction in inventory. The sequential gross margin decreased mainly due to $0.3 million of lower volume from distribution in the Americas for precision weighing end market.", "The Force Sensor segment backlog was 2.5 months compared to 2.3 months in the prior year period and 2.2 months in Q4.", "For Weighing and Control System, the book-to-bill ratio was 1.11 for Q1 compared to 1.0 in the first quarter last year and 0.89 for the fourth quarter. Sequentially, orders increased $2.0 million or 13.1% coming from the Americas and Europe, partially offset by Asia. The adjusted gross margin for the segment was 40.2% in the first quarter of 2016 versus 44.6% in the first quarter of 2015 and 47.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015.", "The year-over-year decrease in gross margin is primarily due to $0.6 million of unfavorable product mix and $0.4 million of negative effects of foreign exchange rate. Sequentially, gross margin decreased due to $1.4 million of lower volume mainly from reduction of revenues of $2.3 million from steel, mainly in Asia, $0.9 million from process weighing in Europe and $0.8 million from onboard weighing in the U.S., partially offset by the acquisition of Stress-Tek which contributed $2.1 million of revenue in the Americas. In addition, there was $0.3 million of higher obsolesce recorded as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.", "The segment backlog was 3.3 months compared to 3.5 months in the last year first quarter and 2.6 months in the fourth quarter.", "Moving to Slide 8. From an organic performance perspective we are focused on new product development to improve our top-line and continue our initiatives to cut cost and improve efficiency. Based on the actions taken to-date, we are expecting to see improved performance. We have realized $1.4 million in savings in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of 2015 and we expect to achieve our $6.7 million in savings in this fiscal year.", "In light of the global economic conditions and the continued strength of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies, we expect net revenues in the range of $57 million to $62 million for the second quarter of 2016.", "Our expectations for fiscal year 2016 remains the same with adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.80 to $1.0 at constant EPS at constant exchange rate of the first quarter of 2016.", "With that, let's open the line for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator ", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Franzreb of Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.", "John Franzreb", "I'd like to start with the Weighing and Control segment. The gross margin profile was significantly lower than what I was expecting. Even at lower revenue number if I look historically in the third quarter of last year, you did roughly $15.5 million. The business had a 45% gross margin. Now the adjusted gross margin is down to 40%. Could you give us a little color what's going on there and maybe what your expectations are for that business in the coming quarter?", "Ziv Shoshani", "Absolutely John. You are absolutely correct from a mathematical standpoint. As you may know, the WCS reporting segments consist of three main product line, onboard weighing, process weighing and steel. Each of them has different margin levels. The most profitable business is steel. If you look from a revenue standpoint, if I look at this quarter revenue vis-\u00e0-vis the same quarter in prior years, the revenue dropped. It came predominantly from the steel section. From the KELK business, we dropped by sales volumes of $2.2 million. In fact since the WCS is a seasonal business, I may say that on the process weighing side, we were flat and on the onboard weighing side, we were slightly above. But the main drop came from the steel.", "If I look at quarter-over-quarter, by far steel again represents the biggest drop. Now let's talk about steel for a minute. This is already the third year we are having -- we are in a very, very deep recession and a very low capacity utilization in regards to steel. The revenues for our steel business which were $3.1 million this quarter were the lowest ever, therefore the margin impact was very, very significantly, because if you may recall, the gross margin level for this product line is above 50% vis-\u00e0-vis the other product lines which are at the low 40s. Therefore, we had the huge mix effect.", "Now, our expectation is that in the second quarter that we are going to ship around, and this is not the guidance, I would say around 50% to 60% more of what we have shipped this quarter in regards to steel, and I would say that the initial signs and I hope that this trend will continue. The initial signs that we may see a little bit recovery has been indicated only at the end of March coming from a steel utilization of mid-60s which is the lowest since many, many years back to the 70% mark, which I do hope will -- is a true indication that some things may change.", "I just have to note that regarding steel capacity most of the western world continues to reduce steel output due to the very low prices, only China indicated a small around 2% increase, and this -- and all-in-all we hope and we do expect that we may see some recovery, but the main -- again going to the -- just answering your question in a natural, the biggest drop in gross margin is the unfavorable mix due to a very, very low revenue level in for the steel product line.", "John Franzreb", "Perfect. That's exactly what I was looking for, Ziv. You mentioned in your answer about the seasonality of the business. Could you just kind of review what other product line may have some significant seasonality we need to be aware of?", "Ziv Shoshani", "The seasonality is mainly -- when we speak about WCS and it's mainly in the onboard weighing. As you may know, our weakest revenues in onboard weighing, especially in the United States is in Q1, because the main end market is -- we are serving the logging industry. And always in Q1 due to the winter conditions, this is our lowest revenue level, while it continues to recover. The other part from a process weighing standpoint, we always expect a better second quarter and the other seasonality impact is the so-called the European slowdown during summer time. But again, the seasonality is mainly affecting WCS and to a much less extent FTP as well Force Sensors.", "John Franzreb", "And in the prepared remarks, there was a mention of $300,000 of course of labor inefficiency. Can someone just enlighten me what that was?", "Ziv Shoshani", "Okay, very good. Let's talk about the labor inefficiencies. Let start with the first reporting segment. In the first reporting segment, we were speaking about two main projects. The first one was a very steep ramp up of advance sensors and you see of course the volume impact of 95% higher revenues quarter-over-quarter is 42% and the same quarter year-over-year is 95%, therefore we are in the huge ramp up and we had to hire, I would say significant amount of people in order to support the demand.", "By itself, such rapid increase in production is already -- we have incurred some inefficiencies due to the learning curve and due to the fact that we had to hire many people in a very short time, until we stabilized the operation. I think to a large extent it's behind us, because we are already at a much higher level of production which we can support at this point in time.", "The second effect regarding FTP is the Costa Rica closure which we have announced a couple of months ago. We had in our Costa Rica facility over 100 people and the decision has been made to close the facility within I would say four to five months. Such a big -- I would say reduction in such a -- I would say an aggressive step to close the plant and to relocate the product lines to another manufacturing plant in a very short time creates a lot of pressure and I would say a high learning curve on the accepting part which was in this case our facility in the United States and our secondary facility in Israel.", "So, I would say that since the expectation is to close the facility by the end of this month, by the end of May, we already incurred more than 50% of the inefficiency due to this I would say high learning curve.", "The other part of the inefficiency which is part of the $300,000 is the closure of our Beijing, our Force Sensor Beijing facility which we did finalize by the end of March. Again moving the product into India which have created a lot of -- again a lot of stress and we had to hire quite a lot of people within a short time. Again, it's around learning curve.", "So, all-in-all, all the inefficiencies we have reported, this quarter or we made I hope to a low extent may report further on are solely related to manufacturing location closure, except the advance sensor ramp up.", "John Franzreb", "Perfect. I'll get back into queue and let somebody else ask question. Thank you.", "Operator ", "[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Sarkis Sherbetchyan of B. Riley & Company. Please go ahead.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Thanks for taking my questions. First, as it relates to the FTP segment, can you maybe talk about the strength in those FTP margins, and if you anticipate the strong level going forward?", "Ziv Shoshani", "Good Morning Sarkis. Let's talk about FTP. In regard to the FTP, if you look from a sales volume standpoint, quarter-over-quarter the sales volume is pretty much flat. We -- the FTP is really composed of two businesses, one is strain gages/data acquisition systems and the other one is the foil resistors. I think that we did indicate earlier on that in the foil resistors we do see a strong market in regards to avionic, military and space and test and measurements in Europe and in the United States, while on the Micro-measurement side of the business, this is where advanced sensors is being classified, we see a very, very stable environment servicing some avionic, military and space end markets, as well as force and precision weighing. We should bear in mind that this reporting segment has been impact already by the oil and gas recession. Many of the customers did not place any order this year for both product lines, but nevertheless, we were able to -- I would say to offset this potential loss by getting more business from the test and measurement and AMS market.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Then just moving on to Force Sensors, I mean you kind of touched upon this here in the prepared remarks, as was the earlier questions. But did you think that margins were below your internal plan in Force Sensors?", "Ziv Shoshani", "Absolutely, I would say that this margin for this quarter were, exceptionally very, very low, and it composed of two effects. One, this is the lowest revenues we have reported. And please correct me if I'm wrong, but if I look at the information which is available to me, $14.8 million of revenues, there was only one quarter which we have reported lower revenues and that -- and it was 14.6 million, which was the third quarter of 2015, but other than that, this is a very, very low revenue level which we believe by the way that will rebound next quarter and the main driving factor are -- is U.S. distribution for the precision weighing, they had enough inventory while they have been depleting the indication is that they are going to order more therefore we may project much higher sales. So this is one factor, the low revenues.", "The other factor I would say is from a cost standpoint on one hand we have incurred inefficiencies due to the Beijing closure. And we are going in the second quarter to close another facility in China which is our machine shop in Tianjin which is another very large city next by, next to Beijing. In addition to the fact that we have reduced inventories quite substantially and I think that the effect of the inventory reduction on cost was an additional $700,000 of course. So, as I have indicated our target for this reporting segment is mid-20s and starting next year high 20s, and at the end of the day is to get to -- reach to the 30% mark. So this quarter we did achieve an exceptionally very, very low gross margin levels for this reporting segment.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Then I guess moving on to the revenue outlook here. I think for this quarter you said Stress-Tek contributed about $2.1 million in revenue if I've not mistaken. What do you expect Stress-Tek to contribute for Q2 and also when you fold in Pacific Instruments into the next, what do you think Pacific Instruments would contribute in Q2 here?", "Ziv Shoshani", "Now let's talk about Stress-Tek. Stress-Tek book-to-bill we did not indicate that. The Stress-Tek book-to-bill was 1.2, 1.3 for the quarter. So, our indication would be and we have never provided quarterly guidance is that Stress-Tek will -- the revenues would be at least similar to Q1 if not higher in the second quarter, similar to Q1 if not higher due to the fact that we had book-to-bill above 1.", "Now regarding PI. PI finalized the fiscal year and at the end of January, and they have recorded at the end of January $10.8 million. In the first two months of February and March, prior to the acquisition of VPG, they have recorded $2.1 million or revenues. PI end market is very similar to KELK of course it's in a completely different end market, but it is really serving end users for big projects, therefore they are always discussions even and once the order has been placed, when would the customers accept the deliveries they would pull in or push out.", "At this point in time, due to the fact that they are really very, very large, mutli-million dollar pending orders, we -- at this point in time have not at least incorporated in our model more than a $1 million of PI in the upcoming quarter.", "Operator", "There's a follow-up question from John Franzreb. Please go ahead.", "John Franzreb", "Actually, I just wanted to start where you just left off. So PI, is already experiencing push out from what customer base is it, is it steel customer bases or could you just expand upon that push out that you are seeing?", "Ziv Shoshani", "PI, I will just take a step back. If you recall, PI is in a completely different end market, it's not in steel, it's in government based business. At this point, of course our plan is to shift it also to open more market which we are in, but at this point in time, they are exclusive in avionic, military and space, government contracts business, pretty dominantly in the United States, but also in Asia and Europe. So, all the big contracts with all the main defense companies in the United States, they are working with PI.", "For many different end applications like wind tunnel, digital [ph] stress analysis, testing of construction measurements with wind tunnels, engine thrust measurement and other type of -- and I would say other type of military applications. That's 90% government based business, U.S. government based business.", "John Franzreb", "So why would they be suffering from push outs. Are they tied to certain programs sort of being pushed back?", "Ziv Shoshani", "This is a little bit I would say here I have to be a little bit careful.", "John Franzreb", "Okay.", "Ziv Shoshani", "In the government you have certain bids which companies are wining, there are some other companies that may appeal if another competitor may win. So there is some I don't know even how you may want to define -- a certain dynamic that only once those appeals are over then the order will be placed. So, we did win, but some of competition, not our competition. Our customers competition have appealed few times and those are very, very, very I would say multi-million projects, multi-million big, big military projects. ", "John Franzreb", "And regarding the restructuring actions with $6.7 million, could you just talk about how much you have realized of that $6.7 million and the timeline to get that former benefit.", "Ziv Shoshani", "So I did report earlier that in Q1 we have realized $1.4 million of the restructuring programs we have announced. And we do plan to achieve the $6.7 million. Now we have to bear in mind that this is not a linear, that the progression will not be linear, because some of the projects, some of the restructuring projects are related to the Costa Rica and the China restructuring plans while the closing of the plant, for example the Beijing one has happened only end of March, so the savings will be, we will start to realize the savings only from Q2 onwards. In regards to Costa Rica, the main savings, we will start to realize by the end of Q2 onwards. So, for Q1 we have realized $1.4 million and as we move on, we are going to realize more and more, and I do believe that we at least for a minimum, we would achieve the $6.7 million we have committed for.", "John Franzreb", "That's all I have got. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Wendy Wilson for closing remarks.", "Wendy Wilson", "Thank you, Danielle, and thank you, everyone for dialing in today.

SG&A remained flat due to savings of $700,000 from cost reduction programs, mainly lower headcount and $600,000 in lower fees, which were totally offset by additional SG&A cost of $1.3 million associated with the acquisitions of Stress-Tek and Pacific Instruments.", "Looking at operating margin on an adjusted basis, without restructuring cost and the acquisition cost, you see that it's at [ph] 5.6%, an increase from 4.5% in the second quarter last year and from 3.6% in the first quarter of 2016.", "Included in other income expense is $100,000 of foreign exchange gains during the second quarter of 2016 compared to $300,000 of foreign exchange losses in the second quarter of 2015.", "The lower GAAP tax rate in the fiscal quarters and six months ended July 2nd, 2016 is primarily attributable to a $1.6 million release of a valuation allowance established with respect to U.S. deferred tax assets.", "The reduction in valuation allowance is related to deferred tax liabilities established in connection with the acquisition of Pacific Instruments. For the 2016 fiscal year, we expect the operational tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 28%.", "Adjusted net earnings for the quarter of 2016 were $2 million or $0.15 per diluted share as compared to adjusted net earnings attributable to VPG's stockholders of $1.8 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the comparable prior year.", "Cash generated from operations for the second quarter of 2016 was a negative $500,000 compared to a positive $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was mainly attributable to $1.7 million in cash restructuring payments, $4,000 in acquisition costs, and $4,000 in estimated tax payments associated with Pacific Instruments, and $200,000 in higher interest payments due to the increased borrowings for the acquisitions.", "Capital expenditures were $2.2 million in the second quarter, flat with the second quarter last year.", "Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter of 2016 was $2.9 million compared to $2.7 million in the second quarter of last year.", "We define total free cash flow as the amount of cash generated from operation, which is negative $500,000 for the second quarter of 2016, in excess of our capital expenditures which is $2.2 million for the second quarter 2016, and net of any proceed from the sale of assets, which were $200,000 in the second quarter of 2016. Total free cash flow was a negative $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2016 as compared to a positive $200,000 in the second quarter of 2015.", "On slide five, we remained focused on our strategy of growing the topline through organic growth and pursuing additional acquisitions as well as improving profitability by increasing efficiencies and reducing costs.", "This is exemplified by the Pacific acquisition, our second acquisition in the past eight months and by our improving gross margin. With the focus and execution, we should be owed to achieve the milestones on this slide within three years.", "With that, let me pass for other comments on to Ziv.", "Ziv Shoshani", "Thank you, Bill. An important part of our strategy is to grow by developing new product offering. While the Advanced Sensor line is reporting revenues increases of 58% in the second quarter of 2016 versus 2015 second quarter, there is a reduction of 17% in revenues as compared to the first quarter of 2016.", "The low volume, the FTP segment for the second quarter of 2016, came in below expectations, mainly with the Micro-measurement products. I will elaborate on this performance in the FTP segment overview. ", "We will continue to focus on optimizing the profitability of the company despite the global economic uncertainties that continues to create a challenging environment for us and for our customers. We continue to closely monitor the steel market and note that China's steel demand is cooling down as its government's short-term stimulus policy affects sales [ph].", "With rising supply, steel average selling prices are under downside pressure. China's export price declined to $345 per metric ton, which is below the breakeven point for many companies around the world. Export prices in the CIS Zone, which has a large impact on global prices declined as well.", "The increased risk associated with domestic EU developments, including uncertainty with Brexit, also dampens prospect for rapid recovery. Outside of the EU, we have cautious optimism due to the U.S. manufacturing PMI, which experienced the sharpen rise [ph] in the U.S. manufacturing production since November of 2015.", "In spite of a strong dollar, the ongoing energy sector downturn and the political uncertainty due to the upcoming presidential election, the July data signals a rebound in business conditions across the U.S. manufacturing sector. It is too early to say if this is a start of a stronger upturn, but we will monitor the trend. ", "On slide six, moving on to operational trends, let's start by comparing consolidated year-over-year and sequential results. The company's overall book-to-bill was 1.98 in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 1.91 in the second quarter last year and 1.03 in the first quarter of 2016.", "Total orders for the second quarter of 2016 were $56.5 million, up $2.2 million or 4.1% from $54.3 million in the second quarter last year and down $2.1 million or 3.5% from $58.6 million in the first quarter of 2016.", "Moving to slide seven, some details on our reporting segment. The Foil Technology Products segment had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.01 for the second quarter of 2016 compared 0.90 for the second quarter of 2015, and 0.98 for the first quarter of 2016. Sequentially orders decreased by $200,000 or 0.8% from the first quarter of 2016.", "The FTP adjusted gross profit margin was 37.0% for the second quarter, down from 39.6% in Q2 last year and down from 42.3% in the first quarter of 2016. The FTP adjusted gross profit margin decreased from the comparable prior year period was due primarily to $900,000 of lower volume from Micro-measurement product in the test and measurements end markets in Europe and in the America and $0.300 million in labor inefficiencies offset by $200,000 of realization of cost savings from our previously announced cost reduction programs.", "The sequential adjusted gross profit margin decreased from the 2016 first quarter was due primarily to $900,000 of lower volume for foil resistors in the test and measurements and in the avionic, military, and space end markets via distribution in the Europe and in the Americas.", "$400,000 in labor inefficiencies related to the closure of our Costa Rica facility and transition of manufacturing to other facilities during the second quarter of 2016, and inventory related charges of $400,000. The FTP segment backlog was 2.8 months compared to 3.0 months last year, and 2.6 months in the prior quarter.", "Looking at the Force Sensors segment, the book-to-bill ratio was 0.97 for Q2 compared to 0.98 in the second quarter last year and 1.06 for the first quarter of 2016. Sequential orders decreased by $900,000 or 5.6%. This decrease came mainly from the Americas in the process weighing and OEM medical end markets.", "The gross profit margin for the segment was 29.0% in the second quarter of 2016 versus 19.0% in the second quarter of 2015, and 18.4% in the first quarter of 2016. The gross profit margin increases from the comparable prior year period is primarily due to $1.0 million in savings from cost reduction programs and $600,000 related to positive foreign currency exchange rate.", "The sequential gross profit margin increased from the end of 2016 first quarter, primarily due to $200,000 related to increased volume, $300,000 in savings from cost reduction programs, and $600,000 in inventory increase to support ongoing manufacturing of our consolidation plan, and $300,000 related to positive foreign currency exchange rates.", "We completed the Beijing facility closure in the second quarter of 2016. In July 2016, the company signed an agreement to sell its Karmiel, Israel facility and also agreed to lease the portion of the facility back from the buyer. This will give us further cost reduction savings going forward. The sale is expected to close no later during November of 2016.", "The Force Sensors segment backlog was 2.3 months compared to 2.2 months in the prior year period and 2.5 months in Q1 of 2016.", "For the Weighing and Control systems segment, the book-to-bill ratio was 0.94 for Q2 compared to 0.88 in the second quarter of last year and 1.11 for the first quarter. Sequentially, orders decreased by $1.0 million or 5.6% mainly in Europe for our process weighing and onboard weighing for the client.", "The adjusted gross profit margin for the segment was 45.6% in the second quarter of 2016 versus 43.7% in the second quarter of 2015 and 40.2% in the first quarter of 2016.", "The volume for the second quarter of 2016 was flat compared to the second quarter of 2016 due to further reductions of process weighing in Europe and the steel business, offset by an increase in onboard weighing in Europe and the acquisition of Stress-Tek.", "The adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter increased from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to the realization of cost savings from our previously announced cost reduction programs. Sequentially, adjusted gross profit margin increased due to $1.3 million of higher volume, primarily related to steel mainly in Europe.", "The Weighing and Control systems backlog at 2.8 months compared to 2.9 months in last year's second quarter and 3.3 months in the first quarter.", "On slide eight, from an organic performance perspective, we're focused on new product development to improve our topline and continue our initiatives to cut costs and improve efficiency.", "Based on the actions taken to-date, we are expecting to see improved performance, we have realized $2.7 million in savings in the first six months of the year and we expect to achieve our $6.7 million in savings for this fiscal year.", "In light of the global economic conditions, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies and the normal seasonality of our business, we expect net revenues in the range of $55 million to $60 million for the third quarter of 2016.", "Our expectation for fiscal year 2016 has been updated with adjusted earnings guidance of $0.70 to $0.80 fully diluted share at constant exchange rates as for the second quarter of 2016.", "With that, let's open the lines for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "Our first question comes from Ben Terk of Active Owners Fund. Please go ahead.", "Ben Terk", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Quick question on the guidance that you gave, you gave a range of $0.70 to $0.80, can you translate that into a rough range of EBITDA for us? Thank you.", "Bill Clancy", "Okay, Ben, from $0.70 to $0.80, I would say, we're probably looking at EBITDA in the mid to high $20 range.", "Ben Terk", "Great. Thank you. That's all.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sarkis Sherbetchyan of B. Riley & Company. Please go ahead.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Yes, good morning guys. So, a couple of questions here as it relates to the margins. For FTP, margins were down year-over-year, so are the labor inefficiencies related to closing the facility over and should we expect margins to start trending higher in this? And then I have follow-ups.", "Ziv Shoshani", "Okay. In regards to the FTP, the inefficiencies that has been created in the second quarter as I've indicated earlier; one is the -- I would say the bigger portion in the related to the closure of the Costa Rica line and the learning curve in Israel and in the United States and I would say that we may expect some more inefficiencies in the third quarter which are not related to the Costa Rica closure, but are related processes introduction at the Advanced Sensors, while we are -- while we may see that more on the yield side.", "So, the inefficiencies will be reduced substantially, but we may have some yield related matters in the third quarter while we introduce those new processes.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Yes. Thanks for that. And then you did mention a little bit of -- sounded like disappointment from the Micro-measurements, maybe can you touch a little bit upon what's going on that side of the business?", "Ziv Shoshani", "Yes, yes, of course. I will -- I just want to state that in general the reason the company has changed its guidance and -- in regards to EPS and also in regards of -- to revenues and it's important to know is that we built-in our model at certain -- I would say improved business environment where we're going to see much higher revenues in the third and fourth quarter.", "Unfortunately, at this point in time, the macro economy is such that we see more stabilization in the marketplace rather an improved environment, therefore, we have -- we're focusing more flat revenue second quarter vis-\u00e0-vis first quarter only a small increase, therefore, the EPS and the sales guidance has been revised.", "Now regarding Micro-measurement, I think that -- in the Micro-measurement part and may be more related to Advanced Sensors, we have been building a certain capacity in order to support the customers.", "For certain customers, we do get, I would say, very frequently updating regarding to their demand. We have seen a much, much -- we have seen softening of the business environment, we have seen slower demand from our customers, and in fact, this is the first quarter that we do report lower revenues in Advanced Sensors in the second quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the first quarter and I've indicated it's around 17%.", "So, the disappointment was in regard to the fact that our customers have reduced their demand in a very sharp and -- in a very short notice in the second quarter. Therefore, we had to cut back on capacity in order to adopt our workforce to the new loading.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Understood. And then I guess moving onto Force Sensors, here, gross margin obviously higher, can you give us a sense if these levels are sustainable going forward?", "Ziv Shoshani", "In the Force, what the -- in regards to Force Sensors, I think that the big -- or a significant part of the margin improvements which we have indicated also in the past is related the cost reduction.", "You may see from an order intake as well as from a sales revenues, at this point in time, we don't think an improved business environment, but we don't see any deterioration. This is a pretty much, I would say, a solid environment with a potential upside.", "So, we do expect to sustain high 20s gross margin based on our cost reduction initiatives; the closure of Beijing, the selling of the Karmiel facility, and more consolidation that is being planned toward to the year end.", "So, I do think that those margins -- the high 20 margins are sustainable in this -- at this sales revenue level.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Good. And a final one for me. For Weighing and Control, it sounded like you mentioned may have been a quarterly -- quarter-on-quarter increase in the steel business, can you maybe talk about your expectations here for the steel end market, particularly, as it relates to the business on a go-forward basis?", "Ziv Shoshani", "The -- we did see an increased revenues in steel in the second quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the first quarter. And the steel revenues were $1.5 million vis-\u00e0-vis the first quarter. And this is really -- I would say trying to deliver existing backlog. I -- unfortunately, I don't have any good news regarding the steel as I've indicated. I think that the situation is in -- the situation is very -- is already at extremely low level.", "I think that what we have seen in the last couple of years which has been deteriorated in a way this year vis-\u00e0-vis prior year is extremely low prices, companies that are losing money.", "We are expecting big consolidation, at least, from our perspective. We do believe that we are already at an extremely low level and we hope or expect that the situation will not continue to deteriorate.", "But at this point in time, we are at the lowest level we ever had, or I think the steel market condition is in its lowest level since many, many, many years, or even many decades in regards to supply and demand situation.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Understood. I'll hop back into the queue.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Our next question comes from Adam Hutt of Leviticus Partners. Please go ahead.", "Adam Hutt", "Hi, guys, I got late to the call, so I apologize if you covered this already. But can you address for me the potential opportunity in infrastructure, you know there has been -- the infrastructure stocks have been on a chair, companies that build bridges and highways, can you tell me what kind of potential there is in new products that you're working on, that you then talk about over the next two years in infrastructure?", "Ziv Shoshani", "Well, regarding infrastructure, I can say that our results have been impacted very, very much so by the infrastructure end markets since we are providing product in our WCS segment in regard to our Nobel brand -- European Nobel brand, our U.S. BLH brand, and also in regards to Micro-measurement strain gages. So, we have seen this significant decline, which so far we have not seen any upside.", "In regards to specific product, I would say that on the strain gages side, our products are widely used in various applications. And I cannot identify a specific product which has been developed for a given application, but they are widely used across, I would say many applications in regards to the infrastructure end markets. So, once this end market recovers, we should expect a very nice rebound in regards to our revenues.", "Adam Hutt", "Are bridge builders using more so than in the past sensors to detect for actual stress to get a better idea of when bridges need to be rebuilt because that's something -- is that represent a growth opportunity for you anecdotally speaking anyone?", "Ziv Shoshani", "Okay. In regard -- if you speak specifically about bridge applications, I know that in some of the more modern systems that we are not -- that our customers are developing, they may use more strain gages.", "But I'm not sure I have enough information to say if it's 10%, 20%, or double what they have been using before. But since I know this is a more critical applications and the tendency is definitely to be on the safe side and not to take any risk, they are using more, but I -- it is very hard for me to quantify how much or how many more.", "Adam Hutt", "What percentage of your business is in infrastructure, can you guess that?", "Ziv Shoshani", "In infrastructure if we look across all the company and I don't have -- I could -- may be say it's around -- because we don't track this specific end market. Our segmentation, our end market's expectation is done slightly different, but if I had to guess how much goes into infrastructure, I would say around 5%.", "Adam Hutt", "But you're not looking for any particular bump-up from the current legislation for highway spending bill and what not. It's not something that you guys talk about internally that should be a lead to a bump in demand for your sensors.", "Ziv Shoshani", "No, I would assume that our customers are part of these solutions. We don't have any direct -- we don't have any direct relationship with the changes in legislation.", "Adam Hutt", "I got you. Can you say [Technical Difficulty]?", "Bill Clancy", "Excuse me?", "Adam Hutt", "I got you. Can you say who your three business customers are that buy your sensors that -- and build them in?", "Ziv Shoshani", "In which end markets?", "Adam Hutt", "Bridges and highways, tunnels?", "Ziv Shoshani", "I'm sorry. Out of the -- top off my head, I don't have any --", "Adam Hutt", "Okay. That's fair.", "Ziv Shoshani", "I -- but -- I -- we can definitely go back to you and provide you with the name of the top three customers in these end markets, absolutely.", "Adam Hutt", "Yes, another time. No problem.", "Ziv Shoshani", "Top off my head, so sorry.", "Adam Hutt", "No problem. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Clancy for any closing remarks.", "Bill Clancy", "Thank you for your participation on the call today.

Approaching 90% of fixed capacity caught gold [ph] which is 45 million metric tons for 2016 and 100 million to 150 million metric tons in five years, which represent 10% of the total capacity reduction.", "The gold in the short-term is to achieve productivity enhancements and average selling prices increases. Uncertainties in some of our key regions continued to play pressure on our business. We\u2019re monitoring trends in Europe, including the continuing impact of Brexit and the rising corporate debt in China.", "On Slide 6, moving onto operational trends, let\u2019s start by comparing consolidated year-over-year and sequential results. The company\u2019s overall book-to-bill was 0.98 in the third quarter of 2016, compared to 0.97 in the third quarter last year, and 0.98 in the second quarter of 2016.", "Total orders for the third quarter of 2016 were $53.2 million, down $2.5 million, or 4.4% from $55.7 million in the third quarter last year, and down $3.3 million, or 5.9% from $56.5 million in the second quarter of 2016.", "On Slide 7, some details on our reporting segment. The Foil Technology Product segment had the book-to-bill ratio of 0.99 for the third quarter of 2016, compared to 0.90 for the third quarter of 2015 and 1.01 for the second quarter of 2016. Sequentially orders decreased by $2.0 million, or 7.9% from the second quarter of 2016, primarily in the Americas and Europe.", "The decrease is mainly in the Stress Analysis Gages, which are used in the oil and gas and in precision agriculture applications, which are order driven. The reduction in foil resistors compared to Q2 of 2016 is mainly due to seasonality of the business. The Foil Technology Products adjusted gross profit margin was 36.4% for Q3, down from 42.0% in Q3 last year and down from 37.0% in the second quarter of 2016.", "The FTP adjusted gross profit margin decreased from the comparable prior year period was due primarily to $2.5 million of lower volume for Micro-measurement products in the test and measurements and force measurements and market in the Americas and Europe.", "The sequential adjusted gross profit margin decreased from the 2016 second quarter period was due primarily to 0.8 million of lower volume for Micro-measurement products in the avionics, military and space and in the test and measurements end markets mainly in the Americas. The FTP segment backlog was 3.0 months compared to 2.6 months last year and 2.8 months in the prior quarter.", "Looking at the Force Sensors segment, the book-to-bill ratio was 1.02 for Q3 compared to 1.03 in the third quarter last year and 0.97 for the second quarter of 2016. Sequential orders increased by 0.7 million, or 4.5% mainly from the Americas construction OEM customers, offset by Europe\u2019s medical customers.", "The adjusted gross profit margin for the segment was 31.0% in the third quarter of 2016 versus 21.0% in the third quarter of 2015 and 29.0% in the second quarter of 2016. The adjusted gross profit margin increased from the comparable prior-year period is primarily due to 0.6 million related to increased volume in the Americas related to OEM constructions and 0.8 million in savings from cost reduction programs.", "The sequential gross profit margin increase is due to 0.3 million of favorable volume product mix. The Force Sensors segment backlog was 2.4 months compared to 2.4 months in prior year period and 2.3 months in Q2 of 2016.", "For the Weighing and Control systems system the book-to-bill ratio was 0.92 for Q3 compared to 1.05 in the third quarter last year and 0.94 for the second quarter. Sequentially, orders decreased by $2.0 million, or 12.4%, mainly in the Americas due to steel and in Europe due to onboard weighing.", "The adjusted gross profit margin for the segment was 44.9% in the third quarter of 2016 versus 45.4% in the third quarter of 2015 and 45.6% in the second quarter of 2016. The Weighing and Control system adjusted gross profit margin decreased from the comparable prior year period was due primarily to a negative impact of foreign exchange rate of 0.2 million.", "Sequentially, adjusted gross profit margin decreased due to $1.1 million of lower volume in steel and onboard weighing in Europe. The Weighing and Control systems backlog was 2.9 months compared to 3.3 month in last year\u2019s third quarter and 2.8 months in the second quarter.", "On Slide 8, based on actions taken to-date, we are expecting to see improved performance. We have realized $5.6 million of savings in the first nine months of the year and we expect to achieve our $6.7 million in savings this fiscal year. In light of the global economic conditions, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies, we expect net revenues in the range of $55 million to $60 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. We are updating our expectations for the fiscal year 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 70% to 75% at constant exchange rates as of the third quarter of 2016.", "With that, I\u2019d like to open the lines for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Franzreb with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.", "John Franzreb", "Good morning, everybody.", "Ziv Shoshani", "Good morning.", "William Clancy", "Good morning, John.", "\u2018", "John Franzreb", "I\u2019d like to open up with the current revenue trends. It seems like a little bit lower than \u2013 do you expect it, say, six months ago, as Ziv kind of highlighted the continued weakness we see in the steel market. Is there anything else that you can call out that\u2019s kind of surprised you that it was softer than you expected going into year end?", "Ziv Shoshani", "Okay. As we look into the year-end, there are few, I would say, there are few points that we have to look at. First, in regards to this specific quarter, we did report a fairly as \u2013 and as I indicated in prior earnings calls, there are two \u2013 there are mainly two product lines, which are end-user project driven. One is Pacific Instruments and the other one is the steel KELK business. For Q3, we have realized lower revenues and we do expect to see a certain, I would say, a certain recovery or higher revenues for Q4 based on the existing Q.", "Overall, in regards to the business environment, I think that I would like to emphasize that the \u2013 onboard weighing business in Europe has been affected quite heavily by the July Brexit announcement. I think that in essence, the construction business in the UK was almost standing still for two months and it did affect our revenues for the second quarter in regards to onboard weighing, at least, at the level of $500,000.", "In regards to the steel and the oil and gas, I don\u2019t think that at this point in time, we have any indications regarding a real recovery. But there are signs that our mainly oil and gas customers have been depleting our stock for the last nine months and they\u2019re ready to place orders despite the fact that it might be on the lower level, but they\u2019re ready to place orders, which they didn\u2019t do for the last three quarter in the, I would say, in the \u2013 in coming weeks.", "All in all, in regards to Micro-measurements, where we have seen a large volume decline, this is due to, one factor is stock adjustments at OEM customers and having less end-user project-driven mainly in the United States.", "John Franzreb", "Okay, got it. And in regards to Force Sensors, the good margin profile you attributed some of the restructurings, but I\u2019m also curious about the product that you attributed to product mix. I know you can try to gravitate more towards an OEM\u2026", "Ziv Shoshani", "Exactly.", "John Franzreb", "\u2026type sale. How much of that benefit was that mix and where do we stand today relative to your 70-30 target?", "Ziv Shoshani", "Well, the 70-30 target is still further along. But as I indicated and we have been discussing that, there\u2019s a significant cost savings coming from the restructuring and the consolidation of manufacturing. But also in this particular quarter, we have seen and we have reported a favorable product mix coming more form OEM value-added product vis-\u00e0-vis precision weighing semi-commodity product.", "I think that all in all, this effect did contribute for this specific quarter around couple of hundreds of thousands due to a favorable product mix.", "John Franzreb", "Okay, great.", "Ziv Shoshani", "I would like to also add that we have seen a recovery in \u2013 we have \u2013 I\u2019ve been reporting an increase in the United States and in the OEM construction business. And this is a very large, I would say, a very large deal that our U.S. customers has won in Asia, and this is why we do see an uptick in the demand.", "John Franzreb", "Perfect. And regarding the strategic alternative cost that you took in the quarter, can you just talk to what led you to the decision to go down that avenue if you\u2019re not going to give us any color on what you\u2019re looking to do, but this \u2013 what started the process?", "William Clancy", "John, at this point in time, I think, we\u2019re now \u2013 I\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019re not going to comment or disclose any developments regarding this process until we have further information.", "John Franzreb", "Okay. How about \u2013 do you expect to incur the costs again in the current quarter or in the December quarter?", "William Clancy", "John, unfortunately, I cannot comment as to the continuation of this process.", "John Franzreb", "Okay. I\u2019ll just \u2013 I\u2019ll get back in the queue for now. Thank you, Bill.", "William Clancy", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sarkis Sherbetchyan with B. Riley & Company. Please go ahead.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Yes. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question here.", "Ziv Shoshani", "Good morning, Sarkis.", "William Clancy", "Good morning, Sarkis.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Yes. So with regards to just restructuring costs and initiatives, it seems like you\u2019re nicely on the way with what you had communicated earlier. Do you see any room for additional costs out or cost areas that you can attack few or further increase margins?", "Ziv Shoshani", "Yes, absolutely. So far I can talk only regarding what we have announced, because there are some social plans and people, which are involved in the growth of the restructuring. But so far the restructurings have been in regard to the closure of the Beijing facility. Our Beijing facility for Force Sensors, we have reported also in the last quarter of selling the current \u2013 these early facility for Four Sensors, which we had a very low, I would say, utilization in regards to the space vis-\u00e0-vis the headcount.", "W are planning more restructuring programs to be realized by year end, which should show more cost savings for next year. And for next year itself, we are expecting more cost reduction programs, which should realize, I would say, much more money beyond what we have reported this year. But at this point, unfortunately, I cannot discuss may be just one more point that this was part of the restructuring that has been completed in Q3. All the operational \u2013 the Weighing and Control System operational team that has been residing in California has been consolidating by the end of the third quarter this year to the Stress-Tek operation in Seattle.", "So by now, all the WCS operations in the United States are in Seattle. This is also part of the cost savings program.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Good. That\u2019s helpful. And so I presume you have more details as we kind of wrap up Q4 here and you\u2019d communicate additional measures that you\u2019d undertake, is that correct?", "Ziv Shoshani", "This is absolutely correct.", "Sarkis Sherbetchyan", "Okay. Thank you, I\u2019ll hop back in.", "Ziv Shoshani", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Clancy for any closing remarks.", "William Clancy", "Okay, thank you very much and everybody I thank you for joining us on our earnings call today, and we look forward to talking to you and everybody else in the near future.

A copy of the press release, along with other company information may be found on the Investor page at our website at ", "Before I turn the call over to Chris Harris the President and Chief Executive Officer of CDTI, I want to emphasize that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements that are predictions, projections and other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.", "Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today\u2019s results press release and the comments made during this conference call, and a Risk Factor section of our Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I am excited to discuss with you the progress we are making in transforming CDTi into an advanced materials company. We are driving volumes with existing OEM customers while aggressively targeting near term revenue opportunities with DuraFit.", "In the first quarter, our commercialization efforts drove results for DuraFit diesel particulate filters or DPFs and our broader portfolio of advanced catalysts. On a sequential basis, consolidated revenue grew by 19.3% and gross margins improved 457 basis points driven by a more favorable product mix and progress in building out multiple sales channels for DuraFit.", "Although revenue in our Heavy Duty Diesel Systems division declined year-over-year due to the wind down of the California diesel retrofit mandate, we met our internal goal of $1 million in DuraFit sales for this quarter without any national networks onboard yet. We continue to build out our distribution platform and expect to ramp sales throughout 2015 putting us on track to achieve our guidance of $5 million in DuraFit sales for the year.", "Now I will provide a more detailed update on our near term commercial efforts. In our Heavy Duty Diesel Systems division, we are achieving success with our sales strategy. As I just highlighted, we continue aggressively roll out DuraFit, our new cost effective alternative to OEM replacement filters for the North American markets.", "In the first quarter, we won a major fleet customer with New York City\u2019s Department of Sanitation, one of the largest refuse fleets in America. We believe refuse fleets alone across the U.S. represent a $15 million to $20 million replacement DPFs sub markets. We are continuing to pursue national distributors and expect to add at least one large network relationship in the second quarter.", "In fact, we expect to soon announce our first distribution agreement with the national network that would make our replace DPFs available to several 100 outlets across North America. Meanwhile our regional independent distribution network throughout the U.S. and Canada continues to growth 10s of distributors now onboard.", "Our traction in the DPF replacement market demonstrates our success targeting multiple major sales channels and signifies the growing penetration of our DPF product and proprietary technology throughout North America. Our DuraFit value proposition is resonating with customers, high-quality durable replacement DPFs, there is leveraged CDTi catalyst technology and promise fleet managers and owner operators lower total cost of ownership and less risk at vehicle downtime. To support these efforts, we are adding to CDTi\u2019s regional sales teams and executive commercial leadership.", "Turning briefly to the retrofit markets, while not a growth driver, we believe there are opportunities to target projects to bring good margins and leverage our many government approvals and long track history in heavy-duty retrofits. For example, in the first quarter we\u2019ve recorded approximately $600,000 in revenue from the combination of two key projects, one with the Utah Department of Transportation and the other with Niagara Frontier Transit.", "We seek to leverage our latest verified systems such as Purifilter EGR to exploit retrofit opportunities outside North America and Europe. Overall while we expect pockets of profitable sales in future quarters, retrofit will contribute less to our total mix of revenue as DuraFit sales ramp. In our catalyst division, we continue to execute well against our Honda business, which now includes supplying catalysts for the Acura ILX as announced on our fourth quarter call.", "The volume of the new car catalysts production for Honda is up 9% year-over-year and we are seeing modest overall growth across our entire catalyst portfolio. Our expanded portfolio now generates an extra $1.50 per vehicle in material margin when compared to 2013 due to manufacturing improvements and a favorable mix of performance catalysts. In fact, if we back out pass through revenue tied to ceramic substrates onto which we coat our proprietary catalyst formulations.", "Gross margins for the catalyst divisions would rise from 26% to 40% for the first quarter. Showing the true value add of our advanced materials and precision coating, while West Coast port disruptions did affect the port in first quarters, we still expect full commercialization of our broader product portfolio to represent the more profitable product mix and we anticipate second quarter OEM sales to be similar to the first quarter.", "Now I will turn to our exciting technology advances as we transition to an advance materials company. As previously discussed we planned to deploy CDTi proprietary innovative technology for use in our own catalyst coating and to broaden its availability to other catalyst coaters for use and proprietary powder from with other business models. Last week, we announced initial engine and vehicle testing results for our new Synergized Platinum Group Metal Diesel Oxidation Catalyst Technology called SPGM DOC.", "The initial results showed that our breakthrough SPGM DOC technology achieved emission control and system performance comparable to a leading OEM catalyst product, both slashing PGM usage by over 80%. The DOC is a major component of diesel emission control systems and current designs use high levels of platinum and palladium to reduce pollutants and breakdown particular matter.", "Based upon information derived from Johnson Matthey\u2019s Platinum 2013 report OEM spent almost $1 billion on PGMs for heavy-duty vehicle catalysts in 2012 and CDTi estimates that DOCs represented the vast majority of that spend. The test further demonstrate our ability retailer nanoscale materials that could be easily coated onto conventional substrates to create significant value propositions in a range of downstream market such as CDTis [ph] own DuraFit aftermarket product line, as well as global retrofit in OEM applications.", "Heavy-duty DOCs are thus a major opportunity for Advanced Materials Technology. As a faster path to revenue, our aim is to more broadly commercialize our SPGM DOC technology to other major global players in the value chain via our powder-to-coat business model.", "Beyond the SPGM DOC testing, we are executing other test plans on engine platforms and initial results will be forthcoming. Our testing employees sophisticated data analysis, emission performance evaluation and interaction with engine calibrations. We\u2019re using industry and regulator recognized aging and drive cycle test protocols to take longer to complete, but generally highly credible test data for advancing our commercialization with leading OEMs around the world. More specifically, within the second quarter we expect to release initial testing results of our Spinel technology and other new proprietary technologies conducted on gasoline direct injection, turbocharged and naturally aspirated engines.", "Our innovative materials all aim to offer compelling value proposition as the improved performance and dramatically reduced costs. More specifically, our breakthrough technologies offer major PGM costs savings, superior noise reduction, cold-start emission performance and improved functionality of rhodium used in three way catalysts. For example, passenger cars typically have two catalysts for different exhaust zones. We believe our approach will offer new highly cost effective options for exhaust system design such as the potentials to greatly simplify an exhaust system by reducing a two catalysts system to a single catalyst or by mixing and matching technologies for close coupled and underfloor catalysts.", "Beyond our research and testing efforts we continue to strengthen our pattern portfolio. Two key patterns were awarded in April 2015 for CDTI\u2019s latest Mixed Phase Catalyst or MPC, three-way catalyst innovations, they relates to the technology used in our most recent Honda wins. These patents helps commenced CDTI\u2019s position on our current proprietary technologies underpinned the powerderization work we are conducting and support our ongoing work with OEMs.", "Meanwhile we filed five more patents during the first quarter of 2015 and expect more filings to protect our newest technologies. Overall we\u2019re making great progress. We are working with OEMs to achieve validation of our basic technology in advance of scaling up to commercial quantities in the coming months we are optimizing our power to coat capability. And while we do not [Indiscernible] interest pay related revenue until 2016 we intend to secure our customer for enabling catalytic powders in the second half of this year.", "We are more excited than ever about the tremendous potential of our advanced material strategy. We are making significant progress in both the commercialization of our products and solutions and the development of our new technologies, so we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.", "I will now turn the call over to Dave for review of our Q1 financials. Dave?", "David Shea", "Thank you, Chris, as a reminder, the standard exhaust business, which was sold in October of 2014 is classified as discontinued operations. For the first quarter of 2015 revenue was $10.3 million compared to $11.6 million in the first quarter of 2014. Heavy-duty diesel revenue for California and the 49 states was down due to the forecasted decrease in retrofit demand. In the first quarter of 2014 CARB regulatory deadlines are up stronger sales in the California retrofit market of $4.2 million, compared to $1.2 million for the first quarter of 2015, meanwhile our Durafit sales had just began to ramp up in the first quarter of 2015.", "Our catalyst revenue was up 17% compared to the 2014 first quarter reflecting growth in the new production volumes for Honda and product mix. Gross profit was $2.8 million, compared to $3.7 million reflecting the lower revenue and the startup cost associated with the new DuraFit product line. As sales of DuraFit ramp, we expect incremental improvements in the margins.", "The breakdown of margins was 27% for heavy-duty diesel and 26% for the catalyst division for the first quarter. Total operating expenses were $5.5 million, compared to $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2014. Breaking down operating expenses SG&A was $3.4 million compared to $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2014. R&D was $2.1 million compared to $1.3 million in the first quarter of last year.", "R&D expense increased as a result of the testing and development work on advanced catalyst technology and continued new patent filings and prosecution. Operating loss was $2.7 million, compared to $1.5 million in the same period last year. Net loss was $3 million or $0.21 per share as compared to a loss of $3.8 million or $0.39 per share in the same period last year.", "The outstanding shares for the first quarter 2015 were $14.2 million as compared to $9.8 million in the first quarter of 2014. The increase reflects approximately $2 million shares in the $6.9 million offering and $1.4 million in the $4.4 million offering, we conducted in April of 2014 and November 2014 respectively. At March 31, 2015 we had cash of $4.3 million as compared to $7.2 million at the beginning of the year. We are reaffirming our annual guidance for 2015. We continue to expect revenue between $40 million and $45 million depending on the timing of DuraFit sales ramp as well as retrofit projects. This compares to revenue of $41.2 million in 2014.", "We expect gross margins between 25% and 28% due to carry of the startup cost and supply chain inefficiencies. As DuraFit ramps and we optimize our supply chain, we expect margins to improve in the back half of the year towards the 30% level achieved in 2014. We will continue to assess options to better align our assets with our future vision for the company as well as our view opportunities to improve our balance sheet and financial flexibility to position us for growth.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Chris", "Chris Harris", "Thank you, Dave. We are well on our way to transforming CDTi into an advanced materials company that can broadly commercialize our proprietary technology, scale the business and build substantial shareholder value. I\u2019m most proud of our achievements today and extremely encouraged by the opportunities ahead of us. We continue our highly vigorous validation testing of Spinel and other new technologies to expand the commercial reach of our enabling technology and accelerated deployment.", "We expect to have additional updates for you on our vehicle testing and our work to validate, optimize and scale our powder-to-coat capability in the second quarter. We intend to secure our first customer for enabling catalytic powders in the second half of this year. We anticipate further protecting our advanced low PGM, SPGM and ZPGM materials platforms by filing additional strategic patents in 2015.", "In short term we are targeting to add at least 1 national distributor for DuraFit by the end of the second quarter as well as ramp sales with our existing regional distribution network.", "Operator, we are now ready to begin the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Matt Koranda of Roth Capital Partners. Your line is open.", "Matt Koranda", "Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions.", "David Shea", "Good morning.", "Chris Harris", "Good morning, Matt.", "Matt Koranda", "So just wanted to start out with the powder business, and you guys had mentioned potentially securing your first customer for that business model in the second half of this year. Could you help clarify for us, is that going to be an OEM customer or are you talking about a catalyst coater?", "Chris Harris", "Clearly, if it\u2019s a powder-to-coat business model, it will be coater of catalyst. And our focus is on Matt is on a near-term revenue and proving out the business model of powder-to-coat. If you look at large passenger car OEM programs those are a little bit longer cycles of selling and we of course have lots of discussions with OEMs and other players in the market, but we\u2019re going after the shorter time frames of revenue and improving out this model.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, great. And then how you envision the commercialization with that customer going? I mean, what\u2019s magnitude of revenues we can expect and how can we kind of model to ramp up in 2016?", "Chris Harris", "I think any of these early opportunities [indiscernible], they will be materially significant profitable revenue on top of our base catalyst business, but they won\u2019t be the size of a major passenger car OEM program.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, all right, got it. Shifting gears to DuraFit for a moment. Can you just help us understand the potential size of the opportunity, may be on an annual revenue basis with the New York Department of Sanitation. I know, you\u2019d mentioned fleets in general, but just how much are each of these sorts of fleets kind of work on an annual basis in terms of revenue for you guys?", "Chris Harris", "Generally, we\u2019ll not get into discussing a very specific customer or fleet for a variety of reasons, but we - when we translate the Department of Sanitation in New York City to other major fleets across North America, it is a $15 million plus [Indiscernible] replacement DPFs.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, all right, got it. And I mean may be you could just qualitatively characterize the size of the New York Department of Sanitation versus some other potential fleet opportunities. Could you do that for us?", "Chris Harris", "In the refuse area, they\u2019re the largest, clearly, but obviously there is on-road fleets that will exceed that. They are significant and as we report more on details of DuraFit sales in the coming months as sales expand, we\u2019ll be able to piece together a better picture of what those revenue profiles look like for fleets or combinations era.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, got it. In terms of what needs to happen to secure the national DPF channel partner that you guys have mentioned in the prepared remarks, I mean what needs to your purpose right now and the announcement kind of get you guys over the hump or is there anything else left to do here?", "Chris Harris", "We feel pretty comfortable that we\u2019ve addressed all the major commercial and technical issues and we have a good portfolio to roll into any first agreement that we signed and start executing with any national networks.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, and then just lastly on DuraFit, if you can help us out just understanding the cadence of DuraFit revenues for the remainder of the year. Is the incremental $4 million that you guys have implied in the guidance, is that evenly split between the rest of the quarters or is there a ramp up and how does that kind of - how does that ramp play out for the rest of the year?", "Chris Harris", "I think, it\u2019s fair to say that our expectations around Q2 are similar to Q1 and that the second half shows as people ramp and that\u2019s related to the kick-in of any national network deals that we land and start executing as well as full-fledged exploitation of our independent regional distributor networks.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, so did we see may be a ramp in Q3, just given some inventory bills that there would be associated with a national dealer network win?", "Chris Harris", "Yeah, I mean there is with any distributor or dealer location, some initial inventory and pipeline filling and but everyone is managing their inventories tightly and the name of the games in this business is to better understand what the mix of parts will be out there and to have a order fulfillment system that can respond quickly, such that there is a massive amount of inventory piled up in the value chain and supply chain. And so we\u2019ll be able to qualify any sales ramps that we see in terms of trying to understanding what\u2019s actually moving off the shelf to end users and actually truck owners or fleet managers versus what\u2019s in the pipeline.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, great. Couple of more and then I\u2019ll jump back in queue. On the California retrofit market, could you just help us understand, what were California retrofit revenues in Q1?", "David Shea", "$1.2 million.", "Matt Koranda", "$1.2 million, okay, great. And then lastly just on the balance sheet I was curious, if you guys could comment sort of on cash management strategies that you guys are implementing. Can you generate any cash from working capital during the remainder of 2015 just like your thoughts on that?", "Chris Harris", "Yes, and if you look, in Q1 we used a fair bit of cash we rebuilding of our AR [ph], look we, our AR increase like $1.6 million coming off slow in Q4. So we will have some coming out of both RAR and RAP.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, got it. I will jump back in queue, guys. Thank you.", "Chris Harris", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is from Ian Gilson of Zacks Investment Research. Your line is open.", "Ian Gilson", "Hey, good morning, gentlemen.", "Chris Harris", "Good morning.", "Ian Gilson", "I have a couple of questions regarding the balance sheet - notes of accounts receivable went from $2.9 million to $4.4 million.", "Chris Harris", "Yep.", "Ian Gilson", "And prepaid expenses declined from $2.1 million down to $940,000, could you outline why?", "Chris Harris", "So, on the - let\u2019s talk about the accounts receivable first. When you look back at Q4, we\u2019ve got really - Q4 was one of our slower quarters on really of recent memory and it was particularly slow in December. We had a really slow December, so to that point - we acquired a bit of [Indiscernible] pipeline coming in March. And our March of Q1 was actually particularly strong. So we had a lot of revenue within the - within Q1 in the last month. So that\u2019s why you see our AR jumping at $1.6 million.", "Ian Gilson", "Okay. And the prepaid expense account?", "Chris Harris", "Okay, so as far as prepaid\u2019s, we went number of that\u2019s around our insurance and then, [Indiscernible] for the rest of it for you.", "Ian Gilson", "Okay, okay. The Honda business, that\u2019s just the introduced - introduction of the ILX how about volume on other line say, Acura lines and that [Indiscernible]?", "Chris Harris", "In general, I think I mentioned earlier about 9% of vehicle volume increase on that. And it spread fairly evenly across the different models, but clearly there is a shift in this portfolio Ian, and we\u2019ve been talking about this for a while away from just the four cylinders standard accord to this fixed cylinder and the specialty model from the Acura models. So that is an important part of the plan and the forecast for the Honda this year, for the remaining part of the year also.", "So I mean and things are pretty steady, the overall North American market remains very strong - at levels now new car production and sales of pre-recession. So we don\u2019t expect surprises there, but it\u2019s robust, but there is a lot of competition that all of these OEMs are faced in the North American market and so we have to be measured and conservative in our overall expectation for the Honda portfolio.", "Ian Gilson", "You are now have a control over your Southeast Asian business, how is that going?", "Chris Harris", "Well, it shouldn\u2019t surprise you that we are on the ground as we speak in Asia, investigating some of the large markets there including China in terms of what opportunities exist for faster commercializations and utilizing our proprietary technologies and powder-to-coat model in developing new business and trying to get there sooner rather than later in the shorter cycles to revenue.", "Ian Gilson", "Okay, fine. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is from Jeff Osborne of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.", "Jeff Osborne", "Hey, good morning guys. Couple of questions, most of them have been answered at this point in time, but I was wondering, if you could just update us, you mentioned a couple of higher, looking to expand on the sales force, how should we think about the OpEx trends through the year?", "David Shea", "So, when you look at OpEx through the year, we actually think, it\u2019s going to be R&D should be similar through most of the year, a little bit lower, when you look at SG&A Q1s are peak of the year and will actually be coming down slightly in the balance of the year.", "Jeff Osborne", "Thank you [ph]. So what\u2019s the rationale for the peak in Q1 whether decline?", "David Shea", "So peak in Q1 relates to a lot of year end ramp up activities, we\u2019ve got most of our audit fees et cetera that ramped through Q1, so there is a lot of that sort of non-recurring stuff that appear that\u2019s done in Q1.", "Jeff Osborne", "Got you, okay, so for and then can you just walk through the levers for DuraFit gross margin expansion through the year other than volume, what are the other things that we are thinking about and then longer term on DuraFit, is there a possibility of using SPGMs for that or is it kind of fully based the way it is now?", "Chris Harris", "Clearly, we\u2019ll look at as we look at the DuraFit portfolio products and go into the market and find out where and if you will the failure rates are and what we need at our product line, we\u2019ll update both the DPF side of things and we\u2019ll look very closely as whether we should introduce DOCs that our catalyst that have occurred in front of the DPF on most of these on road vehicles, and if we introduce those DOCs, we are going to look very strongly doing it with technology like SPGM DOC, and in terms of the levers for margin expansion, similar to what I\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s the raw material side, especially on the substrate itself, the filter itself that we\u2019ve been put our catalyst coatings on top of, that\u2019s very important component. And as we build volume and optimize the whole operational planning and forecasting, we should be able to get better buying packages if you will.", "And then, we\u2019ll look few also at our manufacturing processes as we ramp and build out our capacity to keep up with expanding volumes of how we can run that more efficiently. And so it\u2019s really about optimizing the supply chain and really getting out those key material substrate cost.", "Jeff Osborne", "Got you, that\u2019s helpful. Couple other quick ones. Should we think about the retrofit market kind of waffling around in this $1 million to $1.5 million range or is there are any hopes for growth from these levels? What\u2019s kind of the outlook for that segment?", "Chris Harris", "I think as we\u2019ve talked about retrofit in the past in terms of it, it is in general declining market for sure in North America. And it\u2019s very project base with all sorts of variations and changes in terms of timing of projects from the funding stage to the actual execution of putting systems on vehicles. I think you have definition of calling it a waffling market is exactly the way it should be termed.", "Jeff Osborne", "Okay, but for the $1.2 million this quarter - you wouldn\u2019t characterize it as a heavy period of projects that flow through the revenue, and would suggest that it would be half of those number in 2Q or something like that kind of flattish to down would be a decent trajectory for it?", "Chris Harris", "Yeah, I think flattish to down is a good term for it.", "David Shea", "Yeah.", "Jeff Osborne", "Okay, perfect. Any just one or two other quick ones, any initial read on the final testing, I know you still waiting for all the data validation, but what\u2019s been the early feedback? Any suggestion that the original [Indiscernible] is in valid?", "Chris Harris", "We\u2019re executing the programs as planned. There are no showstoppers at all and stay tuned.", "Jeff Osborne", "All right, good to hear. Last question, if I heard you right, you mentioned that there was a port [ph] impact, I want to ensure if you\u2019re talking about in the fourth quarter, in the December quarter or in the March quarter, but is that something that you could quantify what the port strike and others heard the revenue about?", "Chris Harris", "I think people know a lot of the West Coast port disruptions and that has been influenced a different supply going into the automakers in the Midwest such that certainly the builds are being kind of pushed out and may be level loaded more towards the second quarter et cetera. So I think the bottom line is that we expect our OEM business from the second quarter to look similar to the first quarter when all set in time.", "David Shea", "And some of our shipments are going out to Honda in Asia and those - some of those have been delayed due to the port\u2019s effects.", "Jeff Osborne", "Gotcha. Thanks so much, guys.", "Chris Harris", "You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is from Noah Kaye of Northland Capital. Your line is open.", "Noah Kaye", "Thanks very much [Indiscernible]. I Just want to start congratulating you on the DSNY win.", "Chris Harris", "Great. Thank you, Noah.", "DavidShea", "Great.", "Noah Kaye", "I wanted to ask about just patent strategy, you talked I think at the outside about you know doing some more work to secure additional patents there. Can you kind of conceptualize that for us and help us understand how you are thinking about the IT and the strategy going forward?", "Chris Harris", "Yes, I mean there is two aspects is - one is, the portfolio itself and then of course a strategic foreign filing strategy, but let\u2019s go to the portfolio itself. The issue there is that securing what we have done on the earlier Spinel wins structure based patents is really important and then we cover all our bases in terms of compositions of matter.", "And then we\u2019ll get increasingly sophisticated as outputs of our testing work too in terms of getting applications related patents. So that we kind of cover the whole basis from the structure to the composition of matter two specific applications and where possible, if we can prove our investigations in terms of sensitivity with engine calibrations, we\u2019ll file strategically there if we come up with novel learning\u2019s and interactions between engine calibrations in these new platform materials.", "Noah Kaye", "And is there any sort of competitive prospect or a potential competitor that\u2019s driving your work on the patent thing? Or is it really just a question and kind of wanting to get out in front and nail this down?", "Chris Harris", "We clearly want to be out in front and nail this down and cover our basis. I mean the issuance of those foundational Spinel patents in October, November last year was in record time and that would suggest - it could suggest that we are in space where no one is at and that we are truly novel. So our goal is to maintain that leadership and ensure we have as part of our overall technology strategy, make sure we have proper protection for these new inventions and these new possibilities.", "Noah Kaye", "Okay, great. And you talked about a little bit earlier, but just want to maybe get some additional color on other fleets that you might be able to target it. Can you kind of give us a sense of geographically where you are spending your time right now for win similar to the DSNY?", "Chris Harris", "Well, I mean, you know I don\u2019t want kind of to show our cards\u2026", "Noah Kaye", "Sure.", "Chris Harris", "So to speak in terms of how we analyze the market and where the concentrations of trucks and fleets are, but suffice it to say, we are mapping in detail where the concentrations of trucking industries and fleets and service outlets are. And then we are overlaying that with independent distributors pursuing national networks that cover those concentrations. And so, if you look at that from a strategic standpoint, it is very important that we round out multi-channel sales and distribution with DuraFit keeping in mind the analysis that we have done on where the concentrations of these vehicles are.", "Noah Kaye", "I guess it maybe another way to kind of get at this is to ask, what are you seeing incrementally on what kind of on the regulatory front that you may or may not be potential tailwinds to your prior portfolio and to your solutions.", "Chris Harris", "I think the key regulatory development is on the past into your side with EPA\u2019s Tier 3 that it efficiently starts facing in 2017, but we already know that for a variety of strategic fleet credit reasons the OEMs are moving to introduce Tier 3 compliant vehicles already. And in that space, we know that when we go out there and look at some platforms that we see in the marketplace with Tier 3 compliant catalytic converter systems on it, we know that those OEMs are spending a whole lot more precious metal PGMs to reached those compliance levels.", "Noah Kaye", "All right.", "Chris Harris", "And so, that clearly says that that regulatory driver is already here and it will build over time and there is people spending a lot of money to comply now and as soon as we can get them comfortable with our preliminary test results and fully engaged, we need to find ways to accelerate past the commercialization, so we can reduce those bills that have already gone up for them soon or rather than later.", "Noah Kaye", "Okay, that\u2019s great context. Thanks so much.", "Chris Harris", "Thank you, [Indiscernible].", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Duane Roberts of SH Fund. Your line is open.", "Duane Roberts", "All of my questions have been answered, thank you.", "Chris Harris", "All right, thank you, Duane. So just some on clarity on Ian Gilson\u2019s question on prepaid, it was regulated to mark on our Canadian income tax, if you there is an offset in income taxes payable. That\u2019s the biggest movement in prepaid, so\u2026", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Marc Franklin of Wells Fargo Advisors. Your line is open.", "Marc Franklin", "Yeah, hi, guys, I\u2019m doing to this situation and I\u2019ve been, the business sounds very exciting, I\u2019m just trying to get caught up on your financials ability, your ability to finance the business going forward and so that we could be assured of that because the creditors won\u2019t reap benefit of this, all these one of the things you\u2019ve created, can you give me some color on financial outlook?", "David Shea", "Well, it\u2019s safe to say, we\u2019ll look at how we can accelerate the commercialization and the penetration of the technology for broader market acceptance and we will look at financing strategies that are consistent with that goal, and it aimed to maximize shareholder value.", "Marc Franklin", "Okay, that\u2019s a good general answer, but do you have to go into certain counsel [ph] there, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not sure, if there\u2019s an expression, but they\u2019re going to\u2026", "David Shea", "Say that again.", "Marc Franklin", "There is - do you might have a fairly immediate need for cash from, well, I can see by based on your balance sheet, so what are you going to do about that?", "David Shea", "So, and if you know, actually, if you look at last year\u2019s financials, we\u2019re actually had going concern last year also.", "Marc Franklin", "Right.", "David Shea", "And I believe the report. So we\u2019re examining all of our options and will raise funds prudently as necessary to getting into fund operations.", "Marc Franklin", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is from [Indiscernible] your line is now open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Chris Harris", "Good morning, Carter.", "Unidentified Analyst", "First question, just kind of following up on kind of the way that the [Indiscernible] portfolio changing as they just more of the OEMs kind of getting compliance at the EPA Tier 3, can you may be talk a little more granularity about the different types of engines that you see of a mixed shift that is going to start evolve and does not - is actually into your current forecast of 2015 and how that might involve into 2016 as you say that people are changing the vehicle line ups in advance of the full implementation and just how that plays into your current expectations for the segment?", "Chris Harris", "It\u2019s very important, because in fact in terms of how restructuring our vehicle test programs now, we\u2019re definitely trying to target these technologies and understand the potential of them on so-called go forward engine designs that would involve smaller engines that are turbocharged directing [ph] out injections that frankly run colder and make catalytic convertors to work harder and make the job emission reduction even more difficult.", "So you have the gathering storm here where for fuel efficiency reasons we\u2019re going to these types of engine designs and make it harder to reduce emissions and meanwhile we have standard saying emission reductions that are going to be required going forward that are going to be sustainably lower 70% to 80% across NOx and hydrocarbons and CO. So to that end, we have to be testing these technologies on those types of engine platforms and as we report results we\u2019ll be sure to educate people about what types of engines were generating those positive results on such that people can triangulate and understand the true potential and power of these technologies for performance and cost savings.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then is there any specific tying to your current forecast or is that really just too early to make that link?", "Chris Harris", "I think it\u2019s too early to make that type of granularity done to engine types, but we certainly know in terms of our dealings with OEMs where they\u2019re headed in some of their engine roadmaps and we\u2019re aligning our programs and our developments in our testing with those roadmaps.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Perfect. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over for closing remarks.", "Chris Harris", "Well, I\u2019d like to thank everybody for the many questions we just heard. Clearly I\u2019m very bullish on this business. I mean we\u2019re achieving momentum right now. If you look at DuraFit, we\u2019ve got a quality of customer base that\u2019s outstanding and we\u2019re adding to it. We just see a quickening of results here and we\u2019re execution focused in terms of what we need to do with DuraFit, what we need to do with these vehicle testing\u2019s and what we need to do to commercialize sooner rather than later some of these new technologies in our powder-to-coat business model.", "So thank you again for the many questions. That was a good exchange. I\u2019d like to before we close here also mention that Dave and I are going to be meeting with investors at several upcoming events. And CDTi will be attending the B. Riley Annual Investor Conference later today. The Cowen Annual Technology Media and Telecom Conference on May 28, and the LD Micro Invitational on June 1. In addition we\u2019ll be meeting with investors in various cities throughout the quarter, if you\u2019re interested in meeting us, please contact our Investor Relations firm LHA whose contact information is in today\u2019s press release.", "So again thank you for the questions.

Sir, please go ahead.", "Pedro Lopez Baldrich", "Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us. By now, you should have a copy of our results press release, which crossed the wire this morning prior to market open. A copy of the release along with other Company information may be found on the Investor page of our website at www.cdti.com.", "Before I turn the call over to Chris Harris, President and Chief Executive Officer of CDTI, I want to emphasize that some of the information you would hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements that are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's results press release and the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factor section of our Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. ", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris.", "Chris Harris", "Thank you, Pedro. Good morning and many thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations and we remain on target with our 2015 technology development and commercialization objectives. We completed initial engine and vehicle testing of our newest technologies that underpin the transformation of CDTI into advanced materials company.", "We also began collaboration with emission control market leader to more quickly commercialize our technologies for the North American aftermarket for light duty replacement catalytic converters. Meanwhile, in the Heavy Duty Diesel particulate filter or DPF replacement market, we added a national distribution channel for DuraFit and expect our growing distribution platform to drive sales in the second half of 2015.", "On a sequential basis, consolidated revenue was $9.9 million, down 4% and gross margins improved to 28% from 27%. As expected, DuraFit EPS and Catalysts revenues were consistent sequentially and we remain on track to achieve our guidance of $5 million in DuraFit sales for the year. As projected, revenue in our Heavy Duty Diesel Systems division has declined due to the wind down of the California diesel retrofit mandate.", "In terms of our near-term commercialization efforts; in our Heavy Duty Diesel Systems division, we continue to aggressively roll out DuraFit, our new cost-effective alternative to OEM replacement filters. In May, we signed an agreement with a national private label to distribute our DuraFit line into the medium and heavy-duty vehicle aftermarket through hundreds of local outlets across North America. Commercial shipments are expected to occur in Q3.", "We continue to pursue the multi-million dollar opportunity for replacement DPFs by adding distribution and commercialization capabilities to promote our aftermarket parts to provide higher levels of quality and value. We recently signed an international distribution agreement with one of our key distributors, Diesel Emissions Service, to distribute DuraFit DPFs and other CDTI products into the medium and heavy-duty vehicle aftermarket in Australia. This distribution agreement represents an opportunity to explore new market for our products with an established distribution partner and reflects the significant progress we have made in penetrating the fast growing replacement filter market.", "To support these efforts, in late July, we welcomed Eric Bippus, as our new Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing. With his extensive automotive leadership experience in global aftermarket expertise, Eric will be a key contributor to the execution of our Durafit strategy and to the commercialization of our new catalyst technologies.", "Turning briefly to the retrofit market, we received a key certification from the Verification of Emission Reduction Technologies Association called VERT for our Purifilter EGR systems. This recognition enables CDTI to address opportunities in South America and other international locations, consistent with our strategy to exploit select retrofit opportunities. We estimate there are more than 60,000 urban transit buses in major South American cities that need DPF retrofitting. So, we'll leverage Purifilter EGR against these opportunities.", "Not only does Purifilter EGR provide outstanding pollution reduction, it incorporates CDTIs zero-PGM DPF and advanced low PGM DOC technologies, enabling approximately $700 in PGM savings per vehicle over comparable retrofit system offerings. While we continue to target specific projects to capitalize on our many government approvals and long track history in Heavy Duty Diesel retrofits, we expect retrofit will contribute less to our total mix of revenue as Durafit sales ramp.", "In our Catalyst division, as anticipated, second quarter OEM sales were similar to the first quarter. The volume of new car catalysts production for Honda was up 6% year-over-year in the second quarter and 8% for the first six months of 2015 when compared to the same periods in 2014. In June, we began partnering with AP Exhaust Technologies to bring to market our latest catalyst technologies, including MPC, BMARS and Spinel across portions of AP's extensive aftermarket catalytic converter product line.", "Our objective is to achieve large scale rapid commercialization of CDTI's advanced Catalyst technologies and our first target is the North American aftermarket for light duty replacement catalytic converters, where according to a May 2015 report from the Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association, during calendar year 2014, well over 2 million aftermarket converters and almost 3 million coated catalyst substrates were sold for aftermarket converter applications in North America.", "Our plan involves a powder-to-coat business model, whereby CDTI sells enabling proprietary catalytic powders to AP, which AP will precision coat onto catalytic converter substrates in its state-of-the-art coating facility. With both companies committed to accelerating the validation and introduction of CDTI's latest cost saving and growth-enabling technologies, we anticipate first orders could occur during the second half of 2015.", "Turning to our accelerating business development campaign, which is underpinned by our recent technology advancements, we released initial vehicle testing results on our Spinel technology and other new proprietary technologies conducted on gasoline direct injection turbocharged and naturally-aspirated engines. Initial test results using the industry-standard federal test procedure indicate our next generation technologies, Spinel, BMARS and SPGM DOC could enable the light and heavy duty vehicle industries to reduce billions of dollars currently spent on PGM's with the value extending into the future as our technology provide a tremendous edge against the run up in prices of costly precious metals.", "We're using industry and regulator recognized aging and drive cycle test protocols that take longer to complete, but generate highly-credible test data for advancing our commercialization with leading OEMs around the world. We utilized certified outside facilities to age our catalyst products prior to testing using OEM testing protocols designed to give a worst case aging effect on the catalyst. Aging the catalyst prior to testing simulates the performance and durability of the catalyst after tens of thousands of miles drive. To summarize our validation activity, Spinel testing data demonstrated a Spinel underfloor catalyst with a 97% less PGM, achieved emissions control performance equivalent to the OEM catalyst.", "Meanwhile, BMARS test results demonstrated that in a typical two catalyst configuration using a close-coupled and an underfloor catalyst of BMARS system with 50% less PGM outperformed the OEM catalysts system on a Buick passenger car. Further demonstrating the NOx reduction power of BMARS, we removed the underfloor catalyst and had a comparable emissions reduction while reducing PGM by approximately 65% overall and eliminating the cost of the second catalyst.", "Also SPGM DOC achieved emission control and system performance comparable to a leading OEM catalyst product while slashing PGM usage by over 80%. We continue with validation testing on close-coupled Spinel catalysts, where even higher temperature durability is required and we expect to report those results later this year.", "Overall, these test results demonstrate breakthroughs in CDTI's advanced materials research program aimed at significantly reducing or eliminating the need for costly PGMs in emission control catalysts. With the fundamental value proposition of our new catalytic materials demonstrated by our recent testing, we are launching a major business development campaign to drive the large-scale, rapid commercialization of our advanced catalyst technologies. We are now able to share the value of our catalytic materials across multiple geographic and product segments, pursuing both short and longer term opportunities.", "To enable rapid commercial inroads, we continue to explore key growth markets for our unique catalyst materials. For example, in markets such as India and China they are finding enforce emissions regulations are tightening significantly. These regulatory drivers will be associated with significant technology upgrades requiring improved catalytic function and increased system complexity. To meet these new standards, current industry catalysts will require greatly increased levels of costly PGM. This cost escalation is a major issue for the OEMs with whome we are in discussions.", "The domestic passenger car market is huge. China alone represented $23 million or 26% of the global light-duty vehicle production in 2014. Short-term sales cycles and regulatory drivers present an excellent opportunity for CDTI. We believe that our breakthrough proprietary clean emissions exhaust technology will dramatically reduce the cost for automakers to attain increasingly stringent clean air standards.", "Based on the progress we are making to validate, optimize and scale our powder-to-coat capability, we expect to secure first orders for enabling catalytic powders in the second half of this year. And beyond our research and testing efforts, we continue to strengthen our patent portfolio. We filed 15 more patents during the second quarter of 2015, bringing this year's total to 20 and we expect more filings to protect our newest technologies.", "In summary, we are executing our 2015 plan and remain very optimistic about the tremendous potential of our advanced materials strategy. Now that we have largely completed the fundamental validation of our technologies, we are now launching a major business development campaign to drive large-scale, rapid commercialization of our technologies with multiple market segments and geographies.", "As we continue advancing the commercialization of our products and solutions and the development of our new technologies, we will keep you updated on our progress. ", "I will now turn the call over to Dave for a detailed review of our Q2 financials. Dave?", "David Shea", "Thank you, Chris. As a reminder, the standard exhaust business which was sold on October 2014 is classified as discontinued operations. For the second quarter of 2015, revenue was $9.9 million compared to $11.7 million in the second quarter of 2014. Heavy Duty Diesel revenue for California and the 49 states was down due to the forecasted decrease in retrofit demand.", "In the second quarter of 2014, CARB's regulatory deadline drove stronger sales in the California retrofit market of 2.8 million compared to 1 million in the second quarter of 2015. Meanwhile, second quarter DuraFit sales of 1 million were comparable to the first quarter of 2015. Our Catalysts revenue was up 9% compared to 2014 second quarter, reflecting growth in new car production volumes for Honda and product mix. Gross profit was 2.8 million compared to 3.8 million and reflecting lower revenue and the launch cost associated with our new DuraFit product line.", "As sales of DuraFit ramp and we gain efficiencies in our supply chain, we expect incremental improvements in margins. Margins were 26% for both the Heavy Duty Diesel and the Catalyst divisions for the second quarter. If we back out the pass-through revenue tied to the ceramic substrates onto which we coat our proprietary catalyst formulations, gross margin for the Catalyst division would rise from 26% to 41% showing the true value-add of our advanced materials and precision coating.", "Total operating expenses were 4.9 million compared to 4.4 million in the second quarter of 2014. Breaking down these operating expenses, SG&A was 3 million compared to 2.9 million, R&D was 1.9 million compared to 1.5 million. R&D expense increased as a result of testing and the development work on our new advanced catalytic materials.", "Operating loss was 2.1 million compared to 0.6 million in the same period last year. Net loss was 2.4 million or $0.16 per share compared to a loss of 1.2 million or $0.10 per share in the same period last year. The weighted average outstanding shares for the second quarter of 2015 were 14.8 million as compared to 12.3 million in the second quarter of 2014. The increase reflects the approximately 2.5 million shares in the $5.1 million offering we conducted in June 2015 and the 1.4 million shares in the $4.4 million offering we conducted in November 2014. At June 30, 2015, we had cash of 6.8 million as compared to 7.2 million at the beginning of the year.", "We are reaffirming our guidance for 2015. We continue to expect revenue between 40 million and 45 million, depending on the timing of DuraFit sales ramp, as well as retrofit projects. This compares to a revenue of 41 million in 2014. We expect gross margins to be at the mid-to-high end of our guidance range, which is between 25% and 28%, approaching the 30% we achieved in 2014. We will continue to assess options to better align our assets with our future vision for the Company as well as review opportunities to improve our balance sheet and financial flexibility to position us for growth.", "With that, I turn the call back over to Chris.", "Chris Harris", "Thank you, Dave. We are proud of our continued progress against the milestones we set at the beginning of the year. We added regional, national and international distribution relationships for DuraFit, positioning us to take advantage for the large market opportunity in the Heavy Duty Diesel replacement markets. Next, we expect to continue adding distribution for DuraFit and ramping sales through the back half of 2015, capturing market share in our effort to become the market leader. Eventually, we expect DuraFit sales to surpass those of our retrofit business and thus return our Heavy Duty Diesel division to growth and profitability.", "We announced significant achievements in our validation testing efforts demonstrating breakthroughs in CDTI's advanced materials research program aimed at significantly reducing or eliminating the need for costly PGMs in emission control catalysts. Based on the progress we're making to validate, optimize and scale our powder-to-coat capability, we expect to secure our first orders for enabling catalytic powders in the second half of this year.", "We are now beginning a large-scale business development campaign to commercialize our products. To wrap up, we remain excited about the tremendous potential of our advanced materials strategy and we look forward to providing you with updates on our continued progress.", "Operator, we're now ready to begin the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Matt Koranda, your line is open.", "Matt Koranda", "Good morning guys. Just wanted to start out on the Catalyst side of things, I know you guys talked about securing your first orders for powder-to-coat in the second half of the year, could you just talk about when that potentially flows through the P&L and the magnitude maybe of the opportunity with AP in particular?", "Chris Harris", "In any significant or material way, it will flow through the P&L in 2016. In terms of how I discussed business development opportunities especially with these near term-- medium term opportunities, I'd like to say that from a resource standpoint we go after things that at least add 10% of incremental revenue to the Catalyst business, add substantially higher margins than where we're at today.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay got it, that\u2019s very helpful. Could you talk about the nature of the discussions that you're having with OEMs now since announcing some of the good results with Spinel and BMARS and your other catalyst technologies? I mean, has the nature of the discussions and the seriousness changed at all? Maybe you could just characterize that for us? And then I've got a follow-up as well.", "Chris Harris", "Clearly, when you demonstrate the fundamental value propositions on vehicles with these industry-recognized drive cycle and aging protocols, it definitely ramps the discussions and the engagement to different levels. And depending on the OEMs and their objectives in terms of focused vehicle programs versus overall major platform -- technology platforms, the pathway in terms of how you engage develops differently. So, there is certain OEMs where we'll be focused in on very specific vehicle programs and there is others where we're looking at more substantial technology platform plays and they may take a little bit longer to realize those.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, got it. And then, if you could talk about, maybe just the pipeline of activity in Catalyst and the discussions that you're having, maybe you could kind of bracket it out for us by -- if you could break it out by geography or maybe by OEM versus the after-market, what is the pipeline of opportunities for Catalyst look like right now, as you see it?", "Chris Harris", "Certainly, in terms of which will lead to revenue and material revenue for us, it's more likely to be in aftermarket and retrofit applications just because the qualification cycles are more streamlined there. But it's very important get on vehicle and demonstrate those and have accretive revenue and gross profit to the business to fund the bigger plays that come later. So from a pipeline standpoint, look forward on aftermarket and retrofit opportunities first.", "In terms of the lay of land in terms of geography, I think we've said before that there is, in certain markets that are more dynamic in -- especially when you go to the India's and China's of the world where it's kind of an ideal opportunity in terms of the transition to the EURO 5 type emission control levels and the need for technology to mitigate against what will be substantial cost escalation for that. So that's an opportunity where, because of the regulatory maturation that's occurring as well as the overall double-digit growth rates in automotive demand and output and the introduction of new models and upgrades to models et cetera, it's a more dynamic environment that will lead to shorter cycles -- sales cycles in terms of qualification and actually commercialization and revenue generation.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, very helpful, Chris. Shifting really quickly to HDD, when we look at DuraFit, it looks like you guys had signed up some nice distribution agreements over the last several months, Maybe you could just try to -- if you could, try to quantify the potential uplift in sales to DuraFit as it pertains to 2016 in particular, be interested to get your take on that?", "Chris Harris", "Yes, clearly our biggest quarter in sales in 2015 should be Q4. Because by then, we will have gone through some of these incubation periods with new customers and new channels and really roll things out. And then 2016 would be a substantial uplift because we'd have the full year impact of that pathway we've taken to build our channels and the sales. So if we're targeting $5 million in 2015, we're looking at very substantial levels above that for 2016.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, got it. Maybe one for David, if I could sneak it in really quickly; for the remainder of the year and just in terms of kind of cash preservation, what are some of the working capital assumptions that we can make? I mean, are you expecting to draw down on inventory from current levels. Just talk about some of the assumptions that you're making at this point in time?", "David Shea", "Yes, so good question Matt. If you look at the first half of the year, cash from operations was about -- $5.1 million is what we consumed. Looking forward into the rest of the year; one, I think we should be seeing a little bit of narrowing of our loss and also as we said, bringing down the -- a little down on the -- that we've got money to get out of inventory, we've got some more money to get out of the AR, which will help bridge us there. Also, if you remember, last year around this time, we did a number of -- completed a number of actions which created some severance liability and those should be running out during this quarter also. So that will also reduce our cash consumption.", "Matt Koranda", "Got it, very helpful guys. I'll jump back in queue.", "Operator", "Thank you our next question comes from Ian Gilson the line is open.", "Ian Gilson", "Good morning gentlemen. Just got a couple of questions here, did you go through why there was a loss in the catalyst system because it's a profit last year, when the increase in revenue came from an established customer and that it must surely be profitable.", "Chris Harris", "So, when we look at really the change in the Catalyst business year-over-year, it's really more a matter of what we've been investing in the development of these new catalytic materials and we had a significant increase in the R&D expenditures in that business to do all testing that we spoke about. So as those return to a more normal level, you'll see the Catalyst return to profitability.", "Ian Gilson", "Okay, but the increase in R&D was less than the reduction in income, so where did the other expenses come from?", "Chris Harris", "So, we had increases in expenses in both R&D and in the Catalyst business and I think all of the increase in R&D-- you also had a shifting of R&D expenses from the Heavy Duty Diesel business into the Catalyst business. So some of what you're seeing within the catalyst business is a shift of resources from the Heavy Duty Diesel business into the Catalyst business.", "Ian Gilson", "On the inventory increase, was that due to the, sort of, seasonal sales pattern during the quarter?", "Chris Harris", "So, the increase in inventory, a couple of things. One, we've been ramping up our DuraFit inventory as we spoke about bringing on this private label arrangement that we did in Q2. We've been building up the inventory to service this channels because you've got a-- once we hit the ground, we want to hit the ground running and be able to deploy a lot of inventory into our customers facilities.", "Ian Gilson", "Okay. So, during the progress of that contract, will you be holding all of the inventory or will you be passing that onto the distributor?", "Chris Harris", "So, it will begin as a direct shipped and then eventually we should be having them hold the inventories.", "Ian Gilson", "That's fine. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from Thomas Boyes, your line is open.", "Thomas Boyes", "Thank you for taking my question, most of actually have been answered. I mean, it's great to see all the progress, obviously, that you've made recently. I kind of want to touch on one thing, hopefully it's not too esoteric. I noticed that, on your website, it said that you were actually not able to sell DuraFit in California. I was actually wondering why that was and if you have sense on when you would be able to be active in that market? Is this something you're looking at?", "Chris Harris", "Yes. California, as you know, through the California Air Resources Board set their own rules in terms of emission control products and certifications et cetera. And the self-verification procedures are in effect outside of California are not recognized by California, Generally, they go to more detailed certification and approval protocols. We've been working closely with the California Air Resources Board to try to fashion a certification approval program for heavy duty aftermarket DPF parts and there's been substantial progress made throughout these years and we started in the third quarter of last year in earnest.", "There will be another, what's called a workshop on August 10 and that will be critical in terms of seeing where they're at on their program and I think their program is nearly final such that it would go in front of the California Air Resources Board for approval in the fourth quarter as best as we know. And that means that there could be a program approved and in motion by the end of the year, such that we think that we could be in line to have first sales in California by mid-2016.", "Thomas Boyes", "Okay, great. I really appreciate it. Thank you very much.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Thanks Thomas.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from Carter Driscoll, your line is open.", "Carter Driscoll", "First question is, maybe it's a little out of the box, but if you look at the major OEM in terms of their-- moving towards Tier 3 emissions, if you could kind of may be informally rank which ones are more open to moving towards those standards ahead of others and why that may be in your opinion? And I've got a couple of follow ups?", "Chris Harris", "Well, I'm not really going to speculate it in terms of ranking customers or potential customers out there but Carter, I think you're totally right. There are early adopters out there and we know who they are, over the years because of the technology play that we've had, we know who will value technology and total costs of ownership and operation well and so we're clearly talking to those players. There is a variety of reasons why they go early.", "Some of them do it for marketing and promotional purposes. There is other complex dealings, I think with fleet balancing rules with the EPA in terms of those that go early on certain models, they get more time etc. The OEMs know those rules and those relationships very well with the regulatory authorities. And so-- but the fact is that already some of the OEMs have introduced Tier 3 compliant models and we know very well that it's been extremely costly from a precious metal standpoint to do that and so there's incentive out there to take advantage of some of our latest technologies sooner rather than later.", "Even if the absolute mandate deadlines are further out in years, already people are spending a lot of money to be compliant and so there is incentive to looking at technologies like ours to deal with this gathering storm of increasingly stringent emission requirements and engine designs that is our smaller engines, turbocharged that are more difficult from an emission control standpoint. And so we're pretty bullish that there is enough in motion already towards Tier 3 that it is a point of engagement for us with some of the key players.", "Carter Driscoll", "Given the recent test you had with the Regal, would it be fair to characterize GM as one of the more-forward thinking OEMs? I realize you don't really want to list necessarily to rank them, but is that a fair characterization?", "Chris Harris", "I think the major automaker players are spending a billion dollars plus on precious metal. So they have tremendous incentive to look at technologies and to take advantage of them.", "Carter Driscoll", "Okay. Shifting gears a little bit. Go back to the DuraFit as a brand that heard obviously, you expectations in second half and into 2016. Is there a -- internally a threshold which you start to see maybe the material costs come down and potentially that impact might be that -- as it ramps, without giving a specific number, can you talk about maybe a magnitude of what the margin impact could be as your expectations for DuraFit begin to ramp and to be able to pull out the cost in the material side?", "Chris Harris", "Yes, I mean, clearly the turning point in terms of where we can really secure efficiencies in the supply chain in some of the highest raw material cost comes later in 2015 turning into 2016 at those levels of sales and when we realize those cost structure I'd say and the exhaust let's say higher cost inventory that's in the pipeline, it will add a few percentage points to the gross profit of that business.", "Carter Driscoll", "That's great. That's very helpful. Then may be kind of a similar question with the agreement with AP Exhaust, is that one of which you could see, again, margin expansion maybe at a similar type of level as that begins to ramp and I realize that that's going to take time, and obviously it's different channel, but is that the same expectation that you should get some level of margin enhancement once that relationship begins to -- really being to produce.", "Chris Harris", "So, there will be some level of margin enhancement. But the one thing to understand is that after market requirements and the amount of precious metal being used in after-market versus some of the new car production across the various OEM platforms is a different ball game. And so you can think about it, when there is less precious metal in play there might be less value pricing possibilities also. So I think we have to be reasonable and understand that there is kind of portfolio approach of margins when you do value pricing around enabling proprietary materials based on where the precious metal is going, but over time, the aftermarket will upgrade itself too as -- it will tighten in terms of its mission requirements. And therefore there will be more value in terms of offsetting usage of precious metal and that will lead to more margin expansion.", "Carter Driscoll", "So it's really more of a characterization under the AP agreement as expanding your distribution channel and your revenues and it is as much of a margin play.", "Chris Harris", "I think it's a very important demonstration of the powder-to-coat business model. It's very important to get these materials on vehicle and to show how durable they are in the field and that will lead to more value that can be extracted in aftermarket applications and it certainly is a bridge and a confidence builder in our outreaches on the OEM sector. ", "Operator", "Thank you our next question comes from Duane Roberts your line is open.", "Duane Roberts", "Thank you. I think I heard you say early in a conference call that you're going to have to look at opportunities to improve your balance sheet. Does that mean that you have to go out and raise additional capital this coming fall?", "David Shea", "So, it's we are looking at all of our options obviously whether that -- and that's obviously one of them. So, when we get there we'll share that with you.", "Duane Roberts", "Okay. The second question I have is when you have a new technology like Spinel coming out, does it take a lot for a manufacturer to use the technology? For example, do they have to retool their plants or anything like that in order to bring this new product online?", "Chris Harris", "From what we've seen so far, the technologies we're inventing and the powder-to-coat business model, what we envision will fit in very well with existing supply chain infrastructure as well as manufacturing and coating infrastructure. So, our experience to-date in terms of some of the equipments that we put our materials on that's located in other coating factories other than what we own had been very positive. So, we think, to your question, it does not require any major tooling and it is not capital intensive to adopt the use of these materials and that we are very compatible with existing supply chain and manufacturing infrastructure.", "Duane Roberts", "Okay thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I'm showing no further questions in the queue. That will conclude today's question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Harris for closing remarks.", "Chris Harris", "Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. Couple of things, coming up next months, we will be participating in the Rodman & Renshaw 17th Annual Global Investment Conference in New York on September 9. Over the course of the third quarter, we will be actively meeting with investors across the country including San Francisco next week. If you are interested in the meeting, please contact LHA, our Investor Relations firm, whose contact information is in today's earnings release.", "Just a couple comments as we wrap up here, I guess that you can tell that we've made substantial progress and I'm very bullish on where CDTI is headed. We've got a really a world-class team of dedicated professionals and they're not only satisfying, in an outstanding way, our current customers but they are executing very well against our technology and priority commercialization initiatives. We really believe we're on track, transforming CDTI into an advanced materials company of large-scale and what that means is that's going to drive shareholder value. So, I really am thankful to all our stakeholders and I appreciate the questions in this call today and I thank everyone for participating.

Ma'am, please begin.", "Becky Herrick", "Thank you, Macy. Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us. By now, you should have received a copy of our press release, which crossed the wire this morning prior to market opened. A copy of the press release along with other Company information may be found on the Investors page of our Web-site at www.cdti.com.", "Before I turn the call over to Matthew Beale, Chief Executive Officer of CDTi, I want to emphasize that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements that are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.", "Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today's results press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew. Matthew, please go ahead.", "Matthew Beale", "Thank you, Becky. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we get into the quarterly review, I'd like to note that my appointment as CEO comes at a time when the market environment has never been more favorable for CDTi's technology. Automotive emissions controls and standards are under intense scrutiny globally. Increasingly stringent standards continue to raise the cost of compliance for industry participants.", "OEM validated improvement solutions that allow the industry to meet or exceed requirements while reducing costs could not be more relevant. CDTi's mission therefore cannot be more relevant. However, as a manufacturer of catalysts, CDTi can only partially fulfil its mission. Its size and scope have necessarily limited its ability to deliver solutions more broadly.", "Despite the universal applicability and recognized innovation to CDTi's low PGM solutions in automotive context, its manufacturing focus and the attended resource allocation implications have limited the Company's capacity to grow and diversify its revenue base.", "CDTi is truly world-class at two things, the material science of catalyst formulations and high-volume light-duty automotive catalyst coating. While the accumulated know-how of being world-class at both of these things is perhaps the Company's most valuable asset, CDTi adds more value to more customers in more markets as a focused pure-play advanced materials technology company.", "We have talked at length in previous calls about our advanced materials focus and powder-to-coat business model. Following an intense investment cycle in new technology, CDTi's resource allocation is now heavily weighted towards market specific applications and commercialization. The strength of our product offering and the quality of our new business pipeline now position the Company to accelerate completion of its business transition.", "This transition will involve significant change on two levels, organization and infrastructure and revenue composition. As it relates to our organization and infrastructure, we are currently finalizing plans to restructure and reposition our operating footprint in support of our strategy. Those plans include initiatives that would result in exiting non-core businesses and externalizing operating activities that are not integral to delivering value for CDTi's customers.", "We believe these steps will have significant positive impact on the ability of the Company to achieve sustainable profitability. We will be providing details of these activities in a series of announcements that will likely begin prior to year-end and be completed before our next earnings call.", "Revenue composition will also change significantly over an 18 to 24-month period. Most notably, we will be winding down our light-duty high-volume catalyst coating activity with the completion of current vehicle programs we have with Honda in the second half of 2017. We will of course continue to pursue business with passenger car OEMs including Honda going forward, but will do so where consistent with our powder-to-coat business model.", "As mentioned above, our advanced materials strategy will allow us to deliver value to more customers in more markets. However, consistent with our transition to a streamlined and focused operation, we have been disciplined in identifying the opportunities we will pursue and that will contribute to a more diversified and growing revenue base.", "Now I'd like to touch briefly on our new business pipeline by a major initiative. The North American aftermarket is a large and highly sophisticated automotive ecosystem that plays to CDTi's strengths. Our ability to deliver OEM validated technology in this channel is a major differentiating factor and is driving the expansion of our commercial pipeline in chosen segments.", "The Heavy Duty Diesel segment, and Class 5-8 trucks in particular, is an attractive market for us and where we have established our DuraFit branded DPF and soon-to-be launched DOC products is a technology and quality leader in the OEM replacement market. As mentioned in a recent press release, we believe this segment offers a total market opportunity in the realm of $450 million.", "Thus far in 2015, we have rolled out a multichannel distribution network and expect to meet our initial revenue targets. Notable in this regard is our recent distribution agreement with PACCAR, a heavy duty market leader under the Peterbilt and Kenworth brands. We will expand our distribution network further in coming months and believe we have created the foundation for a revenue stream that can multiply over the near term, with evidence of this trajectory emerging during the course of 2016.", "We're also targeting the light-duty OEM replacement market where we can deliver OEM caliber technology and significant PGM savings to exhaust manufacturers. Increasing adoption of CARB standards outside of California and the PGM loadings necessary for compliance creates a highly favorable environment for application of our technology. This is a large and vibrant market of over 2 million exhaust systems per year.", "In the CARB compliance segment, the product segment, where our technology is most relevant, is growing faster than the overall market. We are addressing this opportunity through our collaboration with major North American exhaust manufactures including AP Exhaust.", "Our BMARS technology delivered in powder-to-coat form complements our partners' manufacturing expertise in this segment. Based on our product development and certification timelines, we expect revenue visibility from this market to grow throughout 2016.", "In India, we are engaged in discussion with potential OEM partners regarding deployment of our SPGM DOC technology for commercial vehicles on a powder-to-coat basis. This is a large and rapidly growing market of approximately 500,000 vehicles. Our ability to provide low PGM solutions that support the transition from domestic emissions standard BS3 to BS4 in 2016 creates a fertile market for our technology.", "We are currently performing initial vehicle testing and expect to provide more color regarding this market opportunity in the coming months. We would anticipate initial revenue visibility in the latter part of 2016. Longer-term, we see a significant powder-to-coat opportunity at the 3 million vehicle per year OEM passenger car level. The commercial vehicle initiative currently underway is an important stepping stone.", "In China, we are in advanced discussions with powder-to-coat customers in the Heavy Duty Diesel segment. We see ample opportunity to deploy our SPGM technology in a market that produces approximately 1 million heavy-duty engines per year. Leveraging our success in this market, we obviously perceive enormous long-term potential in serving the 20 million vehicles per year passenger car market through our powder-to-coat strategy. In this segment, the largest passenger car market in the world, we have initiated vehicle testing with a domestic OEM on a popular light-duty model and we'll report progress in coming months.", "Last but not least, and although we will no longer pursue high-volume light duty catalyst coating opportunities, we will continue to work with leading global OEMs and their suppliers to deliver our technology through our powder-to-coat capability. Our long-standing relationships and history of innovation positions us very nicely to transition seamlessly from Tier 1 supplier to technology partner.", "To summarize, we expect to transform our revenue base over the next 18 to 24 months while streamlining our operations around a powder-to-coat focused business model. That transformation will gain increasing visibility during the course of 2016. Longer-term, we perceive enormous incremental revenue potential as a provider of next-generation low PGM catalyst formulations for the global passenger car market. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.", "I will now turn the call over to Dave for a detailed review of our Q3 financials. Dave?", "David E. Shea", "Thank you, Matthew. As a reminder, the standard exhaust business which was sold on October 2014 is classified as discontinued operations. For the third quarter of 2015, revenue was $9.8 million compared to $9.3 million in the third quarter of 2014. DuraFit sales were $1.7 million for the third quarter as compared to $0.1 million for the same period last year. We remain on target to meet our goal of $5 million of DuraFit sales in 2015. Retrofit sales were $0.6 million as compared to $1.7 million last year as retrofit sales continued to decline.", "Catalyst revenue was $6.7 million, up 8% compared to the $6.2 million in the third quarter of 2014. The increase reflects growth in new car production volumes for Honda and product mix. Gross profit was 25% compared to 31%, reflecting the launch cost associated with our new DuraFit product line. As DuraFit sales ramp and we gain efficiencies in our supply chain, we expect incremental improvements in the margins. Margins were 20% for the Heavy Duty Diesel and 27% for the Catalyst division for the third quarter of 2015.", "If we back out the pass-through revenue tied to ceramic substrates onto which we coat our proprietary catalyst formulations, gross margins for the Catalyst division would rise from 27% to 43%, showing the true value add of our advanced materials and precision coating.", "Total operating expenses were $5.3 million for each period. Breaking down the operating expenses, SG&A was $3 million compared to $2.7 million, reflecting higher payroll related and consulting costs as we pursue new business opportunities. R&D was $2.3 million compared to $1.8 million. R&D expense increased as a result of testing and development work on new advanced catalytic materials. Severance and other charges were $0.8 million in the prior year quarter.", "Operating loss was $2.9 million compared to $2.4 million in the same period last year. Net loss was $2.2 million or $0.13 per share compared to a loss of $1.6 million or $0.13 per share in the same period last year. The weighted average outstanding shares for the third quarter 2015 were 16.8 million, as compared to 12.4 million in the third quarter of 2014. The increase reflects the approximately 2.5 million shares in the $5.1 million offering we conducted in June of 2015 and the 1.4 million shares in the $4.4 million offering we conducted in November of 2014.", "At September 30, 2015, we had cash of $3 million as compared to $7.2 million at the beginning of the year. Subsequent to quarter end, we amended our loan agreement with Kanis SA to extend the maturity dates from October 1, 2016 to October 1, 2018. This provides for greater flexibility as we execute on our growth strategy.", "We are reaffirming our annual guidance for 2015. We continue to expect revenue between $40 million and $45 million. This compares to the $41 million in 2014. We expect gross margin to be at the mid to high end of our guidance range, which is between 25% and 28%. As Matthew mentioned, we are assessing several opportunities to better align our business with our goal of profitable growth.", "With that, I turn the call back over to Matthew.", "Matthew Beale", "Thanks Dave. I have been in my new role with CDTi for three weeks now, but clearly perceive an organization excited to accelerate its strategic and operational transformation. Once completed, the potential to leverage the Company's unique technology across applications and geographic markets that [indiscernible] the manufacturer is enormous. Thank you for your time and interest and we look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. Now we'd like to turn the call over to operator please for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Koranda from Roth Capital Partners. Your line is open.", "Matt Koranda", "Just wanted to start out with guidance. Wanted to assess your confidence level and the revenue projecting you guys have. I think the midpoint of your guidance implies about $12.5 million in revenues in Q4, which looks like a little bit over $2 million better than your best quarter this year. Maybe you could just run through the assumptions for us and puts and takes there?", "David E. Shea", "So as far as our guidance, the range $40 million to $45 million, we're probably a little bit under \u2013 we're to hit the low end or the midpoint, as you talk about. The Catalyst division is expected to run pretty much similar to what we saw in third quarter. I think we'll kind of have a pickup on the Diesel side as we bring DuraFit really up to speed and we start to see the benefit of the PACCAR agreement.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, got it. As regards to DuraFit, I think you may have mentioned but I might have missed it, how much revenue did you have from DuraFit on the quarter?", "David E. Shea", "$1.7 million.", "Matt Koranda", "$1.7 million, okay, got it. And then could you just talk about the warehouse strategy? I know you guys said you opened I think four distribution warehouses to support the rollout of DuraFit. Maybe you could just highlight for us how many do you have in total now? And I guess what are the fixed costs associated with those facilities on an annual basis? I mean is there any significant cost to those, could you help us understand that?", "Matthew Beale", "So first of all we have the four regional distribution warehouses in addition to our own. The warehouses are sitting within the facilities of certain of our distributors. So the fixed cost is not there. It's all a transactional-based arrangement.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, got it. It wasn't clear on that in the release there. And then maybe could you give a little bit more color on the PACCAR agreement, if you could here? I mean are there minimum volumes associated with it? What does pricing look like relative to what you guys had expected and what you put out on the past calls? Maybe a little color there would be helpful.", "Matthew Beale", "So there is no min volume in the agreement. Pricing is similar to what we've talked about in the past.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay. And then one last one on DuraFit there, gross margins I think you guys had called out in DuraFit is creating a drag on the quarter here. Can you just help us understand maybe specifically what those margins were in Q3, and then how should they improve as you guys kind of scale into Q4? And I think the implied revenue for Q4 for DuraFit is probably somewhere north of $2 million. Is that fair to say?", "Matthew Beale", "So from a revenue standpoint, I think you're in the right ballpark there. From the margin standpoint, we really don't want to talk about that in detail from a competitive standpoint, but clearly it's not where it needs to be. But as we ramp up the volume, you look at that product and the single most expensive thing is the substrate, pricing on that is very volume-dependent. As you can see with PACCAR bringing on 600 plus outlets, that's going to lead to some definite acceleration, particularly as we saw in Q3 a doubling of sales, almost a doubling of sales versus the prior quarter. So that's really what's going to help us bring that down.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, got it. Just one last thing for me on the cash management front here. I think you said last quarter, we might start to see a narrowing of loss from cash used in operations, but I think it increased a bit this quarter, and AR and inventory were both uses of cash. I mean when do they start to generate cash, do you think you can do that in Q4 and where are we in terms of cash position year-end?", "David E. Shea", "As far as \u2013 we had big pickups in AR and inventory, about $400,000 in each of those, over the quarter. We had a disproportionate amount of our sales for Q3 at the end of the quarter. And further, we were ramping up the inventory really to start to be able to serve PACCAR and to be able to put inventory out into the warehouse as we talked about earlier.", "Also additionally, when you look at cash usage over the quarter, I want to point out that if you remember back to the Q2 call, we talked about a settlement with Johnson Matthey related to the sale of AUS, and there were $600,000 of cash that was consumed in relation to that. So with that, I think we'll start to see a levelling out of the AR and inventory as we move into the Q4.", "Matthew Beale", "Matt, I'd just add to that. We just talked about in the prepared remarks and obviously in the earnings release, a very significant shift, strategic shift and organizational shift as we go forward that we'll be announcing from between now and the end of the year, now to the next call. That's going to change very much the profile. I think it will be more helpful as we have greater visibility into some of these initiatives and revenue things come online. We need to start looking at cash on a more strategic basis and how it fits into the context of the new strategy. So I think that will be coming online in the coming weeks as well. There will be more inputs.", "Matt Koranda", "Got it, okay. Okay, that's helpful. Maybe if I could on that more specifically, I mean can you just give us a little bit more flavor in terms of what you mean by exiting non-core businesses? I mean it sounded to me like in terms of the businesses that you have on a go forward basis, obviously powder-to-coat model and DuraFit, I mean what's left that's non-core aside from the catalyst coating side of things which potentially is winding down with Honda by the end of 2017 I think you said, so what else is left to monetize there?", "Matthew Beale", "There's a number of smaller lines of business that we have, customer business, some that's winding down. I would highlight obviously the retrofit business is falling into that category. So when we say 'exit', it can be a number of things. It could be, as you mentioned, monetizing. It can be winding down. It can be outsourcing. There's a number of ways to deal with some of those businesses.", "I think the overriding principle here that we're looking for again is to increase focus and to maintain a significant footprint. To support a variety of small businesses is not what we're looking to do. So again, the focus areas that we identified from DuraFit and some of the rollout internationally, we are taking a long hard look at in addition to the business is what we need to do to add value and be successful in those segments. A little bit of an elliptical answer, but I think again with news we'll be forthcoming here in the coming weeks.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, understandable. Thanks for that and congrats, Matthew, on the new position.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rob Brown from Lake Street Capital. Your line is open.", "Robert Brown", "On the AP Exhaust business, could you remind us the timing of that ramp and how that unfolds in 2016?", "Matthew Beale", "Sure. I think it's helpful to think about that also in terms of the broader North American aftermarket. I think we're good at specifics, but it's also \u2013 I think generally that's a market that we're pursuing the aftermarket exhaust business, the three-way catalyst, and we're looking at a variety of partners including AP, and I think that that will continue to gain visibility in 2016.", "You've got an EPA product category and a CARB product category. Probably the former will gain more traction more quickly, mainly as a result of certification processes and some complexity. But overall, that area and the agreement you cite and the collaboration there is what's going to drive our ability to penetrate that market, which is really unexploited right now.", "Robert Brown", "Okay, good. And then maybe could you go into a little more color on the wind-down of catalyst coating business? Do you see that continuing with Honda but under a different manufacturing model or is that to be determined or how does that play out and I guess what does that mean to the Honda business?", "Matthew Beale", "I think we have a number of models that we are currently working on and those go out through the middle of 2017, and we'll continue to provide the level of service and quality that we have and continue to be an integral \u2013 a partner with Honda in pursuing that business. I think after 2017, the second half of 2017, that will not be our area of focus in looking for high-volume light-duty catalyst coating. At that point, our dialog \u2013 and it doesn't start later, it starts now \u2013 with partners such as Honda in that area will focus around what we can deliver under our powder-to-coat strategy.", "I talked about two things that we're really good at. One is the materials science of catalyst formulations. The other is catalyst coating on a high volume level. I think the former is where we truly add value for our customers. The latter, I think we're world-class at doing it but we don't truly add value because we are not global, we can't scale with our customers, we don't have eight plants located strategically around the world.", "Fortunately, there's a number of other companies that are structured to do that and that's their core business. So that gives you a little bit of the context for the shift in the dialog. I think we will \u2013 through the middle of 2017, our current activity will continue. Our dialog in strategic partnership and looking for ways to deliver our technology, which again is why we have the relationships in the first place, will evolve during that time, and again, we see a tremendous opportunity to even be more beneficial to our customers the ability to deliver that technology in powder-to-coat form.", "Robert Brown", "Okay, that's good. And I know you said some of the details would be more forthcoming, but what's sort of your maybe high-level target on cost savings here or what are the strategic shifts sort of due in terms of timed profitability?", "Matthew Beale", "I think it's difficult to be specific. I think we've got a good handle on where we are headed. There's two sides. There's obviously the organization and the cost side, and we will be able I think in coming weeks to provide a lot of color in that direction, the initiatives we're taking and I think the ability to execute those initiatives will be very \u2013 is transparent and clear. On the revenue side, again, as we move to \u2013 as our mix shifts more to a powder-to-coat model, we believe that profitability, at least the marginal profitability is higher, and again will contribute to cash.", "I think both of those things taken together over the next 18 to 24 months will transform that profile. It would be \u2013 I think it's more helpful if we can lay that out in the context of a number of these initiatives, but our desire, the intensity with which we're trying to pursue the profitable growth scenario on a more diversified customer and user market bases, is front and center and there will be two sides of that equation, but I think we'll be able to lay out very clearly that path that we'll be marching down over the next 18 to 24 months.", "Robert Brown", "Okay, great. And my last question here, you did a good job of laying out the India and China opportunities. Maybe on timeline, is there sort of visibility on revenue in 2016, and then does that mean actual revenue following that or maybe give a sense of when you can see actual revenue in those emerging markets?", "Matthew Beale", "I think visibility on revenue and potentially initial revenue is well in 2016. So that's really what we're targeting. One of the beauties of India and some of these other markets is the time to market, the product lifecycle is a lot quicker, and we are able to work together with our OEM partners, many of them integrated in the sense that they have a very integrated supply chain, in that respect we are able to deliver far more quickly technology and implement and be in the market, get through testing, than we are in some other markets.", "There's kind of a theme here that I want to highlight as well, is that you'll notice that we laid out the business that we will be pursuing, and clearly as well the business that we won't be pursuing. And that is driven also by the ability to serve markets that we perceive as being ill-served or not ideally served over the short term and that provides us a chance to really gain traction with the powder-to-coat model. So the initiatives that we've laid out, we think are consistent with that criteria.", "Robert Brown", "Great. Thank you. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Dayal from Rodman & Renshaw. Your line is open.", "Amit Dayal", "On the DuraFit side, are there any distributors who are accounting for a larger portion of sales or expected to do so?", "Matthew Beale", "Could you repeat the question? I'm sorry. On the DuraFit side, are there any distributors that are what? I missed the last part, my apologies.", "Amit Dayal", "That account for maybe a majority of the sales right now and maybe would account for a majority of the sales in the future. I mean I know PACCAR is a big player in this space. How much revenues were generated through them in the past quarter, if any, and what the outlook is in terms of your larger distributors accounting for a larger portion of the DuraFit sales?", "Matthew Beale", "We talked about the multichannel distribution strategy for DuraFit. So you have the OES segment, which is the OEM service part, of which PACCAR would be a good representative of that. You have the independent distributors. And then you also have retail. Kind of in that order would be the way that our target market is segmented in terms of volumes.", "I don't think \u2013 over the short-term here it would be difficult to point to and there's not a lot of historical data as of yet, but I think it would be difficult to point to one segment immediately as representing the lion's share. The OES segment I think is a newer segment and one that we're very excited about the prospects. Currently if you segment the market, that's where the dollars are. So our efforts in that area along with the others are \u2013 I think will provide the most visibility to revenue going forward. We have begun shipments with PACCAR recently over the quarter, if I'm not mistaken, Dave?", "David E. Shea", "So we have begun to ship PACCAR in Q4. There was no shipment to PACCAR in Q3. But we announced it end of September.", "Amit Dayal", "Okay, got it. And in relation to the powder-to-coat business, you guys seem optimistic on that front. Could you give us some color around some of the news flow related items potentially coming up that you highlighted at a higher level? Are these going to be around the actual shipments beginning to say customers like AP Exhaust or are these going to be around new partnerships you're going to be \u2013 you're pursuing and potentially will close on?", "Matthew Beale", "Listen, I think it's all of the above and you've highlighted it nicely. I think all of those initiatives in addition to new arrangements \u2013 we did highlight in the call dialog that we have both in China and in India, again with a very clear powder-to-coat endgame. I think we have mentioned initially that we'll have our first powder-to-coat shipments to a customer by the end of the year and we continue to believe that will happen. So we continue to believe that will be the case. So that's something if you're looking for milestones to look for, that's a good one. And into early 2016, we think there's very solid news flow. We have stretched the powder-to-coat business, some of the initiatives that we're on which are primary, and I think that just reflects our confidence in the ramp and the potential that we are seeing in those focus areas that we identified.", "Amit Dayal", "Got it. Just the last question on your opportunities in India and China. Are you dealing with OEMs directly over there or are you going through any distributors or suppliers to the OEMs?", "Matthew Beale", "We are dealing directly with OEMs. We are also dealing directly with other participants in the catalyst supply chain, if you will. So it's really a top-down and bottom-up strategy, and which we think is critical in gaining awareness of the applications and for finding different ways to apply our technology at different points in the value chain.", "Amit Dayal", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ian Gilson from Zacks Investments. Your line is open.", "Ian Gilson", "A few questions. Why the increase in R&D in the quarter versus prior quarters?", "Matthew Beale", "So that was really working around in vehicle testing related two things like Spinel and some of the other new technologies.", "Ian Gilson", "Okay. I presume that on the end of the Honda business is with the end of the '17 model year, so basically you have six months of business, and that's the first half of 2017 and then nothing in the second half of the [indiscernible] business?", "Matthew Beale", "So the Honda business will be winding down largely in the second half of 2017. There are still some models that we'll be on at that point, but the majority of it will have transitioned off.", "Ian Gilson", "Is that mainly the result of some business in [probably] [ph] '18, because the model years go basically, as I understand it, sort of the building goes from midyear to midyear?", "Matthew Beale", "Correct. So the model year '18 will be launching in the Honda showrooms in September, which means that suppliers will be building parts in June, July for those.", "Ian Gilson", "Okay.", "Matthew Beale", "So we will have some residual coating business in the second half of 2017 but it will be much smaller than our current book of business with Honda.", "Ian Gilson", "Okay. Why did Catalyst year-over-year go down by $700,000, a profit the year ago to a loss current year?", "Matthew Beale", "So driven by two things, one, our margin is a little bit lower basically due to the pass-through cost of the current model versus what we were building last year. So substrate change is driving that. And then the operating expenses in the business were higher, primarily driven by R&D.", "Ian Gilson", "Okay. The revenue from Honda covers some of it I presume. Is that [indiscernible] or are we faced basically with a structural imbalance?", "Matthew Beale", "I think the structural imbalance I don't think is what we'll be faced to. And again, I think there's obviously complete visibility to the revenue that we have from Honda through a complete but very clear visibility or comparability to what the revenue that will happen through the middle of 2017. I think beyond that, again we'll be transitioning with them and other OEM customers to a focus that is more consistent with the powder-to-coat activities. We will transition the organization also, and our infrastructure as we mentioned, to align more closely with that. You need a different sort of coating activity if you're focused on \u2013 as your focus changes to more of a powder-based strategy. So there will be alignment obviously with the new revenue mix.", "Ian Gilson", "Is the powder-to-coat technology or process available across all of your catalyst systems including the new Spinel catalysts?", "Matthew Beale", "Yes, definitely.", "Ian Gilson", "Okay. You mentioned that we had $1.7 million in DuraFit business in the third quarter. Is that the first revenue or was there any in the second quarter?", "David E. Shea", "No, there's been revenue throughout. I think it's a significant increase I think consistent with the ramp we're seeing in the third quarter versus the second quarter.", "Matthew Beale", "Right. Second quarter was $1 million. Third quarter was $1.7 million.", "Ian Gilson", "Okay. So we are looking basically to $3 million to $3.5 million from DuraFit in the fourth quarter?", "Matthew Beale", "No. So the first quarter was $1 million, the second quarter was $1 million, the third quarter was $1.7 million, so we're at $3.7 million through the three quarters.", "Ian Gilson", "Okay. The cost of doing business in India and in China, basically there margins are generally lower, their costs are generally lower, what are they currently using and do you offer a cost advantage?", "Matthew Beale", "Listen, I think the automotive margins globally are very competitive and I think India and China are no exception, but I think that plays to exactly what our strengths are. Again, what we're offering among other things is the ability to reduce the cost of compliance by reducing the weight of PGMs in the overall cost of the catalyst. And that number is a significant portion of the bill of materials or the product cost, if you will, in the heavy-duty market, and as compliance and the standards increase, even in the light-duty space as well. So it's precisely for that reason that we see this opportunity and we're addressing it with the powder-to-coat strategy because it allows us to sell product or work with customers in India and China. We couldn't do that as a manufacturer of catalysts.", "Ian Gilson", "Okay. So you will be shipping powder out of the United States or are you contracting with distributors that will do that for you?", "Matthew Beale", "The progression is likely to follow the path that you just indicated. I think it can be a combination of both. It will be based on the situation that we're looking at.", "Ian Gilson", "How will you price? Will you price that FOB California?", "Matthew Beale", "It will vary by customer, but primarily FOB California.", "Ian Gilson", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Matthew Beale for any closing remarks.", "Matthew Beale", "Thank you very much. Thanks everyone for joining us. We look forward to announcing and reporting on progress in the coming weeks and months and look forward to \u2013 hope you will join us on the next call.

Ma'am, you may begin.", "Becky Herrick", "Thank you, Eric. Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us for the CDTi first-quarter 2016 financial results conference call. By now you should've received a copy of our results press release, which crossed the wire this morning prior to market open. A copy of the press release, along with other Company information, may be found on the investor page of the Company's website at www.cdti.com. If you would like to be added to the distribution list or if you would like additional information about CDTi, you may call LHA at 415-433-3777.", "Before I turn the call over to Matthew Beale, Chief Executive Officer of CDTi, I want to emphasize that some of the information you will hear during management's discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements that are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's results press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factors section of our Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matthew Beale. Matthew?", "Matthew Beale", "Thank you and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. For the first quarter, we continued our focus on accelerating our commercial and operational goals, firmly positioning the Company toward sustainable profitability and long-term growth. We are doing this by successfully launching new products, winning new customers, and entering new geographic markets.", "Today's global market environment provides a significant opportunity for CDTi. As more stringent regulatory changes are implanted in regions such as China and India, CDTi's technology provides a compelling value proposition for large vehicle markets as it significantly reduces platinum group metals content. This resonates strongly with OEMs and other market participants globally as they seek proven, cost-effective solutions for compliance.", "Now I will review our recent progress on capturing this opportunity. Our partner relationships continue to grow. CDTi's agreement with Panasonic exemplifies our strategy to cost-effectively deliver our technology through both value-added manufacturing and our Powder-to-Coat capability. In addition, this relationship provides important validation of our advanced materials technology among industry leaders.", "After teaming with Panasonic to supply our new advanced materials technology for the Chinese heavy-duty on-road and off-road retrofit markets, we began supplying substrates coated with SPGM DOC technology in January. Activity has increased since then and we continue to anticipate a meaningful ramp in volumes during the second half of 2016, reaching a low single-digit million-dollar annual revenue run rate by the end of this year.", "We are working with Panasonic to explore additional projects that integrate our powder technology into their manufacturing process in multiple geographic markets. Based on our current pipeline of commercial dialogue, we expect to add other partnerships during the balance of 2016 that are consistent with this model, a model that plays to CDTi's strengths.", "In February, we entered a distribution agreement for DuraFit with Hino Motors, which is part of the Toyota Group and one of the top medium truck manufacturers in the US. This marks another critical milestone in expanding our North American distribution footprint as CDTi partners with leading OEMs to pursue a key growth market and demonstrates continued commercial momentum in the estimated $450 million OEM replacement market for DPFs and DOCs.", "In addition to our commercial activities, we continue to streamline our cost structure. We took actions in 2015 and into the first quarter of 2016 to adjust our operating footprint to support the execution of our strategy. This included closing our Markham, Ontario, manufacturing facility and outsourcing metal fabrication activities. In the first quarter, we made additional headcount adjustments in line with our focus strategy going forward.", "Also, we have taken important steps to strengthen our capital structure. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we amended our loan agreements with our long-term lender, Kanis S.A., providing us with a mechanism to convert debt into common stock of the Company in the event of a stock offering or a strategic investment. We believe these agreements provide us with an important opportunity to significantly reduce the debt on our balance sheet and achieve a capital structure more consistent with our growth objectives.", "Before I turn the call over to Dave Shea for a discussion of our financials, I'd like to put our Q1 results in their appropriate context. Six months ago, we announced a major strategic and organizational overhaul of CDTi, aimed at achieving sustained profitability and long-term growth. In the intervening period, we have taken very significant steps to execute that plan, which have impacted all levels of the organization and reshaped it based on our mission. We look forward to seeing the benefits of those initiatives as the year progresses.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to David Shea to review the financials.", "David E. Shea", "Thank you, Matthew. For the first quarter of 2016, revenue was $9.7 million compared to $10.3 million in the first quarter of 2015. Catalyst-driven, it was $6.5 million compared to $6.8 million in first quarter 2015 due to reductions in certain niche models.", "Heavy-duty diesel systems revenue was $4.1 million for both quarters, as an increase in DuraFit sales was offset by a decrease in retrofit. $885,000 and $622,000 of intercompany sales from the catalyst division to the heavy-duty diesel systems division were eliminated in consolidation for the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross margin was 28% compared to 27% and margins were 24% for the heavy-duty diesel and 27% for the catalyst division for the first quarter of 2016.", "Total operating expenses were $5.9 million compared to $5.5 million for the first quarter of 2015. Breaking down the operating expenses, SG&A was $3.4 million for both quarters. In the first quarter, decreased expenses resulting from the closure of Markham facility were offset by increases on some key hires in the sales team in the second half of 2015. R&D was $1.7 million compared to $2.1 million. R&D expenses decreased as a result of reduced testing and development work on new advanced catalytic materials as we completed significant fundamental validation during 2015.", "Severance and other charges were $792,000, related to the closure of our Markham, Ontario, manufacturing facility and near zero in the prior-year quarter. Operating loss was $3.2 million compared to $2.7 million in the same period last year. Net loss was $2.8 million or $0.15 per share compared to a loss of $3 million or $0.21 per share in the same period last year. Turning to the balance sheet.", "At March 31, 2015, we had $1.6 million as compared to $3.0 million at December 31, 2015. As Matthew noted, in April, we closed a $2 million loan and amended our existing loan agreement with Kanis S.A. The amended agreement provides CDTi mandatory conversion rights of the aggregate principal balance of $7.5 million into common stock upon the occurrence of a liquidity event, defined as a strategic investment or public stock offering by CDTi. Also in April, we executed a convertible promissory note for $500,000 with one of the Company's directors.", "We are reaffirming our annual guidance for 2016 of revenue between $39 million and $43 million and expect gross margins to be between 27% and 29%. Based on the measures undertaken late in 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016 to reduce our annual fixed cost base, we are targeting to be breakeven on an income before continuing operations basis by the first quarter of 2016.", "In addition, we are evaluating a number of opportunities to fund our next phase of growth, including capital raises, strategic investments, joint ventures, and strategic partnerships. Our intention is to choose the path that minimizes dilution for our shareholders while supporting the Company's growth objectives.", "With that, I turn the call over to Matthew.", "Matthew Beale", "Thank you, Dave. We are accelerating the execution of our strategy to become an advanced materials technology company focused on high-value manufacturing and Powder-to-Coat market opportunities. In the short term, we have concentrated our efforts on pursuing opportunities in fast-growing markets in China, India, and North America that we can serve profitably with our new business model.", "We have added core global partners that value CDTi's full suite of capabilities and will continue to do so in our chosen geographies. We have added top-tier distributors for our DuraFit product line and continue to expect its revenue contribution to reach $10 million in 2016. As our success produce a diversified and growing revenue base and the benefits of our streamlined operating structure take effect, we expect to achieve sustainable profitability.", "With that, operator, we would like to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] and our first question comes from the line of Rob Brown from Lake Street Capital. Your line is now open.", "Robert Brown", "Good morning. Could you update the DuraFit - did you say the DuraFit revenue in the quarter?", "David E. Shea", "$1.2 million.", "Robert Brown", "Okay good, thank you. And then maybe - with DuraFit, do you feel like you've got the description partners in place that you need to grow that? Or do you see more distribution partners coming?", "Matthew Beale", "Just going back to the $1.2 million, I think in addition to the $1.2 million overall, and we look at this as an overall order book, the number was even higher. So we are very pleased with where that is, and as we mentioned, very comfortable with that number of $10 million this year for DuraFit.", "And getting there involves a couple things. I think leveraging the existing wins that we have in the OES channel, the PACCARs and the Hinos that activity is really beginning to strengthen. It takes time to gain penetration in the channel. But there will be some additional, I would expect, distributors added during the year.", "We are not done by a far stretch of adding additional locations. We are now, in the OES channel, at least, now about 1,000. We look for that number to continue to grow and to provide visibility and revenue beyond the $10 million that we are targeting for this year.", "Robert Brown", "Okay, great. And then you talk about your strategy of adding new Powder-to-Coat customers for additional catalyst business. If you could give us an update on sort of your thinking on how that manifests itself and the timing?", "Matthew Beale", "We spent a little bit of time in the prepared remarks talking about Panasonic simply because it's such a blueprint for what we are doing. I think again, we are focused on a core handful of partners that need our full suite of technologies, partners that have global scope or global aspirations and need technology to pursue that opportunity, where there is a strong fit. And Panasonic is a great example.", "We have similar dialogue obviously underway in China, India, and a couple of other geographies that we think are consistent with that model. Being highly articulated relationships that can be commercial, strategic, and operational, it takes time to complete. But we during the balance of 2016, as I think We have always indicated, we expect to provide more color and indeed be able to talk specifically about new partnership in these markets.", "Robert Brown", "Okay, great. Thanks for that overview. And I guess can you provide an update on AP Exhaust, how that business has ramped and where you're at with the AP Exhaust business?", "Matthew Beale", "Yes. We talked a little bit about this on the last call, and frankly, the status hasn't changed. I think all of the industry we are looking, there is an important regulatory aspect to it as relates to carb standards being rolled out, and we are at a state of flux there. That will drive very significantly the opportunity and the value proposition, particularly in the context of a, shall we say, PGM thrifting type of model. So I think the relationship continues to be there. We're looking at opportunities; it's a little bit pending, some regulatory changes. But I think that will evolve in the coming months. We will have much more to say about that.", "Robert Brown", "Thank you. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Boyce from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.", "Thomas Boyce", "Thanks for taking the call or the questions. My first one just had to do with the status of Spinel. Now that vehicle testing is complete, what are the next steps in that process? Is that more of a late-2017 event or how should I think about that?", "Matthew Beale", "It depends how you define event. If event is revenue, yes. I think meaningful revenue is some ways away. If you define it in terms of a path to commercialization and partnership, I think it's happening a lot more quickly. In fact, it is playing out as we speak. With Spinel, the relevance there obviously is across the board. But where it really becomes a blockbuster is in the global OEM arena.", "And so our efforts are focused on that particular subset of the market, where you get into millions of vehicles types of platforms. So having completed that initial phase of testing, we are into much more operational dialogue with a small handful of what we think are the most appropriate partners. We have kind of culled back and we would expect to have more to say about that as the year progresses here.", "Thomas Boyce", "Great. And then just another one. Given kind of the vacillations of SG&A over the past couple quarters, so there is about 35% of revenue this quarter. How should we think about the cadence as we move through the rest of the year? Just trying to get a better handle on that.", "Matthew Beale", "Obviously in our guidance, We have signaled operating profit breakeven. We are targeting that for the fourth quarter and we continue to move in that direction. The first quarter continues to be messy, particularly if you compare to the fourth quarter. You have got the pluses and minuses, there is still severance, and frankly, we were continuing to execute on the cost reductions through our facility, eliminating a - shutting down a facility and some other headcount reductions.", "Those certainly were not visible in the first quarter. I think we have been pretty consistent in talking about the second quarter being where we really expect to begin to see the benefits. And those benefits then in the second and third quarter to get us into kind of an OpEx range, which needs to get down to the $4 million sort of range for us to achieve that operating income profitability. So that's the dynamic we expect.", "Thomas Boyce", "Great. Thank you very much for your time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Dayal from Rodman & Renshaw. Your line is now open.", "Amit Dayal", "Good morning, guys. On the severance charges, are we done with these or should we expect any additional costs from these next few quarters?", "David E. Shea", "There will be some in the following - within Q2. And Q2, we should wrap it up.", "Amit Dayal", "Okay. In regards to the cash position from a working capital perspective, are we comfortable with where we are? You mentioned potential strategic investments. Should we read into that a little bit more than just your commentary?", "Matthew Beale", "I wouldn't read into it. we are pursuing all those avenues. We brought in the $2.5 million in terms of the additional loan, plus our director contribution. I think both of these we think are tremendous votes of confidence in our future and ability to get to cash flow breakeven. I think the feature of being able to convert those signals that very, very clearly. So I think that that's shoring up the near-term liquidity.", "We were able to achieve that. Right now, longer term, obviously our capital structure is not where it needs to be based on our growth aspirations. So part of that, the path to getting the debt off the balance sheet through conversion and other mechanisms, is laid out and before us. So we have the ability to do that and to put in place what's really a definitive capital structure for this Company. And that's really the approach we are taking.", "Amit Dayal", "Understood. And Dave, if you will, gross margins: should we expect 27% to 29% for the remainder of the year in terms of a range?", "David E. Shea", "Yes.", "Amit Dayal", "Okay. Thank you. That's all I have, guys. Thank you so much.", "Matthew Beale", "Thank you.", "Operator", "At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Matthew Beale for any closing remarks.", "Matthew Beale", "Alright, if there is no further question, again, thanks to everyone for joining and your continued support and interest in CDTi.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I'd like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Becky Herrick of LHA. Ma'am, please begin.", "Becky Herrick", "Thank you, Operator. Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us. By now you should've received a copy of our financial results press release, which crossed the wire this morning prior to market open. A copy of the press release, along with other Company information, may be found on the investor page of the Company's website at www.cdti.com. If you like to be added to the distribution list or if you would like additional information about CDTi, you may call LHA at 415-433-3777.", "Speaking on the call today from CDTi are Matthew Beale, Chief Executive Officer, and Tracy Kern, Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Matthew, I'd like to emphasize that some of the information you will hear during management's discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements that are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today's results press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factors section of our Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CDTi does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to CEO, Matthew Beale. Matthew?", "Matthew Beale", "Thank you, Becky. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Since the beginning of 2016, CDTi has made significant commercial and operational progress executing our advanced materials and catalyst business strategy. Our progress continued in the second quarter as we achieved a number of important milestones in establishing sustainable capital and cost structures for the company.", "At the end of June, CDTi addressed what has been a major obstacle to improving our financial foundation by reaching an agreement to convert $8.5 million in debt into the Company's common stock.", "In addition to the transformative impact of this transaction on CDTi's capital structure, it is a testament to our debt holders' confidence in the long term prospectus of the Company. Once completed, the equatization of debt will give us increased flexibility and prioritizing resource allocation to operating activities.", "In related transaction, CDTi received an investment of $1.25 million inside commercial agreements with industry leader Haldor Topsoe A/S. Headquartered in Denmark, Haldor Topsoe is a global organization with production plants, regional offices, and engineering activities all over the world.", "This multifaceted partnership is highly significant for CDTi. In addition to welcoming Haldor Topsoe as one of our larger shareholders, we also began an important commercial relationship in the heavy duty diesel market where CDTi's technology complements their product capabilities and global reach.", "With Haldor Topsoe and Panasonic, we now have important commercial partnerships with global players that are committed to achieving leadership positions in the fast growing heavy duty diesel market and that are equipped to challenge the prevailing industry hierarchy.", "In addition to the balance sheet restructuring, we continued to realign the CDTi organization to support our needs as a technology company, and essentially completed the restructuring of our corporate function with the appointment of Tracy Kern as Chief Financial Officer. Tracy's highly relevant experience and skill set include expertise and process improvement and turnarounds and will be invaluable as we continue our momentum into the second half of the year.", "Overall, our restructuring program is generating the results we anticipated, albeit with some delay with respect to our original time table. While initiatives undertaken to reduce operating expenses are already visible in our Q2 results, we incurred important shutdown and startup costs and experienced some supply chain disruption that impacted DuraFit volumes and margins during the quarter. We will discuss the impact of these delays on our calendar year 2016 financial guidance in a moment.", "Before discussing the market opportunities, I would like to highlight CDTi's unique characteristics that are driving its emergence as an industry technology leader. CDTi's credentials as an ISO/TS tier one supplier to global automotive OEMs represent a set of capabilities and quality level that is comparable only to the large industry players. While it is impractical for CDTi to scale this capability globally, the know-how it represents equips CDTi to act as a supplier of fuel-tested applications of enabling technology.", "CDTi is a recognized leader and innovator in platinum group metal or PGM management. The prevailing catalyst technology is based on using PGM's to lower emissions. In a global environment of increasingly stringent emission standards, PGM usage is set to grow dramatically that's increasing the single largest catalyst cost input.", "CDTi's core competency is centered on meeting emissions requirements with significantly lower levels of PGMs. Our extensive pattern portfolio and applied know-how in this area provide a significant competitive edge.", "It is the combination of our ISO/TS tier one supplier experience and PGM reduction technology that underpinned CDTi's strong position that makes it truly unique. Technology alone is not sufficient. Applied know-how in automotive coating is required to deliver effective applications while reducing PGMs. This differentiation is driving a recent commercial momentum with new customers.", "CDTi's applied technology and unique capabilities align with market trends and other dynamics. Over the near term, CDTi is ideally positioned to partner with two sets of market participants, large global players with aggressive growth aspirations in the automotive emission controls market and domestic players in large internal markets that require technology and know-how to compete with the traditional industry leaders.", "Highly favorable trends in the global automotive market in general and the heavy duty diesel market in particular are driving new entrants and increased competition for traditional OEM suppliers.", "CDTi has successfully positioned itself as a manufacturing and technology partner to strong emerging global players including Panasonic and Haldor Topsoe, they're challenging the established industry order in key growth markets such as China.", "These are relationships that are based on utilizing CDTi's full suite of capabilities and enabling technology from catalyst formulations to coating and associated know-how. In large national markets such as China and India, domestic suppliers are under growing competitive and technological pressure to meet more stringent emissions requirements. In particular, cost effective solutions are a vital need as they attempt to defend their market against global players.", "As a technology and materials supplier with an established pedigree as a Tier 1 coater, CDTi's offering to the domestic supplier segment of the market is without peer. Where a traditional manufacturing focus once defined CDTi as a competitor, our ability to deliver technology in powder form or through licensing arrangements has redefined the Company as a technology partner to other coaters. This change in emphasis has created highly scalable market opportunities in China and India that were previously unreachable.", "Finally, we continue to pursue incremental high-value, low-volume opportunities with existing catalyst customers. Demonstrating the continuity of our strong relationship, Honda selected CDTi to provide catalysts featuring our high-performance Mixed Phase Catalyst or MPC technology for its newly designed 2017 Accord Hybrid model.", "As it relates to CDTi's financial performance in the second quarter, overall revenue was below our expectations due mainly to timing of OEM catalyst shipments and lower-than-expected replacement market volumes. The performance of our DuraFit product line in the second quarter was impacted by supply chain issues resulting from the closure of our Canadian metal fabrication activities with shipments remaining in the same range as in the first quarter.", "While volumes are beginning to increase in the third quarter, this lower than anticipated transition of manufacturing activities during the second quarter has impacted our full-year outlook as Tracy will discuss in a moment.", "On the positive side, we have been receiving higher-than-anticipated ordering volumes from Panasonic in China, as well as in certain segments of the retrofit market. These items underscore the momentum that we believe will become increasingly evident during the second half of 2016.", "And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Tracy Kern who will review the financials.", "Tracy Kern", "Thank you, Matthew. I'm excited to join CDTi at this pivotal time for the Company and be part of its drive toward sustainable profitability and long-term growth.", "Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, CDTi has been transitioning from a niche manufacturer of emissions control solutions for the automotive and heavy duty diesel markets to becoming a technology and advanced materials provider for these markets. During the second quarter of 2016, the transition was completed and we now view our operations as one reportable segment. As such, we have discontinued reporting revenues as two business division segments based on the products it delivers.", "To reflect the progression of our advanced materials and catalyst business strategy, we are now analyzing our business as a single platform focused on delivering products to the markets we are pursuing. Therefore, in the second quarter of 2016, we have begun reporting as a single business unit and will provide revenue by product category.", "For the second quarter of 2016, revenue was $8.4 million compared to $9.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. Coated catalyst revenue was $4.8 million compared to $6.1 million. Coated catalyst revenue is generated from the sales of our high-performance catalysts which reduce emissions from gasoline, diesel and natural gas combustion engines.", "Emission control systems revenue was $2.9 million compared to $3.6 million. Emission control systems revenues are generated from the sale of products in our extensive line of heavy duty applications including DuraFit, OEM replacement diesel particulate filters, or DPFs, and diesel oxidation catalysts, or DOCs, sold through our distribution dealer network and direct sales.", "Technology and advanced materials revenue was $630,000 compared to $183,000. Technology and advanced materials revenue includes licenses and royalties, as well as sales of our advanced materials platform.", "Gross margin was 20% compared to 28%. This variance was driven by costs associated with the shutdown of our Canadian facility and transitioning the manufacturing from that facility to outside parties.", "Total operating expenses were $4.8 million compared to $4.9 million for the second quarter of 2015. Breaking down operating expenses, SG&A was $2.8 million compared to $3 million. R&D was $1.4 million compared to $1.9 million. Severance and other charges were $600,000 for the second quarter of 2016. There were no severance charges in the same period last year.", "Operating loss was $3.1 million compared to $2.1 million in the same period last year. Net income was $1.3 million or $0.35 per share and includes a $2.8 million gain related to the conversion feature of the Kanis S.A. debt. This compares to a loss of $2.4 million or $0.81 per share in the same period last year.", "Turning to the balance sheet, at June 30, 2016 we had cash of $861,000 as compared to $3 million at December 31, 2015. As Matthew noted, to support our future growth we took action to strengthen our financial foundation and improve our capital structure. In July we secured agreements to convert approximately $8.5 million in debt into equity upon shareholder approval and we received a $1.25 million investment from Haldor Topsoe.", "Due to the factors described above we are revising our annual guidance for 2016. We now expect revenues to be at the lower end of our previously indicated range of between $39 million and $43 million. We believe DuraFit will partially offset the decline in legacy retrofit revenue. However, we anticipate its full-year revenue contribution will approximate $7 million due in part to supply chain issues related to the closure of our Canadian facility that Matthew indicated earlier. We expect this to be positively offset by a greater than anticipated revenue ramp from Panasonic related to shipments of our SPGM DOCs.", "Based on the transition costs related to the closure of our Markham facility, we now expect gross profit margin to be between 25% and 27%. We have made progress in reducing our fixed cost base and believe that our normalized quarterly OpEx run rate is approximately $4 million. Based on these assumptions, we now expect to be breakeven on an income from continuing operations basis by the first quarter of 2017.", "With that, I will turn the call back over to Matthew.", "Matthew Beale", "Thank you, Tracy. As the year progresses we will continue to execute our strategy based on the following pillars: capitalize on highly favorable competitive and regulatory trends that favors CDTi in the heavy duty diesel market; pursue long-term partnerships in the global passenger car", "market where CDTi's Spinel technology has truly disruptive potential; focus on North America, China and India where the global automotive opportunity is concentrated and, finally, develop multiple market entry strategies, leveraging CDTi's broad set of capabilities as a supplier of", "technology, materials and selectively manufactured product.", "As CDTi's technology becomes increasingly widespread and reaches the market in diverse formats from coated catalysts, emission control systems, powder and licensing we believe CDTi's low PGM formulations have the potential to become industry-standard components in the multibillion-dollar emissions control supply chain.", "In the meantime, CDTi will seek to capitalize on the significant market opportunity on hand. This includes providing enabling technology to underserved markets at the point of change as well as addressing major markets by supplying emerging global players.", "Well, that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we would like to open the call now for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rob Brown of Lake Street Capital. Your line is open.", "Rob Brown", "Good morning. First, on your DuraFit issues in the quarter, I guess I just wanted to clarify, will that impact Q3 run rates or will Q3 normalize? And maybe just give a little background on what sort of happened there.", "Matthew Beale", "Sure. I think, Q3, we would expect to see the ramp that we had anticipated, albeit probably delayed by a quarter. That's really the way that we're looking at it at this point. In terms of what happened, as you transition operating activities from a location to another, get a vendor, an outsourcing partner up to speed, there just was a number - it took longer, frankly, than we had expected. And for us to get to regime, it's some of the efficiencies that we had hoped to achieve out-of-the-box weren't there. It just took longer, quite honestly.", "Rob Brown", "Okay, understandable. And then on the Panasonic business in China, I think you highlighted it doing better, but could you just give a little more color on what's happening there? Are you seeing that product on more models or are you seeing greater market penetration? Maybe you can help us understand why that business is doing better. And I guess, a follow-on to that, should that continue to ramp at a faster clip?", "Matthew Beale", "I think what we're starting to see in the second half - again our initial thrust there with Panasonic is in the retrofit market, the heavy duty retrofit market. And we are just seeing a lot of the monies that have been allocated are starting to be deployed and business is really picking up. They are doing a great job on the ground with their partners. It's a very, very strong offering. Our DOC technology, again, we think is unique and the value proposition in terms of PGM and cost reduction is extremely meaningful.", "So it's really starting to pick up there. I think we're starting to as the retrofit business begins to ramp a little bit more in the second half, we'd expect that to continue into 2017. As we get into 2017, we would expect to be talking more about OEM type of opportunities, as well.", "So that's really proceeding actually better than expected. So we're very excited about that market. It's just a testament to what's happening in China. It's just a tremendous opportunity.", "Rob Brown", "Okay, good. Thank you. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Osborne of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.", "Jeff Osborne", "Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions for me. I think you mentioned, Matthew, that DuraFit was pretty similar to Q1. Can you just flesh that out a little bit? I think Q1 was about $1.2 million give or take, I'm just trying to get a sense of the ramp to get to the $7 million for the year.", "Matthew Beale", "Yes, it was basically flat, maybe slightly lower than - it was in essence flat with respect to the first quarter.", "Jeff Osborne", "Okay. And then as the outsourcing, similar to Rob's question, but is the outsourcing issues in terms of raw material disruption in supply and getting your new partners, was that resolved on July 1 or was that something that is carrying over into this quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense of the cadence of the gross margin improvement through the year.", "Matthew Beale", "Sure. That I think we're definitely through the issues there. It's always harder to transition an activity. There's some mentality involved, as well, something you've done in-house and then transitioning it out. But we've definitely got the supply chain issues ironed out.", "We've got some new partners, some new suppliers but we're very comfortable going into the third quarter that those issues are behind us. It really took 60 to 90 days longer than we expected, quite frankly.", "Jeff Osborne", "Got it, okay. And then the Panasonic ramp, is it fair to say that DuraFit was down $3 million in the guidance and Panasonic is the other $3 million higher? Or I'm just trying to get a sense of magnitude of things being better than expected there.", "Matthew Beale", "I wouldn't point to one single factor. I think Panasonic is more than anticipated. Some of the retrofit market segments continue to perform. And then there are some other elements of new business opportunities potentially and just higher volumes in general on the catalyst side. But it's not a linear one-for-one Panasonic DuraFit type of equation.", "Jeff Osborne", "Got you. And then just two other questions. One maybe for Tracy. If you could post to your website or put in a 10-Q the historical segmentation would be helpful with the new classification. Is that something you'd be willing to share of what the quarterlies were for 2015, for example, with the new segments?", "Tracy Kern", "Due to the shift in business we're kind of still looking at how we're going to be presenting that. So I will certainly consider it. The Q is coming out a little later today. I think it will give you some more depth.", "Matthew Beale", "And just to add to that, Jeff, if you think about it, the segments that we're reporting, it's very similar, what we're calling coated catalyst is very similar to our catalyst division. What we're calling emission control systems is very similar to what was our heavy duty diesel business.", "We've added a third category there where we see a lot of growth as we transition partners to a Powder-to-Coat model and that's our technology and materials segment.", "So at least on a revenue point of view, it does pretty much track with some very minor exceptions.", "Jeff Osborne", "Okay. And then maybe can you just touch on, Matt, the India market? One, we were hoping to get some kind of news flow there either later this year or early next. Just how are your conversations tracking for that potentially exciting market longer term?", "Matthew Beale", "We are in really final discussions here, and I think we will have during the course of the quarter our expectation is we can be a little more explicit there. But we continue to be extremely bullish on the area. We've identified the right parties to help us be successful that really benefit most from our enabling technology in that market, so I think we're generally on track, and we will look to be a little more explicit in the coming weeks here.", "Jeff Osborne", "Perfect. Look forward to it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Koranda of ROTH Capital. Your line is open.", "Matt Koranda", "Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to, a couple of mine have been covered, but I wanted to cover the Haldor Topsoe agreement that you guys have and just start taking a crack at modeling this for 2017. So can you help us think about the ramp-up and magnitude of revenue contribution from that agreement in 2017 and maybe speak to 2018, as well, if you could?", "Matthew Beale", "Sure. I think we obviously haven't provided multiyear guidance here, Matt, as you know. But I think generally again it's very similar. I think there is an analogy with our relationship with Panasonic potentially and some of the other large heavy duty partners that we have where we have multiple opportunities in terms of initially there's some, a manufacturing opportunity as we currently have with Panasonic. I think longer term there may be a Powder-to-Coat type of opportunity.", "There's others. I would expect the shape of it to be not dissimilar from the sorts of relationships that we're developing. If you talk about the DuraFit types of opportunities, the Panasonic types of opportunities, all of these they have a very similar, I think potentially have a very similar type of rollout and cadence.", "I think I would be the way that I would think about it. And I think you are right to focus on 2017. Given where we are this year I think any contribution potentially in 2016 is unlikely or wouldn't be material, so it's really 2017. I think that things could move along the same lines as say a Panasonic-type of relationship.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then similar to Panasonic, I would assume it's addressing the opportunity in a certain region. I know that Panasonic addresses the China market, but maybe you could touch on if Haldor Topsoe is focusing on a particular end market or region that you're willing to share?", "Matthew Beale", "It's a little early. I think that they are like all, a lot of the global players, really keying on China, India. Obviously we think that North America, together with North America those are the three primary markets. But China, in particular, it's a matter of public record that they've invested a significant amount of capital in a coating operation in China.", "I think it's a very meaningful investment there. So there's a huge commitment to the Chinese market, which I think is vivid. But this is a global company and they are moving very aggressively to become a leader in the heavy duty diesel segment and really challenging the existing order.", "Panasonic is another example of that, we believe. And so we will be, I think that it will become -- those are really the key markets and obviously where we're keying is they are doing exactly the same thing.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay. Last one maybe just Tracy, if you could touch on the pro forma cash balance. I mean, a lot of moving pieces post-Q2, so maybe you can just touch on with the infusion from Haldor Topsoe where cash stands post-Q2.", "Tracy Kern", "The Haldor came in just after the close of the quarter. So the Q will be out a little later today, so you can play with the cash flows if you like. But that - I'm assuming that you're looking at that cash balance at quarter end.", "Matt Koranda", "Right, okay.", "Matthew Beale", "To be clear, that does not reflect the investment. Yes, exactly.", "Matt Koranda", "Okay. I just wanted to make sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] At this time I see no other questions in queue. I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Beale for any closing comments.", "Matthew Beale", "Thank you. We look forward to reporting on progress in the weeks and months ahead and we thank you for your continued support and interest in CDTi. Have a good day.", "Operator"], "Symbol": "Clean Diesel Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:", "Period": "Q22016", "Month": "08", "Year": "2016", "Date": "2016-08-15", "Target": 1}
