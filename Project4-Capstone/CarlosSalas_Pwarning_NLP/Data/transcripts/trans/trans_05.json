All participants will be in listen only mode [Operator Instructions]. After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Higgins. Please go ahead.", "Mike Higgins", "Thank you. Good morning. With me today is Joe Chlapaty, our Chairman and CEO; and Mark Sturgeon, our CFO. On today\u2019s call Joe will summarize our results for the third fiscal quarter, Mark will then provide detail on our financial results for the quarter and a look ahead to the full fiscal year 2015 before we open the call up to your questions.", "I would also like to remind you that we will discuss forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed in our press release and the risk factors identified in our Form S-1 filed with the SEC.", "While we may update forward-looking statements in the future, we disclaim any obligation to do so. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements all of which speak only as of today.", "Lastly the press release we issued earlier this morning is posted on the Investor Relations section of our Web site. A copy of the release has also been included in an 8-K we submitted to the SEC. We will make a replay of this conference call available via webcast on the Company Web site.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe Chlapaty.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, to everyone. Welcome to ADS' third fiscal quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I'd like to thank all of you for joining us this morning. During the third quarter we generated net sales of $278 million, a 6.4% increase compared to the prior year. Our top line growth was driven by continued solid performance in our domestic construction markets for both pipe and Allied Products and improved sales from our international operations.", "For the third quarter we generated growth in our non-residential and residential end markets of 10.4% and 8.8% respectively. We remain encouraged by the strength we are seeing in our core domestic construction markets which we view as sustainable. Our leadership position in the markets we serve allows us to take advantage of this market recovery by driving conversion opportunities from traditional materials as well as upselling our Allied Products.", "Growth in non-residential and residential construction markets offset weakness in our infrastructure and agricultural markets which declined roughly 1% and 5% respectively. As we mentioned last quarter there was a delay in crop planting in the spring which pushed back the fall harvest and ultimately delayed the installation of our products in a number of projects. For two weeks in November severe cold weather conditions occurred in the Midwest and Northeast slowing shipments in all markets and ending the agricultural season in the Northern Midwest ag geographies.", "Weather conditions did improve in December, and as a result sales jumped sharply reflecting a number of projects coming back online. This trend continues into January where we saw strong activity and healthy orders which we expect will continue through the remainder of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. However given the seasonally low sales environments in our fiscal fourth quarter, we do not anticipate capturing all of the sales that were deferred during the remainder of the fiscal year. In other words we simply do not have a long enough run way in the fourth quarter to make up the difference.", "We would anticipate that what we do not capture in the fourth quarter we\u2019ll resume in earnest as we enter the first fiscal quarter of 2016 as seasonal activity resumes. Mark will be reviewing our updated guidance which reflects these dynamics.", "We generated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of 28 million compared to 30 million in the third quarter last year, a decrease of 6%. We faced an unusual situation with respect to resin prices in the quarter which is the main component of our product cost. During the third quarter resin prices increased sharply which drove nearly 14% increase in our raw material cost as compared to the prior year.", "We had anticipated moderation in raw material prices in the quarter but prices for virgin and non-virgin resins spike to record levels due to unforeseen equipment problems and capacity outages with the major resin producers. Beginning in mid December raw martial prices for both virgin and non-virgin resin have steadily declined. This volatility in our in our raw material cost put pressure on our gross margins in the third quarter. That said as we look ahead to the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2016, we believe the outlook for raw material price really is very favorable, as costs moderate and additional resin production capacity begins to come online in late 2015.", "In addition the impact of the improved commodity cost environment for oil began favorably impacting our diesel fuel cost. As you know we maintained a large fleet of over 625 tractor trailers that we used to ship product directly to customers across the country as well as between our own facilities. The rapid decline in diesel prices will help keep freight cost moderated which should positively impact our gross margins.", "Now let me turn to our recently announced acquisition of Ideal Pipe of Canada, a manufacturer of high density polyethylene pipe and related accessories. Through this acquisition we increased the size and scale of our business in Canada while enhancing our manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities. In particular we increased our Canadian manufacturing footprint from two to five facilities in addition to gaining a strong management, field sales and engineering team. Working together we will be able to pursue new and exciting opportunities in the Canadian market and expand our already extensive product and solutions offering for our customers while strengthening our competitive position against manufacturers of concrete, steel and PVC pipe.", "Ideal Pipe of Canada had sales in Canadian dollars of approximately 43 million for the trailing 12 months and EBITDA over the same period of 7.8 million. Given the time we got the transactions close the bulk of the financial impact of this deal will show up in our fiscal 2016 results. Importantly this acquisition also underscores our commitment to a balanced capital allocation strategy that is focused on investing in growth opportunities both organically and through strategic acquisitions, as well as returning cash to our shareholders through a quarterly dividend.", "In summary while volatile resin cost and weather had virtually impacted our performance during the quarter, the underlying fundamentals of our business and markets we serve remain strong. I\u2019m encouraged to see favorable sales trends in January and weather permitting I\u2019m confident we will continue to see momentum throughout the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2016.", "We continue to innovate and lead our industry in both the quality of our products and our ability to deliver unique water management solutions. We believe there are significant opportunities ahead of us to continue delivering above market growth while driving significant operating leverage over time.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark Sturgeon to discuss our financials in more detail as well as provide guidance for the full fiscal year 2015. Mark?", "Mark Sturgeon", "Thank you, Joe. For the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we reported net sales of 278 million an increase of 6.4% or $17 million compared to the prior year period. Pipe revenue increased 6.3% or 19 million to 213 million compared to the third quarter of last year. The increase continues to be driven by domestic growth in our N-12 and our N-12 high performance product lines which offset lower pipe sale in the agricultural markets due to factors Joe mentioned earlier. We also experienced improved pipe sales in both Canada and Mexico.", "International net sales for the third quarter increased 5% or 14% compared to the prior year. Growth was driven by strong sales in the Canadian agricultural markets despite the negative impact of a softening Canadian dollar in the quarter. In Mexico improved public spending and positive sales momentum in our electric conduit product line continued the strengthening of our sales volume during the quarter in Mexico.", "Third quarter Allied product revenue increased 6.6% to 66 million with strong growth in StormTech and Nyloplast as well as other storm water management product lines. Excluding 1.8 million of Allied products sold during the third quarter of last year Allied Product sales increased nearly 6 million or 10.7% this quarter as compared to the prior year sales of continuing products. Gross profit increased 0.6% to $50 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As a percentage of net sales gross profit totaled 18% compared to 19% for the third quarter of last year. Domestic margins were pressured by a 13.6% spike in raw material costs in the quarter as compared to the prior year.", "International margins were hurt by the sharp decline in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar and its negative impact on overall Canadian market selling prices offsetting the higher sales volume. Total selling, general; administrate expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 increased 3.4 million to $39 million. As a percentage of net sales SG&A expenses increased to 13.9% compared to 13.5% for the same period last year. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by higher variable selling expenses, costs related to our secondary offering and investments we made in our field, sales and engineering team to improve our sales coverage with contractors, engineers and distributors.", "Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter totaled 28 million compared to 30 million in the third quarter of last year, a decrease of 6.1%. As a percentage of net sales adjusted EBITDA declined to 10% in the fiscal quarter compared to 11.3% in the year ago period. Interest expense was 4.1 million in the third quarter up slightly versus the prior year. Miscellaneous expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 were negatively impacted by 6.2 million in unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments for changes in the fair value of derivative contracts, primarily diesel fuel hedges, and to lesser extent raw material derivatives.", "Our effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for the first nine months was 36.6% compared to 61.9% in the first nine months of fiscal 2014, 1.9 million of favorable provision to recurring adjustments were realized in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 as to the filing of all our federal and state income tax returns for the prior year.", "Taking all of this into consideration net loss attributable to ADS for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 was a loss of $367,000 compared to a net loss of just over $10 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Net loss per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $0.01 per share based on average weighted shares of 53 million shares of common. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 was $0.03 a share based on a total diluted common shares outstanding of 73.3 million. This was up from a net loss of $0.12 per share in the prior year.", "In terms of capital expenditures CapEx for the third quarter was $5.8 million. For the fiscal year 2015 we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 35 million for the year. We ended up the quarter with long-term debt obligations of just over $326 million. We repaid almost $60 million of long-term debt in the quarter. As of December 31, 2014, our leverage ratio was 2.24 times our trailing 12 month EBITDA.", "Looking forward our highest priority for uses of cash continued focus on supporting growth, primarily investing in our business and making strategic acquisitions to complement our product lines and geographical footprint such as the recently announced Ideal Pipe acquisition Joe talked about earlier.", "In addition on February 4, 2015 our Board of Directors declared a $0.04 a share dividend to all common shareholders and common share equivalents for shareholders of record on March 2, 2015.", "Now for our financial guidance for fiscal 2015 which reflects our views and outlook as of today. Based on current visibility backlog of existing orders and business trends the company updated its financial targets for fiscal year 2015. Net sales for the fiscal 2015 are forecasted to be in a range of 1.185 billion to 1.2 billion while the outlook for adjusted EBITDA has been lower to a range of 156 million to 160 million.", "Let me provide a little more color on the updated top line guidance. As Joe noted earlier we experienced softer conditions in the agricultural market than we\u2019ve previously anticipated. When we initially developed our forecast we assumed relatively flat growth in the agricultural market. As summer work was slower and the harvest delayed due to a wet spring, the cold weather in November slowed both ag and commercial construction work delaying shipments in spite of strong incoming order volume. Fourth quarter volume is expected to be so solid overall but northern markets will be slow until spring breaks sometime in March. The adjustment we made to our net sales guidance reflects these dynamics.", "The lowering of our guidance and adjusted EBITDA directly reflects the negative impact of the spike in raw material prices in the third quarter based on the factors that Joe discussed earlier. The positive impact of recent reductions in raw material prices will be realized beginning in the April to June 2015 quarter.", "Now we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. Operator, please open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Stephen Kim with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "It\u2019s actually John filling in for Steve. First off, I wanted to get an idea, could you maybe help to quantify the level of deferred sales in the agriculture and the infrastructure end markets due to the weather that you stated.", "Mark Sturgeon", "I would probably put that number because we\u2019re having orders that kind of supported where we have anticipated our sales being, that number is probably today in the $20 million to $30 million range and as I think we talked earlier order volume, incoming order volume remains solid.", "Joe Chlapaty", "John this is Joe Chlapaty. During this whole period of October, November and December we continued to take orders in excess of shipments. So our backlog is building, that continued in January and still continues today in February. So order activity, design activity, future sales opportunity as we get into more of a normal weather pattern are very good.", "Stephen Kim", "I was actually muted, it's Steve Kim. So you talked about the fact that you are impacted by ag, and you sort of gave a little bit color on that. I was curious; you also mentioned I thought you said Canada ag actually was pretty decent. I was curious as to what the dynamics in Canada would be different from maybe what you saw in your U.S. agricultural markets and if you could just give a little color on that would be helpful.", "Mark Sturgeon", "I think Stephen, the markets where the harvest was delayed and what that did was it shortened the season before the ground freezes that agricultural contractors can put pipe in. What occurred in early November we lost a couple of weeks that people would be putting pipe in because the temperatures got the highest in the 20s and got down the single-digits. December it warmed up, except up in Dakota and Minnesota where literally they were done for the year. The biggest agricultural markets in Canada are in Ontario, which is basically due east of Michigan and up in Quebec, but those areas remained open. So we were picking up additional volume and compared the prior year when they froze out early, we had a longer drainage season in that particular area.", "Stephen Kim", "And when you talk about recovering business in the spring I would assume that if March actually turns out to be quite warm, you might actually be able to pull that back in earlier and I think you quantified that just now is about 20 million to 30 million, is that all right?", "Joe Chlapaty", "It is. Stephen, part of our problem is when you take a look at ADS's annual performance, if you go from April through October you can pretty much anticipate there is volatility in weather but it tends to balance out. The last five months of the year are so weather dependent March is a very swing month if spring breaks a little bit earlier we\u2019ll pick up business at the end of March, if it doesn't this kind of falls into the next year but that is so difficult to predict.", "Mark Sturgeon", "The other thing Stephen we\u2019ve been talking to people as we talked investors and to yourselves, we had anticipated that when winter occur that the markets in the south and the west and in Mexico would be stronger this year and they are, and everything else other than the situation from a top line standpoint is still as Joe articulated is still -- the trends are still exactly the same.", "Stephen Kim", "And this is just going to be an ongoing thing, you\u2019re going to have this every single year I think it\u2019s important that the people understand that. Turning to the resin costs, I was curious if you could talk a little bit about the spread there or actually the lag, I know there is lag between what you see in the spot market and when that actually impacts your margin. Can you give us a sense for how long that lag is and be a little more specific about what you\u2019re seeing? And maybe give some numbers around the trajectory of those resin prices through the quarter and looking forward.", "Joe Chlapaty", "I\u2019m going to have Mark to help me out here, Stephen but normally it will take us about 90 days to work through the inventory we have, so to speak in storage. Keeping in mind again that as resin has started to drop now to meaningful way of starting in December was our sales period. So you don\u2019t work through your inventory as quickly as you would if you were talking about a reduction in April, May, June or something like that. But roughly a 30 day window will be there. So resin spike at its high point in October, and then modestly went on in November and then started to accelerate as we got into the back half of December and continues today into January.", "The numbers are out there, you can find -- you go to plastics and we'll talk about with base virgin material is down, we\u2019ve had good recovery and relief with our polypropylene which is incorporated into our N-12 product line, and our StormTech product line and the price of non-virgin post consumer material also spiked in November. And I didn\u2019t realized this what happens often times you have a tremendous amount of material comes over from China for the Christmas season toys, gadgets, whatever, at the end of the year they load up and bring back those empty containers with bales non-virgin bales and ship them back over to China, just not to go back empty.", "We had a spike that I didn\u2019t anticipate it jumped up our bale price significantly for about six weeks, its right back down on a normal basis. So as we go forward not the trend the absolute cost that we\u2019re paying today for virgin material, non-virgin material, polypropylene is down significantly from the peak in October.", "Mark Sturgeon", "And if I could just add, I think if you look at upfront what occurred is with -- we're not tied to oil, our raw materials are tied to natural gas. But the whole dramatic movement there has created a lot of turmoil in the commodity markets and unfortunately for us the near-term our price actually spiked up and it went up to record levels and then it held through a good portion of this quarter, and as Joe described since then it\u2019s moved down significantly. Our tactics in this period was we thought the price was too high, so we bought as little as we could but we still have the inventory until we go through that we took a short-term hit to our earnings but we feel that over the next 12 months the net impact of this is if the trends continue it\u2019s going to be very positive for us.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Stephen, one concern I have and I am glad you\u2019re on the phone and perhaps we have some other analysts on. We don\u2019t want to get tied to oil, because oil is not our feedstock it\u2019s natural gas. And that as we were on the road show for the IPO in July, I specifically referenced our optimistic outlook for base virgin cost not because of oil but because of the natural gas phenomena in this country, natural gas now is at or below $3 million per million BTUs and the fact that there was very significant capacity additions coming on within the petrochemical complex, out in the Houston area, that is a fact.", "And when you read about rigs being shutdown and their cutting capital spending, not the petrochemical guys these are multibillion projects that have been permitted, they\u2019re underway and we by the end of calendar 2015 we\u2019ll have new capacity coming on stream and then going forward for the next three years. So the optimism that we see or saw back in July and in December for base virgin cost, I don\u2019t feel as good about today I feel better about. And I think all which had happened with the oil drop is we\u2019ve got some icing on the cake now.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the location of Rob Hampson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rob Hampson", "I have one kind of related question, you guys just provided some really great detail about the resin cost, just kind of two quick related ones are actually. You mentioned that that\u2019s generally down significantly since November. I guess kind of what\u2019s the magnitude of decline? And then secondly as you think about the virgin versus the non-virgin material, right. I would imagine virgin kind of and especially the spot market drops a lot quicker, and then non-virgin kind of follows soon. What\u2019s the lag time in that respect and how long does it take for non-virgin to decline after that? And does it usually decline just as much as the non-virgin?", "Mark Sturgeon", "Your comments there are exactly correct and how those move. At peaks and valleys which we were absolutely at a peak here the non-virgin material will lag a bit it lags at the top two percentage wise they tend to move together, actual cents per pound are different because they\u2019re different price points. But we saw virgin material actually went up to start the quarter, and then it started down in November and its continued down December and in January and as Joe mentioned those numbers have been published in public news and from the ultimate peak they\u2019re down about 15% at the end of January.", "The non-resin cost actually spiked up and stayed high until about mid-December and is now for the reasons Joe mentioned and others they have moved down very significantly along with that. So those tend to move together, the timings are little different but everything right now for the last six weeks is absolutely been moving in the right direction. And assuming that continues and goes at these levels or lower as Joe said it positions us well for the spring.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Rob, one other point there. I think kind of conservative forward looking thinking on just base virgin cost there is an anticipation of further moderation. And until I would say spring and that\u2019s when historically you get seasonality of demand for high density tends to put kind of us for underneath there. But I believe that there is still some modest or moderate dollar movement further to go in the base virgin markets.", "Keeping in mind that we\u2019ve had meaningful recovery reduction in cost in the non-virgin arena and we are expanding our efforts as we\u2019ve talked about on the road show in the incorporation of non-virgin material content very successfully, and we\u2019ve got capital plans and strategy in place to accelerate that.", "Rob Hampson", "And then on the demand side of the equation. When you look at demand trends, I guess what are your thoughts on market share in the quarter? Is there anything to believe that you've lost market share or anything like that or kind of what you\u2019re seeing in that field in that respect?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Not at all, I\u2019ll let Mike Higgins maybe add some color. In fact we continue to believe that our market share continues to grow. We\u2019ve had very, very positive market place reaction this year to our high performance product line and I think after nine months sales of that product line are up very significantly. Percentage wise high double-digits.", "Mike Higgins", "Yes Rob, I would say that we don\u2019t feel that there has been any type of market share erosion on our part. And just the quarter really both the agriculture and construction markets were impacted by the weather. And as Mark mentioned earlier the positive sign that we see strength in markets, continued strength in markets of areas that were hard hit by the recession Florida, other parts of the South, Southwest, California, et cetera we had strong growth in those geographies in the quarter. And those are areas that we\u2019ve really targeted to increase our market share against the traditional materials like concrete, pipe and I think that we continue to do that.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Rob, one other thing that perhaps isn't getting discussed, any detail was that the significant improvement that we\u2019ve experienced starting in December with our operations in Mexico where we had for several years when fighting an approval situation which we successfully re-obtained business dynamics and improvement in margins down there is getting back to some of our historical very strong level. So this bodes well as go forward and our plans in Brazil are operating at a high level of volume and capacity.", "We also feel that the opportunity in Canada although it may appear somewhat modest in this press release provide significant opportunity to grow our market share up there. And there are significant synergies that will benefit both companies from a production and material cost and delivery standpoint.", "Rob Hampson", "And did you gain any Allied products with Ideal Pipe acquisition, any additional Allied products?", "Mark Sturgeon", "This is Mark. The one the potential synergies we have is Ideal has a very solid sales and distribution base up there and we are going to provide our broad product line of Allied products across there. They do have some products lines, we currently do not sell in the U.S. and we\u2019re going to look to leverage those products as we have with several other acquisitions. And there is upside to take some of their more pipe products and sell them in new markets in the U.S.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Bob Wetenhall", "I wanted to ask you guys, you had some -- you booked some mark-to-market losses on the hedges for diesel fuel and raw cost. And I was wondering if those hedges put the other way and turn into a benefit for cogs down the road at some point.", "Mark Sturgeon", "Yes, Bob this is Mark. The bulk of that is tied to diesel fuel hedges. We also have a small amount on polypropylene and as Joe mentioned on polypropylene those costs have come down dramatically we're actually locking in more now to put us in a very favorable cost standpoint going forward.", "On a diesel fuel hedges we\u2019ve had a policy to try to get to close to 50% hedging that we use collars. The price of diesel when oil came down didn\u2019t move as quickly, the index move quickly but since then the cost of our diesel fuel has dropped dramatically. And in months like this we\u2019re closer to 50% hedge, but what that\u2019s implying is we\u2019re going to say what you\u2019re seeing there, times too is what we\u2019re actually going to save in dollars. So we\u2019re going to have to pay 40% roughly of our savings out in these fuel hedges, but our fuel costs are going to go down if they stay at these levels significantly throughout this year.", "Bob Wetenhall", "Just wanted to ask you, I know you guys have been running the company for a couple of decades now. 2008 oil went from 140 per barrel down to $40. How did that impact the P&L and what did you see resin cost, just trying to understand what kind of accrues to Advanced Drainage and also if you have to pass some of the savings on to your customers or you can retain them?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Bob I think you have to look at the current environment a lot differently from what existed in 2008. If you remember oil -- if I am not mistaking oil in 2008 or late 2007 actually peaked at $143 a barrel and the resin cost that we were paying was really interesting just to show you the leverage the chemical companies had, natural gas per million BTUs was $15, per million BTUs. We were paying not too much differently for resin then as we were paying today and not today but in October and November if you can see.", "And in the interim natural gas went from $15 per million BTUs down to 3, and so the cost advantage that domestic producers had has been phenomenal. You say well what happened? Because our cost structure was so different six years ago, seven years ago the petrochemical industry shutdown a lot of capacity because they were losing money. There was a lot of consolidation within the industry, as I said just before we used to buy from Exxon, we used to buy from Mobil, we\u2019re buying from ExxonMobil now, we used to buy from Chevron, we used to buy from Phillips, we buy from Chevron Phillips now, I think you get the pictures.", "So as supply was tightened and cost went down these guys had kind of, I\u2019ll just say right out, kind of an oligopoly there to do what they wanted. What is happening is your greed is a good thing as what was his name in the movie, it brings on capacity. And with the tremendous margins that have been made in the petrochemical industry over the past several years, huge capacity additions are coming on stream. Given where resin was at even though it\u2019s down 15 it may drop another -- whatever. What if it goes down 25%? The margins today at low cost gas even with the capacity coming on, is still a huge, huge return for the petrochemical folks.", "So I don\u2019t see any deterioration in plans for that material to come on stream, we will be able to hold on to a meaningful portion of reduction. But I would be remiss to say that we\u2019re going to penny for penny hold on to all of it, you have some markets that are more price sensitive whether it\u2019s the ag market, the retail market through, the Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s. But as material costs go down we will hold on to that and we will pocket a meaningful portion of the reduction.", "Mark Sturgeon", "And on our store and serve business side, we\u2019re competing primarily with concrete pipe, and a forecast for them after several years of having very low cost and prices they have a lot of cost pressure. And as we said before we tend to price our pipes to compete with theirs, so that\u2019s why we feel more comfortable in those markets that the impact if resin does move down significantly we will be able to hold a much bigger percentage of that, compared to '08 when just construction stopped and it was a whole different situation.", "Joe Chlapaty", "I mean the world almost came to an end seemed like in October of '08, everything stopped and everything just plunged this is a different dynamic. The other thing I'd outline keep the later, but the opportunities for synergy in terms of strategies and material formulations exist very meaningfully in Canada too, so there\u2019s tremendous upside there as we go forward.", "Bob Wetenhall", "Let me just ask kind of don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse into the ground. But just in terms of flow and timing standpoint, it sounds like the spike in resin was an anomaly caused by supply shortages it\u2019s been addressed. You\u2019ve seen a lot weaker resin prices since the second half of December and resin prices continue to move lower and markets increased its buying. And I am just trying to think about going into the calendar year as oppose to your fiscal year. How does this play through with the hedges you have in place? When do those roll off against the higher cost inventory? And when does your inventory turn is, like two months of work in progress and one month of raw material. How should we be thinking about that and when do we really start to see the benefit in the P&L of your lower input cost?", "Mark Sturgeon", "Really by the first of the fiscal year the hedges we had at higher levels for raw materials were all be gone and really because as Joe said January and February slower months you were exactly right. We have a couple of months worth of finished goods and about one month worth of raw material, and we will start seeing the impact of those lower prices in our earnings in the first fiscal quarter in a meaningful way.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Bob we might, if March were a warm month and the spring side really you could see a little bit there, but by April 1, like it\u2019s like we cleansed the pipeline so to speak.", "Bob Wetenhall", "And final question for me. Versus where you were kind of December 31st in terms of profitability and the growth trajectory both because of lower resin costs on the demand side of the equation. Are you more optimistic now based on what you know or less?", "Joe Chlapaty", "More optimistic for next year. Bob, you've noticed now since the road show in July I was always confident that number one we were industrial growth company, we're a conversion story. We have a huge market position. We always felt that resin with some point was going to turn in our favor. Resin went up for two years straight month after month after month, at some point it had to break. We didn\u2019t anticipate what has happened in terms of the magnitude of the decline. We always felt it would go down but not at the rate it does. I was very confident July 25th, I\u2019m much more confident today.", "Operator", "The next question is a follow up from Stephen Kim with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Kim", "I just had a quick question. You guys said that, I think when you gave your guidance if we were to adjust the top line guidance talking about. If we adjusted that for 20 million to 30 million of sort of the impact from this weather issue, it would still leave you shy of I think your prior guidance at the top end by about 20 million to 30 million. So it\u2019s like you\u2019re lowering the top end the revenue guidance by about 20 million to 30 million even if you would adjust it for the 20 million to 30 million headwind from the weather impact. So I want to make sure I have that right.", "And then I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what that is, particularly in light of the fact that your numbers today I would think would benefit from the Canadian acquisition you just made.", "Mark Sturgeon", "Yes. In terms of the last thing you said the Canadian acquisition; we just made that right at the end of January, February and March are very slow month. Joe and I were up there on Monday I mean there is two feet of snow on first ground in Ontario and Quebec is colder and there are other operations in Manitoba, you wouldn\u2019t want to go there, it's brutally cold. We will start seeing the impact of that really any material amount starting in April.", "In terms of the full year we were down in the first six months about 5% in the agricultural markets based on less summer work and a little weaker market, because the crop prices, other things that we\u2019ve talked previously. And then in our international markets specifically in Mexico things have gotten as Joe said very busy there, but for the first several months of the year they were slower. So that\u2019s picking up now. And we also had a currency situation in Canada where the dollars of the sales while sales were up; the weakening of the currency there on a U.S. dollar basis makes the sales look lower than they were based on the volume.", "So when you add all these little pieces, it\u2019s not really on the commercial side, it\u2019s on the big growth factors we\u2019ve laid out to everyone of non-residential growth which is half of our growth, half of our sales residential and we\u2019ve had a very good year on infrastructure. It\u2019s been primarily ag and a slow start to international markets which again today have picked up quite a bit.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jon Evans with JWEST LLC. Please go ahead.", "Jon Evans", "Can you talk a little bit about you alluded to your Mexican plant and that basically is starting to run better et cetera, because of the currency issues there is that a big advantage? Do you ship that product back into the U.S. and because of the pace of devaluation should that have positive ramification for your growth?", "Joe Chlapaty", "No, we have four manufacturing facilities in the joint venture in Mexico and those are producing for the local market. Infrastructure spending is increasing in Mexico the government funds a lot of this and had withheld those funds for significant a lot amount of time. But again as I said we had to work through an approval situation down there. The business dynamics and the prospects for accelerated growth in sales revenue looking out the next several years there is very positive and we are currently experiencing that. Our Mexican operations had a calendar year and the December sales are very good, January sales are strong. And we look for that to continue for the foreseeable future, but there really isn\u2019t a play there in terms of the ability to shift product back into the U.S.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Joe Chalpaty for closing remarks. Please go ahead.", "Joe Chlapaty", "As we move forward, we remain focused on our strategic growth initiatives and execution in gaining market share from traditional materials and taking full advantage of recovering end markets. We are confident that we are well positioned to continue delivering above market growth, as well as operating leverage over time.", "We\u2019ve been public for six months and I get all kinds of guidance, there is probably attorneys on the phone here they\u2019re going to get mad at me. But we were said, damn you guys you\u2019re volatile but you got to have consistency. All I can do is paraphrase Aaron Rodgers in September, and the Packers have lost the first two or three games, Aaron\u2019s response to the public was relax, things are good.

On today\u2019s call, Joe will summarize our results for the full fiscal quarter 2015and provide a look ahead into 2016.

Welcome to ADS\u2019 fourth fiscal quarter and full year 2015 earnings conference call. We\u2019d like to thank all of you for joining us this morning.", "Let me begin by saying how proud I\u2019m of all that we achieved throughout fiscal year 2015. These accomplishments include completing our initial public offering and listing on the New York Stock Exchange, executing a follow-on public offering in December for an additional 10 million shares, acquiring ideal pipe, which increased the size and scale of our business in Canada, while enhancing our manufacturing, marketing, and distribution footprint and capabilities, and initiated a quarterly dividend, this will provide shareholders a steady return of capital over time.", "Importantly, we generated solid performance for the year, continuing our track record of organic revenue growth and healthy EBITDA. For the fiscal year 2015, we generated net sales growth of 10.2% to $1.180 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $154 million. Our results were driven by continued execution against our multi-pronged growth strategy, solid performance in our domestic construction markets and improving sales in our international operations notably, Mexico in the last six months of our fiscal year.", "As many of you\u2019ve heard me say since going public, the ADS story at its core is one of our conversion, displacing alternative materials like concrete, metal, and PVC pipe with our superior high-density polyethylene and polypropylene pipe. In this area, we have a long history and impressive track record that dates back to our founding in 1966. In fiscal year 2015, we maintained this legacy as we continue to gain market share to material conversion, as evidenced by our outperformance against the construction and markets we serve.", "Specifically, domestic net sales in non-residential grew 15.3% compared to 5% growth in this end market. Sales in residential grew 8.6% compared to 4% for the market, and domestic net sales in infrastructure grew 15.9% compared with 3% market decline. We are very proud of our ability to continue outperforming our end markets, and are confident that we will maintain his track record in fiscal year 2016.", "On the international side of our business, we closed out the year with improving performance and momentum after a slow start. Our Mexican business had a strong second-half of the year driven by improved spending in both the public and private markets, and positive sales momentum in our electric conduit products. In Canada, we had a good year in the agricultural markets, despite the negative impact of the softening Canadian dollar in the second-half of the year.", "Going forward, we feel very good about our competitive position in the market, particularly following our acquisition of Ideal Pipe in Canada in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m pleased to report that the integration of the transaction is progressing well, and we are poised to capture synergies and cross-selling opportunities, as we head into the seasonally stronger spring and summer months. We have solid growth in our fourth quarter, but two temporary headwinds impacted sales and earnings. Harsh winter weather in late February and March forced the delay in construction projects in the eastern half of the United States. These projects were simply delayed until the weather improved. As weather conditions improved in April, we saw a renewal of these deferred projects combined with healthy momentum in construction activity, which we believe positions us well for a strong start to fiscal year 2016.", "Our performance was also impacted by high raw material prices, which were 15.9% higher than the prior year in the fourth quarter. Raw material prices have since dropped sharply from their peak and we anticipate that we will begin to see the benefit of lower raw material costs progressively throughout the fiscal year 2016, now that we have worked through our high cost, higher cost inventory. With these headwinds now behind us, we anticipate fiscal year 2016 to be another solid year for ADS.", "We expect healthy growth in our domestic construction markets, as well as Mexico and Canada. In addition, we also expect to see incremental growth in the above market, growth of all the market as we continue to gain market share from traditional materials in both our domestic and international segments led by N-12 and N-12 HP product lines and the allied products. We also believe the outlook for raw material price really to continue - to continue his - the outlook is to continue as favorable as additional resin production capacity begins to come online in late calendar 2015, improving the supply demand outlook for polyethylene.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark Sturgeon to discuss our fourth quarter financials, as well as provide guidance for fiscal year 2016. Mark?", "Mark Sturgeon", "Thank you, Joe. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we reported net sales of $207 million, an increase of 14%, or $25 million compared to the prior year period. Pipe revenue increased 14.6%, or $20 million to $157 million as compared to $137 million in the fourth quarter of last year.", "Domestic net sales increased $22 million, or 13.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, as compared to the prior year period. The increase in domestic sales was due to continued strong growth in non-residential. Non-residential sales were up 19.4% in the quarter. Infrastructure sales increased 18.1%, and residential market sales increased 8.5%, offsetting a 5.7% decline in the agricultural markets.", "Domestic pipe sales increased $16.5 million, or 14.2% due to continued growth in our N-12 and N-12 HP product offsetting lower single wall sales in the agricultural market. Allied product sales increased $5 million, or 12% in the quarter led by our Nyloplast, StormTech, and other storm water management product lines.", "International sales for the fourth quarter increased $3 million, or 16% compared to the prior year. Growth was driven primarily by improved sales in Mexico, which begun in the third quarter and continued through the fourth quarter. This growth was driven by improved activity in all of our major market segments in Mexico", " Markets in Canada are traditionally slow in the fourth quarter of fiscal year due to cold weather, but they also grew in the quarter with the help of the recent acquisition of the Ideal Pipe brand. Importantly, selling prices were also increased in the quarter in Canada to counter the impact of the weaker Canadian currency, restoring our margins that were negatively impacted by the sharp softening in our fiscal third quarter.", "Gross profit for the fourth quarter increased $13.8 million or 57.9% over the prior year. As a percentage of net sales gross profit totaled 18.3% compared to 13.2% for the fourth quarter of last year. Domestic gross profit increased $12 million or almost 69% to $29.4 million for the quarter, as compared to $17.4 million during the prior year. $11.1 million of this increase was due to the net impact of lower ESOP compensation expenses. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 saw a $14.2 million charge for ESOP compensation expense, primarily due to a special dividend paid in January 2014. This compared to $3.1 million of ESOP compensation expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015.", "The positive impact of our strong sales growth of both pipe and higher margin allied products in our domestic construction markets, were mostly offset by raw material costs, which increased 15.9% as compared to the prior year. Due to purchases - purchase prices of virgin and non-virgin resins spiking sharply in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015. Freight costs for the quarter were 11.1% of domestic net sales, compared to 11.4% in the prior year quarter, helped by continuing lower domestic fuel prices.", "International gross profit increased $1.9 million or 28.8% for the quarter, compared to the prior year. Higher sales volumes in Mexico and to a lesser extent the positive impact from the Ideal acquisition were the primary factors impacting improved performance in the quarter. Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 decreased $6.9 million to $39.8 million. As a percentage of net sales SG&A expenses decreased 19.3% compared to 25.8% for the same period of the prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of a decline in ESOP compensation expense related to the special dividend that I mentioned earlier.", "Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter totaled $16.3 million compared to $16.4 million in the fourth quarter of last year basically flat. As a percentage of net sales adjusted EBITDA declined to 7.9% in the fiscal quarter, compared to 9.1% in the year-ago period. Interest expense for the quarter decreased $700,000 or 15.7% due to a lower average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness and a sharply lower average long-term debt balance.", "Miscellaneous expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 increased $7.8 million over the comparable prior year period. Expenses were impacted due to unfavorable mark-to-market adjustment of $1.3 million for changes in the fair value of derivative contracts related to diesel fuel and to a lesser extent raw materials, $5.6 million currency hedge slots tied to our Ideal acquisition and $900,000 of higher miscellaneous expense compared to the prior year. We have continued in the quarter to strengthen our hedge position for diesel fuel purchases and raw material prices - raw materials that are tied directly to oil feedstocks the lock in sharply lower cost for calendar 2015 and 2016.", "Taking all this into consideration, net loss attributed to ADS for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, with a net loss of $9.9 million compared to a net loss of $12.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Net loss per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $0.19 per share based on average weighted common shares of 53.3 million. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was basically flat, zero per share, based on total diluted common shares outstanding of 73.4 million. This was up from a loss of $0.17 per fully converted share in the prior period.", "In terms of capital expenditures, CapEx for the fourth quarter was $11.2 million. For the full fiscal year 2015, capital expenditures totaled $33 million, slightly below our estimate of $35 million. We ended the quarter with long-term debt obligations of just over $390 million. We repaid over $54 million of long-term debt during fiscal 2015. As of March 31, 2015, our leverage ratio of debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA was 2.6 times within our range of 2 to 3 times.", "Looking forward our highest priority for uses of cash continues to be focused on supporting growth primarily by investing in our business and making strategic acquisitions to complement our product lines and geographical footprint, such as the Ideal Pipe acquisition which was announced in the third quarter completed at the end of January 2015. In addition, our Board of Directors announced an increase in our quarterly dividend of 25% to $0.05 per common stock share to all shareholders of record on June 1, 2015, payable on June 15, 2015.", "Now for our financial guide for fiscal year 2016, based on current visibility, backlog of existing orders and business trends the company expects net sales for the fiscal year to be in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.365 billion, generating adjusted EBITDA of between $190 million to $215 million. Our guidance for fiscal 2016 reflects an economic outlook of anticipated overall domestic and market growth of high-single digits in non-residential, flat to modest growth in infrastructure and total housing starts of $1.1 million to $1.12 million and a decline of mid-single digits in the agricultural market.", "Adjusted EBITDA growth is forecast to be driven by the higher sales volumes increased operating leverage and a more favorable cost environment driven by lower raw material and fuel costs as well as the contribution of a full-year of operating results from our Ideal Pipe acquisition in Canada.", "Now, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. Operator, please open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Stephen Kim of Barclays.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, guys. It\u2019s John actually, filling in for Steve. Just wanted to start on the guidance, just given your sales and EBITDA outlook as well as the operating leverage in the business model, it would seem that you\u2019re taking a pretty conservative approach to the level of raw material benefit that you\u2019re baking into the guide, but you\u2019re using language on the call describing significant declines in the price of raw materials. So maybe if you could quantify the level of raw material deflation that you\u2019re embedding or if you can offer any comments on that?", "Joe Chlapaty", "John, this is Joe Chlapaty. I think, when you look at the guidance that we\u2019ve given, what we\u2019re doing is putting guidance out there that we\u2019re very confident we can achieve. Secondly, you have to look at the historical volatility in resin markets. And the further out you go, the uncertainty that exist with them. I think, the other factor that perhaps gets overlooked sometimes is the fact that of our total consumption of resin, 60% of that is non-virgin, and only 40% of that is virgin. And although both of these raw material streams have moved down, they don\u2019t move down penny for penny.", "So perhaps there\u2019s been a little bit of an over simplification in terms of extrapolating strictly virgin resin reductions throughout the costing and production process. Having said that, we during the height of the oil cost increase last July and high resin markets, were convinced or confident that raw material prices would move lower. Now we felt that way not because of the movement in oil, but the fact that significant capacity was coming onstream in the Houston basin for tremendous capacity additions in ethylene and polyethylene. We believe that will continue, but we have numbers or guidance out there that we believe is prudent, appropriate and achievable.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it. Okay. And on the same topic, can you remind us in fiscal 2015, how many pounds of resin, both virgin and recycled as well as diesel, you purchased?", "Mark Sturgeon", "Yes. This is Mark Sturgeon. We have roughly put out in the marketplace that we are buying about \u00a3800 million of resin, John. And of that, our mix has been around 60% non-virgin, 40% virgin. We may do a little better than that this year. We are working hard to increase the utilization of recycled. In terms of the fuel prices, we\u2019ve kind of given some general numbers, in terms of the amount of gallons of fuel we use. We have in the quarter, we did fix - you put swaps in place the fix some more of our fuel going for the rest of this year and next year.", "We did a similar thing with our one oil-based resin, which is polypropylene, where because of the prices were low, and obviously no guarantee in where oil prices are going to go, we\u2019ve been trying to take advantage of where prices have dropped to and help with the predictability of our earnings. And also onto polypropylene, that the material\u2019s probably has moved the most and so it\u2019s tied directly to oil feedstock compared to polyethylene, which is natural gas. So we\u2019ve locked those in and feel that was prudent for us to do that.", "Stephen Kim", "Got it. Guys, it\u2019s Steve Kim. Thanks very much for all the detail. If I could, Joe or Mark, if I could just follow-up with a question. You gave in the beginning of your remarks some really great color, Joe, about how you were outperforming your end markets. And I think what you said was that residential was up about almost 9% for you versus the market up 4%. But non-resident infrastructure, you outpaced the market by 10% or almost 20% in the case of infrastructure, I believe. I was curious if you could give us a little color as to sort of what drove the relative outperformance in non-resident infrastructure to be so much greater than in residential, if you could talk about that? Is that sort of the usage of the material intensity of plastic?", "Mark Sturgeon", "Well, I would say it\u2019s a continuation of our conversion story, but I think I\u2019d like to focus in a little bit more specifically on that, several years ago we came up with our N-12 high-performance polypropylene product line and this accelerated the opportunities for us and those markets and end users where there was reluctance to use high-density polyethylene. So in certain key markets, Texas would be a great example, we\u2019ve had meaningful increase in penetration because of the high-performance HP which in turn has a pull on effect on our basic polyethylene product line, so I\u2019d say acceptance and conversion and the impact of the HP product line is the key factor driving that performance.", "Joe Chlapaty", "In addition to that, Stephen, I think and you saw it this quarter we were up 19.4% in non-residential despite really, the northern markets got hurt delayed by weather. I think we are also benefiting by the fact that the markets in Florida, the South, Georgia, Carolinas, California, those markets are rebounding and we have picked up share and especially in a state like Florida where a couple of the areas of that state, where polyethylene was not accepted we\u2019ve been able to get approvals there and all those things combined to give us momentum now and going forward.", "Stephen Kim", "In general, would you say that you think residential and hope building was late adopters this trend?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Late adopters of the trend of\u2026", "Stephen Kim", "Towards - moving towards your materials versus concrete?", "Mark Sturgeon", "I would say on in the residential, it depends on the area and it depends on the housing starts. If you go into markets where we have high share, we would have very good acceptance. If you go into certain areas in a Texas or California has a lot of starts but they don\u2019t use a lot of pipe per start. Some of those Las Vegas, the dry areas, you just don\u2019t get as much. I think we\u2019re doing pretty well and as Joe said as we gain more approvals with HP and some of the bigger metro areas, we are doing better in that market.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Stephen, I\u2019ll give you a good example right around Central Ohio, we have several very high growth suburban areas, some of which there had been some reluctance to fully approve our product line even on the residential side with streets et cetera. The HP product line has been a real game changer for us and has opened up opportunities for us kind of throughout the whole geography. So perhaps we might have under anticipated the positive impact of that product line.", "Mark Sturgeon", "And saying that, Stephen we were still up 8.5% to 9% in that market which did outperform the market. One key difference between if you\u2019re comparing residential to non-residential, and non-residential being up more, is our allied products which are a key part of our growth, are concentrated more in non-residential applications. So those sales in that product line help us outperform - have the opportunity to grow sales quicker in that market than we would in residential.", "Stephen Kim", "Okay. Great. Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful and keep up the good work, guys.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Rob Hansen of Deutsche Bank.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Good morning, Rob.", "Rob Hansen", "Good morning, thanks, guys. So I just wanted to ask about the timing of your inventory purchases. They\u2019re obviously up 16% year-over-year in the quarter. Could you talk about when you purchased these materials how much of that is going to be inventory is left that will have an impact on 1Q?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Yes, I would say, as we\u2019ve talked about for quite a while, we roughly have two months\u2019 worth of finished goods and one month of raw materials. When you hit March, because the month of December, January, February are a little slower you might be a little bit more than that, but our resin prices cost increased in late December, they dropped since then, that material as of March 31, is almost all through and we will see our costs drop in April - May will drop more from April and by June, all of it will be through, but it will be - we\u2019re mostly through that inventory as of March 31.", "Rob Hansen", "Okay. And then could you talk about your suppliers\u2019 willingness to - I think in the past, right, you had hedged half of your virgin inventory buys with contracts? And can you just talk about suppliers\u2019 willingness to do that and if you expect to be able to do that at all this year?", "Joe Chlapaty", "In the environment of lower oil prices, but more importantly with the additional capacity coming on stream, beginning late in calendar 2015, the flexibility shown us by the major resin companies has improved, and they\u2019re looking out to calendar 2016 and 2017, and are more willing to work with us going forward in terms of locking in resin costs at different volumes for different periods of time. So that position or that approach to the market has actually improved.", "Mark Sturgeon", "Yes, I think just in addition to what Joe said there - the significant changes that occurred in the commodity prices in late third quarter and fourth quarter everybody, including the large resin companies were kind of trying to see where things were going to and didn\u2019t make - take a lot of positions, but things appear to be getting back to normal. So as Joe said, things were kind of going back to normal.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Rob, maybe one other point, and I don\u2019t want to stick my neck out here, but I think that you will see that the slow by raw materials over the long haul, I mean, you get the period movements up down. I still think this slower raw material is down even from today\u2019s levels, if you go out to 2016, 2017, and 2018. The further out you go, the capacity comes on stream. We are in a period of several years of favorable raw material cost.", "Rob Hansen", "So it seems like, when you think about the - I think your guidance implies around a 200 basis point increase in EBITDA margins here. It seems like most of that would be coming from the input costs, which some people could kind of argue as conservative, but I guess kind of the outlook from here that is kind of - this, would you say that this kind of level of EBITDA margins is kind of the new base and then you should be able to get some operating leverage kind of on top of that longer-term, as well as maybe a little more leverage from lower input costs longer-term, would that be a fair statement?", "Mark Sturgeon", "Yes, the answer is - this is Mark. I would say absolutely yes. I would state and I think we talked about this that our third quarter and fourth quarter were actually adversely impacted by the fact that we had raw - high raw material prices, and we felt that with the way oil and the raw material prices then dropped - it - we\u2019ve had a long history of passing through selling price increases. But in that environment, we felt it would do long-term damage to our customer base if we force that through our customers. So our performance, while it was fine in this quarter, did get hurt, as we get back to what we would view as more normal margins, the leverage we talk about of 50 to 100 basis points with the volume increases of double digits, which we did achieve last year should achieve that and be building from where we forecasted and given guidance for the New Year.", "Rob Hansen", "Got it. Okay. Just one last one, and I\u2019ll hop back in the queue. Just on your - on the top line guidance, I just wanted to - when you plug in kind of the expectations that you\u2019re looking at for the end market - relative to end markets, it\u2019s sort of implies kind of a 2% to 4% price increase. Is that a fair way to think about pricing for this year?", "Mark Sturgeon", "I think in terms of our guidance, we\u2019re assuming relatively flat numbers, I think when we\u2019re throwing up percentages of what our forecast is based off of. Our forecast is based off of that economic end markets. And as Joe talked about, we\u2019ve achieved for several years through market conversion and our new products we are anticipating continuing to outperform that. And therefore that\u2019s the piece that\u2019s probably the 2% to 4% and not selling prices.", "Rob Hansen", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Robert Wetenhall of RBC Capital.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, this is actually Colin [ph] filling in for Bob. So there is a recently announced price increase for polyethylene about $0.05 for the month of May. I was just wondering how you guys are thinking about this if this is going to stick given supply coming online, and then is this baked into your guidance at all?", "Joe Chlapaty", "We were not prognosticators of resin price movements. The latest announcement, I believe has two aspects to it. Number one, the resin companies are trying to desperately create a floor for resin, and number two, what did happen short-term was there have been some significant outages of polyethylene capacity in Europe, which in short-term improve the export opportunities for the major resin suppliers. That is going to be kind of a short-term dynamic. So we don\u2019t believe that going forward, there are significant upward movement in resin cost, might there be a short-term one that balances all the decreases later in the year. It\u2019s too early to say, but as I said before, I believe the trend is downward in raw material costs. I don\u2019t know if that helps you or not?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes, that\u2019s great. Thank you very much. And then on the competition front, since you are seeing lower input costs, have you seen a competition intensify?", "Joe Chlapaty", "We view composition now mainly from the standpoint of the concrete pipe industry. And I\u2019m going to let Mark add some color there.", "Mark Sturgeon", "In terms of, that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019ve talked before where when resin spiked and then came down. We chose to kind of treat our customers as they expect to be treated. And in saying that in the biggest portion of our market, which is the storm sewer business, where all our non-residential, residential, in those markets our competition is concrete pipe, and to a lesser extent steel. Their material prices have moved. You all follow aggregate companies, cement companies, we feel pretty good about, there is no guarantee, but we feel pretty good about pricing there, if resin prices do increase, we\u2019re going to certainly do everything we can to pass that on.", "In the markets where we compete directly with other polyethylene companies, which is primarily agricultural market. There\u2019s always going to be some pressure there. We\u2019ve been trying to encourage people to also follow different indexes. There\u2019s one that\u2019s called recycling markets.net that gives some idea of what the cost of post-consumer bales are. Those can move up and down. We have a cold month in February and March. They don\u2019t collect as much bottles, that comes back on, it comes back down, that will some, those type of cost impacts that market more. But for the most part things seem pretty stable right now and I think there\u2019s a lot to do with the fact that how we handle the market when things started moving significantly.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thank you. And one last question, you\u2019re expecting the continued decline in your agricultural sales. As resi increases, what you expect your long-term end market mix to be and how does this impact your margins?", "Joe Chlapaty", "In terms of agriculture, compared to what we anticipated last year, we thought because the markets had been - we had a very harsh winter the year before. We have project the ag to actually be up some. Obviously you never know where commodity prices are going to go. You never know what where farm incomes going to go. It ended up that ag sales for the year last year declined 5.5% or 5.6%, that was not shared, the market declined. We don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to happen in ag markets. Right now, our ag looks pretty strong, but in coming up weather forecast and the fact that farm income is projected to be down. We thought it was prudent to forecast that would be down in the mid single-digits.", "Over time, our non-residential, residential, and infrastructure markets will become an increasing percentage of our sales. We also think we have great opportunities to grow long-term in our international market. So ag over time, we\u2019ve not projected it to anyone, that\u2019s a growth market, but still very good market, and we\u2019re still very committed to it.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Brian Connors of Boenning & Scattergood.", "Brian Connors", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about kind of the sequential outlook into the first quarter of the fiscal 2016 year. I know you talked a lot about your guidance for all of 2016, but if you go back to your press release in March on your sort of preannouncement, if you will, you talked about project delays impacting 4Q and pushing some orders and demand into the first quarter and yet, it looks like the fourth-quarter numbers came in actually pretty solid, so can you talk about whether there is still that push ahead into the first quarter and if so what the magnitude of that might be?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Well, I would just say, this is Joe, Brian. But I would say this that our business activity right now is very solid. It\u2019s in line with what we have not only forecasted, but internally have budgeted for the year. Where we have seen the biggest renewal on the non-agricultural side is in the Northeast, where there was intense cold weather that slowed down the beginning of the year. We\u2019re off to a solid on plan beginning in April and the so far into May. So we\u2019re on target here.", "And so and you asked specifically while we need to put out specific numbers. The impact that it had was probably been in the range of $25 million or so sales that that would have been in the quarter that got pushed into the - to that in the next fiscal year. The last couple weeks of February and the first week or so of March, the weather was terrible, and they\u2019re just delaying that we can\u2019t - we only have so many trucks and you ship it out. And but it was kind of in that type of range.", "Brian Connors", "Got it. So that number is still intact the end market at $2 5 million?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Right. It would be that business didn\u2019t go away. Those were projects that they were working on and you all saw housing starts and housing starts. We had a lot of people that were started a house in the ground froze and they didn\u2019t do anything for a week. We ship directly to job sites, so the job sites are shutdown, you just - you don\u2019t ship until they unthaw.", "Mark Sturgeon", "Maybe adding some color there, we have quoted historically during our various presentations that the requests for help and design projects giving assistance were made at a very, very strong level, and there has been no diminishment there. As you look at those requests, you can pinpoint the timing, some of those might be requests for late summer, fall, or next year. But the fact is that the level of construction activity currently going forward looks very solid.", "Brian Connors", "Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And my other question I wanted to talk a little bit about the facilities portfolio specifically on two fronts. Number one, the Ideal Pipe acquisition, are there any overlapping facilities, where you have markets that are now covered by multiple facilities where there might need to be any restructuring actions there, or is that all pretty clean from an integration standpoint?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Mark and I are both join in on this. Number one, what was really interesting about the Ideal acquisition was that we really didn\u2019t have significant overlapping locations in fab, where we see the opportunity here in addition to market penetration and cross-selling of products was the fact that we will have a meaningful freight savings because of the locations of the Ideal plants. And in addition, the facilities that we purchased are in an excellent shape and provide us with capacity to bring the Canada some different operations that they didn\u2019t have helping us speed off the conversion and cross-selling of our allied products in addition to meaningful freight savings both in terms of delivery of product and raw materials.", "Mark Sturgeon", "And one thing along that line and I mentioned it, but you should all know this. When we agreed to - that acquisition our board approved and at the time the U.S. dollar purchase price, so that was $50 million. We fixed that price at that point, and the Canadian dollar weakened the next two months before we close. So the $5.6 million currency loss that we had - we got that was a miscellaneous expenses for the quarter was tied specifically to the fact that our Board had approved us for $50 million. We weren\u2019t going to take a risk on currency and we fix that.", "The positive of that was because of the accounting treatment, we get to deduct that for tax purposes. So 40% of that we actually get the cash back quicker than if we had appreciated in tangibles. But as Joe said, we picked up a lot of locations, a lot of equipment, our footprint up there now went from two facilities to five, and we really are encouraged that Canada really has a long-term growth potential. Now we have the footprint in place to do that.", "Brian Connors", "Got it.", "Joe Chlapaty", "The business activity in Canada over the past 45 days has been very strong. And the contribution of that from Ideal - Ideal\u2019s footprint, Ideal sales force is up, I don\u2019t want to stick my neck out, but I think it\u2019s exceeded our expectations.", "Brian Connors", "Got it. And then my other question on the facilities front was as agricultural market has declined, I would imagine there is some facilities in the Midwest that were disproportionate level of sales goes into agriculture. Are there any areas that are operating at very low capacity utilization and any restructuring activity in that respect, or is everything still pretty healthy there?", "Joe Chlapaty", "I believe that, what we have to keep in mind here is that, although on a percentage basis, our sales were down. So the volume - the absolute volume of product we\u2019re selling in the agricultural market is much larger than it was five years ago. And we\u2019re noticing stability. We think we\u2019ve reached a stable point. In fact for the first time in several years, we are having a normal spring. What do you mean by that? Crops are going in on time. What does that mean for us? That means we are going to have an on-time early harvest which is going to help us in fall, which is truly a better ag season than the spring season.", "So we\u2019re not looking at capacity from the standpoint of just sitting idly by. Keeping in mind that the lines that we have in the agricultural markets can be moved to other plants where there are pinch points. And so we don\u2019t believe that we have the need or the desire or the opportunity to be closing facilities. We can be shifting our production capacity to those locations where market demands are more intense.", "Mark Sturgeon", "And in addition to that, those facilities if we have a plant - the agricultural market is a little bit like you need to have an outpost in the area or your competition will come in and do it. So several of our plants in ag areas, their business might be down some 5%, but what is Joe said, if they were running two lines or three manufacturing now they\u2019re running one less. But then we adjust our cost structure to be at that level and can operate we have some plants that run one line and we make quite a bit of money at and we just need to continually focus on what\u2019s the outlook in an kind of ag-only plant and have the cost structure so we make good money at that. So we\u2019re looking at those facilities, but at this point we are not anywhere close to where it would make sense to close the facility.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Keep in mind that we focus on agriculture geographies, but they do have a meaningful amount of non-agricultural business that are produced and shipped from them. We have Fairmont, Minnesota which is serving the Minneapolis market. We have Eagle Grove, Iowa which is serving markets in Des Moines at other geographies. So we have our operations in Buxton, North Dakota that are providing significant capacity in the non-agricultural side, so we have a couple of modest operations whey they\u2019re mainly ag only, but those are small facilities and as I said, we are adjusting where we need to their.", "Brian Connors", "Great. Well, I appreciate the depth of your response. Thanks for your time.", "Operator", "Our next question is a follow-up from Rob Hansen of Deutsche Bank.", "Rob Hansen", "Thanks. Just one other thing; your international gross margin came in at 29.7% I believe, so much higher than the domestic gross margins. What\u2019s driving the delta there? I realize last year it was also much higher as well, but can the domestic gross margins, should that kind of equal out over the course of the year?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Yes, I would say, Rob, we have talked about this for a while, but before, Mexico has recovered nicely. They are kind of a virgin only market, because they are a 12 month a year market, raw materials work through quicker and we think our margins are going to be better there. On a 12 month basis, the margins should be relatively similar.", "Rob Hansen", "Okay. And then, one other question is, I think you mentioned infrastructure being pretty strong this quarter. But you\u2019ve got in your guidance I think flattish for next year. So I think it was a 16% increase in this quarter, so why the big delta there?", "Mark Sturgeon", "Again, that\u2019s what we are anticipating the economic outlook, we actually - our analysis had infrastructure overall economic U.S. market down 3%. We\u2019re saying that\u2019s going to improve to flat, but our sales in that market with HP, sanitary pipe, with some other products we have there and with picking up some highway approvals, we\u2019ve been doing way over what the market is and we\u2019re anticipating continuing that market conversion.", "Rob Hansen", "Got it. Okay. Makes sense. I appreciate it, guys.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Joe Chlapaty, for any closing remarks.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Thank you. In closing I am pleased with our full-year results continued confidence in our future performance as an industrial growth company. Our performance has been and will continue to be driven by our growth strategy, specifically our commitment to capitalizing on market conversion opportunities both domestically and internationally. Our ability to provide completer water management solutions through our allied product offering, and our leadership position in each of our end markets, whose ongoing recovery we are poised to capitalize on. We remain confident in the fundamentals of our business, and believe there are significant opportunities ahead of us to continue delivering above market growth, while driving significant operating leverage over time.", "Thank you again for participating in today\u2019s call and your interest in ADS. I look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months. And due to the Tom Brady situation, we will refrain from any football quarterback analogies this quarter.

Welcome to ADS\u2019 fiscal 2016 earnings conference call. We\u2019d like to thank all of you for joining us this morning. I am pleased to share with you a brief summary of our performance during fiscal 2016. ", "Overall our top line performance this past year was strong, generating 9.3% growth or 6.2% organic growth in net sales to $1.290 billion coming in slightly higher than the updated guidance we provided on our call at the end of March.", "Our performance was especially strong during the second half of the year, reflecting solid execution against our conversion efforts as well as favorable weather conditions in the majority of our end markets. Related to weather specifically we estimate that our fiscal 2016 net sales were favorably impacted by approximately $10 million to $15 million with the majority of this benefit being picked up in the fiscal fourth quarter.", "We also generated adjusted EBITDA of $186 million for the year, which reflects a 29% increase over 2015, and in line with our expectations previously communicated on our call in March. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.4% improved 220 basis points over the prior year driven by our strong top line results, solid operational execution and lower raw material cost. We believe that raw material cost will continue to remain favorable in fiscal 2017 as cost moderate and additional resin production capacity comes online.", "Turning to slide five we once again generated above market growth in fiscal 2016. This is particularly evident in our core construction markets, where we significantly outpaced the market by 600 basis points, growing roughly 11% compared to the estimated market growth of 5%. Our performance was driven primarily by our efforts to gain market share through material conversion as well as exceptionally strong growth in Allied Products, which increased more than 19% compared to the prior year. We also generated strong growth in our HP pipe product line which we anticipate will continue to experience excellent growth in the coming years.", "In summary I am very pleased with our performance in fiscal 2016, which underscores the fact that the fundamentals of our business and end markets remain strong. Going forward we will remain focused on conversion opportunities where we can displace alternative materials like reinforced concrete, corrugated metal and PVC pipe with our superior high density polyethylene and polypropylene pipe. It is this strategy that will continue to enable us to consistently outperform the market.", "Further we anticipate that adjusted EBITDA will continue to trend favorably this year, driven by healthy volumes, higher Allied Product sales and favorable raw material cost. Scott will provide more detail on our guidance in just a moment. Ultimately we feel very good about our position to continue driving above market growth with significant operating leverage overtime.", "Now I will turn the call over to Scott Cottrill to discuss the details of our results this year as well as our fiscal 2017 guidance. Scott?", "Scott Cottrill", "Thank you, Joe. On slide seven we provide a detailed summary of our financial results for fiscal 2016. As Joe mentioned we generated net sales of $1.29 billion, an increase of 9.3% over the prior year. These results were driven primarily by strong growth in our domestic business, notably healthy growth in pipe and allied products of 6.2% and 19.1% respectively. We also experienced significant growth on the international side from our acquisition of Ideal Pipe of Canada, which offset foreign exchange headwinds in Canada and a weaker market in Mexico.", "Adjusted EBITDA for the full year increased over 29% to $186 million, representing margin expansion of 220 basis points to 14.4%. During the year we incurred approximately $28 million of restatement-related expenses. Due to the fact that these expenses are non-recurring in nature we have treated them as one-time costs and have excluded them from our adjusted EBITDA calculation.", "During the early part of fiscal 2017 we anticipate that there will be an additional $9 million of restatement-related costs to support the accelerated process of filing our three 10-Qs and annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2016, all of in a three to four months period of time. We are also treating these as one-time costs and have excluded them from our fiscal year 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance. ", "Beyond the $28 million of restatement-related expenses which are non-recurring, G&A increased $15 million during fiscal 2016. The increase related primarily to the Ideal and BaySaver acquisitions, additional bonus expense and cost related to the financial transformation project. As it relates to the additional bonus expense you may recall that we did not take bonuses in fiscal 2015, which makes the fiscal 2016 bonuses fully incremental on a year-over-year basis.", "On slide eight, I would like to briefly highlight our top line performance by geography. For fiscal 2016 our domestic net sales contributed the lion's share of our growth year-over-year with $86 million of incremental growth. Canada added an additional $35 million of growth, primarily due to the Ideal Pipe acquisition. The remaining legacy Canadian business was roughly flat on a constant currency basis. These positive contributors were slightly offset by a $9 million decline in Mexico, driven by lower public spending, which negatively impacted our infrastructure end market.", "Now looking at fiscal 2016 by quarter on slide nine, you will see that domestic sales got off to a slower start to the year, but have steadily accelerated as the year progressed. This includes both pipe and allied products, which grew 13% and 27.4% in the second half of the year respectfully. Conversely results in our international segment progressively got weaker throughout the fiscal year, as strong first half results, driven by solid agricultural demand and conversion efforts in the construction markets increasingly gave way into a challenging macro environment in Mexico.", "Looking more closely at our domestic performance by end market on slide 10, we see a similar story here with net sales growth accelerating through the year in each of our end markets. In the non-residential market net sales growth was driven by conversion efforts and strong performance in allied products, which are primarily sold into this end market. In the residential market we generated double digit increases from new development activity which were further complemented by retail sales that significantly improved towards the end of the year as retailers started building inventory earlier than they did last year.", "We also saw an improvement in infrastructure sales driven by growth in states where we are building our market position. This includes states such as Florida, Texas and Missouri where we have benefited from regulatory approvals and increased market acceptance.", "Lastly, the favorable performance in our agriculture market in the second-half of the year was driven primarily by mild weather conditions which allowed for an earlier and longer season for purchasing and installing our products.", "Please turn to slide 11. In fiscal 2016 we continued to generate strong free cash flow of approximately $90 million, more than double the amount we generated last year. We believe there remains additional upside to our free cash flow in fiscal 2017 due to increased earnings lower restatement-related cost and continued working capital improvements. During the year we repaid $50 million in debt which brought our leveraged ratio down to 2.4 times. We also had $45 million in capital expenditures, which included investing in our HP and N-12 production capacity, adding production capacity in Florida and other initiatives.", "Looking ahead to 2017 we expect to invest between $50 million and $55 million in capital expenditures. The increase is driven primarily by our planned investment in a new pipe manufacturing plant targeting the Central Midwest. Finally, in 2016 we paid off $50 million in quarterly dividends at $0.05 per share. ", "Slide 12 highlights our disciplined capital deployment strategy and current priorities. As we look to deploy cash in fiscal 2017, we're first committed to investing in capital expenditures to drive profitable growth. Currently, one of our top CapEx initiatives includes investing in our HP production capacity and capability, a newer product line that has been growing significantly albeit on a smaller base. As I mentioned earlier, we are evaluating options for a new manufacturing facility in the Central Midwest, where we need to be closer to the market to support current and future demand. Based on recent approvals as well as other favorable market conditions, we see good growth opportunities in the construction markets within this region. ", "Given that we are currently serving this market from other ADS locations, there are significant logistical savings that will come once the plant is operational. This plant will also help to free up production capacity in other parts of the Midwest, which is needed based on current and projected growth in demand. ", "We are equally committed to our current quarterly dividend, which we increased to $0.06 per share as announced in our press release issued earlier this morning. Beyond organic investments and our dividend we are very focused on identifying strategic bolt-on acquisition opportunities. We have a long history of being active in the M&A markets and will continue to evaluate opportunities that complement our product and solution set as well as geographic footprint. ", "Lastly, due to the combination of debt repayment and strong adjusted EBITDA growth, we were able to bring our leverage ratio down to 2.4 times, which is well within our target range of two to three times. ", "Now let me switch to our fiscal 2017 guidance which we've highlighted on slide 13. We are expecting net sales to be in the range of $1.33 billion to $1.38 billion, which represents growth of between 3.1% and 7%. We are also expecting adjusted EBITDA for the year to be in the range of $205 million to $230 million, which represents an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 15.3% to 16.7%, based on our forecasted net sales. ", "I would like to make one important call out as it pertains to the pace and progression of our financial performance in fiscal 2017. On a year-over-year basis we expect the first half of the year to show good top line growth and adjusted EBITDA performance driven by the strong momentum we have carried into the new fiscal year, which will be compared against our relatively weak start to fiscal 2016. The opposite will be true as we get into the back half of the year as we will be facing more challenging comps due to our strong performance during the second half of fiscal 2016. ", "Furthermore the incremental benefit from favorable resin prices will be lower on a year-over-year basis in the second half of fiscal 2017 as a result of the favorable resin prices we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2016. In addition, the second half of the year will also be impacted by the normal seasonality of our business, where we generate higher volumes during the first half of the year compared to the second half of the year. ", "Taking all these factors into consideration, the year-over-year improvements in net sales and adjusted EBITDA will be less pronounced in the second half of the year as compared to the first. ", "On slide 14 we have provided some color on the end market dynamics that are underpinning our top line growth expectations for the year. We are expecting that our largest end market domestic construction will remain healthy with expected market growth of 4% to 7%. We will of course look to grow above this market rate, as we did in fiscal 2016 and have throughout our history. Favorable growth in our domestic construction markets will be someone offset by continued softness in the agriculture end market, which we expect will decline by 5% to 12% in fiscal 2017. ", "We are also expecting the second half 2016 weakness in our international markets to persist in fiscal 2017, largely driven by challenging market conditions in Mexico as well as softness in Canada tied to the weaker agricultural market that will offset anticipated growth in their construction markets. ", "Lastly, assuming raw material costs continue to remain favorable, we expect that pricing will decline approximately 2% to 3% in fiscal year 2017. Taken together, we anticipate our top line growth will land in the 3% to 7% range. ", "On slide 15, we have provided a bridge to detail what is driving our sales performance expectations for fiscal 2017. We are expecting incremental growth of approximately $50 million to $85 million from our domestic operations, driven primarily by our conversion efforts in our core construction markets with solid growth in our pipe product lines and the continuation of the strong growth we have seen in our allied products. ", "We are expecting incremental growth of up to approximately $5 million from Canada, driven by our continued efforts on converting market share from competitors and through additional materials in construction market with our pipe and allied products. ", "In Mexico, the challenging economic environment is expected to have a $5 million to $10 million negative impact to our fiscal year 2017 sales. This brings us to our fiscal 2017 net sales guidance range of $1.33 billion to $1.38 billion. ", "Lastly on slide 16, we've provided a bridge to further detail what is driving our adjusted EBITDA expectations for fiscal 2017. We are expecting incremental growth of approximately $35 million to $45 million to adjusted EBITDA from healthy volumes as well as lower raw material costs, partially offset by modest price declines. ", "We also expect to gain roughly $5 million to $10 million from higher allied product sales due to increased sales and market share growth. SG&A will be about $15 million to $21 million higher year-over-year. This includes additional selling expenses to support higher net sales and profitable growth, including additional engineering and tech support personnel, an increase related to our finance transformation project, reflecting additional FTEs as well as outside professional service fees, and finally additional build out of corporate support staff. ", "As I mentioned before we anticipate incurring an additional $9 million, in re-statement related costs; primarily related to the completion and audit of the three fiscal 2016 10-Qs and fiscal 2016 annual report on Form 10-K, all of in a roughly three to four month time period. All these changes are a result of the accelerated filing process and will not be incurred on an ongoing basis. As such we are treating these expenses as one-time costs and have excluded them from our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for fiscal 2017. ", "Lastly, we anticipate getting slightly favorable impact from our diesel and resin hedges, as well as operational efficiencies. This brings us to our fiscal 2017 adjusted EBITDA expectations of $205 million to $230 million. Overall we are excited about our prospects in fiscal 2017 and believe we are positioned well to have another successful year. ", "As we\u2019ve previously communicated on our call on March 30, we have dedicated significant time and resources to the completion of the fiscal 2015 audit and restatement along with the preparation of the filing of the three quarterly filings for fiscal 2016. As a result we were unable to file our fiscal 2016 Form 10-K within the prescribed due date, which was the 31 of the May. We intend to file the fiscal 2016 Form 10-K as soon as reasonably practical, which we anticipate will be by the end of July. ", "As we continue to work our way back to our normal quarterly filing process, we anticipate we will have one more quarter of playing catch up. We expect that we will file our first quarter 10-Q for fiscal 2017 by the end of August. We should be back on a normal schedule thereafter.", "With that I\u2019d like to open up the call to your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator ", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rob Hansen of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rob Hansen", "Thanks. So I just wanted to ask a little bit about the weather pull forward, I think you mentioned around $15 million in 4Q in pull forward there. I guess, what have sales done in April and May? Have you, has that definitely come through, right? Or have you, because you had some very strong end market numbers exiting March, and now we are in obviously in June now. So I just want to see how that kind of has played out here?", "Mike Higgins", "Yeah, Rob, Mike Higgins, I would say in terms of that, what we have recently given \u2013we gave today on guidance we\u2019re comfortable with that \u2013 with where that is and what we\u2019re seeing so far. So I think we\u2019re very comfortable with what we\u2019ve said and what we see in the market specifically our construction end markets right now. ", "Joe Chlapaty", "Rob, this is Joe. Rob one of the things that's so difficult to quantify what the pull forward or pull back dollars would be, quite honestly as it relates to non-agricultural sales, but more on the commercial construction side that really won\u2019t show up to a large degree till later in the year because even if we pull some business in to March they had other business that was projected, or on the books to begin in April, and well the season slowed down earlier because of that and that\u2019s a question right now, we just can\u2019t answer. ", "Rob Hansen", "So you haven\u2019t necessarily seen a slowdown yet?", "Joe Chlapaty", "No. I would say what \u2013 we\u2019ve seen, what we expected to see. ", "Rob Hansen", "Got it, okay and then just \u2013 I wanted to ask about the EBITDA to free cash flow conversion rate. I think in the past few years it\u2019s been that kind of 20% to 30% range and then last year 48% right. And then also so what's changed compared to the prior year is it just all in the margins right for yeah so what\u2019s changed there and then what changed since you gave us that additional guidance of free cash flow in that kind of $40 millionish range at the end of, in the last call?", "Scott Cottrill", "Yeah, Rob. This is Scott. I'd say the biggest change from fiscal \u201915 was in working capital and again the way we look at working capital is receivable inventory and payables. So in \u201915 we had a use of cash there close to $20 million and fiscal \u201916 we generated I would say lot of that was driven by lower resin cost and inventory of about $15 million net-net of raw --inventory was much greater than that but working capital in total was about $15 million source of funds. ", "I think for the strong performance versus what we indicated at the end of March, quite honestly a little of that was visibility, a little bit of that was still in the middle of the throes of the restatement and wanting to be conservative as we were finishing that up. So again very happy with the conversion, that we\u2019ve seen there. And again on the working capital side we would expect as we go in fiscal \u201917 for us to be positive on working capital side as well. ", "Rob Hansen", "So what is the right level of conversion to free cash flow from EBITDA kind of going forward? And then additionally how do you kind of think about the \u2013 because you used to have operating basis right and that would come through net income and therefore the operating line and now that down below in financings. So it kind of maybe distorts the free cash flow picture a little bit compared to historically. How do you kind of think about it in that way as well?", "Scott Cottrill", "Yeah, on your second point all of the periods have been restated and they\u2019re all consistently presented. So to your point that came in other capital leases is now treated as a financing or repayment of debt if you will. So it\u2019s out of our free cash flow definition but that's the same for every period. So it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve just done that for \u201916 and \u201917. ", "The way I think about it is on the EBITDA side, working capital obviously as a percent of sales for us is in the low 20%. So as we grow sales we\u2019re going to need a little bit of additional capital to support that additional growth. That being said, in a lower resin cost environment you\u2019ll have a positive going the other way. So that\u2019s how I think about working capital. We project that will be slightly positive to us net-net in fiscal \u201917. ", "And then on the CapEx, which is the other key piece to this we will be up around $5 million to $10 million based on our guidance in fiscal \u201917 versus \u201916. So again $32 million we\u2019re going to have that EBITDA growth, some of that will be [indiscernible] into by additional CapEx and I believe working capital both on supporting the growth in sales but then favorably based on lower resin cost, I think that will net-net prove out to be a slight source of funds. ", "So we should have pretty good conversion of that incremental EBITDA and incremental cash flow. ", "Rob Hansen", "Okay, got it. That\u2019s all I have for now. Thanks guys. ", "Operator ", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Halloran of Robert Baird. Please go ahead.", "Michael Halloran", "Hey, good morning everyone.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Good morning.", "Michael Halloran", "So appreciate the addition color you gave on how the year-over-year growth rates track through fiscal \u201817, but could we talk about that in terms of the sequential pattern. Now, you just mentioned that we won\u2019t know the full impact of whether or not weather pull was really pulled forward demand or not until you get later in the year. So when you think about it in terms of your guidance, does guidance assume a pretty normal sequential pattern as you work through the year or do you build in a little bit cushion as you went to the back part just in case weather did pull some demand forward?", "Joe Chlapaty", "No, it represents a pretty consistent pattern of what we\u2019ve seen. Usually the first half of the year is around 60% of due to seasonality of our total sales. So we would expect to see kind of that same pattern here as we go into fiscal \u201817.", "Michael Halloran", "And then on the hedging side what\u2019s the actual number from a hedging loss perspective that\u2019s embedded in this? I know you are saying it\u2019s a modest positive year-over-year. I think it was what above $15 million of a loss in fiscal \u201816. Maybe just help us what that is in fiscal \u201817, and then whether you are expecting any of those losses to carry through into fiscal \u201818 if prices hold steady?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Yeah, I think so you are right \u201815 was the impact in fiscal \u201816. Right now we project the number was about $12 million going into fiscal \u201817 with oil strengthening a little bit. That number is probably going to be coming down a little bit as we go into the year. The propylene hedges pretty much end in December of this year. So as you talk about fiscal \u201818 there's not an overhang there and the diesel will probably stay at around 40% to 50% hedged as we move forward.", "Michael Halloran", "Great, that\u2019s all I had, guys. Thanks.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Yes. This is Joe Chlapaty. In summary we are pleased with our results for fiscal 2016 and look forward to carrying this momentum into this year. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and we look forward to the opportunities in fiscal 2017 to continue our legacy of outperforming the overall market by driving conversion opportunities from traditional materials as well as generating significant operating leveraging overtime.

Please go ahead.", "Mike Higgins", "Thank you. Good morning. With me today is Joe Chlapaty, our Chairman and CEO; and Scott Cottrill, our CFO. On today's call, Joe will summarize our results for the first fiscal quarter, Scott will then provide more detail on the financial results for the quarter as well as our guidance for fiscal 2017 before we open the call up to your questions.", "I would also like to remind you that we will discuss forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We will make a replay of this conference call available via webcast on the company Web site.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Chlapaty.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to ADS's first fiscal quarter 2017 earnings conference call. We'd like to thank all of you for joining us today.", "Overall, our performance during the quarter was strong, particularly in our core domestic construction end markets, which grew 8% this quarter outpacing the overall market. Our continued focus on conversion opportunities, where we can displace alternative materials like reinforced concrete, corrugated metal, and PVC pipe with our superior high-density polyethylene and polypropylene pipe remain central to our long-term growth strategy.", "We are also pleased with the strong performance of our Allied Products, which grew 18% over the prior year. Allied Products not only serve as an important growth engine, but they provide us with a competitive advantage by offering our customers a complete water management solution. We also have a long history of bringing innovative products and solutions to the market through our Allied Products, including HP pipe, which grew over 30% this quarter over the prior year. These [technical difficulty] results were partially offset by weaker than expected sales in our domestic agricultural market, as well as in our international markets, particularly Mexico, which resulted in consolidated net sales growth of 2.4% for the quarter.", "We are also very pleased with our adjusted EBITDA performance for the first quarter, which increased 34% over the prior year period to $72 million. In addition, our net income increased 96% over the prior period, to $25 million. These strong results were primarily driven by effective price management as well as lower raw material costs.", "As we look ahead, we continue to believe that raw material costs will remain favorable as compared to the prior year. Although we are facing headwinds in ag in Mexico as well as a slower domestic construction market expected for the remainder of the year, which Scott will cover in more detail, we feel very good about our performance during the first quarter and our ability to generate above market growth and healthy profitability for fiscal year 2017 and beyond.", "Now, we'll turn the call over to Scott Cottrill to discuss the details of our results this quarter, as well as our updated fiscal 2017 guidance. Scott?", "Scott Cottrill", "Thank you, Joe. On slide five we provide a detailed summary of our financial results for the first quarter 2017. During the quarter, we generated net sales of $358 million, an increase of 2.4% over the prior year.", "As Joe mentioned, these results were driven primarily by strength in our domestic construction markets, particularly in our non-residential end market partially offset by weaker than expected results in ag and in Mexico. Our gross margin totaled 27% for the first quarter, 570 basis points higher as compared to last year. This margin expansion was largely attributed to effective price and cost management as well as increased sales of our Allied Products during the quarter.", "Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 34% to $72 million, compared to $54 for the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 20.1%, which was 470 basis points higher than the same period last year.", "Turning to slide six, domestic net sales increased 5% year-over-year, to $313 million. This growth was primarily a result of the continued strength and sales of our Allied Products, which grew 15% in the first quarter.", "As Joe previously mentioned, our core domestic construction end markets experienced high single-digit growth over last year, despite our residential end market sales only increasing 1% year-over-year. The growth in our construction end market sales was partially offset by weaker than expected sales in our ag end market. Our domestic adjusted EBITDA improved 60% year over year to $67 million, driven by slightly higher volumes, effective price and cost management as well increased sales of our Allied Products.", "On slide seven, I'd like to provide a bit more detail on what is driving our domestic performance by end market. Our non-residential end market continued to perform very well in the quarter, increasing 11% over last year. The growth was driven by strong sales of our Dual Wall [ph] and our HP high-performance pipe products, as well as our Allied Products. This growth was most pronounced in the South East, Central Midwest, and parts of the West.", "As I mentioned earlier, in our residential end market, our year-over-year growth was slightly lower than expected at only 1%, primarily due to a 5% decline in retail sales. As a reminder, 55% of our residential-related sales are in the retail channel, while the remaining 45% is related to land development and subdivision construction. We believe lower retail sales were due to the mild winter and a relatively dry spring and summer, as well as de-stocking of inventory by our customers. That said, we did experience high single-digit growth in sales related to new development activity, which together with our lower retail sales, as I mentioned a minute ago, netted to an increase of 1%.", "In our infrastructure end market, our sales grew 7% in the quarter as we continued to benefit from strong demand and acceptance for our pipe and Allied Products. In our ag end market, sales were weaker than expected, down 16% on a year-over-year basis. This softness was largely due to mild weather conditions in the spring, which allowed for an earlier planting season. As a result, we were not able to sell and install our products to the extent we had previously expected as we got further into the summer season.", "During the quarter -- turning to slide eight, during the quarter, free cash flow improved $17 million from a use of $30 million last year to use of $13 million this year. This improvement was due primarily to higher earnings and lower working capital, partially offset by higher restatement-related costs. We also repaid $61 million in debt since June of last year, and end of the quarter with net debt of $446 million.", "CapEx for the first quarter was $13 million, an increase from $12 million in the first quarter last year, putting us on track to spend between $50 million and $55 million for the full year. Our top CapEx priorities for fiscal year '17 include the completion of our new facility in Missouri as well as expanding our HP production capacity.", "Slide nine highlights our disciplined capital deployment strategy. Our highest priority use of cash continues to be investing in our business, as well as making strategic acquisitions to complement our product offerings. In addition, we are committed to returning a portion of our excess cash to shareholders through our dividend program, and will consider opportunistic share purchases in the future.", "Now let's turn to slide 10 for our fiscal year financial outlook. On slide 10, we have provided our updated guidance for fiscal year 2017. We are expecting net sales to be in the range of $1.27 billion to $1.31 billion, which at the midpoint is essentially flat compared to fiscal 2016, and is down $65 million from our previous guidance range midpoint-to-midpoint.", "The revised forecast is based on trends we saw during the first half of the fiscal year, particularly slower market growth in our domestic construction markets during Q2 and continued weakness in our ag end market in Mexico. More specifically, our revised forecast contemplates consolidated net sales for the second quarter to be down 5% to 7%, as compared to the same period last year.", "We are also lowering our adjusted EBITDA expectations to between $200 million to $225 million for the full year. This implies a $5 million decline in adjusted EBITDA from our previous guidance. The lower guidance reflects the impact of the lower sales guidance I just mentioned, partially offset by favorable price and mix relative to our previous expectations.", "Lastly, as a result of these changes, our expectation for adjusted EBITDA margin is now between 15.7% and 17.2% or 45 basis points higher than our previous estimates.", "On slide 11, we have provided additional color on the end market dynamics driving our updated full year expectations. In our core construction markets, we now expect the market to grow between 0% and 4% compared to our previous expectation of 4% to 7%. The growth in our domestic construction markets will be offset by continued softness in our ag end market, which we now expect to decline somewhere between 15% and 25% for the full year. We are also expecting the weakness in our international markets to persist throughout the remainder of the year largely driven by continued softness in Mexico.", "Before we open the call to your questions I'd like to provide an update on our upcoming filings, which are detailed on slide 12. As we continue to work toward a normal filing schedule we have provided an updated timeline for our next three quarterly filings. As noted, for the first quarter we expect to file our 10-Q by the end of October. For the second quarter we expect to file our 10-Q between late-November and early-December. And for the third quarter we expect to file that 10-Q by the due date of February, 9.", "Lastly, we have provided you with our preliminary net sales expectations for the second quarter, which we expect to be down 5% to 7% from the prior year. However, given that we are still in the process of closing our books we will not be making any comments nor responding to any questions regarding our Q2 operating performance, including adjusted EBITDA on today's call.", "We intend to fully address our second quarter performance when we host our next earnings call, which we believe will occur at some point during the middle of November. We will of course alert you with specific details when the date firms up as is our customary and normal policy.", "Now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator, please open the line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rob Hansen with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rob Hansen", "Thanks. So yes, we appreciate the 2Q sales update. So I wanted to kind of dig in to really 1Q and 2Q in terms of non-res in the United States. I think you were tracking somewhere in the double-digit range when you exited 4Q, and so you had a solid pace there. So what did you see in terms of maybe on a trend basis throughout the quarter and into the September quarter? And were there projects being pushed out, were there any differences between large projects or small projects or the type of properties? Any color on the ground in terms of what you've been seeing from 1Q into 2Q?", "Scott Cottrill", "Yes, Rob, I'll take the first stab at that. Again, I think the bottom line is just in Q2 first, we just see that growth has slowed. And really that's manifesting itself on the pipe side as well as on the Allied side from what we saw in Q1. And Q1 non-res has been [ph] up 11%, really good performance, and again, I think it's fair to say maybe a little bit of timing between Q1 and Q2 on how those sales sell, but really what we're seeing between Q1 and Q2 is mostly just related to the growth slowing as we talk about our outlook.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Yes, Rob, this is Joe Chlapaty. One of the difficulties we have in our business is trying to isolate and pinpoint the impact of weather. And one of the items that really throws into question the timing of business was the fact that non-residential construction again began earlier than normally you would anticipate. So there were a lot of projects on the books that began earlier than we anticipated, and that strong volume continued into June. And so now they're ahead of where they normally would be by the end of the second quarter. I'll say this; the activity as it relates to request for plans, the request for designs has not decreased. So we believe that going forward, the market [ph] remains solid for us whether it's the rest of this year or going into next year. I hope that helps.", "Scott Cottrill", "I mean and just a little additional color as well, on the residential side, Rob, again. So let's talk Q1, we were up 8% in our construction market. And in Q2, for the total company to be down five to seven, our construction end markets again will be flat to slightly down as well in Q2 -- not as well, but down year-over-year. So what we see there again on the non-resi side I think is a little bit of timing as well as slowing of growth. And on the residential side we saw continuation of what we saw in Q1 related to the retail and the de-stocking, and the impact there on a year-over-year basis. So that continued into Q2. So just to give you a little bit more color there as well.", "Rob Hansen", "Got it. And then just in terms of pricing, how much did price take away from the quarter? I imagine in agriculture it's obviously worse, but are you having to give up a little price in non-res as well?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Yes, actually based on our expectations, and if you remember our -- and when we went out on June 7, we thought pricing was going to be down 2% to 3% year-over-year for the full year, and actually for the first half that was about a 2% to 3% as well. Actually, what we're seeing is really good price mix. So on the yield side of the house pretty much flat with the prior year. So we're benefiting from what we expected and what was baked into our initial guidance, so up on that side, but flat on a year-over-year basis. And to your point, on ag it's down. So just to make sure I'm clear on that. Ag would be down, and the other markets would be making up for that difference.", "Mike Higgins", "Yes, Rob, Mike Higgins, I would say ag pricing is declined with what we expected with the conditions in the market place, and then good pricing discipline on the construction markets has an in-line or slightly better than what we initially anticipated.", "Rob Hansen", "Got it, okay. And then just the last question on the top line is just, I haven't had the chance to run the numbers, but the inputs in your guidance along with 1Q and 2Q sales, what are you kind of expecting in the back half, is that -- what are you kind of looking for there? Are you looking for a big rebound in the end markets or kind of a continuation of the trends you've seen?", "Mike Higgins", "I think when you look at the second half, again we expect -- we had a very strong second-half last year so I think it's a little too early to call specifically what the end markets are going to do. As we said, we've definitely seen some slowing growth in the overall construction market. But I think our expectations would be where we initially thought that Q3 would be in line with what we're anticipating. And then Q4, obviously we had a very strong winner which drove large sales growth. So we weren't necessarily expecting to match that type of growth, that we would have more sales and look more like a normal winter, anticipating that we wouldn't have such a favorable conditions compared to last year.", "Rob Hansen", "Got it, thanks. So I'll defer to others.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Marshall Mentz", "Hi, this is actually Marshall Mentz on for Bob today. How are you all doing?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Good.", "Marshall Mentz", "I was wondering if you could maybe quantify the impact of the early planting seasons. I think you spoke to delays in some projects or maybe putting off to next season? And then how should we be thinking about the impact to next year, is that comp [ph]?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Yes, I mean ag -- I think part of the ag being 15% [ph] down in Q1 year-over-year, again we expect the ag to be down. And I think our range was 5% to 12% for the year. I think we tried our best coming out of our guidance to estimate the impact of the mild weather. I think to be honest we underestimated that a little bit as to what that impact was going to be. And based on that early [ph] planning season a lot of what -- some of what we expected to get in during the summer has now been deferred.", "Now, as to what will happen here in Q3 as those crops come off, that is something that we remain to see as we go forward. And again, to the fourth quarter impact, as you talked to, going forward again it's just -- in the ag market it does depend on the weather. A little bit depends on farm incomes a little bit as well, and what they're willing to spend on drainage products versus other in crop prices. So a little bit of that all comes into play.", "Mike Higgins", "Marshall, Mike Higgins again, I think we said before that we thought the fourth quarter was a $10 million to $15 million got pulled out of '17 and into our previous year. So if you use that number ag is likely somewhere in that $4 million to $6 million range impact that fell into Q4 versus maybe would've happened in Q1.", "Marshall Mentz", "Then maybe switching gears in the follow-up, on the gross margin you had some positive mix shift due to that growth of Allied. Could you maybe elaborate on the drivers for that, and where you see the future of that business and the path relative to pipe?", "Scott Cottrill", "Yes, Allied again has just been a great -- again we use kind of a 30%-35% gross margin for our Allied products. And again, that was driven by our retention/detention products, our water quality products, so kind of the same group of products, if you will, year over year. And again, they're not dependant on pipe growth as you could see by what we're talking about here for not only the question, but full year. But when you look at regulatory, especially on the StormTech, as those regulations change a lot more people are looking to -- and it's still a conversion story. They're converting their ponds into the StormTech chambers. And so we continue to see that demand grow as we go forward. So, again, not contingent on pipe growth for that to continue to grow as we've seen it.", "Joe Chlapaty", "You know, Marshall, the Phase II EPA requirements are really creating significant demand for our Allied Products, specifically the StormTech, I'd say Nyloplast, and the Inserta Tee products, we don't see that slowing down or diminishing. And what that really does for us is that has a pull along effect on pipe, because the main product going in is the chamber but all the related pipe and other things, inlets, water quality units follow that along. So we're not looking for that to slow down. We're very optimistic of where we're at with those products and the remainder of our portfolio.", "Marshall Mentz", "Thank you, very helpful.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ryan O'Donnell of Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ryan O'Donnell", "Good morning guys, thanks for taking my question.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Hey, Ryan.", "Ryan O'Donnell", "So I just wanted to touch again on kind of the slowdown you guys saw in 2Q. Was there something maybe month-to-month or something that we can't see, what's kind of the consolidated number that gives you guys confidence that kind of the blend of the first-half will be the right run rate especially as you look to kind of get back to flat for the year on pretty tough comps in the back half?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Yes, I think what we're seeing there is the fact that -- yes, I think Q3 we would expect to be a little bit favorable from what we had thought or it seemed last year. And I think as you look to Q4, because of the strong and mild winter that we had will be a little bit under Q4, so flattish if you will. If you at domestically the second half will be a little bit up versus the first-half being a little bit down to get us back to that guidance range on a year-over-year basis.", "And then again as International, as we talked about, that will just be continuing down and weak, but a little bit less of a drag than what we saw in the first-half as we go through the rest of the year on a year-over-year basis.", "Ryan O'Donnell", "Sure, okay.", "Scott Cottrill", "And Ryan, I think just to elaborate on that, the growth if you look on a month-to-month -- month-over-month basis in the first quarter was very consistent. And it followed a little more of an up-and-down pattern during the second quarter. So as we said before, we've definitely seen kind of the overall demand slow, but again a little too early to call on the second half on what we'll end up seeing.", "Joe Chlapaty", "This is Joe Chlapaty, Ryan. The back half of our year is much more difficult to predict than the first-half just because of weather, and maybe getting back and talking about the very weak agricultural market we've had. One of the things that an early planting does do for us is the fact that crops go in earlier and they come off earlier. And our fall season is typically a more robust ag season than the spring season. So the earlier crops come off the more opportunity there is for drainage to take place. So we're going to have a heck of a lot better feel here in another six-seven weeks. As long as weather stays favorable I believe we'll have a reasonably good ag fall. It all depends on when winter comes in. But farmers have just been cautious this year. And I think the decision to put drainage in will take place as crops come off.", "I might add that in prior years we used to provide what we called an Early Order Program, an encouragement for farmers to take pipe early. And we didn't do that this year because of the, I'll be honest with you; we don't like to run up too significant a credit exposure with any one customer. So we thought we would just let it run its natural course. So I mean, we're only in October 6, if the weather stays the way it is, so we'll have a solid fall.", "Ryan O'Donnell", "Okay, appreciate all the color there guys. And then on the margin side, you know, certainly a good quarter, it doesn't sound like -- but was there anything abnormal that you will call out about the first quarter and then how should we think about kind of progression through the year based on guidance it obviously slows in the back half but how are you guys looking at that 2Q and then in the second half?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Yes, I think nothing unusual to your first question. As to the second question, as to the phasing I think a lot of the revision to the guidance we talked about will be mostly seen in Q2.", "Ryan O'Donnell", "Okay. And then lastly, any update on kind of the hedging benefit and flow-through both this year and then kind of what we can expect next year as well that kind of normalizes and they roll off?", "Scott Cottrill", "Yes, the propylene hedges that we have off of our polypropylene N resin purchases actually has moved and we are seeing the correlation come back in line with where it normally has been. So it's been almost like a $0.10 move in those hedges. So they have moved on a mark to market basis to a favorable place. So we will see favorability as we go through the rest of the year, and that number right now is around $3 million based on forward pricing and forward curves.", "Ryan O'Donnell", "Okay, I appreciate the time guys.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Scott, I am correct, and those will end at December [technical difficulty] ", "Scott Cottrill", "In December 31, correct. Based on our view of oil and the study that we have done as to our hedging needs and strategies, we will be layering on some additional hedges as we go through the year, but right now we are letting those just roll off.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] It seems we have no other questions at this time, so I would like to turn the conference back over to Joe Chlapaty for any closing remarks.", "Joe Chlapaty", "In summary, we are pleased with our results for the first quarter. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we are confident that we will continue our legacy of outperforming the overall market by driving conversion opportunities from traditional materials as well as generating significant operating leverage over time.", "Thank you all again for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with many of you very soon.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded for webcast.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Higgins, Director, Investor Relations and Business Strategy. Please go ahead.", "Mike Higgins", "Thank you. Good morning. With me today is Joe Chlapaty, our Chairman and CEO; Scott Cottrill, our CFO and Ron Vitarelli our Co-COO. On today's call, Joe will summarize our results for the second fiscal quarter. Scott will then provide more detail on the financial results for the quarter, as well as our guidance for fiscal year 2017 before we open the call up to your questions.", "I would also like to remind you that we will discuss forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our press release and the risk factors identified in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC.", "While we may update forward-looking statements in the future, we disclaim any obligation to do so. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements all of which speak only as of today.", "Lastly, the press release we issued earlier this morning is posted on the Investor Relations section of our Web site. A copy of the release has also been included in an 8-K we submitted to the SEC. We will make a replay of this conference call available via webcast on the Company Web site.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Chlapaty.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to ADS's fiscal second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. We'd like to thank all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your patience and support to the most recent restatement process, which we finalized January 10, and as we continue to work diligently to become current with all of our SEC filings. Scott will cover more details related to the restatement in just a minute. ", "So let me now turn to highlights for the second fiscal quarter. As we indicated on our last call, market conditions during the second quarter were softer than initially expected. But I\u2019m pleased with our overall performance during the quarter as we continue to outpace the overall construction market, while generating strong profits and cash flows.", "On a year-to-date basis, we\u2019ve generated solid growth of 6% in our non-residential end market. We continue to see double digit growth of our HP pipe, and growth at our Allied products, lead by Nyloplast, StormTech and our base saver water quality units. Our second quarter sales results declined primarily due to continued softness in Mexico, lower sales in Canada and a lack of growth in our domestic construction markets, which resulted in a consolidated net sale decline of 6%.", "We generated $66 million of adjusted EBITDA this quarter, about 3% higher compared to the prior year. Our price management and material cost advantage continue to enable us to generate good healthy profits. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA has increased an impressive 18% to $137 million, even though net sales have decreased 2% over the same time period.", "Although, we are facing greater than expected headwinds to our top line revenue, which Scott will cover more detail, we feel good about our ability to continue driving above market growth and healthy profitability for fiscal year 2017 and beyond. Importantly, we also expect to continue generating favorable cash flow, which will create additional revenues for shareholder value creation, including organic investments in our business, acquisitions, cash returns to shareholders and maintain a healthy balance sheet.", "Let me spend just a few minutes on some of these investments. Our new manufacturing facility we are building and Harrisonville, Missouri remains on schedule and on budget. Once complete, this facility would help free up production capacity in the mid west, allow us to meet the growing demand for our products in the region and help reduce the time and cost of delivery to our customers.", "As reminder, this facility is expected to open in the first half of calendar 2017. We\u2019re also committed to investing in product innovation that helps to extend our leadership position and competitive differentiation. We have some exciting news on this front, and we will have more information to share regarding a new pipe product very soon.", "We believe this new product offering will help further our market share gains in the infrastructure end market, particularly for large diameter storm sewer applications, building upon the success we have seen with our HP product line. We\u2019re also reviewing our manufacturing footprint to identify investments and other actions we can take to improve our efficiency, and lower our fixed cost, without sacrificing our service levels to customers.", "We are early in that process and we\u2019ll have more to share in the coming quarters. In addition to organic investments, we also expect to build on our track record of making strategic acquisitions to complement our product mix and geographic footprint.", "Lastly, we are committed to return a portion of our excess cash to shareholders through our dividend program, and we'll consider opportunistic share repurchases in the future. Now I'll turn the call over to Scott Cottrill to discuss the highlights from Quarter 2, 2017 as well as our fiscal 2017 guidance, Scott.", "Scott Cottrill", "Thanks, Joe. On slide five, we have outlined the impact of our recently completed financial restatement, which impacted the annual periods ending March 31st of 2012 through 2016.", "To summarize, during our internal review our share based awards and related administrative procedures, we identified accounting issues with the treatment of our stock based compensation. Specifically, we gave participants in the plan the ability to net shares of financial size for tax reporting requirements at an amount greater than the statutory minimum. We also, at times, repurchased shares from employees within six months of issuance. Both of these items resulted in our conclusion that we should change the way we account for our share based awards on the equity method to the liability method.", "As part of our review, we also determined that additional adjustments were required for historic compensation expense associated with certain executive employment agreements, as well for some certain stock repurchase agreements in place with members of the senior management team. Importantly, as we outline on slide five, the adjustments were all 100% non-cash and did not impact net sales or adjusted EBITDA for any of the impacted periods.", "For further details on the restatement, please refer to our amended financial statements for the above referenced periods filed with the SEC earlier this week. With this restatement now behind us, we continue to expect that we'll become a timely filer when we file our Q3 report. For more specifics, please refer to the updated timeline on slide six.", "Let me now shift to our financial results for the second fiscal quarter, a summary of which is provided on slide seven. During the quarter, we generated net sales of $361 million, down 5.9% from $383 million in the prior year. As mentioned on our last earnings call, domestic construction markets in the second quarter were slower than we initially anticipated. Additionally, Ag in Mexico continued to be significant headwinds. With regards to Mexico, we believe the market has bottomed, and are cautiously optimistic about our future performance there.", "Let me now highlight a few year-over-year improvements during the quarter. Despite lower sales our gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin improved versus the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Our gross margin improved 250 basis points to 25.1% and our adjusted EBITDA margin improved 160 basis points to 18.2%. The key drivers to the margin expansion are effective price management, lower resin cost and favorable transportation and operation costs. These improvements were partially offset by higher SG&A.", "Turning to slide eight, domestic net sales decreased 4.7% on a year over basis to $312 million. This decline was primarily attributable to the ongoing weakness in our Ag end market and a soft domestic construction market. That said we feel our performance in the non-residential end market held up better than the broader market, growing approximately 1% during the second quarter year-over-year and up approximately 6% year-to-date.", "Despite the decline in sales, we continue to show improvement in our adjusted EBITDA on both a dollar and margin basis. Our domestic adjusted EBITDA increased 3% year-over-year to $57 million, and our adjusted EBITDA margin improved 140 basis points to 18.3%, driven again by effective price and cost management.", "On slide nine, I'd like to provide a little bit more detail on what is driving our domestic performance by end market. Our non-residential end market sales continued to perform well in a difficult market environment, with results up slightly year-over-year. A slide decline in pipe sales was offset by an 8% increase in sales of our Allied products. The strength of our Allied product sales, particularly the performance of our Nyloplast and StormTech product lines, reflects market adoption for our complete product package for storm water management solutions.", "As mentioned previously, on a fiscal year-to-date basis, our non-residential end market sales are up approximately 6% as compared to last year. Our residential end market was slightly lower than expected, decreasing 2%. Similar to the first quarter, a 2% increase in new residential construction sales was offset by a 5% decline in our retail channel, primarily due to the warm weather we experienced last winter and inventory management and destocking practices, many of our retailers have implemented this year.", "In our infrastructure end market, our sales declined 5% in the quarter, driven by weaker project activity in markets where we have strong approvals. Again, we believe the decrease in year-over-year sales is due to the timing of projects and weaker activity, and do not believe we've lost any market share. Longer-term, we still feel good about our position in this market and look forward to continued success of our HP product line, as well as the rollout of the new product that Joe mentioned earlier.", "Lastly, sales in our Ag market were down 27% on a year-over-year basis, primarily as a result of an earlier start to the planting season, as well as weaker underlying economic conditions in the agricultural economy. Given the persistent challenges in the overall Ag market, we're in the process of evaluating our facilities and production capacity in locations that primarily serve this market.", "To-date, we've shuttered one facility in the upper Midwest and have taken out or moved approximately 7% of our production lines to other facilities with less capacity and/or exposure to the Ag end market. We will continue to evaluate our options to optimize our manufacturing footprint, moving forward, given the weakness in the Ag markets we serve, as well as to ensure we have the right product at the right plant at the right time.", "Turning to Slide 10, on a year-to-date basis, free cash flow improved $22 million, an increase of $27 million when compared to a use of $5 million last year. This improvement was due primarily to higher EBITDA and lower working capital requirements, partially offset by the timing of cash payments related to the financial restatement.", "As Joe mentioned, strong cash flow generation affords us the opportunity to invest in profitable growth, whether that\u2019d be organically or by making strategic bolt-on acquisitions, as well as the ability to return excess cash to our shareholders.", "Lastly, we repaid $77 million in debt since September 30th of last year, and ended the quarter with net debt of $420 million. CapEx for the first half of fiscal year '17 was $24 million, an increase from $22 million during the same period last year. We're on track to hit the low end of our expected range of between $50 million and $55 million for the full year.", "Slide 11 highlights our disciplined capital deployment strategy. Our highest priority use of cash continues to be investing in our business, as well as making strategic bolt-on acquisitions to complement our product offerings and our geographic footprint. We remain committed to returning a portion of our excess cash to shareholders through our dividend program, and will consider opportunistic share repurchases in the future.", "Based on our performance year-to-date backlog of existing orders and trends, we are updating our net sales at adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal year '17, which is noted on slide 12. Our current expectations are for net sales to be in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.250 billion, and adjusted EBITDA to be between $190 million to $210 million for fiscal year '17. Our expectations reflect, primarily, net sales performance for the fiscal third quarter, as well as a more conservative view on the fiscal fourth quarter.", "On a consolidated basis, we anticipate net sales for the fiscal third quarter will be approximately 6% lower than the previous year. We anticipate sales in our domestic construction market will improve low single-digits, year-over-year, driven by non residential sales, which will be up mid single-digits.", "With respect to our other domestic and international end markets we expect similar performance to what we saw in Q2. For the fiscal fourth quarter, we have assumed net sales will be approximately 7% lower than Q4 last year. That being said, as we all know, weather can be very unpredictable, particularly in the winter, which makes it difficult to provide accurate estimates for the fourth quarter.", "Lastly, it is worth noting that we were up against relatively strong comps in the fourth quarter due to favorable weather last year. In fact, last year's winter was one of the mildest in recent memory.", "In terms of adjusted EBITDA, our updated range is primarily due to our lower forecasted sales and lower pricing. Our pricing in the first half of fiscal '17 was better than we initially anticipated, and our revised guidance on October 7, assume that benefit will continue. Our updated range incorporates current pricing levels, which are in line with what we had assumed at the beginning of the fiscal year, of about 1% to 2% lower year-over-year.", "On slide 13, we have provided our outlook on the end market dynamics, driving our full year expectations. In our core construction markets, we have narrowed the expected range from market growth to between 0% to 2%; comparatively, our performance in the construction market this year, including our preliminary view on the fiscal third quarter, will be in the lower single-digits with non residential sales up by mid single-digits, partially offset by lower retail and infrastructure sales.", "Our revised net sales guidance assumes that the low single-digit growth in our domestic construction markets will be offset by continued softness in Ag, which we expect to decline by 20% to 25% for the full year. We also expect weakness in our international markets to persist throughout the remainder of the year, driven by continued softness in Mexico and second half weakness in the Ag market in Canada.", "Again, with regards to Mexico, we believe the market is bottomed, and are cautiously optimistic that our performance in the region should begin to stabilize, if not improve, moving forward. Now, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator, please open the line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Rob Hansen of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rob Hansen", "So, your top line came in largely as expected. You gave this updated guidance, and we know we really appreciate that. What is like really changed, between last time when you gave guidance and this time, right? And why did you reduce the guidance? And I guess I am thinking, is it something that you\u2019re seeing in January here that wasn\u2019t good. What are your thoughts on that, and are there specific verticals within non-res that came in weaker than expected. And by verticals, I mean, like office or retail, or something like that.", "Scott Cottrill", "I think, year-to-date through Q2, we had seen our non-res up mid single-digits. And so when we\u2019d done the prior forecast, we were using that as the trajectory as we move forward, we did not thank and originally in the guidance we put out, we thought Q3 was going to be up year-over-year a little bit. And obviously in Q3 what we saw, again what we pointed to is continued weakness in our construction end markets, so at least weaker than what we anticipated being down.", "And especially that was in the infrastructure and retail end markets, as well as the fact that pricing. We had assumed, in the October forecast when it came out, we were seeing very favorable pricing versus what we had expected at the beginning of the year. We play that forward assuming that it would gradually go down, but that we\u2019d largely leave it intact. What we saw through Q3 ended up becoming more in line with what we thought at the beginning of the year, which is when you\u2019re in the second full year of a lower resin cost environment, you can end up getting some of that back.", "Now again, Ag and retail you would expect to give that back, that\u2019s our price sensitive markets. And again, on the non-res and construction markets, they are very savvy customers are well and it\u2019s something to be expected. So those would be the biggest changes that we saw just the weaker demand dynamic, as well as pricing.", "Rob Hansen", "And the pricing are, it seems like in the second half of the year, it\u2019s kind of a swing factor, looks like it might be anywhere from flat to down to 200 basis points of sales, something like that. Is that kind of what\u2019s embedded in the guidance?", "Scott Cottrill", "It is, Scott, yes.", "Rob Hansen", "And then just on the, from an input cost prospective, what is that looking like, what our input cost up or down year-over-year, and how aggressive have suppliers been? And just lastly, if you could just give us the gross margin for domestic versus international, that would be helpful.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Let me give you kind of the 10,000 foot review of raw material, and then Scott can give you the specifics. We have maintained a favorable outlook and attitude towards material costs, and that really hasn\u2019t changed. And we see meaningful capacity coming on stream this year, augmenting with came on last year. So, going forward, we remained, I don\u2019t want to use the word, optimistic, but we haven\u2019t changed our outlook on downward pressure on material costs. That looks like it is going to take place, and is taking place. So, we feel good about it. Now, Scott, can give you some of the specifics on the margins of sales.", "Scott Cottrill", "So, again, on the resin side, during the first half of the year, we were down about 14% year-over-year, so again, great trajectory. The comps getting more difficult in the second half, so that can still be a benefit, but not as much as what we saw in the first half of the year. I guess, I\u2019ll talk to the EBITDA margin side, Rob, on the EBITDA margin. Domestically, we're at about 19.5% year-to-date and about 17% international. And that blends us to about the 19% for the year-to-date period, consolidated.", "Rob Hansen", "And then just last one. What's going on in Mexico, and why do you believe that the market there has bottomed?", "Joe Chlapaty", "We are, actually, experiencing recovery in Mexico and that really started in December. And I think the outlook on there is for improved activity again in the, I'd say the construction market, so maybe it relates to residential. And we have implemented some programs to recapture market share that we believe escaped from us over the past couple of years.", "So, we have a new team in place down there. They're doing a good job. And as we speak, over the last say 60 days, Mexico has turned into an upward trajectory. And we're not looking for huge growth, but we\u2019re looking for improvement over the -- than it was, let's say, over the past year and half.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bob Whitnall of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Marshall Mentz", "Good morning guys. This is actually Marshall Mentz on for Bob. A couple of questions for you guys looking to actually your fiscal '18. Would you talk about Missouri facility with respect to financial impact, and how that could potentially flow through in '18 and beyond?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Well, we have facility in Missouri, being completed from a couple of different standpoints. We believe there's a growing market opportunity in Missouri, and in that region out there. And we have received some meaningful approvals, improvements on our approvals out there, which give us a lot of confidence. And quite honestly, equally important was the ability to dramatically reduce our freight shipping cost to that area where we hit kind of a hole. And we were incurring a lot of freight expense delivering product to that market, so as the sales trend is up, we need the capacity out there and the ability to save freight cost dollars, becomes more meaningful.", "Marshall Mentz", "And then, I guess, shifting gears a little bit, but still talking about next fiscal year. The agricultural end market, and given your commentary about the negative impact in the planting season for last year. How does that play out in the future, and if you anticipate any pent-up demand? I think you got some commentary, and maybe about backing away from the business a bit, just given conditions. But is there potential for some sort of recovery given what's happened?", "Joe Chlapaty", "I don\u2019t have rhymes, but would really comment that, the comment on that in a broader perspective. But we certainly are not giving up on that market. We just think that with a company our size with soon to be 49 domestic plants, you\u2019ll need to deploy your operating lines in those geographies where there's strong business volume. So, if we have lines in those situations that have been, stay idled, we're going to move those to areas where we need that capacity.", "Ag is a very variable market. And every time you think you've analyzed where it's going to go, it changes direction. And I would say that, and I'll let Ron address this. But it\u2019s hard to ignore the weather impact that we've had over the past year and half. But we don't want to just use that as some type of excuse. The market is softer, but the year-to-year weather impact has been significant.", "Ron Vitarelli", "And just to echo, this is Ron Vitarelli. Just to echo that comment a little bit, obviously, the weather has a certain impact on the agricultural market for us. And although we don't see a very significant demand push forward or from this year's and last year, from an ADS perspective, we've been in this market for a very long time. Our market share is very stable, and our customer base is very stable, which bodes well for, just kind of continued market performance in the Ag business. So our expectations are, I think, realistic in the Ag market, but we're not expecting to see a very drastic increase based on pent-up demand.", "Joe Chlapaty", "And Marshall, it's fair to say that when we do our Q3 earnings release coming up in early Feb, we'll be giving directional additional directional look into what we think the end market performance will be.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mike Halloran of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Mike Halloran", "So, first to start on the non-res side, I'm just thinking back to the last update call. There was an expectation that things would get a little better in the fiscal third quarter beyond. Obviously, today you talked about how you're taking those expectations down. But maybe you could talk a little bit about how the performance has been sequentially relative to what you normally see from a sequential perspective? Was it a little bit closer to your normal sequential pattern, or worse? I mean, how would you characterize that?", "Joe Chlapaty", "I mean, I'll take a first stab and I'll let these guys add some context to it. I think the first quarter was very strong. We were up 11% in non-resi in the first quarter. And again that was the mild winter, the spring. I mean it was -- people were outside, people were working, people were getting to jump on things much earlier than what you normally see. A little bit of that was timing then. And again it's mostly impacted Ag and retail, and some of those other construction markets.", "But you also saw a little bit of that weaker activity in Q2 that, I think, was a little bit of that timing and phasing. To be honest with you, I look at the first half being up 5.6%; in the non-resi side it's kind of a more of normalcy, if you will, for how we did in those six months. And to me that's kind of a normal trajectory with what we thought. I think really on the pricing side, that's where we saw a little bit of a weaker activity, all that started coming in Q3. And again, that was -- I don't want to get into the months. But again, as we saw on November-December, we were picking back up, and then you had winter and weather started impacting us in mid-December again.", "So, I would say the sequentials -- I would just talk to it the way I just did as to the first half was in line with what we expected when you looked at it over the entire six month period. And then in Q3, I think, a little bit of weaker activity, a little bit of what we assumed at the beginning of the year on the pricing side came to fruition. And then, again, we got tough comps in Q4, but we still expected to be up mid-single digits in Q4, year-over-year, despite those comps in the non-resi side of the house.", "Mike Halloran", "So it sounds like you're saying basically the sequential trend, a little bit of weather headwinds, comps certainly a problem. But the sequential trend probably as you worked through the year and try to normalize everything out, not that different from what you'd see in a normal year. Is that fair?", "Ron Vitarelli", "That's correct. This is Ron Vitarelli, again. As we've talked with the greater group in detail in the past, we do -- we track the conceptual size of that business and the design side of that business very closely. And all the indications that we are witnessing would support the position that we've taken, that it is a timing issue. Certainly, cold weather, on company like us, impacts construction, because we're a 100% outside of the building. But what we\u2019re seeing certainly supports our outlook as stated.", "Mike Halloran", "And then maybe a similar discussion on the resi side of things, obviously, different distribution channel, little harder distribution channel. Weather benefits, I am assuming there is well from part of the year, comps harder here as well. How would you characterize the core market there, and your performance relative to the core market and what you\u2019ve seen, sequentially?", "Joe Chlapaty", "Yes. Again, I think as we have talked through the market, we\u2019ve not lost any customers or market share. I think, to be honest, I think we underestimated the impact of the Q4 winter and the pull forward a little bit we just did. We said 10 to 15 it was probably close to the 20-25 impact there. On the pricing side, again, our price sensitive markets are Ag and retail, and not that you don\u2019t have that pressure again on the construction markets. But primarily, it's in those two markets first. And they\u2019re very savvy customers, and on the retail side of the house.", "So, I think that\u2019s what you saw. You\u2019ve got different weathering events at different geographies throughout the U.S. that didn\u2019t help us, whether that the draught in the west or heavy rains in Texas. I mean, none of that ended up boding well for us as we went throughout the year. And then you also have, we mentioned the inventory management practices that our large retail customers put into place. Now today, don\u2019t always have that in place, but we saw it more so this year when it came to destocking. And really having just in time inventories if you will, and keeping inventories at relatively low level. So I think those are the key driver we\u2019ve seen in the retail side of the house.", "Mike Higgins", "Michael, one other, this is Mike Higgins. One of the things to add on the residential piece is there is the retail component of the business and then there has been the new residential construction, which would be related to new subdivision development, new multifamily developments. That business has performed in line. You said mid single digit growth there in the first half of the year. So that\u2019s really where, again, that\u2019s where the conversion story is in play for us that\u2019s the focus, that\u2019s where we\u2019re competing against traditional materials.", "As Scott mentioned, the retail, we have the share there where we\u2019re really focused on, and pleased with that growth that we\u2019re seeing in the residential construction, because that means our strategy of conversion is at play, and we\u2019re being successful.", "Mike Halloran", "And then last one for me, just maybe an update on the impact that you guys are anticipating on the hedging side this year?", "Scott Cottrill", "Yes, I mean, we\u2019ve had actually favorable movements on the monomer, the propylene monomer year-to-date. So, that\u2019s primarily the financial hedge side in diesel. And so the best way to look at that is about $3 million favorability on both the GAAP earnings and EBITDA perspective than what we had assumed at the beginning of the year.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Brian Connors of Boenning & Scattergood. Please go ahead.", "Brian Connors", "I wanted to -- actually I have question bit of a bigger picture angle on the pricing situation from a structural standpoint, talking about the construction market. And obviously, your markets are really regional, so even though you\u2019re talking about pricing in the national context. Well, I understand, business is really is regional markets where the supply/demand situation would really be what dictates price. So, can you talk about your pricing situation on a regional basis with construction growth so low? I imagine there are markets where the growth is negative, and that that\u2019s pressuring that supply and demand dynamic. And then also as it relates to the re-tasking of agriculture assets by yourself and others, whether that\u2019s creating some original issues in terms of pricing from a supply standpoint.", "Ron Vitarelli", "Certainly, and I\u2019ll handle. This is Ron Vitarelli. Level start with Ag, and very simply in the Ag, in a declining Ag market, it becomes a competitive environment with more people competing for a smaller piece of the pie, and I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been exposed, doing working on for the last 50 years. As it relates to the commercial construction, and I mean of all, the heavy construction market, overall, we\u2019re booking to regionally, by local polyethylene players and then concrete more on a national level.", "So we priced ourselves accordingly. We understand the concrete input pricing has moved upwards, and we\u2019re trying to be conscious with that in the market where we\u2019re directly converting against to reinforce concrete pipe producers. And in marketplaces where our primary competitors of the polyethylene high producers, we have to take a little different view on things to make sure that we don\u2019t lose markets share.", "And one of the things, I think, that we should certainly highlight again this year is that we have -- we feel very strongly that we have not lost any market share to any of our traditional competitors, both on factory side of the business and the polyethylene side of the business. So, hopefully, I hope that answers your questions as to our regional looking at those things.", "Joe Chlapaty", "I just want to add one flavor or one context to this, right, is the fact that for the year, we expect resin costs to be, on average, down 10% year-over-year. And on the pricing side, again, it\u2019s blended average of Ag and retail, and all of our markets. But we expect pricing to be now 1% to 2%. So, I just want to put that in context that of the majority of what we\u2019re seeing on that resin side, we\u2019re able to keep in and we pride ourselves and be able to do that. And the sales guys do really effective job of managing that, both up and down.", "Brian Connors", "So I can just paraphrase that. You don\u2019t believe, even though that the market growth has been a little bit below your expectations in some of the markets. You don\u2019t believe that there is any lingering sort of oversupply issue of too many production lines out there from an industry standpoint?", "Scott Cottrill", "Brian, in the construct markets know where you would have that overcapacity, would be in the Ag markets.", "Brian Connors", "And then it's a good segway, because my other question had to do with Ag. And it does seem that where couple of few years into this down cycle, and it does seem like the negative momentum that you\u2019re forecasting here down, you\u2019re 20% plus, is certainly little bit more pronounced then in some of the other Ag related market, if you think the irrigation, for example, where things have stabilized. So my question is, what you think is driving that? And is there some change, some shift, I know that a lot of your products have used in tiling applications. I mean, is there some shift taking place in the way the product is used or is not used in these application that is either exacerbating the cyclical impact in some way?", "Joe Chlapaty", "I think what\u2019s been difficult, this is Joe Chlapaty, to try the separate the actual market expectations from weather, has been very challenging; because, as Scott had mentioned earlier that the Ag season haven\u2019t really stopped last year much in winner. And we had a four quarter in Ag last year that was probably close to a record for us. So, when you factor that into this year again you don\u2019t know how much pull back you\u2019ve had. I\u2019ll say this, agriculture field drainage is a proven technique to improve crop yield by 20%. And most lending institutions, if you want to borrow money to buy farmland, often times they\u2019ll require that the land be drained.", "Now we\u2019re going through a situation here, transitional commodity prices are certainly down from where they've been. But where is the bottom, I'd like to think we're there, its where is it going next year, it's just a hard one to predict. We could, and I'm not suggesting this. But you could see a rebound in our business earlier this year. Again, if weather turn warm in March, you'd see a rebound in that business.", "We had a much earlier start to winter in the upper-Midwest in December which we just didn\u2019that experienced last year. I don\u2019t know where you're calling from, but if you were in the upper Midwest in the second third week of December, it was bitterly cold. And once installers put their equipment away, they tend not to pull it back out till spring. So, maybe that's kind of a lot of words that didn't address your question, but I hope it was helpful.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joe Chlapaty, Chairman and CEO, for any closing remarks.", "Joe Chlapaty", "Thank you. In summary, we are happy to have the restatement behind us, and are pleased with our performance so far for the first half of the year; particularly given the more difficult than expected end market environment. Our performance in the construction market this year, including strong results in non-residential and residential construction end markets, continues to outpace the market. We're also pleased to see double digit growth in our HP pipe, as well as solid growth in our Allied products.", "Our gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin improved compared to the prior year by 250 basis points and 160 basis points, respectively. And we are generating healthy profits and free cash flow, which will create additional revenues -- avenues, for shareholder value creation, including organic investments in our business, acquisitions, excess cash returns to shareholders and maintaining a healthy balance sheet. We also remain confident in our strategy to outperform the overall market by driving conversion opportunities from traditional materials, as well as generating significant operating leverage over time.", "Thank you all again for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with many of you very soon.

To begin based on preliminary financial data, we expect first-quarter revenue to be approximately $572 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 7% versus the first quarter of 2015. We do not have an earnings per share figure to announce today, but do expect non-GAAP EPS to be below the current consensus expectation, consistent with the revenue shortfall. Gross margins will be lower than normal due to the reduction in sales volume, but that difference is expected to be partially offset by lower operating expenses and stock-based compensation.", "Our HiSeq X benchtop sequencing array and services portfolios performed to expectations in the quarter, our HiSeq 2500, 3000, and 4000 fell short of our projections. In particular, sales of the HiSeq 4000 were lower than anticipated, with somewhat more outsourcing to X service providers and fewer upgrades from older generation instruments than our models predicted. We are evaluating a number of potential responses to this weakness that we can implement in the near term.", "Sequencing consumable shipments grew 24% year over year to approximately $300 million, as MiSeq, NextSeq, and HiSeq were at or above their respective ranges while HiSeq X utilization was below the $650,000 to $700,000 guidance range. Shipments to our clinical customers grew approximately 20% versus the prior year period, despite the expected shift of NIPT samples from our lab to in house sequencing at two large customers.", "Our benchtop instrument portfolio performed well in the quarter and the pipeline remains strong. Initial MiniSeq feedback has been positive, with more than 75 orders received and lower than expected cannibalization of MiSeq. Similar to previous instrument launches, it will take several quarters to fully understand customer buying preferences across these instruments. HiSeq X orders were above our expectations and our guidance range of 20 to 30 units with shipments of 20 units. The X funnel remains strong due in part to expectations associated with the Chinese precision medicine initiative, and we continue to project shipment of 20 to 30 units per quarter for the remainder of the year. ", "Geographically, in spite of the slow start in Q1, we are confident that the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions will grow full year shipments in the mid teens, consistent with our projections coming into the year. This expectation is based in part on the strength of orders booked in the first quarter, as both regions built significant backlog, deliverable over the next three quarters. The book to bill ratio for the Americas was 1.4 and Asia-Pacific was 1.2, a clear indication that these markets remain robust. These positive trends will be negatively impacted by Europe, which we now expect to deliver shipment growth of low to mid single digits, significantly diluting the Company average. We continue to believe that the market potential for next generation sequencing in Europe is far greater than this outlook suggests and are clearly disappointed by this projection.", "This morning, we announced a leadership change in the region and we are in advanced stages of hiring a general manager who will restore our growth trajectory in 2017, if not sooner. Additionally, we've assigned one of our most senior sales leaders from the US to work in Europe, and he is already in the region. As a result of our updated forecast for Europe, we now expect to deliver total Company revenue growth of approximately 12%, below our original expectation of 16%. Needless to say, we will look for every opportunity to control expense growth in order to partially offset the impact of the revenue shortfall on earnings. We will provide more details when we update our 2016 EPS guidance during our first quarter earnings call. Despite these disappointing results for Q1, we are resolute in our conviction that the growth prospects for sequencing are unmatched in the life sciences market. Our innovation engine continues to run at full throttle and we are well on the way to revamping our organization in Europe.", "Thank you for joining us today.

I am pleased to report that Q2 exceeded our financial guidance as revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $600 million. In the Americas, revenue grew 13% versus the prior year, slightly exceeding our forecast. And Asia-Pacific revenue grew 29%, driven primarily by China, which grew 70% on the back of demand for HiSeq X, benchtop instruments from clinical customers, and array and sequencing consumables. In Europe, revenue declined 4% versus Q2 of last year, a slight miss to forecast.", "We're making good progress on the action plan we enacted post the first quarter. Last quarter, we shared three areas that we're focusing on to deliver in our full year. The first area was improving our sales processes and, specifically, lessening deal complexity and ensuring the early closure of orders. We're making progress on deal structure and saw tangible results on the timing of the deal closure. As a result, this quarter's linearity was the best we've experienced since the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Second, our commitment to improving the execution and outlook in EMEA. We're pleased with the early impact of the leadership and execution changes, including the now permanent appointment of Scott Thomas as Head of Sales and Paula Dowdy as the Regional General Manager. The turnaround will take time, even a bit longer than originally projected. We continue to believe the region's first half result and outlook is primarily reflective of execution challenges and not the result of changing demand or increasing competition. And we are confident in the ability of our EMEA leadership to achieve its full potential.", "Our third area of focus was expense management. I am pleased to report that our expense re-planning efforts were completed during the quarter, slowing down our pace of hiring, discretionary travel, and other external spend without materially affecting our product development portfolio. This is partially reflected in our results for Q2 and fully reflected in our forecast for the year.", "In addition to the progress made on these three areas of focus, our manufacturing and supply chain execution also improved. Specifically, the back order situation for arrays has now been resolved, and incremental capacity has been built to handle the increased demand. More broadly, our manufacturing and supply chain teams executed flawlessly, due in part to new leadership.", "I'll now move on to an update on our markets. Our strategy to catalyze clinical markets is to deliver market-leading technologies and tailored solutions that enable customers to personalize patient care through genomics.", "In oncology, this strategy has resulted in pharma partnerships to develop and bring to market custom panels, including TruSight Tumor 15, which has been launched as a research use-only and investigational use-only product, and TruSight Tumor 170, which will be launched as a research use-only product later this year.", "We have also partnered with Amgen to develop a companion diagnostic test for Vectibix. The product development is complete, and we're preparing the final module of our pre-market approval application for the FDA. We expect this to be the first PMA submission based on next-generation sequencing, an exciting step towards fulfilling the promise of genomics in personalized medicine.", "With our sample-to-answer solutions and technology leadership, we expect our oncology revenue to grow, even as reimbursement and regulation play out over time. For example, this quarter saw a rebound in oncology testing shipments during the second quarter, which grew at more than four times the rate of total company revenue growth although from a small base.", "In NIPT, as expected, we continue to see customer shift to in-house testing on our sequencers. As a result, the number of samples running through our testing facility decreased to about 25,000. And we saw an offsetting uptick in sequencing consumables from these customers. Test fee revenue paid by customers to access the NIPT IP pool grew 90% year-over-year.", "We gained further traction in driving NIPT penetration in China as sample volumes accelerate and are on pace to double year-on-year. With the launch of our CE-IVD VeriSeq NIPT assay in Europe late this year, we expect to see a further acceleration in that region. The launch of this product will be well-timed given the Dutch Health Council's recent endorsement of NIPT for all pregnancies.", "Focusing now on new products. Orders placed across our high-throughput instrument portfolio increased sequentially and shipments were roughly flat. HiSeq X orders exceeded our guidance range and we added three new customers, bringing the total to 34. Again, this quarter demand came from new customers preparing to take part in the China PMI program, which has now allocated funding to more than 60 projects over the next 3 years to 5 years. In fact, Chinese customers drove the majority of our HiSeq X shipments in the quarter. Going forward, our HiSeq X outlook remains robust at 20 instrument to 30 instrument orders per quarter and we expect to see an increase in HiSeq placements in the Americas during the latter part of this year, which is supported by a solid pipeline.", "Our benchtop instrument portfolio performed well in the quarter, driven by ramping interest in MiniSeq, NextSeq adoption for NIPT in the U.S. and China and lower than expected cannibalization of MiSeq. Additionally, during the quarter, we received two regulatory approvals for our MiSeqDx instrument from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea and from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. These regulatory milestones will enable our customers to use our NGS technology in a clinical setting and are examples of how our regulatory strategy is enabling markets globally.", "Microarrays were, again, a bright spot as our revenue grew 30% year-over-year driven by both consumables and services, which resulted in the highest quarter of array shipments since 2011. There were two main drivers to this result, the direct-to-consumer market, which grew more than 100%, and medical research in bio-banking customers. Additionally, array orders grew more than 60% year-over-year due to orders for our Global Screening Array, or GSA, and Infinium XT product family, both of which will launch in the second half.", "Given strong orders in the last two quarters, our outlook for arrays for the year is much more optimistic. The impact of these products, coupled with a strong first-half result is expected to lead to double-digit array growth this year, which is clearly a turnaround for this business.", "Before closing, I would like to thank Jay for his 17 incredible years as CEO of Illumina. Through his vision, leadership, and determination, Jay led our company from a San Diego startup to a global market leader with over $2 billion in revenue, powering the genomics revolution. I look forward to partnering with him in his new role as Executive Chairman to further our mission of improving human health through unlocking the power of the genome.", "Today, we're still at the beginning of realizing the impact genomics will have in human health. As we march towards our mission, our top priority is to continue to deliver breakthrough products that enable the adoption of genomics in large and unpenetrated markets. Innovation has always been and will always be one of our core values, and a core part of our culture. And as the saying goes, culture eats strategy for breakfast, and I am committed to fostering our strong culture as we scale.", "I'm also focused on scaling the organization, our infrastructure, process, and our people. Taking on some of the world's hardest problems requires the world's best team. We have an incredibly talented team, and are seeing the benefit of continuing to strengthen the organization. I'm excited about the pipeline of talent being pursued across the company. From an operational perspective, I'm focused on simplifying our business and focusing our resources on activities that will have the greatest impact. It is important that we stop doing things that don't matter.", "So, these are some of my early priorities in the new role. At Illumina, we are passionate about making this great company even greater. The second quarter was a positive step along this path, but we have more work to do, as we continue to execute in our mission.", "I will now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our second quarter results.", "Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer", "Thanks, Francis. As Francis mentioned, total revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $600 million, slightly exceeding our quarterly guidance. This result was driven by growth in sequencing consumables, and strong demand from microarrays. Instrument revenue declined 19% year-over-year to $126 million, primarily due to a challenging HiSeq comparison, given the 3000 and 4000 launch in the prior year. Sequentially, instruments grew 7%, primarily driven by our benchtop portfolio.", "As predicted, HiSeq instruments were roughly flat sequentially, and we continue to expect to see an uptick in the second half, primarily Q4 in the Americas, as Francis mentioned. Consumable revenue represented 63% of total revenue to equal $379 million, an increase of 25% compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by strength in both the array and sequencing product lines.", "Sequencing consumables revenue also grew 25% year-over-year to approximately $310 million, driven by our growing installed base of instruments, and particular strength in NextSeq consumables. Again, this quarter, NextSeq utilization was above our guidance range of $100,000 to $125,000 per instrument annually. As a result of this outperformance and our increasing forecast, we are now projecting annual pull-through of $100,000 to $150,000 per NextSeq instrument.", "MiSeq utilization was in our projected range of $40,000 to $45,000, and HiSeq pull-through per instrument fell within the guidance range of $300,000 to $350,000. For modeling purposes, we removed approximately 45 HiSeqs from our installed base in the second quarter, reflecting the units taken offline due to adoption of newer machines.", "HiSeq X utilization fell just shy of our pull-through guidance range, as a large customer continues to work down inventory as we have previously shared. On a four-quarter rolling basis, which normalizes for the impact of shipment timing, X utilization was within our range of $650,000 to $700,000. Given customer ship schedules and the relative size of the installed base, we are widening the guidance range to $625,000 to $725,000 annually per instrument.", "Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts, grew approximately 18% versus Q2 2015 to $90 million. This improvement was driven by maintenance contracts associated with a larger sequencing installed base and genotyping services, partially offset by a decline in NIPT service revenue, given customers migrating to in-house testing as expected.", "Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude non-cash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as our GAAP EPS guidance, both of which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina's stockholders.", "Our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72.8%, a sequential increase of 110 basis points, driven by an improvement in sequencing consumable margin and favorable microarray pricing. Year-over-year, adjusted gross margin expanded 40 basis points, primarily due to higher consumables mix, partially offset by lower services margin.", "Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $114 million or 19% of revenue, including $8.6 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $113 million or 19.8% of revenue in the first quarter. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $127 million or 21.2% of revenue, including $6.5 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $125 million or 21.9% of revenue in Q1.", "Adjusted operating margins were 32.6% compared to 30.1% in the first quarter, driven by an increase in revenue, gross margin expansion, and our operating expense replan. Operating margin was lower compared to the 37.4% reported in the second quarter of last year due to increased investment in head count, GRAIL, and Helix. Core Illumina operating margin adjusted for expenses associated with GRAIL and Helix was approximately 35% in the second quarter. Stock-based compensation expense equaled $32 million. In the second half, we expect to see an increase in this expense driven by a number of key hires and the annual employee equity grants in Q4.", "Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% compared to 28.9% in the second quarter of last year and non-GAAP net income was $127 million. This resulted in Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.86, better than expected due to higher revenue and lower expenses compared to our forecast. This quarterly result compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $120 million and $0.80 in the second quarter of 2015.", "Non-GAAP EPS this quarter included approximately $0.06 and $0.02 of dilution in GRAIL and Helix, respectively. We reported second quarter GAAP net income of $120 million and EPS of $0.82 per diluted share compared to net income of $102 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the prior year period.", "I'm pleased to announce that late in the quarter we completed our plan to enter into a common to preferred share exchange transaction related to our shareholding in GRAIL. As a result, our GAAP diluted EPS included $0.01 benefit from the exchange and while Q2 net income reflected approximately 90% of the GRAIL losses, going forward net income will include approximately 50% of GRAIL losses, which is more in-line with our ownership.", "Cash flow from operations equaled $217 million. Q2 DSO totaled 56 days compared to 64 days last quarter. This return to pre-SAP levels was driven by continued process enhancements, focused collection efforts, and improved linearity in the quarter. Q3 linearity is expected to drive an uptick in DSO, given the summer vacation season. Inventory rose to $311 million due to the continued build-up of consumable safety stock to enhance our supply chain performance. This increase in inventory is expected to continue into the second half of the year, as we build safety stocks in preparation for the relocation of our San Diego reagent manufacturing to our new building on the headquarters campus.", "Capital expenditures in Q2 were $68 million, and we reported an additional $75 million increase in property and equipment related to construction expenditures paid for by our landlord, and capitalized by us under build-to-suit lease accounting. Consequently, Q2 free cash flow was $149 million.", "During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million of common stock under the previously announced discretionary program and ended the quarter with approximately $1.43 billion in cash and short-term investments, including the consolidated cash balances of GRAIL and Helix. We have approximately $155 million of repurchase authorization remaining, of which $70 million is discretionary.", "Turning now to expectations for the remainder of 2016. We continue to project total company revenue growth of approximately 12% year-over-year. Included in this projection is the expectation that EMEA will experience a slower pace of recovery, which will be offset by an improved outlook in Asia-Pacific.", "We are forecasting Q3 revenue of $625 million to $630 million and are anticipating high year-over-year growth in Q4 than in Q3. We have increased our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $3.48 to $3.50, up from $3.35 to $3.45 given our outperformance in Q2.", "In conclusion, I would like to punctuate a number of key fundamental performance indicators related to the second quarter results. Firstly, we experienced robust sequencing and array consumable growth. Secondly, we saw strong growth in oncology testing shipments, up more than 45%.", "Thirdly, Asia-Pacific outperformed significantly, and we saw strong Americas performance, offsetting underperformance in EMEA. We finally \u2013 we completed our expense replan and saw better than expected non-GAAP EPS. We believe these fundamentals will enable accelerating growth through 2016. Execution continues to be a major imperative, and our teams are focused on rebuilding growth in Europe, while continuing the strong performance in the other regions.", "Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, we will now open the lines.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks. Francis, can you maybe just elaborate on your comment on the European recovery being a little bit slower? I'm just wondering if that's a function of incremental steps you have to take. And obviously, with Brexit, any thoughts on whether there is any impact to GeL (20:09) funding?", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. The action plan we put in place at the beginning of Q2 is playing out. We have new leadership out in EMEA, as Scott is now the permanent Head of Sales there. Paula is the new Regional GM. And when Scott first went out there at the beginning of Q2, we asked him to look through the pipeline and validate the strength of that pipeline.", "And his response and in his report back to us was that the deals in the pipeline are real. Those are real opportunities for us. And three months in, those are real. And, in fact, we've added to the pipeline. What we are finding, though, is that there are some big deals in that pipeline that are taking a little bit longer to close. So, in Q2, we had a couple of those deals that slipped out of Q2, resulting in EMEA coming in slightly short of the forecast. And so, what we've done looking forward is we've looked at all these big binary deals in the pipeline and we've done a probability weighting on those deals and so that's caused us to take back a little bit our forecast for the year in EMEA.", "Now that's been offset by strength that we've been seeing in the Americas and APAC and so that's the commentary. The dynamics we're seeing in the market are still strong and the issues I'm talking about are primarily our own internal issues that we're working through. The demand environment seems strong. We talked about the fact that the Dutch Health Council has approved or endorsed NIPT for all pregnancies, the research environment seems stable.", "The Brexit impact hasn't really shown up yet. And so it didn't really impact us for Q2. There have been some anecdotes of \u2013 a couple of instances where it showed up, for example, we've had a couple of research teams that were questioning whether they should include collaborators, PIs, in the U.K. on their collaborations. And we expect those kinds of conversations could possibly slowdown some deals but we expect those deals to go forward anyway.", "We've also had one case where a customer, because of the exchange rate volatility, wanted us \u2013 wanted to pay us quarterly rather than annually. And so, really we're seeing pretty minimal impact at this point from Brexit on our business. We're also not seeing any change in the competitive environment in EMEA.", "Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer", "So, Tycho, just to punctuate a point on that, the Brexit point, our current guidance and forecast, therefore, assumes business as usual in EMEA and in the U.K. And any Brexit impacts which are too premature to figure out are not included in that forecast. GeL (22:55), specifically, we don't see any potential impact to GeL (22:58), but, again, it's a little premature to be able to tell if Brexit is going to impact that project at all, but we don't think so.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow up for the China PMI placement, can you maybe just talk about how you think about the cadence maybe over the next few quarters? Are you seeing the bulk of demand in the near-term here and then it will kind of drop off a bit?", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We are, as we said already, starting to see demand flow from the China PMI initiative. We talked about the fact that in Q2 the majority of our X placements were to China based on anticipated Chinese PMI work. We have a strong pipeline looking forward so I continue to see that strength play out over the coming quarters. And then we expect to see revenues show up from the pull-through associated with the instruments we're placing.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer", "Thanks, Tycho.", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Co. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you and good afternoon. Sequencing instruments were up against the most difficult comparison of the year. So a pretty material decline in instrument revenue. I believe, was expected in most models. For example, we were expecting a 19% decline year-over-year. That being said, based on the e-mails I am getting from investors, it does seem like that 21% year-over-year decline in sequencing instrument revenue is jumping out at folks.", "I believe you indicated that benchtops were better than expected. HiSeq 2500 and HiSeq 4000s were about flat sequentially and that you exceeded the guidance range for HiSeq X orders in the quarter. It would be helpful if you could just provide any additional color on how sequencing instrument revenue performance was relative to Q1, how it came in relative to your internal expectations, and maybe discuss any dynamics such as book-to-bill that will help us assess demand momentum heading into the second half.", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Doug. So, overall, we are where we expected to be generally with the instruments. We knew this was going to be a tough compare. And if you look at breakdowns of our instrument line for the HiSeqs, for example, we saw stabilization in the HiSeq instrument shipments in the second quarter. Orders were higher sequentially, and shipments were roughly flat compared to the first quarter. This was in line with what we outlined in the Q1 earnings call.", "And then, if you go to the X line, we continue to be happy with the strength of the X orders, which are as we expected it to be. And as we look at the pipeline going forward, we expect that to continue. If we look at the back half of the year, we expect to see further strength, especially in the HiSeq line, as we get towards the end of the year and primarily coming out of the U.S. We have a good line of sight into our pipeline for the HiSeq instrument sales towards the end of the year, driven by end of the year budget flush we expect to see.", "In terms of book-to-bill, it was sort of roughly consistent with where it's always been, which means that orders and shipments were sort of roughly in line.", "Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer", "Yeah. And in terms of backlog, I mean, given the commentary on X, obviously we built backlog in that particular area. But I'd say, across the rest of the instruments, it was pretty normal book-to-ship type of ratios.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's really helpful. I guess another question, just recognizing that some have vocally argued that demand for complex genetic tools is poised to decline and that there is overcapacity in the market. That's been out there for a little bit and the argument's become a bit more pointed subsequent to a series of recent quarters where Illumina hasn't performed up to Street expectations.", "This was a good quarter, albeit against a fairly low bar. Recognizing those arguments and keeping in mind some of the progress you've made here, I want to give you an opportunity to address these concerns directly. And specifically would you be willing to comment on how confident you are at this point that the challenges you faced over the past few quarters are a function of company-specific issues versus exogenous factors. Thank you.", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Doug. Obviously that's \u2013 you've covered a lot of ground and those are areas we spend a lot of time thinking through. We have been asked about certainly in the clinical markets, people have asked about, as you pointed out, the demand environment for complex genetic testing. And as we look through the data we have and the results we announced, we really don't see any dampening of the demand. Neither in the reproductive health markets, so, NIPT specifically, nor in oncology. In NIPT, we, overall, saw a continued growth in the number of NIPT samples. The dynamic playing out there is as we expected and we've noted before, we are seeing more of our big customers start to take the testing in-house. And so that results in a decline in our test send out revenue for NIPT but we see a commensurate increase in the sequencing consumables that we get from those customers.", "In addition, we saw really strong growth in the test fees that NIPT customers pay to access the IP associated with NIPT. So we continue to see strong demand and a growth in samples. And if you look at some of the market dynamics playing out, we expect that demand to continue to increase. We're still in the U.S. only about 26% of covered lives that are covered for NIPT and we expect that to increase over time. And we expect to see other markets come online like we saw in the Netherlands. So we believe that there is a strong demand environment and headroom in the NIPT space.", "In oncology, as we pointed out, we saw really strong growth of 45% year-on-year in oncology testing. And we know, from a market perspective, we're still at the very early stages of every tumor being sequenced for example. And so we expect to continue to see strong demand growing from both those clinical markets.", "As we look at capacity and utilization, we've done a lot of work to try and understand what the impact of putting more capacity into the market has done in terms of utilization. And last quarter we put out analysis to show what happens as every quarter we put more capacity in the market, what happens to the utilization of our instruments.", "And we saw that the capacity utilization has remained roughly flat and slightly gone up. And as we've updated that data for this quarter, we saw that play out again. We saw both an increase in capacity in the market, as we put out more instruments, and we saw the utilization slightly tick up as well. And so, we feel confident that even as we put out more capacity into the market, there is demand for that capacity.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you. Marc, what are you seeing at the tail end of the HiSeq X customer segment in terms of pull-through? I mean, are you starting to see some of the folks there take their utilization up? And then, I guess, along those lines, Francis mentioned consumables pull-through on the China placements. So I guess, how quickly would you expect those instruments to ramp in terms of utilization?", "Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer", "Yeah. So, Dan, we continue to see the entire \u2013 it's why we have this nice analysis we do of every customer because there is not a huge number and their pull-through. And it's not quite a straight line but you've got every single potential level of pull-through there from those that are very low to those that are very high.", "Notwithstanding the one kind of customer inventory situation that has impacted us for the last three quarters, I'd say, it's pretty good. And as new customers come onboard, they drag the number down, but existing customers increase their utilization and takes it back up. And so, it's working out pretty well.", "On the China situation, specifically, I would expect that to normally be a headwind as to the utilization rate, as the number of instruments gets placed and the projects come at a slower pace than you might normally expect. But on the other hand, we're still seeing those high-end customers increase. So I would expect them to offset that and so stay within this new range that we provided.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then maybe just a question on oncology, specifically, on the consumables pull-through for the systems that you've placed. Is the usage or the order consistency there any different than you find for the rest of the business, if we're just trying to understand how visibility tracks once the placement itself has been made?", "Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer", "Yeah. I think I can take that, if you like. Again, it varies a lot by customer and by application and what they're doing. We see \u2013 we do have some that are running very, very high and some in the lower end. So I think it's hard to put any kind of specific pattern on it, Dan. I think it follows the same kind of pattern we see across the high throughput instruments in general.", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, and it follows the same pattern as we see in other domains. So that distribution, as Marc said, of the high-end customers that have high utilization all the way down to much smaller occasionally-used instruments.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer", "Thanks, Dan.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer", "Hi, Derik.", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Derik.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So I've got a couple of questions, a multi-parter on the oncology market. So, I guess, the first question is, could you talk a little about the 45% growth. Was that \u2013 what was boxes versus test and was that all consumables, I guess is the first question.", "The second question is, obviously, the reimbursement landscape is very complicated for next-generation sequencing-based test. What are you hearing in the market about trying to drive higher reimbursement rates for NGS test? What are your customers doing along those lines? And then I've got a follow-up on that.", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. So what we are seeing in the oncology market is that a lot of the growth in oncology is driven by a number of the higher end customers and they are both consuming more consumables and buying more instruments. And so, while the overall sort of distribution in the oncology market maps the other markets, we definitely do have a set of very large customers that are running at high utilization and are driving a disproportionate percentage of the growth in revenue in that space. And, sorry, what was the other part of our question?", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "A question on the reimbursement landscape. I guess what are your customers doing in terms of trying to get a higher reimbursement rate from CMS and just trying to get paid for what they're doing?", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. A lot of the growth we're seeing today is not driven by any reimbursement, as you know. So it's either a self-pay market or it's a large cancer centers that are offering these genomics tests as part of their strategy of differentiating from other cancer centers. We are seeing some panels sort of go through reimbursement, but we're still at the very early stages of that process. We're still in the stage of the market where we're seeing a proliferation of panels, I think at last count there were over 1,000 panels out there. And so, as we look forward, I think, the next step in the process is to start to see some consolidation in the number of panels, which we think will accelerate the reimbursement in oncology.", "We've also \u2013 we're also in the stage now where we're starting to submit our PMA for our test for Vectibix, and that will be covered under a reimbursement schedule. But we're still at the early stages of reimbursement in oncology.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Congratulations on a solid quarter. Francis, can you \u2013 notwithstanding your own new role and Marc's new role, you've highlighted new leadership in Europe. I think you mentioned new leadership in supply chain that you thought was paying off.", "Could you maybe just give us a sense as to how you're feeling about the current leadership at Illumina or the other changes that you think or certain areas that you like to strengthen or just maybe give us your overall thought on where you stand there?", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I'll start by saying that we are incredibly fortunate, here at Illumina, to have an incredibly talented leadership team and incredibly talented team as a whole. We have \u2013 I think most of you know Marc, and over time you'll get to know the rest of the leadership team, but we have a team that's deeply experienced in this space and incredibly talented.", "So we're starting with a very strong base of leaders. As we grow, though, both in scale and as we grow in geographies and in new areas, we have needed to expand our leadership team. In some areas, we've needed to add specific expertise. So for example, we did the acquisition of Myraqa, brought on Mya and expanded \u2013 and are still expanding our regulatory team, for example, globally.", "The scale of our business over the last few years has grown significantly. And so, in the last couple of years, we've had to strengthen our supply chain team, bringing in a new leader, our consumables manufacturing team bringing in another new leader, and so, strengthening both the team and then the infrastructure associated with the operations there.", "There are a number of roles that we are looking to hire across the company but then, especially, on the leadership team. So we're looking for roles like the Head of Oncology, the Chief Medical Officer, and we're looking to expand our team that helps our customers with market access and reimbursement, for example.", "And so, I'll say, look, we are starting with an incredibly strong team. But we are also scaling the business. And so, we're looking to strengthen that team.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up just has to do a little bit with guidance. I think you mentioned \u2013 maybe it's kind of two parts here, but I think you mentioned, one, a little bit of a shift in how you were thinking of forecasting Europe, which is now more probability adjusted, is that unique to Europe, or is that something you do across geographies? And then the second part of it is, I think you also highlighted the growth in the consumer segment and the arrays in particular and I am just \u2013 as Helix gets going, I'm just curious how you're thinking about managing the potential for channel conflict in an area like your consumer initiative. Thanks.", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. So let's talk about both. In terms of our guidance for the year, the reason we feel confident with 12%, even though I said that, look, we're looking at the big deals in Europe and applying sort of a probability-based view on them, is that we are seeing slightly stronger than expected pipelines coming out of both, the Americas and \u2013 forecast coming out both the Americas and Asia. We, in general, do apply some probability weighting to deals across the globe but we have leaders that have been in place longer in EMEA and in APAC, and so we feel like we have a much better handle on where those deals are and what their likelihood of closing is.", "We applied a little bit of a heavier weighting \u2013 probability weighting in Europe than we do right now in the Americas and in APAC until we have the team on the ground and have some track record behind us in terms of the forecasting there. But the strength in EMEA \u2013 and the strength in Asia and Americas, sort of more than compensate for that from our perspective.", "In terms of Helix and the consumer business, so the way we set Helix up is that Helix goes out and recruits direct-to-consumer businesses to build on the Helix platform. The intent is that anybody who is looking to set up a direct-to-consumer genomics business will go talk to Helix. And there are incredibly compelling reasons about why you would want to go to Helix and get set up with Helix, rather than set up your own sequencing lab environment, your own informatics pipeline, your own operations.", "If, however, a customer feels like Helix is not the right fit for them, then they can certainly buy from us equipment and consumables. We do have customers that are outside Helix that are direct-to-consumer. They are terrific customers and we're going to continue to support them going forward.", "Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer", "And, Jon, I don't think there's really any direct channel conflict because of the segmentation. Customers that have an array-based genotyping panel that they want to continue with, clearly, we can service that. But if any customer who wants to take advantage of not just the infrastructure point that Francis made but also the opportunity to do exome plus would clearly be directed to Helix. So it's segmented based on the actual product.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Good afternoon, everyone. So it seems like, obviously, the momentum in China has been quite good. It's a market, obviously, you've been in for quite a while, and they've been a dominant sequencing power for some time.", "Can you give us a bit of color on some of the emerging players that are obviously incremental X customers? I mean, these are not household names for us, and it's hard to sort of judge where they are playing, what types of businesses they are, are they all government-funded or some private, how much of it is coming and fueled by sort of the PMI money that has been talked about? Just put some color around sort of the emergence there, given it seems like an important sort of part of your business.", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Good question because China is emerging as one of our top country markets already and is driving strong growth for us. If we look at the dynamics play out in that market, the market in China is primarily a clinical market. And so, we look at where the demand is coming from. There is a lot of demand from customers looking to set up NIPT operations in China. We expected that to continue to be a growing segment for us.", "We're also seeing some of those customers also enter the oncology space, but we're also seeing pure-play oncology providers that are emerging as customers of ours. By and large, these are private companies. They're not necessarily government entities that are being formed to go after those market opportunities.", "In the last \u2013 sort of in the recent past, we have now seen the emergence of organizations that, in some cases, are primarily targeting work coming out of the Chinese PMI. And those are the customers that are driving some of the X demand that we are seeing.", "The oncology and NIPT customers are more likely to be buying the NextSeq from us, for example. And so we're seeing sort of this new segment emerge around customers that are targeting projects from the Chinese PMI.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Great. And just as we think about product development and tiering and the like, over the last number of years, the demand from the client base has kind of been obvious and you've obviously segmented the business quite sensibly and you have instruments in most ends of the market. When you have discussions now on sort of future launches and/or areas for expansion or for areas where the customer demands product development, how have those conversations changed? And is it more on the application side? Is it more still on footprint? Is it on speed? Is it on cost? Where do you still get the biggest push in terms of what the customer base, where they really want you to take the technology from a roadmap perspective?", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That question is a great one, because right now we are seeing, as our business sort of expands, we're getting requests across the board. There are still segments of the market that want to continue to see us drive the costs of sequencing down, drive the throughput up, shortened turnaround time, and so there is still an elasticity in the market that customers want us to enable them to access. And so, clearly, a part of our portfolio is always going to be around delivering the world's best sequencing offering.", "We're getting, though, requests from customers that are saying that that's not the whole problem for them. Increasingly, we're seeing some of our clinical customers ask us to focus on helping them, for example, on the clinical reporting side. And so, as we look to how we want to evolve our portfolio over time, there are segments of the market where we're looking to provide the complete sort of sample-to-answer solution all the way down to potentially a validated clinical report.", "And so, for some segments, that's going to be the key enabling component of that segment. And then in a bunch of cases, the enablers are things that we can influence indirectly. And so working with the regulators, working with the payers on reimbursement, driving the data needed to demonstrate analytical clinical validity and clinical utility, so those are things that are enabling to the market that are not maybe directly driving our business today but an area where we feel we can be productively involved to help catalyze certain markets. So, as our business has gotten bigger, there are a number of strategic levers that we're focused on to drive the adoption of genomics in the various markets we're in.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon. I just had a couple of questions on the HiSeq X franchise, specifically longer-term. So, first, you made the comment around the 20 to 30 orders, which has been pretty consistent. But if you take the puts and takes between sort of the limitations on whole genome sequencing versus obviously some positive funding dynamics there, do you think that there is enough demand to carry that cadence of orders through or just beyond 2016?", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. If we look at what's driving that business, with all the puts and takes but some of the dynamics like the Chinese PMI that we said really drove a significant chunk of the X demand. We expect, net-net, those dynamics to be positive exiting 2016 and to continue to sort of drive that level of orders, as we exit the year.", "Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Got it. And then just a same kind of question on the consumables side. So, obviously, you talked quite a bit about the utilization and you have the installed base sort of aging issue. But thinking about, again, sort of in the next 12 months to 24 months and the cadence of per box usage increases excluding some of the inventory dynamics you talked about and whatnot, is there anything that you can point to that might accelerate that line, thinking again about funding or anything else on the table there?", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "As we look forward, I think that we feel that the pull-throughs will remain in the ranges that we talked about. As we look at the instruments we've placed, so we have new instruments that are coming online and those obviously will take a little while to ramp-up depending on which instrument you're buying. But we're also seeing instruments that are moving towards the high-end of the utilization across our portfolio.", "And so, I expect that range to be fairly stable going forward. I guess the only caveat that we talked about is that there is some volatility associated with the X pull-through depending on how a single order coming in a quarter can move that number one way or another. And so we expanded the range a little bit, but other than that we expect those ranges to stay stable.", "Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer", "Amanda, you specifically expressed a couple of year timeframe. I think if you think out beyond that, the only potential dynamic that could move in the positive direction would be population sequencing projects layering on top of each other. But that's not in the timeframe you specified.", "Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody.", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon, Bill.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "First question is, just on the raised expectations for the Asia-Pacific region, this is certainly consistent with our diligence around China. I was hoping maybe you could spend a few minutes addressing Japan. It's obviously been a bit of a challenging geography here for several quarters.", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. During the quarter, we actually did see the revenue from Japan increase slightly compared to the prior year, but we still think that \u2013 I'll start with saying Japan is not a big part of our revenue today. I think it's about 3% of our revenue today. So it's a small part of our revenue and it's unlikely to really move the needle one way or another. We see a gradual strengthening of the environment there but it is gradual.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Understood. And then just looking at the segment results here, and I guess, specifically a comment at the end of your prepared remarks about double-digit array guidance, but we kept the overall revenue guidance the same. And so, how should we think about the offset here? It's obviously in sequencing. Is it specific to Europe? A little color would be great. Thank you.", "Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer", "Yeah, Bill, so, obviously, we've don't guide to specific levels generally \u2013 specific segments generally, but we feel that given the trend that we're seeing now in arrays, we would give that perspective to you, that double-digit. We've been seeing that start to form. We mentioned it last quarter. We said it was an emerging bright spot, but we needed to see a little bit more of a trend. With the orders that we saw last quarter and the quarter before and the products this year, we had already been contemplating this potential array growth. We just didn't want to provide a number until we felt more comfortable. So it doesn't really change our guidance. And it doesn't offset necessarily on the sequencing side, it's been contemplated for... (51:31).", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Got it. Okay. I appreciate the color there. Thanks, Marc.", "Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. I want to ask a first question on the instrument business and then a follow-up on GRAIL. On the instrument business, just putting together some of the comments here on the call, and I was looking back for history, a little bit of context, you've had a couple of huge product cycles the last five years or six years with the HiSeq family. And just wondering how you think about the high-end of the instrument market being a growth driver if we take a long-term view. Is it really about driving new innovation at the high-end or should we assume that as we think about where this market is going from a clinical standpoint that it's going to be really more about driving lower-end instruments, maybe a lower ASP that reaches out to the clinical market. Just trying to think about how you look at driving growth in sequencing instruments?", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I think there are a few parts to how we think growth is going to come out of the instrument market. One is \u2013 and we've seen this before \u2013 one of the big drivers of growth there is the upgrade cycle. And if you look at our entire portfolio, over time, each of those instruments needs to be upgraded. And whenever we can drive a big upgrade cycle, that contributes to growth.", "Now, in previous years where we've had one instrument, you would have a single big upgrade cycle that would drive a lot of growth. Clearly now, we have a much bigger portfolio, and so while any one upgrade cycle will drive growth, that will play out over multiple instruments rather than a single big upgrade cycle.", "There is, we believe, opportunity \u2013 further opportunity in placing clinical boxes. And so, you'll see us continue to look to get clearance in the various markets around the world. We are very optimistic on the clinical market being a driver of purchases of \u2013 new purchase of our instruments.", "And then, in the longer-term, we do expect to see the low-end of the market to drive instrument growth. And so we talked about Firefly and the instrument we are launching at the end of next year. We believe that there are a number of segments that will be new to sequencing that will be opened up by Firefly.", "So there are tens of thousands of labs, for example, around the world that the vast, vast majority of which don't use sequencing at all, and they are capital constrained and, in some cases, they are sample constrained so that a purchase of even a MiniSeq or a MiSeq really doesn't make sense for them today. But Firefly would be perfect for that market.", "So we see a number of markets that we think a low-end sequencer would be very attractive for. And that would all be incremental instrument revenue.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "It's helpful. And just to follow up on GRAIL, just looking for any update you could give us in terms of key milestones for that program over the balance of 2016 or next 12 months? Just sort of looking at the next 6 month and 12 month timeframe in terms of what we should expect in terms of progress from that program? Thank you.", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. The GRAIL team is making really good progress. They continue to build out their team. So, as you remember, a nucleus of people moved over from Illumina to GRAIL. And that team has done a really good job adding really world-class talent in addition to that team. They've made really good progress and are continuing to make good progress in developing the assay and are on track to have that done by the end of this year. And the team is hard at work on designing their clinical trial. We don't have any new updates to provide right now and we'll make sure to get it out as we do.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks. I wanted to start and ask about NIPT. Could you walk us through some of the moving parts with the insourcing from customers and how that \u2013 plus the IP pool impacted both revenue and maybe gross margin in the quarter?", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So the way that market is playing out is, in a number of cases what we do is when we signup a new customer, we allow them to market their services even before they have their lab set up and we will process the samples for them in our CLIA lab. And for that, we charge them a test send-out fee and that drives test send-out revenue for us. That's good revenue but it really sort of on-ramp for them to have their own lab. And so, while we are processing their samples, a lot of these customers are actively building out their own lab and, over time, the intent is to move the samples from being processed by us to being run by the customers themselves in their own labs. To do that, they obviously have to buy instruments as well as consumables from us and so that's what you see playing out in that market.", "In addition to instrument purchases and consumable purchases, they pay us a test fee associated with getting access to the intellectual property we have around NIPT. And so the way you see that market working then is, we'll signup a customer, you'll see a test send-out, revenue stream show up to us and, over time, that gets replaced by instrument consumable and test fees.", "Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer", "And the way, Jack, that plays out in gross margin is, it generally only have an impact when we have underutilization in our services lab, which we did see a little bit of a headwind for that this quarter, as customers migrated the test to in-house and we have overcapacity for a while which takes us a little while to fill and, therefore, under-observation of overhead. And that's where you see a little gross margin headwind but it's not that significant this quarter.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And then just one more, Francis, I appreciate some of the commentary you made around the cost initiatives this quarter. We can back into what core Illumina is doing on both SG&A and R&D. I'm just curious, could you give us a little bit more granularity on how both the GRAIL, Helix portion you expect that to ramp through year-end and then what a sustainable rate looks like for that and then maybe even what the implied core Illumina looks like? That would be very helpful. Thank you.", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I'll happily take that one as well. I mean, they're both growing businesses. So they're both going to ramp during the rest of this year. That's partially offset by a higher non-controlling interest charge on GRAIL because of the recent restructuring of the shares. So no change there in terms of our forward-looking perspective on the dilution from Helix and GRAIL together. Trying to think, was there another part of the question?", "Rebecca Chambers - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasury", "There was a part for this year and on a go-forward basis.", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. And so, on a going forward basis, we haven't provided any official guidance on that yet. Directionally, we've talked about a couple of options and we'll come back when we've completed our budgeting with more detail on that. The GRAIL and Helix are both tied into the overall Illumina budgeting cycle, and so we're starting to get into the thick of that right now.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. You said that you're expecting strong HiSeq orders in the fourth quarter and you cited that the pipeline is why you believe that you can achieve that. Where in the sales cycle do you see a lot of opportunities that give you the confidence in your pipeline?", "In other words, have customers made the decision to purchase HiSeqs but are waiting for funding applications to be accepted or where are customers or, I guess, are they dragging their feet on committing to making an order?", "Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So a little bit of all of the above. Now, typically, the people buying HiSeqs are not new to Illumina customers. And so, typically, we've been working with a lot of these customers already. We understand sort of their business and the demands on their business. And that's what allows us to project when we think they'll be needing instruments and work with them on when they will need instruments.", "So, in some cases, it's grant applications that are in. In some cases, it's people that are looking at their budgets for the year and using their end-of-year budgets to buy HiSeqs. In some cases, it's they're just ramping up their business, and that's when they'll need the new instruments. But in the majority of cases, these are customers that are already customers of ours and that we have been working with for a while.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. And on a similar topic, you've removed, I think, 270 HiSeqs from your installed base over the last year and a half. Do you expect the rate of instruments that are decommissioned to slow down later this year when you're expecting that pickup in the HiSeq placements?", "Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer", "I mean it doesn't \u2013 actually it doesn't really matter as long as they are replacing those older HiSeqs with newer instruments. And so, as Francis mentioned earlier, with respect to the utilization analysis we do, that we've seen an uptick in the available capacity and so that net of those reductions in older instruments. So even with that, we're seeing the capacity going up as customers buy the new higher throughput instruments. So it's probably not fruitful to try and predict where that's going because \u2013 that's my point, (1:01:12) it doesn't matter as long as it's replacement, which is generally is.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rebecca Chambers for any closing remarks.", "Rebecca Chambers - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasury", "Thank you, operator. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the Investors section of our website as well as through the dial-in instructions contained in today's earnings release.

Please go ahead.", "Sid Jones", "Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts' third quarter 2015 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.", "We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?", "Tom Gallagher", "Thank you, Sid. And I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, our President; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer are both on the call as well, and each of us has a few prepared remarks and once completed, we will look forward to answering any specific questions that you may have.", "Earlier this morning, we released our third quarter 2015 results and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3.922 billion, which was down 2%.", "Net income was $188.1 which was down 1%, and earnings per share were $1.24 this year compared to $1.24 in the third quarter last year, putting us even in EPS for the quarter.", "As has been in the case for year along, currency exchange has been a significant headwind for us both on the revenue and earnings results and the impact accelerated in the third quarter. Importantly, the local currency results for our international businesses remain solid but when converted to U.S. dollars we lost 4% on the revenue line and 5% per share in EPS in the quarter. Or stated in another way without currency impact our sales were up 2% and EPS was up 4%.", "In addition to the currency headwind, we continue to experience a slowdown in specific segments of the economy which impacted several of our businesses but most significantly in industrial and electrical. We will comment on this factor a bit more as we review the individual businesses and as we customarily do I will cover the non-automotive operations and then Paul will report on the automotive segment.", "Starting with Office Products, this Group saw this deceleration on the revenue side in the quarter. After being up double digit since sales growth in each of the first two quarters, the Office Products team ended the quarter up 3%.", "The deceleration is primarily attributable to anniversary in both increased volume from the Office Depot/OfficeMax merger last year, as well as the impact products acquisition that was completed in July of 2014.", "Each of these was a significant contributor to the double digit growth rates generated over the past four quarters and we anticipated the moderation in Q3. However, we would have to say that we saw a bit more deceleration than expected and more so as the quarter progressed. Our sense is that the underlying Office Products demand has softened over the past 90 days.", "From a channel perspective, the softening was more pronounced on the independent reseller side and we ended the quarter down mid single digits. Our mega channel remains strong posting another big double digit increase.", "On the product side, facility and breakroom supplies and furniture each had strong quarters and core office supplies were positive as well. Our technology products were down mid single digits.", "So putting it all together, our Office Product segment was up 3% for the quarter which in the current environment is probably a solid performance. However, we were expecting just a bit more in the quarter and we're watching the recent slowdown closely.", "Before closing on Office Products we do want to mention the acquisition that was completed on October 1. Malt industry is a $20 million distributor at safety products and this acquisition will help to further diversify both the product and customer portfolios for impact products and for S. P. Richards and we\u2019re pleased to now have miles industries as part of our organization. They will contribute nicely to our Office Products results in the quarters ahead.", "Moving over to the industrial segment, Motion industry has experienced another challenging quarter ending the quarter with a 4% decrease. And demand patterns across our customer base were similar to what we have seen pretty much all year long.", "Customers and segments like lumber and wood products, food processing, cement and aggregate and automotive were generating solid positive results for us and we continue to make good progress with these accounts.", "Conversely, however, customers in the mining and resource oil and gas, iron and steel, pulp and paper and original equipment manufacturing are all running sizable decreases for the third quarter and year-to-date and notably the rate of decline actually accelerated as the quarter progressed.", "So despite the fact that there are number of positives within our industrial results, they are being more than offset by some of the specific headwinds and circumstances that we\u2019re encountering and we don\u2019t see this changing in the near term.", "In the meantime, our industrial team remains focused on key elements of their growth strategy. They were able to complete one acquisition in the quarter, Lake Erie Tool & Abrasive was acquired on September 1. This is a pre location distributor of tools and abrasives with annual revenues of approximately $30 million and Lake Erie will be a nice addition to the Motion organization.", "Additionally, the Motion team continues to make progress in the areas of securing new corporate account agreements, penetrating new markets and expanding share of wallet initiatives, each of which will contribute incremental revenue in the months ahead and will help to offset some of the declines that we are experiencing in the key customer categories mentioned earlier.", "But as with office products, we saw deceleration in our industrial results over the quarter which we feel is reflective of the ongoing challenges being faced by many segments of the manufacturing sector in the economy and this is a situation that will take a bit more time to work us way through.", "And I will wrap up the non-automotive operations with a few comments on EIS, our Electrical Segment Entity. This Group ended the quarter up 2% but in looking at the results more closely it shows that they are down 2%, netted acquisitions and copper pricing and similar to Motion many of their manufacturing base customers are experiencing end market headwinds.", "However it's interesting to note that EIS is made up of three different business segments. Electrical is the largest at 40%, fabrication is 30% and wire and cable is 30% and it's in the electrical segment where we are experiencing the most challenges.", "This business is running behind year-to-date while our fabrication and wire and cable segments are both generating solid increases, validating the diversification strategy that was embarked upon several years ago and this is something that they will continue to drive in the quarters ahead.", "End markets will remain challenging for the EIS team at least for the near term especially on the electrical side but they do have a number of potentially positive initiatives underway primarily in the fabrication and wire and cable sides of the business, and we are pleased with the progress they have made in each of these segments.", "So that will conclude the comments on the non-automotive businesses. And Paul will now review the automotive operations with you. Paul?", "Paul Donahue", "Thank you, Tom. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I\u2019m pleased to be with you here today and have the opportunity to revive you an update on our third quarter performance of our automotive business.", "For the quarter ending September 30, our global automotive sales were down 2% year-over- year. This performance consists of approximately 4% in core automotive growth, which is consistent with the second quarter and improved from the 3% underlying growth we reported in the first quarter.", "However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 6% in the third quarter, which is up from a 4% currency impact in the first and second quarters. Previously, our expectation was the currency to hold at/or around 4%.", "Our U.S. team posted a 4% sales increase in the third quarter which is improved from the 3% growth we reported for the first and second quarters. Our international businesses which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand reported another quarter of mid-single digit growth and local currency.", "We are encouraged by the positive trends we are experiencing in our U.S. results and the steady growth across our international markets. We expect that these trends continue in the periods ahead.", "In the U.S. we are pleased with the progress and we are seeing in our field operations across the country. While result vary by geographical reason, our teams are executing on our key initiatives and again we are pleased with the progress", "The Atlantic, North East, Central and Southern Region showed the strongest growth in the quarter. Likewise, our sales in the mid-western region of the country rebounded nicely in the quarter. This pay group reported solid growth following flat sales in the second quarter, which was directly related to the wet weather patterns experienced in this spring and early summer.", "The number of our stores throughout the South West including Texas and Oklahoma, as well as a number of our stores in the mountain division which includes Montana and the Dakotas continue to feel the effects of the downturn in the oil and gas business.", "So now let\u2019s take a look at our same store sales for Q3.We are pleased to report our U.S. Company own store group. Group stores sales grew comps store sales in the third quarter by 5%. This is an improvement over 3% comp store increases we reported for both the first and second quarters. This 5% increase is on top of the 6% increase generated in the third quarter of 2014 giving us a two year stack of 11%.", "Our 5% increase in the third quarter was driven by a combination of increases on both our commercial wholesale side of the business and by our retail business. Let's start with that retail results.", "As mentioned in previous calls, we continue to expand our revamp DIY initiatives across our company owned store group. We\u2019re pleased to report these initiatives are having a positive impact on the results as evidenced by an 8% increase in our retail business. This increase is being driven by both transaction and basket size increases, and is up from a 7% increase in the second quarter and on top of the 5% increase one year ago.", "As mentioned earlier, our retail initiatives have had a positive impact on both the size our average ticket and the numbers of tickets moving through our stores. In the third quarter we experienced an increase on our average retail ticket and a significant jump in the number of retail tickets.", "While we are still on the early dates of our rolling out our retail strategy, we are pleased with the initial returns. We have a great deal of heavy lifting in front of us but our team both in the stores and here at headquarters is truly energized.", "Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business, this is the dominant segment of our automotive business and in Q3 we turned in a 4% increase. This is a nice improvement from the 2% increase we reported in the second quarter and is on top of the 6% increase in the third quarter of 2014.", "The centerpiece of our commercial and wholesale business remains our major account alliances, as well as our NAPA AutoCare business. Our NAPA AutoCare business surpassed another milestone in the quarter, as our membership count has now gone over the 16,000 mark in the U.S., this Group generated high single digit sales increases in the quarter.", "And we can also report our major account partners delivered steady and solid growth in the quarter. Our fleet business bounced back after moderating somewhat in Q2. Sales to our fleet account showed a low mid-single digit sales increase in the third quarter which is in line with the overall growth of our U.S. commercial wholesale business.", "Our wholesale ticket trend was consistent with what we experienced in the second quarter.", "Our average wholesale ticket value was up mid-single digit with no benefit from inflation, while we saw a slight decline in the average number of tickets.", "Let's take a look at a few of our key product categories and review the trends we experienced in the third quarter. Our brakes category was a highlight again in the third quarter and it has been a strong category for us all year. And as mentioned in last quarter's update, we experienced a strong selling season with our heating and cooling categories.", "The warm summer temperatures we experienced across many parts of the country drove strong air conditioning sales well into September. We also saw a resurgence with our battery sales in the quarter. This category was off its historical growth rates in the first half of the year, but we are pleased to see a rebound in the third quarter.", "And finally, our NAPA import parts business continues to expand as we registered another quarter of low double-digit growth. So looking ahead to the fourth quarter of the year, we expect the significant foreign currency headwinds impacting our reported results to continue.", "That aside, we'll be working hard to further improve on our 4% underlying automotive growth achieved thus far in 2015.", "Turning to the trends we are seeing across the automotive aftermarket, the fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains.", "US driving topped 1.8 trillion miles over the first 7 months of the year, which is a new record. In addition, the latest month with reported figures is July, which was up 4.2% year-over-year, also a new record. This makes 17 consecutive months of increases in miles driven.", "As we look ahead, strategic M&A will continue to be a growth lever for our automotive business. We mentioned in our Q2 conference call that we entered into an agreement to acquire Covs Parts, a 25 branch distribution company in Western Australia.", "Covs will serve as a nice complement to our existing Repco business as they are focused on original equipment and aftermarket automotive parts, truck products and mining and industrial consumable.", "We had hoped to close this acquisition on October 1, but are currently awaiting regulatory approval and are targeting a close date no later than December 1. The addition of Covs Parts further expands our presence and scale in Western Australia and is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $90 million in US dollars.", "Based on - back on August 1, we closed on a smaller store acquisition in Australasia, and although the revenues for this business are less than $10 million annually, these types of bolt-on acquisitions throughout North America and Australasia will continue to be a key focus for our teams.", "So in closing, we are pleased to show progress in our third quarter automotive results and we're working hard to continue these positive trends. We would like to thank our teams both in North America, as well as Australasia for their efforts and appreciate all that they do for the GPC automotive business.", "So that completes our overview of the GPC automotive business and at this time, I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?", "Carol Yancey", "Thank you, Paul and good morning. We'll begin with a review of our income statement and segment information and then we'll review some key balance sheet and other financial items.", "Our total revenues for the quarter were $3.9 billion, consisting of underlying sales growth of 1.4%, seven tenths of 1% contribution from acquisitions. These items were offset by a strong currency pressures of 3.7%, which was somewhat stronger than we had anticipated.", "For the nine months through September, our total revenues of $11.6 billion, a 1% increase, consists of 2.4% core growth and 1.2% from acquisitions, offset by a 3% currency headwind.", "Our gross profit for the third quarter was 29.8%, up slightly from the 29.7% gross margin last year. For the nine months, our gross margin of 29.8% compares to the 29.9% reported last year.", "The progress we made in the third quarter is encouraging and primarily reflects the improvement in our automotive margins, although the office and electrical businesses also increased.", "The improvement in these businesses was partially offset by the continued pressure we're experiencing in our industrial business, which is due to the sluggish sales environment and lower inventory purchases, which ultimately negatively impacts supplier incentives earned.", "Executing on our gross margin initiatives is a key priority for our management team and we're committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long-term. We would also add that our gross margin initiatives are critical in offsetting the low inflationary environment that has persisted across our businesses for several years now, especially in automotive.", "Cumulative supplier price changes through September are negative three tenths of 1% for automotive, positive seven tenths of 1% for industrial, positive six tenths of 1% for office products, and a negative 1.5% for electrical.", "Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses were $869 million in the third quarter, which is a 2% improvement from the third quarter in 2014 and at 22.1% of sales compared to 22.2% last year.", "For the nine months, our total expenses are $2.6 billion, which is a slight increase from 2014, but improved as a percentage of sales to 22.4% compared to 22.5% last year. Our teams remain focused on controlling expenses in this environment and we continue to take actions to further improve our productivity and streamline our operations to enhance performance.", "Although we would expect to see more progress on this line in the periods ahead, it's also important to note that our SG&A as a percentage of revenue traditionally trends upward in the fourth quarter relative to the first nine months of the year and we are planning for that.", "Now let's talk about our segment results. Our automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.1 billion, which is down 1.7% from the prior year and 52% of sales. Our operating profit of $202 million is up 4.5% and their margin improved just strong 60 basis points to 9.8%, which was due to improved gross margins and also expense controls.", "For the year, automotive sales of $6.1 billion are down seven tenths of 1% and our operating profit of $560 million is up 1.8% and our margin is improved year-to-date by 20 basis points to 9.2.", "Our industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the third quarter, a 4% decrease in 2014 and 30% of our revenues. Our operating profit of $90 million is down 5.4% and our margin was down slightly 10 basis points to 7.7.", "For the year, industrial sales of $3.5 billion represent 30% of our total revenues and are down 1% from 2014. Our operating profit of $267 million is down 2.6% and our margin is 7.5%, which is down 20 basis points from last year and this relates to the loss of leverage and lower incentives that have pressured this group for most of the year.", "Office products revenues were $511 million for the quarter, up 2.9% and representing 13% of our revenues. Our operating profit of $36 million is up 9.3% and their margins showed nice improvement up 40 basis points to 7.1%.", "This increase was driven by progress on both the gross margin and expense lines and it was partially related to the Office Depot, OfficeMax business, which we anniversaried July 1 of this year.", "For the year, office product revenues were $1.5 billion, up 10.9% from 2014. Our operating profit of $107 million is up 9% and our margin is down 10 basis points from last year to 7.3%. So we're pleased to see our margin for this business stabilize.", "The electrical electronic group had sales in the third quarter of $197 million, a 2% increase and 5% of total revenues. Our operating profit of $20 million is up 12.5%, so the margin for this group showed strong growth of 100 basis points to 10.2% which is a new record high.", "For the year, sales for this group are $574 million, up 2%. Their operating profit of $54 million is up 8.6% and the margin has improved to 9.4 from 8.9 last year. So a very solid 50 basis point improvement.", "So for the third quarter, our total operating profit was up 3% from last year and our operating margin improved by 40 basis points to 8.9% from 8.5%. For the year, operating profit grew 2% and our margin is 8.5%, which is up 10 basis points from the prior year.", "Our margin expansion in the third quarter was driven by improvement in gross profit and also solid progress in managing our expenses. We're very pleased with this expansion given our current sales environment.", "We had net interest expense of just over $5 million in the third quarter, and our year-to-date interest now stands at $16 million. We expect net interest expense of approximately $21 million to $22 million for the full year.", "Our total amortization expense was $8.5 million for the third quarter and is $26 million through nine months, which is consistent with last year. We currently estimate total amortization expense to be approximately at $35 million for the full year.", "The other line which reflects our corporate expense was $34.3 million for the quarter, which compares to $26.1 million last year. Through September corporate expense was $84.2 million compared to $74.5 million for the first nine months of last year.", "Primarily unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustments of $5 million and $7 million for the quarter and the nine months account for the increases. In addition, we've experienced slight increases in cost such as legal and professional and IT related investment.", "Looking ahead we will expect that corporate expense line to be in the $100 million for the full year.", "Our tax rate was 37.45% for the third quarter and 36.85% for the nine months. These rates are up from 2014 due to the changes in our mix of foreign income and the related foreign tax rate, as well as the unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustment that was recorded in the last two quarters. With these factors in mind, we currently expect our tax rate to be approximately 37% for the full year.", "Our net income for the quarter of $188 million compared to $190.5 million in the third quarter last year and our EPS at $1.24 was equal to last year. For the nine months, our EPS at $3.56 is up 1% from the same period last year.", "Now let's turn to our balance sheet, which we were able to further strengthen again in the third quarter. Specifically this speaks to our ability to effectively manage our working capital and drive increased cash flows.", "Our cash at September 30 was $199 million, an increase from $136 million at September of last year. We continue to use our cash to support the growth initiatives across our distribution businesses.", "Accounts receivable was $2 billion at September 30 is down 1% from the prior year and relatively in line with our 2% increase in sales for the third quarter. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time.", "Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3 billion or down 1.5% from September and a decrease of approximately 2.5% from year end. Our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels and we\u2019ll remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels in the periods ahead.", "Our accounts payable at September 30 was $2.9 billion, up 12% from last year, which reflects the positive impact of our improved payment terms and other payable initiatives established with our vendors. We're pleased with our continued improvement in this area and we're encouraged by the positive impact it has on our working capital and days and payables.", "Our working capital was $1.9 billion at September 30, an improvement of 5% from last year. Effectively managing our working capital and in particular our accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable, remains a high priority for our company and we're pleased with our ongoing progress in this area.", "Our total debt at September 30 was $625 million, which is a decrease from the $835 million last year and a decrease from $850 million at June 30. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 16.5% and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time.", "We believe it provides the company both the financial capacity and flexibility necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue. So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength for the company.", "We also continue to generate solid cash flows driven by the significant improvement in our working capital. We\u2019re raising our 2015 cash flow projections for the full year. We're now planning on approximately $950 million in cash from operations.", "Additionally we currently expect free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be approximately $450 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value.", "Our first priority for cash is the dividend, which we've raised for 59 consecutive years. The 2015 annual dividend of $2.46 per share represents a 7% increase from the $2.30 per share paid in 2014 and its well within our goal of 50% to 55% payout ratio.", "Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our four businesses, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases.", "Our investment in capital expenditures was $25 million for the third quarter and through the nine months capital spending is $62 million. We expect our expenditures in the fourth quarter for the full year to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. The vast majority of our investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects primarily in technology.", "Our depreciation and amortization was $34 million in the third quarter and its $106 million through nine months, which is down slightly from 2014. Looking ahead, we're projecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $140 million to $150 million for the full year in 2015.", "Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of our cash for us and they're integral to our growth plans. For the nine months through September, we've invested approximately $115 million for the acquisition of several new distribution businesses, including the two in the third quarter previously covered by Tom and Paul.", "Also as previously mentioned, we closed on an acquisition on the office products business, small industries and we expect to acquire Covs, as Paul mentioned, later this quarter.", "So as you can see, acquisitions are important to our growth plans and we'll continue to seek new acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth.", "Although many of these opportunities will be smaller sized companies with annual revenues in the $25 million $150 million range, we're open minded to new complimentary distribution business of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investments.", "Finally, during the quarter we used our cash to repurchase approximately 950,000 shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. For the nine months, we've repurchased 2.5 million shares and today we have seven million shares authorized and available for repurchase.", "We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we've been slightly more aggressive with our repurchases given the value of our price during those for this year. We expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.", "That concludes our financial update for the third quarter and nine months. So in summary, we've growth plans in place and are intensely focused on showing progress in periods ahead.", "Despite our recent challenges and the relative uncertainty in the global economy over the near term, we're encouraged by the fundamental opportunities we see across our distribution businesses.", "In closing, we would like to thank all of our GPC associates for their hard work and commitment to their jobs. Our people truly are our greatest asset.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Tom.", "Tom Gallagher", "Thank you, Carol, and thanks to you and Paul for the comprehensive updates.", "So that will conclude our prepared remarks and clearly it was another challenging quarter for us. However, underneath the headline numbers, there were a number of positives as well. Few examples, the 4% constant currency increase in automotive and 5% company store same-store sales growth shows steady progress as does our mid single digit local currency increases in Australasia, Canada and Mexico.", "Also in Automotive, the continued strong results coming from the NAPA Auto Care and major account initiatives are two primary and commercial programs and the solid 8% increase in our retail business show good progress on both the commercial and retail sides of the business.", "The completion of two key acquisitions in the quarter, one in office products and one in industrial and we expect to announce a few others of similar size before yearend and all this will give us a bit of a sales lift going into 2016.", "Gross margin improved 12 basis points in the quarter and SG&A decreased six basis points enabling us to show operating margin improvement in three of our four businesses and an overall GPC operating margin improvement of 40 basis points.", "On the balance sheet, good work was done in the areas of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, enabling us to show a nice reduction in working capital as well as a nice increase in cash generation and there are ongoing progress being made by GPC team in a number of key areas as well, which will all serve as well in the quarters ahead.", "However, the one area that continues to give a significant challenge is revenue growth across all of our businesses. Currency is having an effect on each of the businesses to one degree or another both directly and indirectly, and specific economic issues are impacting us especially in industrial and electrical. Although both of these issues are transitory, we don\u2019t expect them to moderate in the near term.", "Additionally as mentioned, we saw deceleration in our growth rates in three of our four businesses as the quarter progressed and the early October results are bit softer than planned. At this point, we don\u2019t see any evidence of share loss across the businesses and our sense is that we are seeing further softening and overall in market demand.", "With all of that said considering current market circumstances and trends, we feel that's appropriate to revise our year-end guidance downward. Prior we gave you guidance on automotive of being up 1% to 2% and currently we would say that automotive will be flat to up just slightly with a 5% headwind from currency exchange.", "Industrial, our prior guidance was flat to up 1 and now we would say down 2% to down 3% with a 1% currency impact. Office Products will remain the same, prior it was up 7% and 8% and currently we say it will be 7% and 8%. And electrical prior guidance was to be up 3% to 4%, and we would say now up 2% to 3%. So for total GPC prior guidance was up 2% to 2.5% and right now we would say flat to up slightly with little bit more than a 3% impact from currency exchange.", "And with revenues at these levels, our prior guidance per earnings per share was to be $4.65 to $4.70, but we would say now $4.55 to $4.60 with a $0.15 to $0.16 per share currency exchange impact and on a comparable basis that would put us at $4.70 to $4.76, which will be up 2% to 3%.", "So that will conclude our prepared comments. And at this time, we will turn the call back to Victoria to take your questions. Victoria?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Elizabeth Suzuki", "Good morning, guys. Can you parse out the foreign exchange impact between Australia and Canada, et cetera? And do you think the headwinds should start to ease in maybe not the next quarter, but starting 2016?", "Tom Gallagher", "I'll try to answer that Elizabeth. We can't give you the specifics right now on the impact by country, but I can\u2019t tell you that currency exchange quarter-end-over-quarter-end we were down about 20% in Mexican Pesos, about 18% in both Canadian and Australian Dollars. If that helps, we will be happy to follow up with you.", "Elizabeth Suzuki", "Okay, thanks. In the industrial segment, are there cost-cutting measures or price cuts that you can execute to try to offset the demand headwinds? Are you noticing any market share shifts among your competitors at all?", "Tom Gallagher", "We are adjusting our cost structure as we go forward. What normally happens is when we get in the periods like this and we have seen prior periods similar to this. Revenue declines a bit more quickly than we can get to cost structure down, but eventually, we will catch up with it.", "And then at least based upon prior experiences what we have seen is that, when revenue does start to come back, the earnings come back fairly quickly and at a bit stronger pace because of the good work that the team does on the cost side of the business.", "As far as share shifts, we don't see anything right now that would indicate to us that we are losing business. I had mentioned in my comments that good work is going on in landing new agreements with specific customers, which might suggest that we are at least holding our own, perhaps picking up a little bit, but as being overshadowed by the declines we are seeing in certain categories right now.", "Elizabeth Suzuki", "Okay. Thank you.", "Tom Gallagher", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Becks with JPMorgan.", "Mark Becks", "Hi, thanks. On the sales guidance, I just wanted to sharpen the pencil on automotive and industrial. So it looks like it's implying kind of 5% to 9% declines in industrial and then in automotive, it seems like 4Q is like 2% to 6%. So I was just hoping you can - obviously, with 4Q being a little bit of a smaller quarter, it gives a wide range, so I'm hoping you can drill that down a little bit.", "Tom Gallagher", "You're going to have to help me on that. I get a little confused when you referenced second quarter.", "Mark Becks", "Yes, so if we use the guidance for down 2% to 3% in industrial, it seems to imply a down 5% to 9% decline in industrial. So I want to see if that seems appropriate. And then similarly with automotive, if we should be thinking about kind of 2% to 6% sales growth in that category for the fourth quarter.", "Carol Yancey", "I think on the industrial, you are probably a ted high. What you saw as Tom mentioned, the later part of the quarter got worse in the industrial segment. So we are guiding for a little bit worse in Q4 so it\u2019s probably more at the lower end of the range that you talked about.", "And then I think as you look out for what automotive would be Q4, I think you are in line with what we are using. Part of that is the currency. If currency won\u2019t be quite as strong of an impact in Q4, it's going to be more back to where it was like Q2.", "Mark Becks", "All right, that's helpful. And then within industrial more specifically, if I look at your 4% sales decline, it looks like it was a little bit more severe than some of the competitors out there. I was just curious who you see the major competitors being, whether it be an Interline or perhaps maybe a Grainger or Fastenal who looked like their top line was a little bit stronger?", "Tom Gallagher", "Yes. We would not say that they are direct competitors. The best comparison I think would be with Applied Industrial Technologies with Kaman and with DXP. They would be the ones that we would encounter most frequently and would have the cost with the clearest overlap in product offering.", "If we look at Interline or if you like at Grainger or Fastenal, we really don\u2019t overlap with them as much on the product categories that we sell.", "Mark Becks", "Understood. And then just last question, you operated a distribution business essentially with four distinct segments. I know some of the facilities are shared warehouses, but I was just hoping you can kind of tease out what benefits you derive from operating the multiple segments and then the potential synergies you gain, whether it be from fleet or transportation or shared services from the various segments? Thank you.", "Tom Gallagher", "You mentioned three of the areas where we do get some leverage, certainly on transportation both inbound and two to three outbound. We certainly get it in the area of shared services without question.", "We don't share facilities to a large degree today. Each business runs independent facilities. That\u2019s something that we think potentially we could do as we go forward. We are looking at it now between the couple of the businesses. But we share technology enhancements and capabilities. We generally pilot something new in one of the business, prove the concept and then start to roll it into other businesses.", "There are several things that we do across all of the businesses once we prove that the concept gives us a kind of returns that we are looking for.", "Carol Yancey", "And Mark I just want to be clear on automotive guidance that we talked about. What we were talking about is probably flat up slightly for Q4 that\u2019s what implies, but the FX would be about 4%. So that is kind of what you are talking about.", "Mark Becks", "Okay. So with kind of the 4% core automotive growth rate, it seems like that's a good number to think about for fourth quarter as well.", "Carol Yancey", "Yes, it is. And last year Q4 our automotive comp was at 6%. So that\u2019s a good number.", "Mark Becks", "Okay, great. Best of luck.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.", "Greg Melich", "Hi, thanks. Tom, I think in your final comments, you mentioned that revenue decelerated across the business through the quarter. Could you help, I guess give a little bit more color then into October and specifically in auto what you saw. Does that mean that auto had a really strong beginning of the quarter and now it's just at that lower level that you just inferred or what do you think is going on there?", "Tom Gallagher", "We saw the quarter was softer. The underlying business as Paul mentioned was pretty good. But we did see deceleration in our U.S. based business, as well as in the international businesses. The delta is not as significant in automotive as it is in industrial - and to a degree in office products.", "The only business that we did not see deceleration across the quarter was in our electrical business. The other three all declined. If we look at the early results in October, it\u2019s pretty much in line with what we saw in the back half of the quarter is softer than what it had been.", "We think right now based upon what we can gather from talking with our customer base and with our supplier base is we think end market demands have pulled back a bit from what we had seen earlier in the quarter and certainly through first half.", "Greg Melich", "If I could follow up on the gross margin, what drove the expansion there, again, especially in auto? Was it the stronger dollar helping, price optimization, vendor leverage? What are you seeing there?", "Carol Yancey", "Actually Greg, it\u2019s all those things. We were pleased - this has been our second quarter, our gross margin improved with automotive and some of the things that we put in place earlier in the year and certainly you talked about it with our foreign operations.", "We had to put some things in place on both the buy side and the sell side to combat the currency issues. Those are working quite nicely for us in Q2 and Q3. And then really on the U.S. business too, their gross profit is up as well and that\u2019s really just strong focus on both the buy side and the sell side. It\u2019s just really all across the board.", "So we\u2019ve been pleased to see their improvements. I'd tell you going into Q4, the only headwind is going to be coming with industrial and just a further softening in their top line. So if we can maintain where we were at be flat or slightly up, through the rest of the year, but we\u2019ve got a little bit of headwind with industrial.", "Greg Melich", "That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Fassler", "Thanks a lot and good morning to you. The first question I want to ask is about the cadence of cost control. The Company responded quite well to the revenue slowdown in the quarter, both in SG&A and in working capital. And the deceleration in SG&A growth or I guess the move to a decline was a real step change from where you had been.", "The guidance that you gave as best I can tell suggests a trend in SG&A much closer to the year-to-date number than what you saw in the third quarter. So can you talk about what enabled you to cut costs so substantially in Q3 and why you don't expect that same pace of expense reduction to persist into Q4?", "Carol Yancey", "What we talk about is, look we were extremely pleased with the progress in Q3 and I'd tell you from an SG&A standpoint, again our team suggesting our cost structure to where we saw the topline to be and it\u2019s in a lot of different areas on SG&A and we\u2019ve seen improvement that\u2019s come in automotive really all year with SG&A.", "It\u2019s really hard with industrial and their lack of top line for them to have. And they are going to have continued pressure on their SG&A line. When you look at the full year, I\u2019d really point you to look at our operating margins through the nine months where each of our businesses except industrial have improvements through the nine months and where we are at 10 basis points operating margins, that\u2019s really probably more of what we expect to be for the full year. ", "We had sequential better sales in Q3, especially in automotive. So we leverage better on the SG&A. Q4, you just have a lower sales volumes, their seasonality. You won't get as much SG&A leverage. And then we are guiding on the corporate expense. You see a change there for the end of the year. We had some favorable onetime items in corporate expense at the end of the year and we called those out last year and there was a swing of almost \u2013 there will be a swing of almost $10 million in that retirement plan adjustment.", "So some of those things are factoring into our full year guidance to get us more to the year-to-date number you\u2019re looking at.", "Matthew Fassler", "Okay. Secondly, and very briefly, I know you announced a couple of new acquisitions. Is it possible just to sum up I guess the annualized revenue that you acquired and just how we think about that factoring into the full-year guidance? I suspect that the numbers are going to be reasonably small contributors, but anything we need to factor in as we build up our organic versus acquisition model for Q4?", "Carol Yancey", "Well, we have contemplated those acquisitions in our guidance. The one that Paul mentioned, the Covs acquisition doesn't close to December 1. So there is a very small amount that would go in there. But if you look at the ones we've already exposed on, you\u2019re talking about something around 140 million on an annual basis and that excludes the Covs deal but hasn't closed yet.", "Matthew Fassler", "And these are acquisitions -- the $140 million are for acquisitions you announced today?", "Carol Yancey", "They are the ones going back to January 1.", "Matthew Fassler", "Okay, got it. ", "Carol Yancey", "We have had about 7. But those are in our 2015 guidance already.", "Matthew Fassler", "So the new news we would have to add to our models is kind of immaterial for the rest of the year?", "Carol Yancey", "That's correct.", "Matthew Fassler", "And then finally interesting commentary on office products and I guess wondering for your insights on the independents sort of bearing the brunt of the slowdown. When do you typically see that in a cycle? I know that there can be some volatility by channel, so I don't want to make too much of it, but you did call it out. So curious for your read from the field on what that typically means.", "A \u2013 Tom Gallagher", "Well, the independence this is two consecutive quarters at the independent side of the business that has been down and we see further consolidation happening in that customer segment currently. We see more of that continuing honestly as we work away through year end but our expectation would be that the independent side of the business would be positive for us in 2016, probably have another quarter or two were to be negative ahead of us yet.", "Matthew Fassler", "It sounds like you have visibility, Tom, to some consolidation by actual deals that have happened that are changing the landscape a bit and then those run their course.", "A \u2013 Tom Gallagher", "Well there are some of that, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. And we have visibility to some that we think are going to happen.", "Matthew Fassler", "Fair enough. Got it. Okay, thank you so much, guys.", "A \u2013 Tom Gallagher", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.", "Seth Basham", "Good morning and thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the industrial side looking at the margin performance there, which was very good all things considered. Can you help us understand a little bit more on the gross margin side versus SG&A side where you saw more pressure and how you expect that to play out in the fourth quarter?", "Carol Yancey", "So on the industrial side and their growth margin is actually down and then their SG&A is not improved either. That\u2019s the one area that I mentioned that - look the size the top line, it's also the volume incentive, so their volume incentives are down similar to their sales decrease in the quarter and we would expect those to be down for the full year as well.", "So they are just not getting the same level and so that\u2019s going to be, I think both pressure on gross margin and SG&A. So where their margins down 10 basis points through the nine months given where we have guided to for the full year we could see a little more pressure on that operating margin for the rest of the year.", "Seth Basham", "Got it. So only a little bit more than 10 basis points. Does that mean 2030 or even more severe than that?", "Carol Yancey", "Well, we\u2019d hope that will not be more severe than that. Look we are really hopeful that - right now we just don\u2019t know but hopefully it\u2019s something what you described.", "Seth Basham", "Got it, okay. Moving on, on the auto side, looking at the core business on the wholesale side in the U.S., this is the second quarter in a row that you've talked about ticket counts being negative, not dramatically so, but any more color there why that's happening, Paul?", "Paul Donahue", "Yes, and I think you and I talked about that last quarter. Look there is a couple of things happening here, one certainly vehicles, vehicle quality is a heck of lot of better today and I think we\u2019re seeing some of that impact on the number of cars coming into the bays. But what you do see when they do come in that the repair is at a higher price which were seeing and we\u2019re pleased to see as our average ticket value continues to - continues to go up in the right direction.", "So, it's something that we\u2019re watching a bit Seth you are correct it is two consecutive quarters and we\u2019re going to continue to monitor it but we would expect that to bounce back in 2016.", "Seth Basham", "Got it. Is there one segment of your wholesale business that is showing more weakness? Is it the up and down the street garage customer?", "Tom Gallagher", "No, not really, Seth. I mean if you - the numbers that we shared with you, our auto care business continues to be strong and that's, that\u2019s all different sizes of shops. Our major account business continues to be solid, so there is no one area jumping out.", "Paul Donahue", "It maybe reflective but what\u2019s happening with the car counts in the bays and I think there is some inconsistency across the board in the industry with car counts I think some are experiencing increased car counts and others are flat to may be down just slightly.", "Seth Basham", "Understood. Okay, thank you very much and good luck.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Management.", "Tony Cristello", "Thanks, good morning. Tom, can you sort of maybe categorize a little bit how this slowdown feels versus other slowdowns you've experienced? The severity doesn't seem like it's as bad in any way, but the beginning stages here I guess give pause and I think you even alluded to watching some things to maybe give you an indication how this may play out.", "Tom Gallagher ", "It\u2019s an interesting question Tony. On the one hand we looked at a set of data points that would indicate that things are going along, okay. On the other hand you look at a different set and they suggest to you that it\u2019s in consistent what the first set of data might indicate.", "Right now it feels like we\u2019re in a grind-it-out mode in several of our businesses and there seems to be quite a bit of caution on the part of a number of our customers primarily in the non-automotive businesses in terms of CapEx and investing for future growth. And I think people are being very careful about how they\u2019re spending their money right now on investing for the future.", "So, right now from at least from my perspective we still have a couple of quarters I think to work our way through this and I think it\u2019s going to be a gradual path forward not anything that\u2019s going to be a hockey stick type recovery. I think it\u2019s going to be slow for another quarter or two and then hopefully we\u2019ll start to see the evidence of that.", "And if you look at the disconnect, on the industrial side the disconnect between industrial production and capacity utilization, they seem to be going in different directions right now and historically they tend to move in line with one another. So again, just they\u2019re conflicting sources of information currently.", "Tony Cristello", "Okay. And was there something in particular on the office side as well, which seems to be holding up better that gives you a little bit of a pause in a different manner than what you've seen in industrial?", "Tom Gallagher ", "On the office products side, we thought like the team together a pretty darn good quarter having anniversaried the two significant impacts. Being up 3% in the current environment I think is reflective of some good work being done by the office products team.", "The thing that gives us a little bit of pause though is, we actually thought we might be just a slightly better as we went into the quarter, we thought it might be a little bit stronger than the way it turned out and we saw some deceleration as the quarter progressed as I mentioned and that\u2019s continued on into the first half of October.", "So we don\u2019t have the sense right now as to what the real cause but what we do know and talking with our primary vendors is that this is not unique to S.P. Richards or Genuine Parts, they're seeing this across most of their customer base and it just seems to be a temporary slowdown that hopefully we will reverse itself as we work our way through the quarter.", "Tony Cristello", "Okay, that's great color. Maybe if I can ask one more, on the automotive side, you are having very good success in terms of the DIY and gaining some traction with various initiatives. Maybe if you could just add a little color to that in terms of is it simply you're a much higher percentage commercial business and so adding that emphasis on DIY is easy to gain that share? Is there something you are doing perhaps differently than what your traditional DIY-focused retailers would? Or is it a situation where even your affiliates are seeing an increased appetite for that type of product and maybe they are gaining some share from what seems to be a competitive marketplace with some disruption over the last couple of years?", "Paul Donahue", "Yes, Tony this is Paul, I would tell you that and we\u2019ve talked about it a bit in previous calls. We have put a renewed focus on our DIY business. We've addressed many of the fundamentals expanding our store hours, additional training for our folks, we\u2019ve added some personnel in the stores, and we\u2019ve also are testing out a new retail store format Tony that we've began to roll-out in 2015.", "And it\u2019s very early yet, but we\u2019re pleased with the results and we'll be reviewing that the balance of this year and make a decision as we go into 2016.", "Generally what takes place, you mentioned our affiliates are independent owners, they will many times let us pioneer some new ideas and certainly new approaches. I think they will get on board when they see the kind of success that we're driving in the retail side.", "Many of our independent owners do a heck of a job today on the retail side of the business anyway. So it's early yet, Tony, but I would tell you we're pleased with the results that we are seeing.", "Tony Cristello", "Okay. Now that's great. I appreciate the time. Thank you.", "Carol Yancey", "Thank you.", "Tom Gallagher", "You're welcome. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carolina Jolly with Gabelli & Company.", "Carolina Jolly", "Thanks, good morning. So looking at your results, you've got some challenged end-market promotions. Has this distress made any potential acquisition targets, maybe something similar to Lake Erie, more willing to discuss a potential sale?", "Tom Gallagher", "Well, as you know, it takes a willing seller and a willing buyer. We are a willing buyer. We just have to find more willing sellers that are willing to sell at prices that we think are favorable to the shareholders of Genuine Parts Company.", "I mentioned in my comments that we have a couple more that we think we'll announce prior to year end, none of which will have any material influence on Q4. But will help us as we go into the first quarter of next year.", "So there are a number of conversations that are going on. A couple are further along and we feel confident that we'll get a few closed by year end and hopefully we can generate some additional interest from some others.", "Carolina Jolly", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Tom Gallagher", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan of Jefferies.", "Bret Jordan", "Morning. A good question. I guess as we talk about Mexico, and it was about a year ago that you began to go to Mexico with the NAPA brand as opposed to Auto Todo. Could you give us any color on how the traction is building there as you are rebranding?", "Tom Gallagher", "You bet, Bret. It was - you've got a good memory, it was just about exactly one year ago that we launched our initiative in Mexico and bringing the NAPA brand down to Mexico.", "We - where we are currently, we're on track, we're on target. We expect to end the year with 20 to 25 NAPA stores in the region. I would also tell you that probably since we last talked, we're in the process of recruiting a couple of strong entrepreneurial independent owners who are opening stores down in the region as well. So - so far we're on track.", "Bret Jordan", "Okay, and then one other regional question. You mentioned some of the energy states were a little softer than the average in performance in the quarter. How about the West ex the energy states? If you go all the way out to the coast, how was the regional performance there?", "Tom Gallagher", "Yes. So the west - and I did mention our team out West, but they are holding their own, Bret. They were right at the overall growth number for the commercial business and our overall business.", "So West is holding up okay. We're seeing, as I mentioned solid growth up and down the East Coast, all the way down into the southern and Florida groups, most of our softness or where our softness is, it's almost directly tied to some of those oil and gas markets.", "Bret Jordan", "Okay. And then one last question, as you were talking about M&A, is there any thought about increasing the Company-owned store base within NAPA, either just buying in independents as they retire or doing something more structural there?", "I mean, obviously, as you are getting a retail operation, you get maybe a better return on the average store. Is there a thought about upping the Company-owned store count?", "Tom Gallagher", "I think you'll see that happen as time goes on, Bret. Our basic philosophy is we'll own the stores in and around the major metropolitan areas and we'll have good independent owners in the outlying areas.", "And I don't think that will change materially going forward. But as a percentage of our total automotive volume going out a few years, you'll probably see the corporate stores represent a little bit higher percentage of the total volume than the independent stores do today.", "Bret Jordan", "All right. Great, thank you.", "Tom Gallagher", "All right, Bret.", "Operator", "Your next question \u2013 your final question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me in under the wire here. Couple of things, first of all, I guess, obviously, we did see at least a slight deceleration in auto despite what seemed to be pretty favorable weather for most of the quarter. So for the sake of focusing on an admittedly short-term issue, I guess the question is probably for Paul. Do you have concerns that we could start to see a little bit of incremental softening if the mild weather we've seen for most of the fall here continue deeper into the quarter?", "Paul Donahue", "Scot, you hit it. Our - we did see slight deceleration as the quarter progressed. We had a really strong both June and July saw a little bit of a downtick, slight downtick in August and September.", "It's early yet, but we're certainly optimistic that the quarter will come in as we projected. But I think as Tom mentioned in his comments, in the overall environment that we're in, we are in a - we are definitely in a grind it out kind of mode right now as we go into the fourth quarter.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "So would you attribute the little bit of deceleration that we saw in auto to weather or was it something else, just so it's kind of clear for everyone?", "Paul Donahue", "No, I don't think it's tied to weather, Scot. Actually the weather throughout the summer and even into September we had I think a warmer than normal summer, which resulted in some good numbers for us and categories like air conditioning was strong, batteries were solid in the quarter. So no, I don't think it attributable to weather at all.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Well, you've mentioned before that you guys are exposed to more industrial related to stuff in NAPA than maybe some of your competitors are. Is that where you are seeing it, some of the items that you've mentioned before on that front?", "Paul Donahue", "No, as I mentioned in a previous question, where we are seeing softness, it is directly in some of the more dominant oil and gas markets, Southwest for sure, some of the mountain areas, which includes some of the fracking country up in the Dakotas and Montana.", "We do - do a lot of business in the fleet, Scot. We do a lot of heavy duty business. We do a lot of heavy duty filter business and we are seeing some fairly significant declines in those categories in those markets.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Okay, I knew you mentioned the geography. I was just trying to clarify on the product. That's helpful. And then previously, I think, as Carol mentioned, you guys are comfortable with the receivables.", "Can you help us understand how much exposure you have to some of these troubled end markets? You've referenced mining, oil, gas, etc. and is there a point where you start to consider changes to terms to some of these customers as you try and protect against potential losses, just given the strain on some of their own balance sheets?", "Carol Yancey", "Actually, we very closely monitor accounts receivable and certainly what you are speaking about in the industrial area, right now, we're not taking steps, additional steps to modify anything. But I can tell you its just a constant focus on our receivables.", "We feel like we're in pretty good shape. We actually already have an outlook and an estimate for what our full year bad debt expense will be and we don't have anything that we're concerned about.", "I think our customers and the terms that we have, we have a pretty close insight as to what's going on. So I wouldn't see anything there.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Got you. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Carol Yancey", "All right.", "Tom Gallagher", "I've got just one last point. Keep in mind that I think across the enterprise our team has done a very good job in accounts receivable management. Carol pointed out earlier that we are down 1% in receivables year-over-year, which I think is a pretty good job.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Thanks, Tom. I appreciate that.", "Carol Yancey", "We'd like to thank everybody for participating in this quarter's conference call. And if you have any further questions, let us know.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.", "Now, I'd like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Sidney G. Jones - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company fourth quarter 2015 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2016.", "Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.", "We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Sid, and I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, GPC's President, along with Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and I will each handle a portion of today's call. And once we've completed our individual comments, we'll look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have.", "Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and year-end results, and hopefully you've all had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3.682 billion, which was down 4% with negative currency impact accounting for 3% of this decrease. Net income was $161.3 million, which was down 3%. Earnings per share were $1.07 this year, which was even with last year, and currency negatively impacted the EPS by $0.03 per share in the quarter.", "For the full year, sales were $15.280 billion, which was down four-tenths of 1%, with currency costing us 3 points of revenue growth. Net income was $706 million, which was down just under 1%, and earnings per share were $4.63 this year, compared to $4.61 in 2014. And for the full year, the currency impact was $0.14.", "After several years of solid performances, 2015 proved to be a more challenging year for us, largely attributable to the combination of the significant slowdown experienced in our Industrial and Electrical businesses, and the impact of unfavorable currency exchange, primarily on our Automotive business. Fortunately, as you'll hear from, Paul, in a few minutes, the underlying fundamentals remain positive for the Automotive segment, and each of our Automotive businesses are turning in solid local currency results.", "The Industrial Operations are our second-largest business segment, representing 30% of total company sales in this past year, and at the end of the year down 3%. And as we reported, over the course of the year, we saw a sequential revenue deceleration as the year progressed. After being up 3% in the first quarter, the Industrial Operations were down 2% in Q2, down 4% in Q3, and down 8% in the fourth quarter, and these results are reflective of the sluggish end-market conditions encountered by many of our Industrial customers.", "Customers in the oil and gas, original equipment manufacturing, iron and steel and heavy equipment rental were all down double-digits with us for a year. And as a point of information, the fourth quarter decreases were even more significant than the full-year declines, indicating the ongoing challenges faced by customers in each of these segments.", "Conversely, customers in aggregate in cements, food products, Automotive, lumber and wood products all generated positive results for us this past year. And then looking ahead, we would expect positive results from each of these customer categories in 2016 as well.", "At the same time, however, our expectation is for continued declines from customers in the oil and gas, original equipment manufacturing, iron and steel, and heavy equipment rental categories for several more quarters, which will certainly be a headwind to our overall sales results.", "In an effort to offset this, our Industrial team remains focused on key elements of their sales strategy including share of wallet initiatives with existing customers, expansion of our customer base, product line extensions, and expanding our geographic footprint and product capabilities through acquisitions. And on this last point, we're pleased to report two acquisitions that are scheduled to close on March 1 with combined revenue of approximately $50 million, and both companies nicely complement Motion's existing business, and they would help our growth rates over the remainder of the year.", "Moving on to our Electrical segment, EIS ended the year with sales of $751 million, which was up 2% and represents 5% of total company revenues. As with Motion, EIS had mixed results among their segments. Customers in the wire and cable and fabrication sides of the business generated nice increases, while customers in the Electrical side had decreases. The Electrical segment represents about 40% of EIS's total revenue, and similar to Motion, we are probably a few quarters away from seeing stabilization in this segment.", "In the meantime, they're employing many of the same growth strategies as Motion including acquisitions, and our expectation is to be in a position to announce a $50-million-plus acquisition in the weeks ahead, which will certainly have a nice positive impact on the EIS results in 2016.", "And a few comments on our Office Products Group, which represents 13% of total company sales in 2015. They ended the year with sales of just over $1.9 billion, and this was up 7.5%. The Office Products growth was fueled by incremental acquisition revenue and strong double-digit growth from the mega channel.", "Our independent reseller business was down low-single digits for the year, with most of this decrease coming in the second half of the year. On the product side, we had double-digit growth for the year in furniture and facility and breakroom supplies, and mid-single-digit growth in our core Office Product supplies. And we are pleased with the progress made in each of these categories. Technology products were flat for the year.", "And looking at our Office Products results over the course of the year, it was really a tale of two halves, with first half revenues being up 16% and second half revenues being up just slightly. The outsized first half increases were driven by the aforementioned incremental acquisition volume and increased revenue from the mega channel that was anniversaried early in Q3. And then we feel our second half results are more reflective of the ongoing underlying sluggish conditions in the Office Products industry.", "Many of the ongoing issues within the industry are secular in nature, and as a result, our team continues to work on market share and share of wallet initiatives, product line additions and extensions, product and channel diversification, as well as strategic acquisitions. You will recall that we completed the acquisition of Malt Industries late in 2015.", "Malt is a distributor of safety supplies and protective apparel with annual sales of about $20 million. We are pleased with their progress to date. This acquisition helped to further diversify our product and channel portfolios, and we will pursue additional acquisition opportunities to continue the strategy in the quarters ahead.", "So that's a quick overview of the non-Automotive segments, and Paul will now give you an update on the Automotive results. Paul?", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "Thank you, Tom. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you here today and to have an opportunity to provide you an update on our fourth quarter performance of our Automotive business.", "For the quarter ending December 31, our global Automotive sales were down 2% year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 2.5% in core Automotive growth and a slight benefit from acquisitions. However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 5% in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with the impact of currency we saw throughout 2015.", "Our U.S. team posted a 2% sales increase in the fourth quarter, compared with 3% growth experienced through the first nine months of 2015. Our international businesses, which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, reported another quarter of mid-single-digit growth in local currency. Despite challenging local economies, we remain encouraged by the steady and consistent growth we are experiencing across all of our international markets. We see no reason for this not to continue in 2016.", "In the U.S., our results varied by geographical region. Our business in the Northeast, Florida, Central and Western regions of the country continue to deliver solid results. The Midwest, Mountain and Southwest regions of the country all came in below our expectations.", "Given our strong commercial presence with fleets, including many in the battered oil and gas sector, we felt the effects across many of our stores throughout the Mountain and Southwest regions. Particularly hard-hit were stores in Texas, Oklahoma, Montana and the Dakotas. We also are seeing the effects across many of our stores in Western Canada. We would also add the above-average temperatures experienced in the fourth quarter across the Midwest and Mountain regions, negatively impacted our winter goods sales.", "So now let's turn to our same-store sales for the fourth quarter. Our U.S. company-owned store grew comp store sales in the fourth quarter by 2%. This compares to the 3% comp store increase we reported through nine months. Cadence of the quarter saw our team post solid results in both October and December. In fact, we were encouraged as we entered the fourth quarter as October same-stores sales were our second-best results of the year. The month of November proved to be the outlier, and we believe warmer-than-normal temps in the month caused this downturn.", "This quarter's 2% increase is on top of the 7% increase generated in the fourth quarter of 2014, giving us a two-year stack of 9%. This increase was driven by a combination of gains on both our commercial side of our business, as well as by our retail business.", "So let's start with our retail results. As mentioned in our Q3 call, we continue to expand or revamp DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group. These initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extended store hours, increased training for our store associates, and the nationwide launch of our NAPA Rewards Program to name just a few. And while we are in the early days of rolling out these initiatives, we are pleased with the initial results.", "Our plans call for us to expand our 20-store impact pilot in 2016 to include an additional 150 company-owned stores. These initiatives are having a positive impact on our results. And for the fourth quarter, we can report a total increase of 5% in our retail business. Coupling this 5% increase with the 11% increase we posted in Q4 of 2014, gives us a two-year stack of 16%. For the full year, our retail business was up 6%.", "These gains are being driven by both transaction and basket size increases. In Q4, we experienced a mid-single-digit increase in our average retail ticket, and a significant jump in the number of retail tickets.", "Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business. This segment of our Automotive business posted a 2% increase in the fourth quarter and a two-year stack of 8%. So, for the year, we can report a 3% increase in our commercial business. The core elements of this segment continue to center around our Major Account business and our NAPA AutoCare business.", "In 2015, we expanded our AutoCare membership count, which now totals 16,300-plus across the U.S. Both our AutoCare and Major Account businesses generated mid-single-digit growth for the year. We believe the slowdown in the Industrial sector had a material impact on our fleet business in the quarter. This business was up just 1% after delivering 3-plus percent increases in the previous three quarters. Our Q4 two-year stack on our fleet business now stands at 6%.", "Our wholesale ticket trend was consistent with what we experienced in the third quarter. Our average wholesale ticket value was up mid-single digits, with little or no benefit from inflation, while we saw a slight decline in the number of tickets moving through our stores.", "So, now, let's take a look at a few of our key product categories and review the trends we experienced in the fourth quarter. Our brakes category was a highlight again in the quarter, and it has been a strong category for us all year. The brakes category grew low-double digits for us in the fourth quarter. And we also saw experienced \u2013 we also experienced solid growth in our tool and equipment business. An area of concern would be in our battery business, which was off slightly in the quarter. We believe this is attributable to the warmer winter temperatures.", "And we can report this business has now bounced back in the month of January, and our team drove a double-digit increase in the month of January. We continue to be encouraged with the strong growth we are experiencing from our NAPA import parts business. This business was up high-single digits in the quarter and posted double-digit growth for the year. On February 1, we announced the acquisition of Olympus Imported Parts.", "Olympus is a 30-year business specializing in professional-grade import auto parts. They currently operate out of six locations in the Northern Virginia and Greater D.C. area and generate approximately $25 million in annualized revenues. This business will be a nice complement to our growing NAPA import business, as well as our Altrom import parts business. We'd like to extend a warm welcome to Mike Brown and the entire Olympus team to Genuine Parts Company.", "We'd also like to provide you with an update on a previously discussed acquisition target. During our third quarter call, we reviewed with you the pending acquisition of Covs Parts, a 25-branch distribution company based in Western Australia. While we had hoped to close this transaction in the fourth quarter, we encountered regulatory approval delays, moving the expected close of this transaction to no later than April 1 of this year.", "With approval for 21 branches, the addition of Covs Parts further expands our market presence and scale in Western Australia, and is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $70 million. This acquisition will expand our industry-leading presence in Australia and New Zealand and puts us over the 500-store mark. We are proud of our team in Asia Pacific and look forward to another solid year from this business in 2016. As we look to the immediate future, strategic M&A will continue to be a growth lever for our Automotive businesses both in the U.S. and abroad.", "Turning to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow, lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer, and miles driven continues to post substantial gain. Miles driven actually increased 3.5% through the first 11 months of the year, which is a new record. In addition, the latest month with reported figures is November, which was up 4.3% year-over-year, also a new record. This now makes 21 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, and it certainly is driving \u2013 these key metrics are driven by lower fuel cost.", "The natural \u2013 the national average price of gas in 2015 was $2.40 per gallon, which was the second lowest annual average in the past 10 years. Gas prices continue to move downward, and in the most part of the U.S. today, they average less than $2 a gallon. These low gas prices should bode well for future increases in both miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases.", "In closing, we are pleased to show positive underlying Automotive growth for both the quarter and the year in a challenging economic environment. And we are encouraged with the start of the New Year, as our sales in January were more in line with our historical run rates. We remain hopeful we can carry this momentum through to the end of the quarter and the balance of 2016.", "As we move into 2016, our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing our retail strategy, and driving global expansion via new store openings, as well as targeted strategic acquisitions.", "I want to thank our teams of both in North America as well as Australasia for their efforts, and appreciate all they do for the GPC Automotive business.", "So that completes our overview of the GPC Automotive business. And at this time, I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We will begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full-year income statements and the segment information, and then we'll review some key balance sheet and other financial items.", "As Tom mentioned, our total revenues of $3.7 billion for the fourth quarter were down 4%, and consist of a decrease in underlying sales of 2%, a currency headwind of 3%, and acquisitions contributed 1%. For the year, total revenues of $15.3 billion consisted of core sales growth of 1.5% and a 1% contribution from acquisitions, offset by a 3% currency headwind. Our gross profit for the fourth quarter was 29.75% down from 30.0% gross margin last year. And for the year, gross margin of 29.8%, compared to 29.9% reported last year.", "Primarily, our gross margins for the fourth quarter and the full-year benefited from improved margins in our Automotive, Office, and Electrical businesses, but our growth in these segments was offset by the continued pressure of lower supplier incentives earned in our Industrial business. This directly related to the sluggish sales environment and lower inventory purchases for this group.", "We recognize the need for additional progress on this line and the importance of executing on our gross margin initiatives. This is a key priority for our management team, and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long term.", "Our gross margin initiatives are critical to offset the low inflationary environment that has persisted across our businesses for several years now, especially in Automotives. Our cumulative supplier price changes in 2015 were negative two-tenths \u2013 20 basis points, two-tenths of 1% for Automotive, positive 90 basis points for Industrial, positive 60 basis points for Office Products, and negative 1.75% for Electrical.", "Turning to SG&A, our total expenses for the fourth quarter were $834 million, or 22.65% of sales, which is a 40-basis-point improvement from the prior year. For the full year, our total expenses of $3.4 billion, at 22.46% of sales, or a 20-basis-point improvement. The improvement in our SG&A expenses reflects the positive impact of our cost control measures across all of our businesses.", "Additionally, we had added savings of lower incentive compensation in the fourth quarter relative to 2014. Overall, our cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by the deleveraging of expenses in our Industrial business, as well as the increases in expenses across the company in areas such as employee benefits and retirement plans and healthcare. Our teams remain focused on controlling expenses, and we continue to take actions to further improve our productivity and streamline our operations.", "We expect to show continued progress on this line in the periods ahead. If we look at our results for the segment, our Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion, down 2% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $169 million is up 12.5%, and their margin improved a strong 110 basis points due to the improved gross margins and expense control. For the year, Automotive sales of $8 billion are down 1%.", "Our operating profit of $729 million is up 4%, and our margin has improved by 40 basis points to 9.1%, so a solid margin expansion for Automotive in 2015.", "Our Industrial sales of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 8%. Our operating profit of $72 million is down 24.8%, and our operating margin was down 150 basis points to 6.5%. For the year, Industrial sales of $4.6 billion are down 2.6% from the prior year, and our operating profit of $339 million is down 8.3%, and our margin was 7.3%, which is down 50 basis points from last year. This is driven by a lower incentives and expense deleverage, which pressured this group throughout the year but at a greater amount in the fourth quarter.", "Our Office Products revenues were $459 million in the quarter, down 2%. Our operating profit of $33 million is down 5%, and their operating margin of 7.3% is down 20 basis points. For the year, Office revenues of $1.9 billion are up 7.5% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $141 million is up 5%, and our margin of 7.3% is down 10 basis points from last year.", "The Electrical Group had sales in the quarter of $177 million, which is basically flat with the prior year. Our operating profit of $16 million is up 6.7%, so the margin for this group showed strong growth of 60 basis points to 9.1%. For the year, sales for this group of $751 million are up 1.6%, and their operating profit of $70 million is up 9%, and their margin improved to 9.3%, which is a solid 50-basis-point increase from the prior year.", "For both the fourth quarter and the full year, our total operating margin improved by 10 basis points. For the quarter, the margin was 7.9% compared to 7.8%; and for the year, 8.4% compared to 8.3%. This improvement in 2015 follows our 30-basis-point expansion in 2014, and given this current sales environment, we're very pleased with our continued progress in this area.", "Looking ahead, further margin expansion remains a key goal for the company. We had net interest expense of $4.3 million in the quarter, and for the 12 months, interest expense was $20.4 million, which compares to $24.2 million in 2014. For 2016, we currently estimate net interest expense to approximate $21 million to $22 million for the full year. Our total amortization expense of $9 million for the fourth quarter and $35 million for the full year is down slightly from 2014.", "We currently estimate total amortization expense of $36 million to $38 million for the full year in 2016. Our depreciation of $27 million for the fourth quarter and $107 million for the full year, and for 2016, we're projecting this to be approximately $120 million to $130 million. So, combined, depreciation and amortization looking ahead would be in the range of $155 million to $170 million.", "The other line which primarily reflects our corporate expense was $16.3 million for the quarter, which is up slightly from the prior-year quarter. For the full year, our corporate expense is $100.4 million, which is consistent with our expectations and up from the $90 million in the prior year. Primarily unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustments of $7 million and planned IT-related investments accounted for the increase on this line.", "Turning to 2016, we expect the corporate expense line to be in the $110 million to $120 million range for the full year. Our tax rate was 38.35% for the fourth quarter and 37.2% for the full year. These rates are up from 2014 due to the changes in mix of our foreign income and the related foreign tax rates, as well as the unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustments recorded through the first nine months of 2015. We currently expect our tax rates to approximate 37% for the full year in 2016.", "Our net income for the quarter of $161.3 million and our EPS of $1.07 was equal to the prior year. And for the year, our EPS of $4.63 was up slightly from the $4.61 for last year.", "Now let's talk about the balance sheet which we strengthened in the fourth quarter with effective working capital management and strong cash flows.", "Our cash at December was $212 million, which is an increase from the $138 million at December 31 last year. Our cash position continues to support our growth initiatives across all of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable of $1.8 billion at December 31 is down 3% from the prior year on a 4% decrease in sales in the fourth quarter. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time.", "Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3 billion, down 1% from the prior year. Our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels and we will remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward in 2016.", "Accounts payable at December 31 was $2.8 billion, up 10%, and this is due to the positive impact of our improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We're pleased with our continued improvement in this area, and we're encouraged by the positive impact on our working capital and days and payables. Our working capital of $1.6 billion at December 31 has significantly improved from the prior year in both absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues. Our progress in this area contributed significantly to our record cash flows for the year. Effectively managing our working capital and in particular, accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable remains a high priority for our company.", "Our total debt of $625 million at December 31 is down approximately $140 million from the $765 million in the prior year. Our debt includes two $250 million term notes as well as another $125 million in borrowings under our multicurrency revolving line of credit. Our debt-to-capitalization is at 16.5%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe it provides our company with both the financial capacity and the flexibility, necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue.", "So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We generated record cash flows in 2015, driven in part by our improvement in working capital. Cash from operations was $1.2 billion and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, was $682 million. This is a meaningful accomplishment for us. And for 2016, we're currently planning for another strong year of cash flows.", "We would expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range and free cash flow of approximately $400 million to $450 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value.", "Our priorities for cash includes strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us, and they're integral to the growth plans of our company. In 2015, we made a number of strategic acquisitions to expand our distribution footprint, and in total, these new businesses are expected to contribute $180 million in annual revenues.", "Thus far in 2016, we've added the Olympus Imported Parts distribution business, as covered by Paul. And looking forward in 2016, we will continue to seek new acquisition opportunities across all of our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Although many of these opportunities will continue to be bolt-on-type companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, we are still open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large and small, assuming the appropriate returns on investment.", "Turning to our share repurchases in 2015, we used our cash to repurchase 3.3 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program. Through today, we have also purchased another 570,000 shares of stock, and today we have 5.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we have been slightly more aggressive with our repurchases given the value of our stock price over the last 12 months to 14 months.", "We expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best returns to our shareholders. Our investment and capital expenditures was $48 million for the fourth quarter, which is an increase from the $34 million in the prior year.", "For the year, our capital spending was $110 million, up slightly from the prior year. We are currently planning for capital expenditures to increase further in 2016 to approximately $140 million to $160 million with the vast majority of our investments weighted towards productivity enhancing projects, primarily in technology.", "Effective yesterday, the board approved a $2.63 per share annual dividend for 2016, marking our 60th consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders. This represents a 7% increase from the $2.46 per share and is approximately 57% of our prior year earnings. This was slightly above our stated goal of a payout ratio of 50% to 55%, but we're comfortable going beyond this range from time to time due to our strong cash flows.", "So this concludes our financial update for the fourth quarter and the full year. And in summary, we operated in 2015 with relatively mixed results. That said, we improved the strength of our balance sheet with excellent working capital management, and effective cost control measures helped us produce an expanded operating profit margin.", "Additionally, we generated record cash flows and a record earnings per share for 2015. These are meaningful accomplishments and our progress in these areas supports our investment and growth opportunities such as acquisitions, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders with the dividend and share repurchases.", "We look forward to updating you on our future progress in the periods ahead. And I'd like to thank all of our GPC associates for their hardwork and their commitment to their jobs.", "I'll turn it now back over to Tom.", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Carol. So that will conclude our prepared comments on 2015. And in closing, we would say as mentioned earlier, that it was a challenging year in many ways but a gratifying year in other ways. Our revenue production in local currencies was solid across our Automotive businesses as it was in Office Products, but Industrial and Electrical found it more difficult.", "We were pleased to see strong operating margin improvements in Automotive and Electrical, but we had operating margin declines in Office Products and Industrial. We were, however, able to show a 10-basis-point improvement for GPC overall despite the Office Products and Industrial challenges.", "Gross profit was down 12 basis points for the year, but good work was done on the SG&A side, and SG&A was down 20 basis points. As a result, pre-tax income was up slightly, but due to the higher tax rate that Carol explained, net income was down slightly. On the balance sheet side, the progress was more consistent, with cash from operations and free cash, both setting new records and working capital was reduced once again in 2015.", "And we returned well over $600 million back to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. And we reinvested over $225 million back into the business through a combination of capital expenditures and acquisitions, and we expect to invest an additional $125 million in acquisitions over the next few months. And these CapEx and acquisition investments are intended to drive revenue and profit growth in the quarters ahead.", "Now, turning to the year ahead, as a general statement, we would say that we remain quite cautious in our outlook. The general economic conditions look a bit fragile and perhaps tenuous both domestically and globally. And as mentioned earlier, this is already having a significant impact on certain segments of our customer base, primarily in Industrial and Electrical. Conversely, we think that the outlook for our Automotive segment is generally favorable, but the currency impact will once again be a headwind to our Automotive growth in 2015.", "With all of that said, at this point, we would expect our 2016 revenues to be up 2% to 3% in Automotive with a currency headwind of 3%; Industrial, up 1% to 2%; Electrical, up 1% to 2%; Office Products, down 1% to up 1%; giving us a total GPC revenue expectation of being up 1% to 2% and up 3% to 4% before the currency impact. And with revenue growth at these levels, we would suggest an EPS range of $4.70 to $4.80, which will be up 1.5% to 3.5% after currency exchange impact of approximately $0.08 per share, and before the currency exchange impact, would be up 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis.", "At this point, we'd like to address your questions, and we'll turn the call back to Chris.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we will take our first question from Elizabeth Suzuki of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Just wondering how much of the SG&A leverage in the fourth quarter was the result of lower stock compensation? And what other cost reductions were made in order to generate the impressive operating margins in the quarter?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Elizabeth, we would talk about that. I guess I would say primarily it's more coming in the areas of productivity improvements, and we've talked a lot about the investments we've made in technology and productivity things, and that would be both on our warehouses and our stores. Also I would point out additional leverage in our shared services and areas we're doing there.", "Even in our freight, we look at freight and optimization of our routes, fuel prices, we had improvement there. And then even bringing on some of the acquisitions. We're able to bring them on and put them on what we call the GPC programs, and we get the benefit of better pricing for those folks.", "So to a lesser extent, you'd have the impact of lower bonuses and commissions, and then kind of a tightening up that we do, like on travel and some areas such as that.", "Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. So stock comp wasn't really a material benefit?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It's really a combination of all those things. That was certainly not the primary. It's more in the productivity and some of the things that we're doing in improving our cost overall.", "Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And for the Automotive segment, you noted that there was a weather impact in the fourth quarter since it was relatively warm through December. Do you think that should reverse in the first quarter, so that the average of 4Q and 1Q would be about the same year-over-year from a weather perspective?", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "Yeah. Elizabeth, this is Paul. We'd certainly hope to see it. What we're seeing in the early part of the year is encouraging. And certainly the folks up in the Northeast, Boston, New York are feeling the impact of colder temps returning, and we're seeing a bit of it in the Midwest as well. So, absolutely, we are encouraged with some of the weather changes we're seeing.", "Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you.", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "You're welcome.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We go next to Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Seth.", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "Good morning, Seth.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "My first question is on auto, just trying to understand a little bit better your expectations for 2016. You're looking for a growth of 2% to 3% on revenues, with a 3% FX headwind. So looking for core growth in the mid-single digit range, is that correct?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's right.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. In terms of the drivers of that core growth, weather might normalize a little bit, but are there any other initiatives that you can speak to that could help improve your business in 2016 relative to 2015?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Paul and I might double team this. But in his comments, he highlighted several things that we think are going to give us some good production in the year ahead. He talked about the top store initiative, and we'll add 150 of those this coming year and that will certainly be a benefit to us. So we've got other new distribution initiatives that will also help us. Paul mentioned some of the growth we're experiencing with NAPA AutoCare and with Major Accounts; we would expect that to continue in the year ahead. Our import program is performing well and we did add Olympus, the recent acquisition, so that will fuel growth there. So just a number of different things that we expect to have a positive impact as we go ahead.", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "Yeah. I would add to that, Tom. We \u2013 Seth, we'll continue to be opportunistic and fairly aggressive on the acquisition front, both in the U.S. as well as international as evident by our Covs acquisition. We do hope to close that here very soon in Australia. And we continue to expand our presence in Mexico as well, and, as you know, we launched our NAPA initiative down there in late 2014. It's early yet, but we remain encouraged by what we see in those markets as well.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Got it. Just to quantify it, approximately how much do you expect acquisitions to contribute to auto revenues in 2016?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The only one we've included in our guidance is Olympus. And just as a general statement, we normally will not include anything that we've not got a very, very high degree of confidence. And we've got a letter of intent and we've got a closing date, so we included Olympus. On the Industrial side, we included the two acquisitions that will close on March 1. But beyond that, we've not included any of the others in the guidance that we've given you.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Got it, thank you. And then my second question, really good performance on cash flow in 2015. As you look forward, it seems like you're expecting much higher at least percentage increase in CapEx and may not see as much payables leverage. Can you help us understand those two moving pieces to your cash flow expectations?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Talk about CapEx first. I mean, some of the CapEx, and you saw that we were lower than what our guidance was for 2015, some of that is the timing of projects. But I would specifically call out, we have a couple distribution center refreshes, relocations where we're enhancing again the productivity.", "And so that's built into there. And then some of our IT investments that we've talked about, and certainly in the warehouse management area. But again, some of it is the timing on projects. But we're certainly comfortable with the range we've given.", "And then you mentioned on the improvements for cash flow, I mean, one of our sources of cash from operations was in the decrease in accounts receivable. We had almost a $200 million source from accounts receivable, more related to our decrease in sales. So that's why we're guiding to a little bit lower number because we think that receivables won't be as much of a help to us in 2016.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Got it. Thank you very much and good luck.", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Seth.", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI.", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. I had a quick follow-up for Carol, and then I wanted to ask Paul and Tom a couple, one thing. Carol, on the working capital, the AP-to-inventory ratio also improved a lot. Was there something there in timing, or do you think that could get to 100% from I guess what's now a little over 90%?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. We were pleased to see that be at 94% at the end of the year, and as you mentioned, improvements from the 84% the prior year. We don't have a set target for 2016, but I would tell you that we certainly would expect continued improvement. And there wasn't anything that drove that in particular in the fourth quarter.", "We continue to see improvement across all of our businesses. And that was really done despite lower inventory purchases in the Industrial sector, too", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "Good. So that still has room to go, it sounds like?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It does.", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "Great. And then I'm not sure, Paul or Tom, who wants it, but if you think about this year and the guidance and some of the history of weather, if I go back to 2012, which I think is the last time we had a winter that was kind of mild to start, your comps decelerate, I think, maybe 400 basis points over a couple of quarters. Help us understand why this time could be different, or why we expect that auto should hold in there for the next couple of quarters?", "And I also wanted to make sure, Tom, you said Industrial would be up 1% to 2% this year. What accounts for that inflection from at least the second half of 2015's trend? Thanks a lot.", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. We'll take the Automotive first. I think we're basing our guidance more on some of the underlying strategies than we are on any weather impact. And the issues that \u2013 or the initiatives that Paul and I detailed just a moment ago, I think, are the primary reasons that we've guided to the levels we've guided at. So I think we're pretty comfortable at those levels as we work our way through 2016.", "In terms of the inflection in Industrial, there are two things. Again, the comment I made about we'll be adding $50 million of annualized revenue as of March 1 with the two acquisitions that we're making, that's one thing. And then the second thing, it's \u2013 six weeks does not a trend make by any stretch. But what we saw on a per day basis in January and what we've seen through mid-month February is a little bit better than what we experienced certainly in Q4 of this past year. And the other thing is not included in the guidance would be an expectation that we might be able to make another acquisition or two over the course of the year in Industrial.", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "Great. And that bit better on a per-day basis, was that more in the oil and gas and some of the areas that have been weak? Or is it already there? Has it already been positively improved?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I think it's more across those segments that have held up reasonably well.", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "Great. Thanks a lot. Good luck.", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. Thank you.", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "Thank you.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question relates to capital allocation, and you're use of free cash. I think I detected a change at least in the rhetoric and prioritization. Historically you've always cited the dividend first, and today you cited strategic acquisitions and went into some depth in that.", "So is that my imagination, or is there some intent? Obviously, you've been raising the dividend for many, many decades, and that I know is not expected to change, but does that speak to an increased focus on strategic deals for you?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I don't know that it necessarily signals an increased focus, but there's a heavy emphasis and focus on strategic acquisitions right now, and we've actually got more discussions going than we had at certain points in the past. So, we're encouraged by the number of conversations that we're engaged in, and we would expect a certain number of those to come to fruition.", "And quite frankly, I think if we had 2015 to play over, we might have been even more aggressive on the acquisition front, but we just didn't find \u2013 we're unable to engage in enough discussions. But I think we've gotten that sorted out, and we're pleased with the level of activity we see there right now.", "So I don't think it at all indicates reduced interest in increasing the dividend, lower reduced interest in appropriate levels of share repurchase or CapEx expenditures across the businesses, but we're bit more optimistic about our opportunities on the acquisition right now than it might have been this time last year.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And Tom, would you expect most of your deals to be of similar size to the kinds of transactions that we have noted over the past several years in terms of general range?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I would say that's right. However, as Carol mentioned, if we would have find something larger that made sense for the shareholders then we would certainly like the opportunity to engage in that discussion. And the nice thing about our balance sheet is that we've got the wherewithal to fund acquisitions that are larger.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And then shifting gears, just digging a little bit deeper into the Automotive P&L, you had quite a move in the profitability of that business in the absence of any kind of sales momentum. I understand that last year's margin compare in Automotive was somewhat depressed, so that might help the year-on-year compare, but can you just give us a little more color on what helped you generate that Automotive profitability?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I would call out \u2013 so in the quarter, I would say that of the 110 basis point improvement, a third of that came from gross margin and two-thirds was from SG&A. So our core gross profit and we've called this out before, we've seen continued quarterly improvement in our core gross profits for Automotive. And that's both in the U.S. and our international businesses and there has been specific things done in our foreign businesses to really take control of gross profit, especially with the headwinds that they've had on the strong U.S. dollar.", "And then two-thirds of the improvement came from SG&A, and it's some of the things that we called out earlier. So, again, Automotive has done a terrific job on the productivity side. And again, calling out some specific things they've done with investments in technology and systems and the warehouses and the stores. And then also, again, the freight, we've talked about route optimizations in some of those areas. And then, to a lesser extent, you had lower bonuses and incentives that impacted that in the quarter as well.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And were there reversals of any accruals in that business of year-to-date numbers that perhaps went the other way in Q4?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "There weren't anything else that we haven't already called out.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Matthew.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan, next we turn to Mark Becks.", "Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. The sales outlook of plus 1% to 2% in earnings, that seems to imply kind of flat to up slightly EBIT margins. Is that, in fact, accurate? And then, how does that parse out between Automotive and Industrial? Presumably Automotive would be expected to be up a little, and then on the other side Industrial, I guess, would be expected to be down slightly? Is that the way to think about it?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Mark, I guess, we are probably implying \u2013 what we would imply is that we'd have some slight improvement in our operating margins. And I think what you called out is we would expect probably to see that, depending on the top line, more in the other sectors than the Industrial ones. But we're more implying for a slight improvement on the operating margin. I mean, we've called out we still have our corporate expense numbers a little higher. But again, I think we can be up slightly with what we're targeting.", "Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, I guess, the other side of the ledger with Matt's question, you guys have been steadfastly committed to the dividend. I think you have a targeted payout ratio of 50% to 55%. And with your dividend announcement today it takes you slightly outside. Given your proven ability with strong cash flows, why is the 50% to 55% the right number? And then would you have any considerations for taking that up?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll try to answer that, Mark. This is Tom. First of all, the 50% to 55% is somewhat of an informal stated objective, and over time, we've come to conclude that a payout at that level is a reward and return back to the shareholder, while at the same time leaving us adequate funding to do the other things that we want to get done.", "So, yes, we're slightly above that. I think we're 57% of prior-year earnings with the recent dividend increase. I don't think you'll see us take that up materially from there. I think we'll take that, the capital that we're generating, the cash we're generating and invest it in some of these other areas.", "Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Understood. And then last quick clarification for Carol. You have that $250 million in November due. Any initial thoughts on that?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It's still premature, but our thoughts on that, is that we'll probably do some type of a renewal as we get close to the end of the year.", "Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Up next, we go to Bret Jordan of Jefferies.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, good morning.", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "Hey.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Bret.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "A quick question on the top store rollout, you're adding 150. If that were successful, how many of your stores do you think are applicable here? I mean, how big could that concept get?", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "So, Bret, we're planning on 150 this year of our company-owned stores. We could go a bit greater in that number. We're going to see kind of how the first half plays out.", "When we've got stores that are in not exactly prime retail locations, so backstreets, more Industrial areas, we will certainly refresh those stores, but we will not go to the full top-store formats. But right now, we feel very good about our ability to roll out the 150, could expand it. We will also \u2013 any new stores and/or any new relocations this year, we will move to the new store format. And then at the appropriate time, we'll also bring in our independent owners who are ready to make that kind of a commitment as well.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then a question on Olympus. I mean, it's a $25 million revenue business. Is that something that you're getting a catalog you can roll out across the rest of the network that it will contribute in that import parts category more quickly? Or is that just something you're going to grow off of a relatively small base more slowly?", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "So, Bret, we are already and have had an import business inside of the NAPA network for a number of years that's Altrom. So we've been in that space. Olympus will be a nice bolt-on addition to that business, and we'll certainly bring with it increased expertise. They've got a great management team, an experienced management team. We've got expansion opportunities up there in that marketplace, but we're excited to bring those guys on board.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay, but there was nothing special about their catalog that you acquired that is leverageable?", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "No. No. No.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "All right. You're welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tony Cristello of BB&T Capital Markets.", "Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Tony.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Morning.", "Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets", "I wanted to ask a follow-up on some of the discussion with M&A. It sounds as if there is certainly an acceleration, and perhaps you had an appetite to maybe even have done more in 2015. Is that a result of more willing sellers or multiples have come in? Or are there some distressed businesses out there that you feel like you can pick up and gain some market share from right now?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Tony, I think it's more of the former two than the last point. We're not really bottom-fishing. We're not looking for distressed businesses. We're looking for businesses that give us an opportunity to expand geographically, or give us product diversification, and that fit us strategically for the long haul.", "I think, as I mentioned earlier to a prior question, I think we're just seeing right now the opportunity to at least engage in more discussions with certain sellers than perhaps we had seen a year ago. And certainly we're interested in following not just the discussions we're in now through to completion, but also identifying some additional opportunities that we could add to the organization.", "Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets", "Has the marketplace afforded more reasonable valuations for you as well?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, yeah, and I think you probably know at least we consider ourselves to be a fairly disciplined buyer, and there have been times in the past where we've engaged in discussions and we couldn't chin to the valuations and feel it was appropriate for our shareholders. But right now, we seem to have a number of folks that fit in the ranges that we would use for valuation purposes.", "Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. And switching gears a little bit, if you look across your competitive landscape and each of your segments, you've done an excellent job of keeping your inventory appropriate. Do you feel your competitors are also reacting accordingly to what appears to be at least in the non-auto segments a bit more of a sluggish or challenging environment?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Tony, if we could \u2013 something happened where you broke up a little bit there. Would you mind repeating the question?", "Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets", "Sure, I'm sorry. Across the categories, I was wondering from a competitive standpoint, you've done a very good job on managing your inventory levels and keeping things somewhat appropriate. When you look across some of your competitive segments, and more so in the Industrial side, do you believe your peers are also reacting accordingly?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I don't know that I'd be in a position to address that honestly. The thing that I would say is that having the right amount of inventory and the right mix of inventory is a high priority for us across all of the businesses. And I think it's played out reasonably well for us and I expect that it'll be a heavy initiative for us going forward as well. I can't address what the competitors are doing.", "Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. Okay. Very good. Thank you for your time.", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Tony.", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "Thank you", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning, guys.", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "Good morning, Scot.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning. So I know you don't break out CapEx by division, but even as I look at the entire company, your CapEx is somewhere between a half and a quarter of your biggest Automotive competitors. And I know your model is, obviously, a bit different with the wholesale component, but I guess the question is do you believe those levels of CapEx are sustainable, number one? And number two, it does appear that some of those competitors are actually accelerating their own capital investments. So I guess in a nutshell the question is, do you think you're going to need to accelerate your capital investments at some point?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I would take a first stab at that and Carol may jump in. But in the guidance that Carol provided, she said $140 million to $160 million in 2016, which is up a bit from where we have been historically. And I think for modeling purposes, you could probably use that for the years after 2016. So it is a little bit heavier. We're investing a bit heavier.", "And as Carol mentioned, it's for facility refreshments to enable us to be more productive in the throughput. It's for technology investments that enable us to either have better management information or enable us to be more productive in what we do. And at least as we look out over the next couple of years, it appears that that's an appropriate level for the next several years.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I guess, I think the only other two things I'd add is one is our maintenance level of CapEx, if you will, the amount we need to do each year is probably more in the $100 million range. And the other thing is we have our distribution footprint out there. I mean, we're really in all the areas we need to be.", "So, if anything, it's \u2013 we have a lighter level of investments on real estate. So more of ours is in the technology, productivity areas with systems. And so if we have investments in real estate, it's more due to a relocation or refresh.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then you guys did talk about there's quite a bit of regional variability in the auto business, obviously weather had an impact. I'm assuming part of that is also the, let's call it, stores in the oil patch or energy patch. Can you give us some more color around the magnitude of the differences experienced market by market?", "Paul D. Donahue - President", "Yes. Scot, this is Paul. What we saw in those markets that performed well, and I think I called out the East, certainly the Northeast, Florida, Central, out West, those businesses in Q4 all grew mid-single digits, good solid growth. The other end of the spectrum, and I believe I called out the Southwest and the Mountains, certainly impacted by oil and gas and Midwest, which we believe was more weather-related, were down low-single digits.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Perfect. All right. Thanks, guys.", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Thanks, Scot.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Carolina Jolly of Gabelli.", "A. Carolina Jolly - Gabelli & Co.", "Thanks, guys, for taking my question.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "A. Carolina Jolly - Gabelli & Co.", "Good morning. In regards to the Industrial side of the business or Motion, what is your sense of inventory at your customers? And do you expect, I guess, any destocking going forward into 2016?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Carolina, I'll try to answer that one. Most of what we sell on the Industrial side is not for customer inventory. It's for something that they need right now. So inventory fluctuations are not that big of a factor for us honestly. So what we do see is we do have some customers that would hold some inventory. And if they're a multi-location customer, we do see them employing what we might call a buy \u2013 or use what we own already.", "So we do see some inventory transfer among plants under the same ownership, but I don't think inventory fluctuations are going to have a material effect on our demand patterns over the next year.", "A. Carolina Jolly - Gabelli & Co.", "Great. Thanks.", "Thomas C.

And each of has a few prepared comments and once completed, we'll look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have.", "Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2016 results, and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3.718 billion, which was down one half of 1%. Net income was $158 million, which was down 1.9% and earnings per share were $1.05 this year, which was even with the $1.05 reported in the first quarter of last year.", "Once again this quarter, currency exchange was a headwind to all of our results. The impact of the strength of the US dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Mexican currencies was 1.6% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share in earnings per share. Stated another way in constant currency sales were up 1.1% and EPS was up 1%. While a bit better than the reported results, we still find ourselves revenue challenged primarily in our non-Automotive businesses and this is clearly pointed out if we look at the results by segment without currency impact.", "In constant currency our Automotive business was up 4.4%, industrial was down 1.7%, Office Products was down 2.5% and Electrical was down 3.4%. So the difference between our Automotive operations and our remaining three segments is quite pronounced and Paul will cover the Automotive segment in a few minutes. At first I\u2019ll make a few comments on the non-Automotive businesses starting with industrial.", "Motion industries ended the quarter down 2.5% on a reported basis and down 1.7% in constant currency. And although we continued to run decreases in this segment, we are just a bit encouraged by these results for two reasons. First, the first quarter of 2015 was our strongest quarter of the year at plus 3% and secondly, our Q1 2016 decrease was a smallest decrease that we\u2019ve seen in several quarters. Additionally our mid mine [ph] paper results are modestly positive and hopefully this is something that we can maintain as we move forward in the month and in the quarters ahead.", "However, it is important to point out that if you look at our performance by industry segment, by tough customers and by tough product categories, it shows just how uneven and choppy our business continues to be. If we look at our top 12 industry segments, first we have six that are up and six that are down. On the positive side in no order our lumber and wood products, boot products, cement, chemicals and automotive. On the down side we have, oil and gas, equipment and machinery, iron and steel and equipment rental and leasing.", "Our top 20 customers are actually up low single digit, with 15 of these customers running positive results thus far, but five are down. In our top 12 product categories, six are up and six are down. So as you can see, it\u2019s a real mixture with solid results in a number of areas being offset by weaker results in other areas. And all of this in our opinion is reflected of the tepid state of the economy both domestically and globally. But this is the environment that we\u2019ll face for a bit longer and we\u2019ll try to offset this with a combination of specific market share initiatives and acquisitions.", "Moving on to EIS, our Electrical distribution segment, this group ended the quarter down 3% and some of the same factors that impacted our industrial business were headwinds for the Electrical segment as well. Things like the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment, lower defense spending, lower corporate pricing again in the quarter which caused just over 1% in sales growth. The impact of the stronger dollar on our export oriented customers and the overall sluggish economic climate. And these factors we think will persist for a bit longer, but it\u2019s interesting to look at the individual performances of the three segments that comprise EIS.", "You may recall that the Electrical segment is our largest representing about 40% of the total company revenue, fabrication and wire and cable each represent about 30% and in general fabrication and wire and cable both had positive results in the quarter, but Electrical was down mid-teens. So our challenges are primarily concentrated in the Electrical portion of the business and our folks are working hard to turn this segment around, while at the same time working to maintain the positive results in the fabrication and wire and cable segments.", "And finally a few comments on Office Products. As reported earlier this segment was down 3% in the quarter with mid single digit growth in the mega channel being offset by high single digit decline with our independent resellers. On the product side, the facility breakroom supply category turned in the strongest results ending the quarter with a high single digit increase and we continue to be pleased with our growth in this segment. The furniture category was even followed by a slight decline in Office Products and a low double digit decrease in technology products.", "Putting it all together, we\u2019re making good progress in areas like facility and breakroom, overall end market conditions remain challenging for our Office Products team and they\u2019re working hard on share of wallet and market share initiatives across their product categories and their customer base. Additionally, they\u2019re continuing to work on diversifying their business through new product additions and the opening of new sales channels. And we hope to report in the next call that we were able to close on a strategic acquisition later this quarter that will further bolster their diversification efforts.", "So that\u2019s a quick overview of our non-Automotive businesses and at this moment we\u2019ll ask Paul to cover the Automotive operations. Paul?", "Paul Donahue", "Thank you, Tom. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you today and to have the opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our Automotive business.", "For the quarter ending March 31, our global Automotive sales were up 2% year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 4.5% in total Automotive growth which includes an approximately 1% benefit from acquisitions. However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 2.5% in the first quarter.", "Our U.S. team posted a 4% sales increase in the first quarter, an improved performance from the 2% growth we reported in the fourth quarter and the 3% growth we experienced for the full year of 2015.", "Turning to our international business, which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, this group once again reported another quarter of mid single digit growth in their local currency. Despite challenging local economies, especially in Australia and Canada, we remain encouraged by the consistent mid single digit growth we are experiencing across all of these international markets.", "In the U.S., our results varied widely by geographical region and product category. Geographically our business in the Florida, Atlantic and Western regions of the country all out performed in the quarter. On the other hand the Central, the Eastern, Midwestern regions of the country all under performed. We would attribute the warmer than average temperatures experienced across the Northern states in February and March is having a negative impact on our business in that region of the country.", "And as we look at our winter related goods, we saw a similar trend in sales. After experiencing double digit growth in January, our battery business was flat in both February and March. Again we believe warmer than normal weather patterns impacted this segment of our business.", "So now let's turn to our same-store sales for the first. Our U.S. company-owned store grew same-store sales in the first quarter by 3.6% The cadence of the quarter saw our team post solid results in January with sales moderating somewhat in February and March. is compares to the 3% comp store increase we reported through nine months. Again we would attribute a good bit of this slowdown to the weather as well as the impact from Easter week moving from April in \u201815 to March in 2016.", "This quarter's 3.6% same-store sales increase compared to a plus 2% in the fourth quarter and was driven by a combination of increases on both our commercial wholesale side of the business as well as by our retail business.", "So let's start with our retail results. As mentioned in previous calls, we continue to expand or revamp DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group. As a reminder these initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extending our store hours, increased training for our store associates, and the nationwide launch of our NAPA Rewards Program to name just a few. We are still early in the process, but we can report the results we\u2019ve seen thus far outpacing our expectations.", "As previously announced, we\u2019re expanding our initial 20-store pilot which we tested in 2015 to include an additional 150 company-owned stores in 2016. These initiatives are having a positive impact on our results. And for the first quarter, we can report a total increase of 3% in our retail business. And we couple this 3% increase with the 6% increase we posted in the first quarter of 2015, it gets us to two-year stack of plus 9%. Our retail initiatives are driving increased transaction accounts and in quarter one, we again saw a significant jump in the number of retail tickets. We can also report a low single digit increase in our average basket size for the quarter.", "Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business, this segment of our Automotive business posted a 4% increase in the first quarter, an improvement over the 2% increase we generated in the fourth quarter of 2015. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continued to center around our Major Account business as well as our NAPA AutoCare centers. We had a strong quarter with our 16,000 plus AutoCare customers as this business trended up mid to high single digit.", "On the Major Account front, our team drove sales increases in line with our overall Automotive growth for the quarter. We were also encouraged by the slight improvement in our fleet business, which was up 2% for the quarter and an improvement over the 1% increase we posted in Q4 of 2015. And voluntarily we are working really hard to gain some positive momentum with this important customer group.", "Our average wholesale ticket value was up low single digit with no benefits from inflation. We were flat in the average number of tickets, although our first quarter performance was improved over a downward trend we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters. So, earlier in my comments, I mentioned our battery business, so now let\u2019s take a look at a few of other product categories and review the trends we experienced in the first quarter.", "Our brakes business was a highlight again in the first quarter. This category grew low double digits in the quarter and we can also report solid growth in both our tool and equipment business, as well as our filtration business. We are especially pleased to see the growth in our big filter [ph] business. This key product category came under pressure last year as our industrial, energy and our fleet business softened. We hope to continue this trend as the year progresses.", "We continue to be encouraged with the strong growth we are experiencing from our NAPA Import Parts business. Our underlying Import Parts business was up high single digits in the quarter before the added benefit of Olympus Import Parts, a $25 million business we acquired just past February. We can report good progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we will continue to search for additional acquisitions in this growing segment of the aftermarket.", "We would also like to update you on the closing of our Covs Parts acquisition on March 1st. As you may recall, we announced in February that we received approval to acquire 21 of their 25 branches. This allows our Asia-Pac business to further expand its market presence and scale in Western Australia. This is an important strategic acquisition for the Asia-Pac team and we expect Covs to generate additional annual revenues of approximately 70 million in US dollars.", "On the acquisition front, we are encouraged by the ever increasing level of activity in all geographical regions and in all segments of our Automotive business. We are pleased to report today, we will be closing on May 1st on Atlanta, Georgia based heavy duty truck parts business. We would like to welcome the team from Global Parts Incorporated.", "Global operates six branches in three states and generates sales of approximately 20 million plus on an annualized basis. This business will serve as a nice complement to our growing business in this segment of the Automotive aftermarket. And as we look ahead, strategic acquisitions will continue to be a growth lever for Automotive businesses both in the U.S. and abroad.", "Now, turning to the trends we\u2019re seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continued to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gain, Miles driven increased 2% January following a strong 3.5% increase in 2015.", "January marks 23 consecutive months of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gas was $2 in the first quarter, which is down from 240 per gallon in 2015, the second cheapest annual average in the past 10 years. And although gas prices appear to be moving upward in the recent weeks in most parts of the U.S., the current cost of gasoline remains well below last year and these low gas prices should bode well for future increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchase.", "In closing, we were pleased to show positive sales growth in the first quarter and look forward to building on our growth plans over the balance of the year. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing on our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings, as well as targeted strategic acquisitions.", "We want to thank our teams both in North America, as well as Australasia for their efforts and appreciate all they do for the GPC Automotive business. So, that completes our overview of the GPC Automotive business. And at this time, I will hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?", "Carol Yancey", "Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We appreciate you being on the call with us this morning and we will get started with looking at our first quarter income statement and segment information and then we will review a few key balance sheet and other financial items.", "Our total revenues of $3.7 billion for the first quarter were down a 0.5% or up 1% excluding the impact of FX. Our gross profit for the first quarter was 29.7%, compared to 29.8% last year.", "The slight change in gross profit margin primarily reflects the continued pressure of lower supplier incentives earned in our Industrial business. Excluding this factor, we\u2019re pleased with the positive impact of our gross margin initiatives across all of our businesses.", "On SG&A, the impact of SG&A in the quarter was flat and we had some impact from our cost saving initiatives and just the loss of leverage. So, our efforts to enhance gross margin are especially important in our low inflationary environment.", "I want to mention what our cumulative supplier price changes are for 2015. We\u2019re down six-tenths of 1% in Automotive. We\u2019re up two-tenths of 1% in Industrial. We\u2019re up one-tenth of 1% in Office and we\u2019re down 1.25% in Electrical. The talking about SG&A, again, I\u2019m sorry about that, our SG&A was $850 million or 23.07% of sales, which is in line with first quarter of last year.", "So, our cost control measures continued to positively impact our results and they are driving our progress towards greater operational efficiencies. For the first quarter, however, the benefits of our overall cost savings were somewhat offset by the deleveraging of our expenses in our non-Automotive businesses. As we look ahead, our teams remain committed to controlling our expenses and enhancing our productivity and streamlining our operations. We expect to show continued progress on these initiatives as we may have had.", "Now, let\u2019s discuss our results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the first quarter was $1.9 billion or up 2% from the prior year and 52% of our total sales. Our operating profit of 154 million is up 2% and their margin improved 10 basis points to 8.0. Our Industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the quarter, a 2.5% decrease from the prior year and 31% of our total revenues.", "Our operating profit of $82 million is down 6.8% and our operating margin was down 30 basis points to 7.1%, primarily driven by lower supplier incentives, as well as expense deleverage. Our Office Product revenues were 477 million in the first quarter, down 2.8% and representing 13% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of 34 million is down 6.4% and our operating margin of 7.2% is down 20 basis points.", "The Electrical and Electronic Group had sales in the quarter of 176 million, down 3.4% and that\u2019s 4% of our total revenues. Their operating profit of 15 million is down 4% and the margin for this group was down 10 basis points to 8.4.", "For the first quarter, our total operating profit margin was 7.7% compared to 7.8% in the first quarter of last year. This follows a 10 basis point margin improvement in the fourth quarter and for the full-year of 2015 and basically reflects the lack of leverage associated with the sales environment in our non-Automotive businesses. We are intensely focused on continued progress in this area with further margin expansion being a key goal for the company.", "We had net interest expense of 4.8 million in the quarter and for the full-year, we continue to look for net interest expense to be $21 million to $22 million. Our amortization expense was 8.8 million for the first quarter and we continue to expect total amortization expense to be $36 million to $38 million for the full-year.", "Our depreciation expense of 26 million for the quarter, we are now projecting for depreciation to remain at 120 million to 130 million for the full year. So, combined depreciation and amortization of 34.7 million for the first quarter and we would expect this to be in the range of 155 million to 170 million for the full year.", "The other line which primarily reflects our corporate expense was 24.4 million for the quarter compared to 25.1 million last year. For the full-year we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range.", "Our tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 36% which is in line with the first quarter of last year. We expect this rate to increase over the balance of the year and continue to project at 37% tax rate for the full-year. Our net income for the quarter of 158 million compared to 161 million for the last year and our EPS was $1.05 which is flat with last year.", "Now let\u2019s turn to the discussion of the balance sheet which we continue to further strengthen with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at March 31 was 205 million which is in line with our cash position at year-end and up a bit from 166 million at March 31 last year. Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our distribution businesses.", "Accounts receivable of 2 billion at March 31 is flat with the prior year and relatively in line with our sales. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with their quality at this time. The inventory at the end of the quarter was 3.1 billion, a 2% overall increase although this is flat excluding the impact of acquisitions in the last 12 months.", "Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels and will continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate level as we move forward. Accounts Payable at March 31 was 3 billion up approximately 14% from last year due to improved payment terms and other payable initiatives established with our vendors. We are encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and days in payable.", "Our working capital of 1.6 billion at March 31 is improved from the prior year and down 67 million on a comparable basis which excludes the reclassification of the 250 million in term debt from long-term to current. Effectively managing our working capital and in particular key items such as account receivable, inventory and accounts payable remains a high priority for our company.", "Our total debt of 700 million at March 31 is 194 million less than the 894 in March of last year. Our debt includes two 250 million term notes as well as another 200 million in borrowings under our multicurrency credit facility. We would also add that one of the term notes is due this November 30 and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date.", "Our total debt-to-capitalization is approximately 18% and we are comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe it provides the company both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue.", "In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We continue to generate strong cash flows and following a record year in 2015, we appear well-positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the 900 million to 1 billion range for the full-year and free cash flow which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be in the $400 million to $450 million range.", "We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash includes strategic acquisition, share repurchases, the reinvestment in our businesses and the dividends which we paid every year since going public in 1948 and have increased for 60 consecutive years.", "Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us and they\u2019re integral to our growth plans. Thus far in 2016, we have added the Olympus automotive import parts business as well as three additional acquisitions which closed on March 1. As previously covered by Tom and Paul, our Asia-Pac business also acquired Covs Parts with expected annual revenues of US$70 million and Motion added Epperson and Company and Missouri Power Transmission with combined annual revenue of $50 million.", "For the balance of 2016, we\u2019ll continue to seek acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Although, many of these opportunities will continue to be bolt-on types companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, we are open minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small assuming the appropriate returns on the investment.", "Turning to share repurchases, we have purchased 576,000 shares thus far in 2016 and we have 5.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best returns to our shareholders.", "Our investment in capital expenditure was 12 million in the first quarter which is down slightly from last year. For the year however, we continue to plan for capital expenditures to be in the range of 140 million to 160 million, so you will see CapEx picking up over the balance of the year due primarily to the timing of several large projects.", "Turning to our dividend, our 2016 dividend of $2.63 per share approved by the board in February was a 7% increase from the prior year and is approximately 57% of our 2015 earnings. Was slightly above our stated goal of 50% to 55% payout ratio, we are very comfortable going beyond the stage from time to time due to our strong cash flows.", "Now that concludes our financial update for the first quarter of 2016. And in summary we operated relatively in line with our expectations, let\u2019s assume fairly steady underlying growth for the Automotive business but in another quarter of challenging economic conditions across our nonautomotive businesses. We manage to offset some of the challenges with key sales initiatives and cost controls and also further improve the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports ongoing investments and opportunities such as acquisitions as well as return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. We look forward to updating you on our future progress in the period ahead.", "At this point I will turn it back over to Tom.", "Tom Gallagher", "Thank you Carol and thanks to you and Paul for your comprehensive updates. So that\u2019s an overview of the financial and operating performance for the first quarter. And in looking back, our feeling is that our teams did a reasonably good job of operating with the Automotive group turning in the best performance. A lack of revenue growth in the non-automotive businesses did not enable us to gain any operating average unfortunately.", "Turning to the balance sheet we feel that folks did a pretty good job overall and we look for another strong year in cash generation and asset management. The one area that we continue to be challenged in is sales growth and across all of our businesses, organic growth initiatives and strategic bolt on type acquisitions are getting a lot of attention. And on the acquisition front based upon what we see right now, we think that we\u2019ll have a bit more to talk about in the second and third quarters.", "Now as far as the reminder of the year is concerned, we feel that previously provided guidance remains appropriate at this time. You may recall that we guided for Automotive revenues to be up 2% to 3% for the full-year against the current 1.8% increase. We said Industrial would be up 1% to 2% compared to 2.5% decrease for the first quarter.", "Office Products down 1 to up 2 compared to 2.8% decrease in the quarter and Electrical will be up 1 to 2 compared to the 3.4% decrease in Q1. So for the total company we feel that 1% to 2% increase is appropriate compared to the half of 1% decrease through the first quarter. And then on the earnings side, we feel that an expectation of $4.70 to $4.80 per share remains appropriate and this should be up 2% to 4% over the prior year.", "At this point we would like to address your questions and we will turn the call back to Catherine.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.", "Seth Basham", "Thanks a lot and good morning.", "Tom Gallagher", "Good morning, Seth.", "Carol Yancey", "Good morning.", "Seth Basham", "My first question is just on the guidance Tom, could you tell us what your expectations are for FX impact this year and any additional revenue you\u2019re assuming in your guidance from acquisitions?", "Tom Gallagher", "Well, the FX is pretty difficult quite honestly, Seth as you know, we think back to January of this year currency exchange was an even heavier factor, we were down mid to upper double digits in the exchange rates between the Canadian, Mexican and Australian rates. We did see some moderation, some strengthening of the dollar in February and March, but at this point for the quarter it was still double-digit impact and we really don\u2019t have a clear look at what we think is going to happen as we go forward. I think perhaps this thing to say would be that, for the whole company we\u2019ve guided to being up 1 to 2 and perhaps for the whole company FX is going to be a headwind of 1.5% to 2% at this point. As far as the acquisitions, the only ones that we have included in our guidance are the ones that have been completed. So, Paul covered a couple of them. Carol covered a few more. They are the only ones we have included and our practice is not to include anything until we actually close on it. And at that point, we\u2019ll incorporate it into our future guidance if that answers your question.", "Seth Basham", "That\u2019s helpful. Just to confirm relative to your guidance you provided initially for 2016 in February, you assumed at that point in time 3% or 4% sales growth for entire company ex FX and now you are now looking for 1% to 2%?", "Tom Gallagher", "Well, no, we\u2019re looking at 1% to 2% including FX and then 1.5% to 2% headwind from FX, so on a constant currency basis, you would have to add that 1.5% to 2% back in.", "Seth Basham", "Got it. Okay. Helpful. All right, and then my other questions on the auto business, looking at U.S. comps, it seems like they slowed down to your stack basis. Also it seems like your Major Accounts business growth slowed a little bit. I understand I think weather is a drag. Any other factors you can point to that might be impacting your business relative to the industry?", "Paul Donahue", "Seth, this is Paul. No, it just - I touched on many of the factors. Seth, we hate to play the weather card, because at the end of the day we still need to execute on our initiatives. Look, I think our team is doing a pretty good job. But when you look at the delta between our big divisions up in the northern states versus some of our business in the southern states, it certainly had an impact. Our NAPA AutoCare business continues to be solid, very solid. Our Major Account business is good. It\u2019s not growing at the double digit rate perhaps that we saw a couple of years ago, but it\u2019s still growing at a good pace overall. So now, I think, Seth, there is just a bit of sluggishness out there right now, but we\u2019ve got some great initiatives. We just need to continue to execute and I have no doubt that business will bounce back quickly.", "Seth Basham", "Got it.", "Tom Gallagher", "Seth, I\u2019d add to that. If you look at across the spectrum of our larger accounts, the major accounts and the AutoCare customers, those in the northern tier, as Paul pointed out, are having a more difficult time than those in the southern tier. But also those that are more heavily oriented toward tires, are a bit more challenged than those that are more heavily oriented towards the service side. So we will see all that reverse at some point, but we just don\u2019t know when.", "Seth Basham", "Got it. Since you brought up weather as an important point here, if you think about warmer winter weather and the impact on parts stress, would you expect heading into the summer season there to be fewer part failures and more limited parts sales as a result of that?", "Tom Gallagher", "It depends upon how warm and how hot it gets in the summer. That\u2019s going to put the second round of stress and that\u2019s a key determinant. So if we have a hot summer, I think we will see some of the summer related products, heating and cooling as an example, I think we\u2019ll see some pick up there, if we have a modest summer, we won\u2019t get that increased demand.", "Seth Basham", "Got it. Thanks a lot and good luck.", "Tom Gallagher", "Thank you, Seth.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.", "Chris Bottiglieri", "Hi, thank you for taking my call. My first question is, can you talk about your plan for enhanced store openings and you\u2019re trying to pick it up for the company-owned store group. This is primarily in the U.S. So, is it going to be focused abroad and then ultimately how many stores do you think you could have in the US?", "Paul Donahue", "Yeah, Chris, this is Paul. So, our store expansion program includes all of our markets, so Australia, New Zealand, where we will continue to grow via acquisition as well as organic growth and we believe we have opportunities to continue to grow in both Australia and New Zealand markets. In Canada same thing as well as Mexico, in Mexico, as you may recall, we\u2019ve rolled out our NAPA Mexico initiative, which we have 20 plus stores in Mexico today branded under the NAPA brand both company-owned and independently-owned. We believe and we\u2019re not going to put a targeted number out there, Chris, but we believe we\u2019ve got significant opportunities to continue to grow our store footprint in Mexico.", "And then in the US, again, same type of initiatives both acquisition, bolt-on type acquisitions as we announced already do this year, but in addition, organic new distribution as well across the U.S. and we think again there is many open markets across the U.S., so we can continue to expand the NAPA brand.", "Chris Bottiglieri", "Got you, then I have one quick follow-up. As I understand it historically more [Indiscernible] facilitator of independents when I look to exit the business, you sell from one independent to the other. Is there any change in philosophy if the company acquires some of these independents or how do you see that playing out?", "Tom Gallagher", "Chris, this is Tom. Our attitude is exactly what it has been and that is if it\u2019s an independently-owned store in an outline market, if there is another independent owner that\u2019s ready to step in and make that acquisition, we\u2019ll help them do that. If there isn\u2019t someone ready to step in, but the current owner has a desire to get out and we\u2019ll buy the store and we\u2019ll run it for a period of time until we find a good independent owner. If it\u2019s in a metro market, we\u2019ll buy the store and we\u2019ll operate it for the long term as a company-owned store. So the attitude is essentially the same.", "Chris Bottiglieri", "Okay. Really helpful. Thank you for the comments.", "Tom Gallagher", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now go to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Chandni Luthra", "Hi. This is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. Tom, I have a quick question on your Industrials business. So, I just want to understand about the performance in the Industrial segment. It appears that you guys outperformed versus how we saw your peers report in the last week or so. Could you perhaps throw some light in terms of what drove that performance and what was the cadence, because a lot of your peers talked about a very sharp decline in the second half of March. I just want to understand if you guys also saw a dip in March and you know how the quarter trended? Thank you.", "Tom Gallagher", "Well, I\u2019ll take the latter part of the question first. We did see March being the weaker of the three months in the quarter, but still better than what we had been running. In terms of what\u2019s happening within our Industrial business, I think our teams have been working hard on some of their share of wallet and market share initiatives, as well as on the acquisitions we did and had the benefit of the two acquisitions that closed late in the quarter that Carol mentioned.", "But additionally our folks are finding additional opportunities with existing customers and they are also opening up some new customers. So as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we can look at about half of the business and see that it\u2019s performing pretty well and then we look at roughly the other half and we see that we\u2019re still challenged. So hopefully we\u2019re starting to see a little bit of a turn and maybe the quarters ahead will be a little bit more reflective of what we\u2019ve seen in Q1 and then also early in the month of April.", "Chandni Luthra", "Got it. Thanks for the color. And quickly on the Office segment, so you guys had your business decline by about 3%. I just want to understand how should we think about go forward given that you\u2019ve maintained your guidance and in terms of what gives you confidence to kind of catch up with that guide given that cycling of the ODP, OMX [ph] businesses having some impact to you?", "Tom Gallagher", "Well, in terms of maintaining the guidance, we did say that. We guided to down one to up one for the full year, having finished the first quarter down 3%, we would say may be closer to the mid to lower end of the range for the full year. I did comment in my prepared remarks that we think we have an opportunity to close on a pretty good size acquisition for the Office Products group yet in Q2. It will be late in Q2. That\u2019s not in our guidance at this point. But assuming that we are able to complete that, we\u2019ll give you an update on that as we make our comments at the end of the second quarter.", "Chandni Luthra", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Tom Gallagher", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will continue on to Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Tony Cristello", "Thank you. Good morning", "Tom Gallagher", "Good morning.", "Tony Cristello", "My first question, I wanted to just touch on the import parts side of the business and better understand where you are in terms of parts coverage there. It\u2019s obviously growing at - I think you said, Paul, high single digit rate and I wanted to understand is that growth just because you are offering more and more parts. Are you seeing more and more demand from existing or you growing both with the new customer as well.", "Paul Donahue", "Yeah so Tony, great question on our import parts business. So we - look, we have been in the import parts business for some time and we go to market under the Altrom brand we sell here in the U.S. direct through our NAPA network. And where we see continued growth is both existing customer expansion, but also capturing new customers. So our NAPA Auto Care centers are major accounts are servicing more and more import part vehicles therefore they need access to those parts and fortunately they are coming through us. When we look at the continued expansion of that segment we are excited of our core business, the Altrom business going through our NAPA network, but also with our recent acquisition of Olympus and what that group brings us and I think I talked about a bit in our last call is, we got a great team at Olympus they bring us years and years of import experience that is the value to us and this is the category that we think we can certainly continue to grow at the a greater rate than our overall business.", "Tony Cristello", "And do you see the same lift of benefits as your companies stores as you all do or see at your independence when you put in new initiatives or focus on being able to sell through on imports or something, I\u2019m just trying to piece together sort of the success across your whole business versus company-owned versus independent.", "Paul Donahue", "Yeah so Tony, we\u2019ve made a commitment in our company owned stores that we are going to be stocking in import parts and it is a classic parts business in general. If you have the part, you have good people and you\u2019re priced competitively, generally you are going to get the business and what we are finding as we upgrade our inventories across our NAPA company-owned store network business is growing as we upgrade those inventories. On the independent side Tony, it\u2019s been an initiative that we worked on for a number of years as our independent owners. Some have gotten into the business, do a terrific job, others have been a little slower to adapt to stocking in import parts. They may - certainly some of our independent owners are out in more rural markets were they may not be quite at much demand for import parts, but our initiative in growing that businesses both via our company-owned stores and via our independent owners as well.", "Tom Gallagher", "Tony I might just add on, you may recall that our general approach to any new initiative is that we will test it, pilot it in the company store group will approve the concept and then at that point we will go to be independent owners. We want to make sure that what we are recommending to them work so after we approving the concept we will tell them what we did, how we did it, what it cost, what is the returns are and then our good progressive owners will step up and they will embrace the initiative and we go on from there.", "Tony Cristello", "That\u2019s great color. I appreciate that and if I can ask just one more question, I think you mentioned CapEx acceleration and several projects that may be hitting in the second half of the year. Can you provide any were information, is that an IT type spend or there any strong store refreshers or something that we should consider?", "Carol Yancey", "Yeah, it\u2019s both facility refreshes and also an IT project. So mentioning on facilities we have got in each of our segments and both here in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and Australia folks have DC refreshers. So a lot of it is in the area of productivity improvement and so it could be not necessarily a full relocation, but a refresh within the facility. So those are multi-months projects that we know we have started and there\u2019ll be slated for third quarter and fourth quarter and then IT as well we got again, most of our IT projects are going to be in productivity areas were health management, inventory optimization and we have several sights planned for the second half of the year. So those are all in the work, so we expect that to pick up over the balance of the year.", "Tony Cristello", "Okay, thank you very much for your time.", "Carol Yancey", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And Mark Becks with JP Morgan have our next question.", "Mark Becks", "Hi thanks for sharing the monthly detail in Auto. Understanding that there is a slowdown as far as the end of the quarter I just wanted to clarify what was the impact from the Easter shift and the labor - leap day shift and then does that help or hurt back half of the quarter.", "Paul Donahue", "Well, Mark this is Paul, we think certainly it was not a help, we estimate and it is hard to put an exact number to it, but we estimates Easter holiday moving from April end of month of March cost us minimum half a point on our top line.", "Mark Becks", "And then any impact from the leap day?", "Paul Donahue", "For sure, the extra day, again estimating between a point of quarter to point half.", "Tom Gallagher", "Ranging between 0.5% and 1% for the quarter at net.", "Mark Becks", "Understood and then Paul you elevated to widening performance gap in the northern stores versus southern stores. Historically some of your peers is focusing gaps anywhere in the range of 500 to call it a 1000 basis points, is there any way you can kind of frame up the difference between say the north-east market which is more the kind of weather sensitive market versus like the South or the West.", "Paul Donahue", "Yeah, I will put it this way Mark, when we look at across northern states and not just the north east because we really felt the impact in the Midwest, when we talk about the Central, Mark, that\u2019s Ohio, Pennsylvania but all the way into the north-east as well. That group and those are some of our larger operations that group grew low single digit, when we compare those to some of our southern division, so I mentioned Florida, I would throw the Southern group in there as well, the Atlantic which should be the Carolina South and then even West that group grew mid to high single digits across, so it was more of a significant delta that helps seen in some time.", "Mark Becks", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful and then last question for me Tom and Carol you mentioned you\u2019re open to more larger transformational type of acquisitions and historically [indiscernible] you\u2019ve opted for more than smaller bolt-on type acquisition. So just trying to get an idea of historically why that has been the route you have gone by that it is just there is more opportunities of that nature in the marketplace or culture or anything else there.", "Tom Gallagher", "Mark, I will take a stab at that. You have hit on one key point and that is generally speaking there are many more opportunities in that $25 million to $250 million range. Secondly, our philosophy has been that any acquisition we do needs to be accretive and hit the minimum threshold within three years and it seems that we can get to some of the back office synergies more quickly and more easily in the 25 to 150 range than something well above that. And then the third thing is that, we got a general approach that we want to make multiple acquisitions across each of our businesses and spread the investments spread, the risk so to speak, but also to leverage the strong management teams that we have across our businesses. Now with all of that said if we were to find - I think you used the word transformational, if we would find something larger, we would be more than happy to look at it, but it has to meet the same general level of expectation within three years and we look for 15% ROIC no later than the third year, but if we found something large that met that threshold then we would absolutely have interest in doing it. The good point is that we have the balance sheet that will enable us to do whatever and it was set that kind of logic that led us to GPC Asia Pacific, the largest acquisition we have done and one that has turned out to be pretty darn good thanks for the shareholders at Genuine Parts.", "Mark Becks", "Okay. So if you have more to talk about in 2Q and 3Q just it seems like it safe to assume that these will be more of those kind of bolt-on that you are talking about.", "Tom Gallagher", "We just have to wait and see.", "Mark Becks", "Okay, thanks.", "Tom Gallagher", "All right thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll go on to Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Elizabeth Suzuki", "Hey guys just a quick question for Paul, looking at the auto business in Texas and other oil related markets you guys mentioned that the broader region underperformed, but do you have data on those markets specifically in terms of their performance year over year in the quarter.", "Paul Donahue", "Yeah, so Elizabeth if I look at our businesses down in the Southwest part of the country and that group was under some stress all last year and if I look at Q1 that group was up low single digits, so certainly on the lower end of our performance amongst our many divisions.", "Elizabeth Suzuki", "Okay, great thank you.", "Paul Donahue", "Welcome.", "Carol Yancey", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Good morning guys.", "Carol Yancey", "Hi Scot.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "I apologize in advance for kind of stick on this weather things here, but couple of questions. What other categories outside of batteries would you attribute kind of whether gyration is the first question? And then second relate to that I guess winter of 2011 - 2012 is probably the closest comparable that we have to this year\u2019s warm winter weather. So I\u2019m not sure if you have that data in handy or not, but can you remind us of your sales cadence in these types of categories in 2012, how they kind of trended from February to March and into the spring - later spring and summer months.", "Paul Donahue", "So, Scot I will take the first part first and then I\u2019ll let Carol handle the historical data, if she has it. But yes outside of batteries and certainly the entire electrical category Scott, when we look at starters, alternators and including batteries that entire category, which is the big category for us only, grew low single digits in the quarter. Heating and cooling, certainly heating is another area that was impacted, we saw slower than kind of our fleet average growth. And then all of our chemicals in commodities type products were another area that we saw slower than our typical growth or in our overall growth for the first quarter, so all of those categories really can be impacted one way or the other by the weather.", "Tom Gallagher", "It goes even further Scot, if you think about up in your neck of the woods when you got that extreme cold weather, it tends to cause additional puddles up North and through the Central and Midwest parts of the country as well, which in fact potentially can impact some of your chassis product in the ensuing quarter or two so. It is pretty pervasive in terms of what it can do and I should say that we are pretty pleased with our chassis business right now, our chaste team is doing a really good job for us and we are getting some pretty good growth currently from that organization.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Got you.", "Carol Yancey", "And Scot as far as the weather patterns back in 2011 and 2012 I mean I will have you afterwards, but we are not going to comment or do we have that product line specific cadence in those winter months on how that reacted, but we\u2019re happy to discuss that further.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "I guess the question is just in general, so obviously you\u2019re not going to break all that out by category, but you kind of went from February to March, you already talked about some sluggishness in some of these categories and Paul just referenced them, did they continue to worsen as you go to the latest spring in summer months or did it kind of will get to a level and just kind of stay there and I just trying to figure out.", "Tom Gallagher", "I would take a stab at that first, Scot. This is Tom and I would say that we\u2019ve somewhat stabilized in those categories at this point, but we wish we were stabilized at a slightly higher rate.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Got it. Okay thanks a lot guys.", "Tom Gallagher", "Thank you.", "Paul Donahue", "Thanks Scot.", "Operator", "Thank you. And Bret Jordan with Jefferies has our next question.", "Bret Jordan", "Hi, good morning guys", "Paul Donahue", "Good morning Bret.", "Carol Yancey", "Good morning.", "Bret Jordan", "On global project accusation could a give us a little color on what you\u2019re seeing in heavy-duty and maybe how that\u2019s comping relative to passenger vehicle parts and maybe sort of give us a feeling for after this deal how big that is going to be relative to your parts distribution .", "Paul Donahue", "Yeah, so Bret, that\u2019s a business, we don\u2019t talk about a lot, but across North America so US and Canada and in Canada we have got very mature robust business on the heavy duty side it is in our standalone side in excess of $600 million in annual business. It\u2019s a good business, it\u2019s a growing business and there is roughly 8 million heavy duty trucks on the road here in the US and it\u2019s the category that we think we can continue to grow. The acquisition of Global which is Atlanta again much like Olympus acquisition that we did on the import side, brings us a great team, a knowledgeable team experienced team in the category, we believe we\u2019ve got well [indiscernible] synergies and again just bring in another experienced group into our business and we will complement our heavy-duty business here in the Southeast quite nicely.", "Tom Gallagher", "Bret just to add on to that, by our estimation we would have 5% to 6% of the total available market for the heavy-duty industry and if we can grow that to 10%, we\u2019re talking upwards of $0.5 billion to $600 million more in revenue, so that\u2019s part of the strategy.", "Bret Jordan", "How was this business is been comping is that comping ahead of your company average in auto.", "Tom Gallagher", "No, it is actually been - the fleet business it is actually been little bit less than our total Automotive business, but the good news is it\u2019s come back a bit. I think Paul mentioned that we were up 2% in Q1 in our fleet business. So we\u2019re pleased with the fact that it has started to revert back to what is a more normal business.", "Bret Jordan", "Okay and then one last question on comp, when you look at the NAPA core comp, how do you feel that rate was relative to the industry in Q1. Do you think you\u2019re a share gainer or just performing in line?", "Paul Donahue", "Hard to say Bret, being the first guys out, I\u2019m guessing we\u2019re going to be where the market is. We certainly don\u2019t believe we are losing any market share across the country and our teams are executing on the initiatives we put out there for them so. We think we will be in line, hard to say though; we will have to wait and see.", "Bret Jordan", "Okay and then one last question in Mexico are you going to convert the auto total stores to NAPA brand or do they standalone?", "Paul Donahue", "Yeah, great question Bret, that\u2019s something that we are looking at. I was actually down there with the team last week, we have not made a final decision one way or the other, as you may know we have eight auto total stores down in the marketplace and we\u2019re evaluating that right now, but that absolutely could happen in the future and I would also comment Bret because I know you follow it quite closely, our overall business and sales in Mexico continue to grow each quarter, we are building out our team, we are building out our brand, we just added that talented executive to that group down there and we are still bullish with our opportunities down in that market.", "Bret Jordan", "Okay, great thank you.", "Paul Donahue", "Welcome.", "Carol Yancey", "Thank you, Bret.", "Operator", "Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Greg Melich", "Hi, thanks. I just want to follow-up on the Easter shift question, make sure I got the math right there and the second one on the margins. If we assume it was 50 or 75 perhaps, should we be thinking that our run rate would simply move that amount of sales in the second quarter from first and Tom when you describe stabilizing trend which number are we stabilizing I guess, is it adjusting for the shift or not or for leap day. And I have a follow-up on margin.", "Tom Gallagher", "My understanding of the question on the trends was more product oriented and that\u2019s where I think we have stabilized in particular product categories. In terms of the impact of Easter we should see the benefit of that in April, we should pick up a little bit more in April that we gave back in March.", "Greg Melich", "So [indiscernible] it would be fair to assume that it should be a little better in April so far than we saw in the first quarter.", "Tom Gallagher", "Well, we will see how it all shapes out and will give you an update on it in our second quarter conference call.", "Greg Melich", "Okay, so I\u2019ll switch to margins then. I think it was Carol, in your comments you talked about how the industrial was the main pressure on the overall gross margin rate, a lot of the other improvement across the business was still there, but Industrial hurt. So I guess my question is what level of sales do we need to get out of industrial so that we actually start to deleverage it on the gross margin side, thanks.", "Carol Yancey", "Yes, so you are correct when we look at gross margin the other three segments are find the pressure on gross margin was through Industrial and so lot of our initiatives are in place and I just mentioned Industrial has done a really good job, therefore gross profit was up in Q4 and was also up in Q1. So they\u2019ve done a lot of things on the buy side and sell side to help get that up. So when the volume does come back and it probably needs to be more in the very low single digit range for us to get some of that OEM and center of that, that\u2019s going to really go straight to the margin, but the good thing is their SG&A improvements and their core gross profits, those things are already in place. And when we do get just a little bit of volume back and the top-line growth then we\u2019ll see that on their operating margin.", "Greg Melich", "That\u2019s great. Thanks, good luck.", "Carol Yancey", "Thank you.", "Tom Gallagher", "Thank you, Greg.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli.", "Brian Sponheimer", "Last and least I get it.", "Carol Yancey", "Hi, Brian.", "Brian Sponheimer", "Hi, Carol. My compliments on the continued working capital improvements and I guess, if you just take APM inventory [ph], it\u2019s $280 year-over-year. Is that coming exclusively from NAPA or is that something that\u2019s really a kind of a holistic entire business approach to working capital.", "Carol Yancey", "So all of our businesses have initiatives in the working capital and specifically focused in the payables area, so we\u2019ve - what I would say just the - more the majority of the dollars are coming from Automotive, we do have improvement coming from the others and I can tell you their teams, it\u2019s backed into our pay plans as part of everybody\u2019s performance, it\u2019s part of what everybody\u2019s pushing down is working capital initiatives and we are seeing some improvements in the non-automotive as well. So the ideas that we have just continued improvements each quarter, but again it\u2019s more coming from Automotive, but we\u2019re getting some from the others too.", "Brian Sponheimer", "I understood and then Paul, just one question. You mentioned brakes being up low double digits in the quarter and some improvement on chassis, how much of that is more miles driven and is there any part of that just better supply from some of your larger on and important suppliers within those product offerings.", "Paul Donahue", "Yeah, Brian, so I answer that two ways, on the brakes business we\u2019ve - our brakes business has been solid now for a number of quarters in a row and that\u2019s across all the brakes, [indiscernible], and Friction, and Caliper\u2019s have all been out pacing our overall growth and I think it\u2019s just a great job by our team out in the field grabbing some market share and we got a great partner on that side. If you recall Brian, a year ago on the chassis side we were having some significant service issues and please to report those are now behind us and we\u2019re seeing that business return back to more normal growth rates, but we were down quite a bit early last year as a result of some of the service problems. So again that\u2019s the business we had to do quite well throughout the first half of the year.", "Brian Sponheimer", "Alright, terrific. Well, thank you very much.", "Paul Donahue", "Thank you, Brian.", "Carol Yancey", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.", "Carol Yancey", "We thank you for participating on today's first quarter call, and we appreciate your support of Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to updating you in July on our second quarter result.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Sidney G. Jones - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company second quarter 2016 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.", "We'll begin this morning with comments from our Chairman, Tom Gallagher. Tom?", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman", "Thank you, Sid, and let me add my welcome to all of you on the call this morning. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us. I would start by saying that I've anticipated this call with somewhat mixed emotions. On the one hand, I've been on every one of our calls since we started doing them in February of 2001, so today is my 63rd call, but it's also my last. As you know, Paul Donahue, he was named Chief Executive Officer on May 1, and Paul is only the fifth Chief Executive in our 88-year history, certainly indicative of the management's stability within our organization. I will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board, and as such, I will remain active around GPC. But going forward, Paul and Carol will be doing all of the work on these quarterly calls.", "And I just couldn't feel any better or more positive about the future of our company with Paul as our President, Chief Executive Officer; and Carol as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer leading the way. These are two very talented and capable executives, and they are highly regarded both inside our organization and externally as well. And they will do a fine job in leading our company and creating shareholder value in the years ahead. With that said, I want to thank each of you on the call for your past and ongoing support of Genuine Parts Company, and I'll turn the call over to Paul.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thank you, Tom. I appreciate the kind remarks and the ongoing support. I'm both honored and humbled to follow you as CEO of this great company. You've had an admirable 46-year career at GPC, and the performance of the Company under your leadership for the last 12 years has been impressive. That said, working closely with you for the last nine years has been invaluable. And I feel well prepared for this new role, and importantly, the compensation of our management team remains in place to build upon our performance. So thank you, and I look forward to working with you in your role as the Chairman.", "GPC has a long and rich 88-year history of steady, consistent growth and sound financial, and has been an effective steward of capital. Under my leadership, we intend to build on these achievements over the many years to come. In my first 75 days as CEO, I've taken considerable time to visit with our operations, both around the globe and across our business segment. And I'm more encouraged than ever about the good work being done and the growth opportunities available in each of our businesses.", "As this quarter would indicate, we have our share of challenges to overcome, but I also believe we can reinvigorate our sales growth in the coming quarters. This is our most critical near-term objective, and I'm committed to making this happen. We will provide more details later on the call to this point. Now, turning to our second quarter, I'll make a few remarks on our overall result, and then cover our performance by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full year. After that, we'll open the call to your questions.", "A quick recap of our second quarter results shows, sales for the quarter were $3.9 billion, which was down 1%. Net income was $191.4 million, down 2%. And earnings per share were $1.28 in line with the second quarter of last year. Total sales in the quarter included a 2% benefit from acquisitions spread across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses, and you'll hear more on our acquisition activity as we review our business results. Currency exchange was still a headwind to our overall results with the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and Mexican currencies impacting our results by approximately 1% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share in EPS.", "Turning to our Automotive operations, for the quarter ended June 30, our global Automotive sales were down 0.7%, and included approximate 2% benefit from acquisitions, offset by currency headwind of approximately 1.5%. Our U.S. results were down 2% in the quarter which compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter, and primarily due to the softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring. While we are not pleased with this deceleration, we would point out that our second quarter sales in 2012, the last year we had similar mild winter patterns, we were also down 600 basis points from the first quarter. So we have seen this pattern before and would expect to see a more normalized growth within the next few quarters as the impact of weather plays out and we execute on our growth initiatives.", "Our U.S. results varies widely by geographical region with our better performing markets in the Western, Southern and mountain regions of the country. The Central, Eastern, and Southwest regions of the country all underperformed. Again, we would attribute the soft results in the Central and Eastern regions till the mild winter temperatures, and this is evident in the failed transfer of weather-related goods such as batteries, heating and cooling, and ride control products, which were weak through most of the second quarter. We are pleased to report however that our batteries and air conditioning sales recovered significantly with the hot June temperatures, with both up double-digits.", "In the Southwest, we remain challenged by the ongoing negative impact of the oil and gas sector on fleet and general installer (06:38) business. Same-store sales for our U.S. company-owned store group were flat in the second quarter, and this compares to a 3.6% increase in the first quarter. The cadence of the quarter saw our team post a low single-digit increase in April, likely bolstered by the shift in the timing of Easter, followed by a low to mid single-digit decline in May, and flat results in June. So a mixed cadence with the month of May being our most challenging month.", "Taking a deeper look into our same-store sales for the quarter, our commercial wholesale side of the business slightly outperformed the retail, DIY business, driving the overall flat same-store sales results. Despite the ongoing DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group, fairly weak market conditions resulted in a slight sales decrease for our company-owned retail sales. We believe however that the current market conditions will prove to be short-lived, and we remain confident in the long-term positive benefits of our retail initiatives. As a reminder, these broad initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extended store hours, increased training for our store associates, and the nationwide launch of our NAPA Rewards program to name just a few.", "Furthermore, we continue to expand on our retail impact initiative, which was initially piloted at 20 stores in 2015, with plans to implement this concept in 150 company-owned stores in 2016. We are encouraged by the positive impact of these initiatives at our updated stores, with early results exceeding our expectations on both the retail and commercial sides of the business. For the second quarter, our retail transaction counts were down low single-digit, while our average basket size was up low single-digit.", "Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business, this segment of our Automotive business was basically flat in the second quarter, which compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continue to center (8:47) around our major accounts business, and our NAPA AutoCare Centers, and the results for these key customer groups are good measures for the weak market conditions we encountered this quarter.", "On the major accounts front, sales were down low single-digits, which we believe reflects the challenging sales environment these customers are seeing. Sales to our AutoCare Centers were up low-single digits, driven by the ongoing increase in memberships, now totaling over 16,400 members strong. As an additional point of reference, our fleet business was off slightly for the quarter. Our average wholesale ticket value was down slightly with no benefit from inflation, and we are flat in the average number of tickets.", "Turning now to our import parts business in the U.S., we continue to be encouraged by the strong underlying growth for this business. And with the added benefit of Olympus Import Parts, a $25 million business acquired this past February. We have positive momentum in this category as we enter in the second half of the year. We continue to make solid progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we are excited about the growth prospects for our import parts business overall. Given the positive attributes of this product offering, we closed on another import parts acquisition in Canada on July 1, which we'll cover a little bit later in the call.", "Also on the acquisition front, we are pleased to report that we closed on an Atlanta-based heavy-duty truck parts business on May 1. Global Parts operates six branches in three states, and with the expected annual revenues of approximately $20 million, it serves as a nice complement to our growing business in the heavy-duty segment of the U.S. automotive aftermarket. Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. automotive aftermarket, the fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gain.", "After strong growth of 3.5% in 2015, miles driven increased 2.6% in April, the most recent data available, and is up 3.7% year-to-date. April marks 26th consecutive month of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.35 in the second quarter, well below last year, and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases. Before closing out our Automotive review, we want to update you on our international businesses which includes Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. In Australia and New Zealand, our core Automotive business is performing well, and we have made significant progress with the integration of the Covs acquisition and its 21 branches in Western Australia.", "Likewise, we are excited by the June 1 acquisition of AMX, a Melbourne-based retailer of aftermarket, motorcycle accessories and parts, with four stores and approximate annual revenues of $12 million. Our team in Australia has a multi-year growth plan for this business, which further expands our growing product offering in the motorcycle category. With these acquisitions, our footprint in Australia and New Zealand has now grown to 527 locations, resulting in net new store growth of nearly 100 locations over the past three years. At NAPA Canada, we continue to produce low to mid single-digit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting Western Canada, and of course the devastating wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta back in May.", "On July 1, we closed on the acquisition of Auto-Camping, a leading distributor of original equipment import parts in Canada. Auto-Camping, with 20 locations across Canada, specializes in original equipment automotive parts for the European vehicles, and they sell to foreign repair specialists as well as original equipment dealers. This business should generate approximately $50 million in annual revenues, and much like the Olympus acquisition in the U.S., complements our existing product offering and distribution capabilities for import parts in Canada. Finally, in Mexico, our sales growth continued to gain momentum as we expand our NAPA footprint. We have 21 NAPA stores in Mexico today, and have plans for additional store growth in the future. We are encouraged by the long-term growth prospects we see for NAPA in Mexico.", "So in summary, the second quarter proved challenging for our U.S. Automotive business, although this was partially offset by the ongoing strength of our international operation. We believe the weakness in our U.S. sales relates to the impact of mild winter and early spring, and we expect to improve on this quarter's performance as we move ahead. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and major accounts, executing our retail strategy, and driving global expansion via new store openings, as well as targeted strategic acquisitions.", "Let's turn now to our Industrial business. Motion Industries ended the quarter, down approximately 2% which compares to a 2.5% increase in the first quarter. After adjusting for acquisitions and currency, core Industrial sales were down an approximate 3%, basically unchanged from their adjusted sales decrease in the first quarter. So for the second quarter overall, our Industrial business seems to have stabilized, which is consistent with the industrial indicators we tend to follow such as the industrial production and capacity utilization.", "With that said, a quick review of our business by industry segment, by top customers, and by top product category shows that the markets remain uneven and choppy. Among our top 12 industry segments, three generated sales increases, seven were down, and two were essentially flat. Looking at our top 20 customers, 15 of them increased sales, while five were down consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. And among our top 12 product categories, we saw six that increased and six that were down, also consistent with the first quarter.", "So the takeaway here is that our results were quite mixed among our customers and product lines, with solid results in a number of areas, being offset by weaker results and others. We have been operating in this type of difficult and choppy environment since the first quarter of 2015, and as mentioned before, believe we are seeing at least some early signs of a stabilized and industrial economy. This would certainly bode well for a stronger cycle ahead.", "Shifting to the third quarter and the balance of the year, we will be executing on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth. We remain active with strategic bolt-on acquisitions for this business, and expect to close on a few of these over the balance of the year. We can tell you that effective August 1, we will close on ATCO (16:18), a regional industrial safety product distributor, with estimated revenues of approximately $20 million.", "Moving on now to our Electrical business, EIS, Sales for this group were down 5%, and remaining challenged by many of the same factors that impacted our Industrial business. Things such as the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment, lower defense spending, lower copper pricing again in the quarter which cost us 1% of sales growth, the impact of the stronger dollar on our export-oriented customers, and just the overall sluggish economic climate. We're expecting to see these factors carry over to some degree for the balance of the year, but it's interesting to look at the individual performance of the three segments that comprised EIS.", "The Electrical segment is our largest, representing 40% of this group's revenues and sales were down low double-digits. Fabrication was down low single-digits and our wiring and cable business was up low single-digits with each representing another 30% of the EIS business.", "But certainly, there is room for improvement across the EIS segment and our greatest sales challenges are primarily concentrated in the electrical portion of the business. Looking ahead, our team is executing on its initiative to drive meaningful sales growth over the long-term.", "And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business which reported a 1% increase in sales for the second quarter, which was driven by a 5% contribution from acquisitions. Sales for the Safety Zone acquired on June 1 represents the majority of our acquisition revenues for the Office business, and we are pleased to report that the integration of this business is progressing very well.", "By customer group, our mid single-digit growth in the mega channel was partially offset by a mid single-digit decline with our independent resellers. On the Products side, the facilities and breakroom supplies category, or FBS, performed very well in the quarter, while the Office Products segment category was down low single-digits. Furniture was down mid single-digits and technology products were down low double-digits. We continue to make solid progress on our acquisition strategy and the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing FBS category.", "As previously announced, we acquired certain janitorial and sanitation business from Rochester Midland Corporation effective July 1. We expect this business to further enhance our FBS product offering and contribute approximately $20 million in annual revenues.", "Our Office team will continue to look for these types of strategic bolt-on acquisitions, as well as execute on our ongoing share of wallet and market share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry. We are confident in our growth strategy and look forward to showing more progress over the balance of the year.", "So that is an overview of our performance by business, and we want to thank our teams across all of our businesses for their efforts day-in and day-out. We appreciate all that they do to make GPC the great company that it is.", "So at this point, I'd also want to come back to my earlier comment that reinvigorating our sales growth is our number one priority. During this call, we talked a great deal about our sales environment and the execution of our initiatives to drive sales growth. And I thought it might be helpful to pull it all together and outline a few of the key action steps we are taking to achieve this goal.", "The four building blocks of our growth strategy are comprised of the following: the execution of fundamental initiatives to drive a greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused both on geographical as well as product line expansion; the building out of our digital capabilities across all four of our businesses; and the further expansion of our U.S. and international store footprint.", "We are confident that our intense focus in these four key areas will positively impact our sales and support the steady and consistent growth we strive to achieve at Genuine Parts Company.", "Now, I'll hand it over to Carol who will provide a financial update and a full year guidance. Carol?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Paul, and congratulations on your promotion to CEO. It is certainly well deserved and we look forward to the execution of your key sales strategies. And, Tom, I would also like to thank you for your tremendous leadership of the company and, on a more personal level, your guidance and counsel over the years.", "We will begin this morning with a review of our financials and look at the second quarter income statement and segment information, and then, we'll finish up with a review of a few key balance sheet items.", "Our total revenues of $3.9 billion for the second quarter were down 1%. Our gross profit for the second quarter was 29.9%, which was equal to the prior year. Our management teams are focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives, and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long term.", "The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively steady, with very little supplier inflation, if any. Our cumulative supplier price changes through six months in 2016 were Automotive down 0.7%, Industrial up 0.2%, Office up 0.2% and Electrical down 1.3%.", "Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses for the second quarter were $865 million or 22.2% of sales, which is up slightly from last year, primarily due to this lower sales levels for the quarter. This was partially offset by our tight cost control measures which continue to positively impact our results and drive our progress towards greater operational efficiencies.", "Now, if we look at the results by segment, our Automotive revenue for the second quarter of $2.1 billion was down 1% from the prior year and 53% of total sales. Our operating profit of $204 million is down 2% and the operating margin for this group is 9.7% compared to 9.9% in the second quarter last year.", "Our Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter were a decrease of 1.7% and 30% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $88 million is down 0.7% and our operating margin is up 10 basis points to 7.6% which is driven by a nice gross margin improvement (23:07).", "Office Products revenues were $482 million in the second quarter, up 1% and 12% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $33 million is down 5% and our operating margin is 6.8% compared to 7.2% last year.", "For the Electrical Group, our sales were $185 million in the quarter, down 5% in the prior year and also 5% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $16 million is down 14% and the margin for this group is 8.7% compared to 9.5% last year or down 80 basis points.", "So for the second quarter, our total operating profit margin was 8.7% compared to 8.9% in the second quarter last year. This basically reflects the lack of leverage as mentioned earlier. With that said, we are intensely focused on showing progress in this area in the periods ahead.", "We had net interest expense of $4.7 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we currently expect net interest of $20 million to $21 million.", "Our total amortization expense of $9.2 million for the second quarter, and we would expect our total amortization expense for the full year to be $36 million to $38 million.", "Our depreciation expense was $26.7 million for the quarter and for the full year, we project total depreciation to approximate $110 million to $120 million. So our combined depreciation and amortization was $36 million for the second quarter, and we would expect the combined number to be in the range of $145 million to $160 million for the full year.", "The other line which primarily reflects our corporate expense was $26.5 million for the quarter compared to $24.8 million last year. For the full year, we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range.", "Our tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 36.2% compared to 37% in the second quarter last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings as well as a favorable non-taxable retirement plan valuation adjustment compared to last year.", "We expect this rate to show a slight increase in the last half of the year, but we are projecting our full year rate to be 36.3% to 36.8%. Our net income for the quarter, as Paul mentioned, was $191.4 million compared to $195.4 million last year, and our EPS of $1.28 was equal to last year.", "Now, turning to the balance sheet, we continue to further strengthen our balance sheet with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at June 30 was $234 million, up slightly from June of last year.", "Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our businesses. Accounts receivable of $2 billion at June 30 was up 1% from the prior year, and we continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with our quality at this time.", "Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion, which is actually down 3% when you exclude the impact of our acquisitions in the last 12 months. Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels and will continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward.", "Our accounts payable at June 30 was $3.1 billion, up 12% from last year, due to improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We're encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and also our days in payables, and we would add that our AP to inventory ratio at June 30 reached 100% for the first time.", "Our working capital of $1.5 billion at June 30 continues to show steady improvement from quarter to quarter and is down nicely from the prior year. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular, key items such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable remain a high priority for our company.", "Our total debt is $775 million at June 30 compares to $850 million in total debt last year, and this includes two $250 million term notes, as well as another $275 million in borrowings, under our revolving line of credit. We would also add that one of our term notes is due November 30 of this year, and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date.", "Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 19%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe that it provides the company with both the flexibility and financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may want to pursue.", "So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of our company. We continue to generate strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we remain well-positioned for another solid year in 2016.", "We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year, and our free cash flow which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be in the $400 million to $450 million range.", "We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash includes strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses, and the dividend.", "Our strategic acquisitions remained an ongoing and important use of cash for us, and they're integral to our growth plans. Through July 1 of this year, we've added a number of new businesses across our Automotive, Industrial, and Office operations. These are excellent strategic fit for us and collectively, we expect these acquisitions to generate approximately $450 million in annual revenues.", "Looking forward, we will continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities across all of our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. We'll continue to target those bolt-on acquisitions of companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range. But we're also open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investments.", "Turning to share repurchases, we purchased 765,000 shares in the second quarter and 1.3 million shares for the six months. To-date, we have 4.9 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program and the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.", "Our investment in capital expenditures was $38 million in the second quarter and is $50 million through June. For the year, we're currently planning for capital expenditures to be in the range of $120 million to $140 million, so we expect CapEx to increase slightly over the balance of the year due to the timing of several large projects.", "Turning to our dividend, our 2016 dividend is $2.63 per share or a 7% increase in the prior year dividend of $2.46. 2016 also marked our 60th consecutive annual increase in the dividend.", "So that concludes our financial update for the second quarter 2016 and, in summary, our non-Automotive businesses continue to operate in a challenging sales environment. And in the second quarter, our U.S. Automotive sales were impacted by rather weak conditions. Fortunately, we see these as transitory issues and we look forward to improving conditions as we move ahead.", "Additionally, we continue to benefit from strong performances in our international automotive operations. For the quarter, we offset some of the market headwinds with key sales initiatives, steady gross margins, and tight expense cost controls.", "In addition, we further improved the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports our ongoing investment in opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases.", "Now, turning to our guidance for the full year. On the revenue side, we are maintaining our guidance for total sales to be at plus 1% to plus 2% for the full year. Among our business segments, we are maintaining our Automotive sales guidance at plus 2% to plus 3% for the full year, and we're increasing our Office guidance for sales to be plus 2% to plus 3% from the original amount of down 1% to up 1%.", "We are lowering our Industrial sales to flat to up 1% from the previous plus 1% to plus 2%, and we're reducing the Electrical sales outlook to down 2% to down 3% from the previous up 1% to up 2%. This sales outlook includes all acquisitions that have closed through July 1 as well as the ATCO (32:39) Industrial acquisition that Paul mentioned earlier.", "On the earnings side, we are updating our earnings guidance to be $4.70 to $4.75 from the previous range of $4.70 to $4.80 for the full year.", "So this completes our prepared remarks, and we would just close by saying thank you to all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work and commitment to the success of GPC.", "Paul, I'll turn it back over to you.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thank you, Carol. A good update on the quarter. So without a doubt, we are experiencing a challenging quarter, and frankly, it has been a challenging six months. But as you can tell from our guidance, we are planning for an improved second half to the year, and our teams are energized to execute on the action steps we outlined earlier.", "We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead.", "So now, we'll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks a lot. Good morning.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And Tom, all the best to you as you continue to move forward. I have two sets of questions. The first relates to the Automotive business. It was interesting that you talked about June being flat compared to April up slightly even as some of the weather-sensitive businesses really popped with some of the heat that we saw in parts of the country.", "So can you talk about what's transpiring with other categories and how weather-related softness away from the areas like batteries might be, just sort of how we got to flat rather than an increase with some of the weather businesses surging late in the quarter?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "And are you referencing specifically the month of June, Matt?", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I believe so. I'm talking about the cadence that you...", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yes.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "...spelled out where I think April was up low singles, May down low to mid singles, and June flat. I believe that related to your same-store sales number, though I'm not sure.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yes. So product-related movement we're seeing is, certainly, batteries were soft in the quarter. Ride control was soft in the quarter. However, we saw a slowing in our brakes business in the quarter, which we attribute some of that, we believe, to some of our brakes business probably moved into the first quarter given the warmer temps.", "On the plus side, we're continuing to see nice growth out of our import lines. We're seeing nice growth out of our tool and equipment categories, but unfortunately, they weren't enough to offset some of the softness we saw in the other categories.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And as we're 20 or so days into a new quarter, any sense of how the current run rate compares to what you saw in June?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yeah. I would have to tell you July \u2013 Matt, even though we're only a couple of weeks in and it's looking a lot like June. It's choppy is the best way I think I could describe it. The hot weather has to be a benefit to us and we believe with the continuing warm temps we're seeing across the country will be a benefit to us. And related to that, we are seeing those products that are related to the hot temps, products like batteries, products like rotating electrical, and our AC is picking up. So that's why we're cautiously optimistic about the second half of the year.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And then, my second question relates to Industrial, and specifically to the margin trends within that business. Historically, the gross was within Industrial, I believe were largely volume-driven and tied closely to volume rebates. You had a quarter where I think the volumes were not quite up to your expectations. The margins was quite good. And, Carol, on the call, you cited gross margins within that business. So any sense of the margin dynamics beneath the surface in Industrial, please.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I guess, and you're exactly right, we certainly have headwinds on the volume incentives in that business. What we've been pleased to see is for the first six months of the year, Industrial's core gross margin has improved, and that's due to a lot of things that they put in place over the last 18 months or so, and it's both on the buy side and the sell side. And those things have been put in place, and it helped (37:19) their gross profit. We had, for the six months, a slight decrease in their volume incentives, but they were flat in the quarter. And additionally, on the SG&A side, they've adjusted their cost structure to be more in line with the revenues.", "So it's the combination of those things. So I would say that we're really pleased to see what they did in Q2. And we are expecting a slightly better second half for the Industrial business on the top-line. So hopefully, we can maintain that slight margin improvement as we finish out the year.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it and understood. Thank you so much, guys.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Thanks a lot and good morning and best of luck, Tom.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning, Seth.", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman", "Thank you, Seth.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "First question is just on the difference regionally between \u2013 well, within the Auto Parts business. If you could provide some color as to how the regions performed through the quarters, the delta between the Central and Eastern, as well as the rest of the business, say from April, May relative to June.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yeah. It's a bit like we saw in the previous quarter, Seth, the cold weather in the Northern division. So I called out specifically the Central and the Northeast. The delta between those businesses and some of our Southern businesses, our Southeastern, even down into Florida Atlantic, even out West, was a significant gap, we're talking close to 400 basis points, 500 basis points gap between those that are performing well and those that are continuing to be challenged.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Got it. So that's 400-basis-point to 500-basis-point gap. Was that for the full quarter? Or do you see that gap narrow as you moved into June with the weather improvement?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "No. That was full quarter.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Got it. And did the gap narrow in June?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Not \u2013 it's not much. We're pretty consistent throughout the quarter in both the Northern divisions as well as those warmer weather divisions.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then, second question is just on major accounts, a slowdown there in major accounts. Can you provide any color on that maybe like you have done for the Industrial large customers, how many up or down or what's driving the slowdown in major accounts, do you lose customers? Just any other color will be helpful there.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yeah. We stay close to our major customers, as you would imagine, Seth, and have a lot of conversations. Not all of them are down, but I would tell you that we have seen a drop in their business. We discussed with them often how their business is trending. Their tire sales have been challenged and those big tire guys that we do business with.", "So again, I don't think boy, I can tell you we haven't lost any of our big major customers, and I don't believe we're losing share in any of our major customers. I would tell you that I think our business is the reflection of their business.", "And I would also share, Seth, that as we look at the Automotive aftermarket, in general, we have had many top-to-top meetings with many of our big suppliers here in recent weeks and months. We do have constant dialogue with our major accounts at our NAPA AutoCare Centers. And again, that sluggishness that we experienced in our numbers, what we hear is all of those parties that we're discussing with it are seeing similar results.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Understood. Best of luck for improvement in the second half.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thanks, Seth.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Seth.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "Hey. Thanks. I want to follow up a little bit on the Industrial business and then SG&A. Paul, you mentioned some signs of stability in the Industrial business, although if you think about the number of categories that were up or down being the same as last quarter and Industrial production seems to be a little bit better than your actual sales growth or organic. What are those specific signs of stability that you're pointing to? Then I wanted to follow up with Carol.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yeah. So if I look at the numbers, Greg, that we've seen quarter-to-quarter since back in early 2015 where our sales were declining dramatically from one quarter to the next, culminating in an 8% drop in Q4, we rebounded, if you want to call it that, to a low single-digit increase in Q1 and we've seen that again in Q2.", "So when I say stabilizing, it has stabilized from really the drop that we were seeing \u2013 significant drops that we were seeing in 2015. In talking to our team, our Motion business in Canada has seemed to stabilize and even is showing some slight improvement. We watch very closely our project work. And our project work \u2013 well, the projects are smaller than we would like. They're steady. And the number of projects that we see out there are steady.", "So we're hopeful and we're starting to see it play out in the numbers a bit at our Industrial business, which also impacts our Electrical that has bottomed out. And hopefully, we'll see a better second half.", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "Great. And Carol, what was the thing helping you to actually take down SG&A dollars? I mean you did it in the first quarter and in the second quarter. Can we assume that SG&A dollars are down in the back half as well?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I guess there's a lot of activities going on across all of our businesses. We said that each business, a lot of our investments are in technology and productivity. So as we can put in some of these efficiencies, we would be improving our volume per employee, so certainly, looking at efficiencies in distribution centers.", "Also, you're just adjusting your cost structure to a different level of revenue. So on the Industrial side, and looking at some of their facilities, and looking at their operations, and making adjustments to, say, where we're not going to have business in certain areas and possibly we need to go from three branches to two branches.", "And so, I think it's a number of projects going on. Our Automotive folks have done a very good job on SG&A, and even with a little softer Q2, they still have some SG&A improvement. So we would expect it to continue. We need to have a little bit better second half, which we're forecasting on the revenue and we would expect these things to stay in place, yes.", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "That's great. Good luck.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thank you.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Greg.", "Operator. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.", "Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I had a couple of questions on Industrial. A few of your competitors seem to have referenced furloughs and plant shutdown. Have you seen anything similar or any reason why your customer mix might not be feeling the same headwinds?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "We have, Chris. We're seeing certainly some of the same things I think our competitors and other folks in the industrial world are seeing. If we look at specifically some of the big oil and gas producers which has a big impact on not just our Industrial business, but our Automotive as well. The thought is that and it appears that some of the large oil producers are set to weather their storm. But many of the small oil producers are going under, and I don't know that that's going to change much going forward.", "Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC", "Got you. And then, taking all the context, I mean a 3% organic decline really isn't that bad. Do you think relative to your performance to peers, like what do you think is driving that right now? Is it your maintenance mix versus new equipment? Are there any current growth drivers that you've added that are allowing to take share right now? Like, what are you seeing in that business?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Well, certainly, Chris, some of the new focus product category that we have gotten into in recent years, products like industrial supply, safety supply, material handling equipment, those products and product lines are performing well, and actually, are generating increases year-over-year.", "Where we're seeing some of the pressure is on the traditional industrial products, hydraulics, bearings, power transmission. But I think that much like our strategy in our Office Products business, as we segue into new categories, growth categories, that's certainly helping our numbers.", "Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC", "Got you. Then, actually, one last follow-up related to that. In terms of Office, I mean obviously, you've done a nice job of diversifying into jan/san and some other growth categories. But what are your core, like, technology office products? How are those performing right now? And is there a point in time where you see that business becomes less of a headwind to your consolidated Office number?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yeah. Our tech products \u2013 our tech categories were down in the quarter, Chris. And our team is, certainly, focused on getting that back in the plus column, but for now, that is a \u2013 our tech business is a bit of a headwind.", "Our strategy is I think we've articulated in the past is continuing to drive our overall Office Products business more into the facility, breakroom safety product categories. You're seeing that with most of the acquisitions that we've completed of late, certainly, the most recent being the Safety Zone and the division of Rochester Midland. So we believe that that tech headwind will become less and less of a factor as we move forward.", "Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC", "Got you. Okay, cool. Thank you for the help (48:01).", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "You're welcome. Thank you.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question from Elizabeth Suzuki from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, guys. If we look at organic revenue growth backing out the FX impact and positive contribution from acquisitions, every business segment was down year-over-year and for Auto, it sounds like you attributed that to weather specifically. Is there anyway to quantify what that growth would have been if weather had been consistent year-over-year and is mid-single-digit growth for the second half of the year achievable for that business?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "I'm sorry, Elizabeth. Are you referring specifically to Automotive or across all four?", "Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "To Auto specifically.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Okay. So Auto, in the first half of the year, our core Automotive business was actually up 1% and our expectation is that in the second half of the year that we are going to generate low to mid-single-digit growth in our core Automotive business and that does not include the potential assistance we'll get from acquisitions.", "Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "And Elizabeth, if you were to ask me as a follow-up, so how do you intend to do that, I would tell you that we're still very focused on our core initiatives in Automotive. While the quarter was certainly not up to our expectations, by no means are we in a panic mode and going to shift our focus, we have terrific opportunities to continue to grow our retail sales.", "We are rolling out our top store initiative which will, as mentioned in my comments, will total 150 stores in 2016. We'll reinvigorate our business in our NAPA AutoCare Center, and then, new distribution will be a factor as well. So we're confident we'll drive the kind of numbers that we talked about in the second half.", "Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And do you think without the weather impact, the second quarter might have seen that kind of low single-digit growth in core for Auto?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "One can only assume, Elizabeth. If you look at our first quarter, certainly, we were there. If you look at our previous number of quarters, certainly, we were there. So Q2, we believe, is an outlier, and again, I think that the key initiatives that our team is focused on will get our business back on track in the second half of the year.", "Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thanks for your questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll now move on to Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning and congrats, Tom, on all your success as a CEO over the year and Paul, congrats to you and good fortune to you as you move forward as CEO as well.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thank you, Chris.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "A couple of follow-up questions at this point. So you talked about June flat, July choppy, like June flattish. What's still soft, if you're seeing some of the weather-sensitive business pop, what categories continue to be a drag in performance?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yeah. As we saw in the second quarter, Chris, it's still some of those same core lines. It's ride control. It's brake business. Our brake business, we have been on a tremendous run over the last six quarters to eight quarters in our brake business, and we're seeing that tail off just a bit.", "Again, there is nothing that we have fundamentally changed. We haven't raised prices. We haven't changed product categories. So those big categories, ride control, brakes, that's where we're seeing some of the softness which we're certainly trying to outrun with the growth that we're seeing in tool and equipment, imports, and in our temp related businesses.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And so as you \u2013 I guess, do we have to wait around for \u2013 because it sounds like some of that's like, it's corrosion from the winter that didn't happen, it's potholes that didn't happen. And so do we have to wait around for the winter to see improvements like \u2013 forget your initiatives, but maybe just the industry growth rates, do you have to wait around for the winter to see improvements in those categories or is it \u2013 does 2012 suggest that, well, the further you get away, that drag mitigates and you can start to see growth, and maybe later in the third quarter in those businesses?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "I think you're spot on, Chris, with that comment. I referenced in my prepared remarks, what we saw back in 2012, and I do believe that will be the case. But I can assure you our team is not sitting on the sideline, they have a tremendous sense of urgency. No panic, but a tremendous sense of urgency working with our good customers out in the field, certainly working closely with our AutoCare Centers to understanding where they need our support, how we can help them grow their business. So we are intensely focused on getting our growth curve back going in the right direction in Q3, Q4. And as we have projected on our numbers, we do believe that that will be the case.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Just to clarify, you mean, as the further you get away from the winter, you can start to see growth as you proceed through the year. You don't have to wait for winter weather to reinvigorate those businesses.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "That's correct. That's correct.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then on July, someone asked about the regional differences in June, is the July acceleration in some of those weather-sensitive categories more focused in the Northern tier of the country?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "I think it's maybe just a bit early to go there, Chris. You had the July 4 holiday where we lost essentially a week. I think it might be a bit early to go there, but I will tell you that the hot temps that we're seeing, heck, I heard St. Louis is supposed to be 100 degrees-plus. That goes across the Northeast. That's going to drive business, and it's going to drive certainly those temp-related products. There's just no two ways about it. We've seen it in the past, and I don't think 2016 will be any different.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then one last clarifying question to your response. When you say, sort of July looks like June, there's no negative calendar impact in there. You're sourcing on the days adjusted business, (54:55) business looks similar, right?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Correct. Yes, sir.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much, guys.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "All right. Thanks, Chris.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thank you. Congrats, Tom and Paul. Welcome and look forward to working with you as we move forward.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thank you, Tony.", "Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets", "I wanted to talk a little bit more about the initiatives you have in place to sort of drive the sales growth, and you laid out some of those related to auto. But if you look across your four segments, and then identify the four sort of buckets that you attempt, whether it's (54:35) or acquisition, or digital, or expansion of footprint, can you sort of maybe give some more color of how you would align each one, and where the most opportunity along those four buckets would be for each one?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Well, certainly, we're looking at strategic acquisitions, Tony, in every single one of our businesses, and I think that in 2016 we've had impactful acquisitions in three of our four businesses. We have activity going in, in all four, but we have closed on deals in Industrial, Office, and of course Automotive. As it relates to specifically expanding footprint, both domestically and internationally, that's really targeted at our Automotive businesses. And as you know, we have new distribution initiatives in place both in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. I mentioned earlier we've had terrific success in our GPC Asia-Pac business, and that's a business we'll continue to grow. As we look at our digital capability, that goes across all four businesses, and we're driving e-commerce initiatives across every one of our businesses. And then, of course, a greater share of wallet which really, that underpins all of our efforts. Again, that growth goes across all four businesses (57:13), and really is that what we need to drive our core growth.", "Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets", "And then, especially on the distribution side, are you \u2013 as you continue to cross-sell and leverage across each of the segments, some of the SG&A savings, is that perhaps coming from your ability to be more effective across your distribution at all your locations?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "We believe so, Tony. Certainly, as we look at some of the recent acquisitions, the bolt-on acquisitions that we've done, The Safety Zone would fit that category, Rochester Midland, that Jan/San acquisition, we believe we have opportunities to cross-sell and take full advantage of the structure or the infrastructure we have in place. And I would say the same as it relates to acquisitions that we've done in the automotive space, whether it'd be on our import business or our heavy-duty business. We're leveraging that structure that we've had in place for many, many years across all of our businesses.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And I think one thing I may add \u2013 Tony, one thing I may add and you said on just SG&A, we also see opportunities that come on the cost of goods sold side as well. So on these acquisitions \u2013 and we look at the product categories, we're able to take that and leverage across the organization, our total spend. So we'll see that coming from the gross margin side and the SG&A side.", "Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets", "So it's just a 2016 (58:47) this continue for a period of time beyond as a result of integration and efficiency gain?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Correct.", "Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. And then last one question. I just want to clarify, what was your revised guidance on the Industrial? Did you say down to flat, is that correct (59:06)?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. Our Industrial is going to be flat to up 1% for our new guidance.", "Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets", "Flat to up. Okay. Perfect. Thank you.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Flat to up 1%.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "All right. Thanks, Tony.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, guys. How are you?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Hey, Scot.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Scot.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi. Specifically asking about auto at this point, any change in the competitive environment worth noting? There's obviously been a lot of changes in the industry over the last, let's call it, 12 months or so. I think we also kind of generally get the weather impact given the industry's experience in 2012. But there was also a period in 2008 and 2009 where your Auto business started to significantly lag the performance of a bunch of your peers. And if I remember right, it was a function of uncompetitive pricing in a couple of categories. In fact, it may have even been ride control, now that I think about it. So any change overall in the competitive environment? And then also specifically on your pricing relative to the market. Thanks.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yes. So I would say this, Scot, on the first question as it relates to our competition, we have not seen any major shift in the competitive landscape. I think pricing remains sane across all of our competitors. Look, everybody is scratching and clawing for market share in a challenging environment, but we've not seen any major shift across our key competitors. As it relates to our pricing by product or pricing by product category, I recall quite well your reference to 2008 and 2009, and that did occur and we did adjust, and I think we certainly benefited from it. We don't see anywhere, at this point, where we're an outlier in a particular product category. Our guys do price jobs on a very regular basis. We get input from the field on a daily and weekly basis, both from our stores as well as our independent owners. And there is always the occasional tweak we make here and there based on the competitive landscape, but now I would say, generally we are not seeing any significant change in the competitive landscape.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And Paul, can you remind us how you did wind up in the pricing quandary that you did back in 2008, 2009 because I thought you guys were doing kind of a price scans and competitive pricing general check, if you will, back then as well. I'm just wondering how it wound up gaining (01:01:56) so skewed relative to the market.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yeah. So I joined the Automotive Parts Group, Scot, in 2009. And if I recall, the shift that occurred, and maybe we were a bit slow on the trigger, was our competitors dropped the prices, and certainly, our retail competitors dropped their prices specifically. We ultimately regrouped, reacted and the business bounced right back, but when I joined in 2009, we were on our way out of that.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Got you. Okay. Very helpful, guys. Thanks a lot.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "All right. Thank you.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Scot.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Hey, Bret.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Congratulations to Tom and Paul also.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thank you Bret.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "You called out the energy market as another region that had some softness, and is that specifically Texas and Oklahoma? Does it spread any further around that range? And then maybe could you compare, you said maybe 400 basis points or 500 basis points spread between the north and the central in the Northeastern markets, versus a strong market comp, could you tell us maybe how the energy market comp compared to the average also?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yes. So when we look at our energy-related market, Bret, certainly, the first place everybody goes is Texas, Oklahoma and I get that. And certainly, that has been impacted, no doubt, and continues to be. And that's not just in Automotive, we see that in Industrial as well. But we also see it in the fracking regions. So we see it in portions of the Mountain Division. We see it in Montana, Dakotas a bit. We see it in Pennsylvania where fracking was blowing and going here a couple of years ago. And in addition, we also see it up in the oil sands in Canada, certainly Alberta has been a headwind for both our Automotive business in Canada as well as our Industrial business. So yes, not just Oklahoma and Texas, I wish it was. And then \u2013 I'm sorry, Bret, your second question related to the Northern division gap between their numbers and our warmer weather?", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "I was just going to ask you to compare your energy weakness to the rest of the market. You said that the Northern and Northeastern was 400 basis points or 500 basis points spread. I was wondering, if you could sort of give us a feeling for how bad the energy market was relative to average also.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "It's actually \u2013 if we focus in on your opening comments there, Texas, Oklahoma are very similar. It's that 400-basis point or 500-basis point gap. I mentioned Mountain as one of our better performing divisions. So we're able to overcome some of the shortfall in the Dakotas with some strong performance in the Denver area, for instance, that have made up for that.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then a final question, you talked a couple of times about air conditioning or temperature-related products being up double-digits. Are in-stock levels fine there, is demand exceeding supply, or is everything okay in the inventory?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yes. I will tell you, Bret, on the inventory comment, we are looking at our inventories across our entire business. We have a new predictive modeling engine that we've put into place, and we're looking at our inventories, and especially in some of the categories where we're challenged, and we are pumping up our inventories in some of those categories. Our AC products, we have not had an issue at least that I'm aware of at this point. I think we're well-positioned as we race head long into the back half of the summer.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "All right. Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll now take our final question from Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli.", "Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Hi, Tom. Hi, Paul. Congratulations to you both.", "Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman", "Thank you, Brian.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thank you, Brian.", "Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Two real quick ones. Carol, another great job on working capital. Was any portion of that attributable to changes in currency?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No. Well, there was \u2013 our currency-neutral numbers were smaller this quarter than they have been in the past. But the bulk of that working capital improvement is just coming from accounts payable, and it's broadly all of the segments quite honestly. And then, really, where we saw a nice improvement this quarter was inventory. We had about $85 million source of cash from our inventories this quarter, and that was \u2013 a lot of that came from Automotive. So we were pleased to see additional improvement coming out of inventory, and we feel like we'll have some more in the back half.", "Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay. That's great and encouraging. And then just on getting my numbers right for the NAPA comps, company-owned stores were down 2% in the U.S. Were they down international?", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "They were actually up international.", "Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We had said they were up. So I think Canada was low single-digits, and Australia, New Zealand was mid single-digits.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "And Brian just to clarify one point, you mentioned our company-owned stores, our company-owned stores same-store sales were flat in the quarter. Overall, our Automotive was down 2%, U.S. automotive.", "Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "That's why I asked. Okay. Great. Well, thank you very much and good luck in the coming months.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thanks very much, Brian.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Brian.", "Operator", "And we'll now take our follow-up question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Sorry to prolong the call, but I just had felt the need to follow up on Brian's last question. If we think about that delta between the flat comp in the U.S. and the total down 2%, is that lower sell in to the franchise stores or to the network, or some other factor driving that decline?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "No, you've got it. That's exactly it, Matt.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Any sense of their sell-through relative to that decline, or was it that tough to depot back an inventory because that's a bit of a different pace of business from what you're seeing at the company-owned stores?", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "It is. Our independent owners are competing just fine in the marketplace. I don't think there's anything specific to our big independent owners. They did do a little bit of an inventory build towards the end of Q1, which may have had an impact. But no, we don't see, we certainly don't see anything different happening on the independent side from our company-owned stores.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Understood. Thank you so much.", "Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thank you, Matt.", "Operator", "And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for additional and closing remarks.", "Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, we would like to thank everyone for participating in today's call, and we look forward to reporting out with our third quarter results.

Please go ahead.", "Sidney Jones", "Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company third quarter 2016 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full-year. Before we begin this morning please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its businesses.", "The Company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the Company\u2019s latest SEC filings. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.", "We\u2019ll begin this morning with comments from our President and CEO, Paul Donahue. Paul?", "Paul Donahue", "Thank you, Sid, and let me add my welcome to all of you on the call this morning. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us. Before we begin our commentary on the quarter, we want to update you on Hurricane Matthew, a powerful and deadly storm which recently hit the coast of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas as well as the Caribbean.", "This storm inflicted damages in excess of $5 billion and impacted the lives and businesses of countless GPC personnel and our good customer partners. There are many GPC associates, too many to call out today, who were mobilized around the clock before, during and after the storm, providing aid and assistance for those affected. We want to take this opportunity to publicly thank them for their selfless efforts.", "From an operations perspective, we\u2019ve had a number of facilities and stores closed and/or without power for long periods of time. While most operations are now back up and running, we still have stores in the Carolinas struggling with power outages and floodwaters. So now the real work begins, and our team will continue to support the cleanup efforts and provide assistance wherever and whenever needed.", "Now earlier this morning, we released our third quarter 2016 results. I\u2019ll make a few remarks on our overall results and then cover our performance by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full-year. After that, we will open up the call to your questions.", "So a quick recap of our third quarter results shows; sales for the quarter were $3.94 billion, which was up 0.5%. Net income was $185.3 million compared to $188 million last year, and earnings per share were $1.24 which is unchanged from last year\u2019s third quarter.", "Our third quarter performance fell short of our expectations. Despite the challenging sales environment, we had planned for improved results for the second half of the year, and we came up short in the third quarter. As we will discuss throughout this call, we are intensely focused on our action plans to drive sales and reduce costs in the quarters ahead.", "Total sales in the quarter included a 3.5% benefit from acquisitions spread across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses, and you will hear more on our successful acquisition strategy as we review our business results. Currency exchange was neutral to our overall results for the first time in a number of quarters with the slightly favorable Canadian and Australian currencies offsetting the ongoing weakness in the Mexican peso.", "Turning to our Automotive operations. For the quarter ending September 30, our global Automotive sales were up 1.5%, which has improved from the 0.7% decrease in the second quarter. This quarter\u2019s increase includes an approximate 2.5% benefit from acquisitions and a currency tailwind of 0.5%.", "Our total U.S. results were off 1% in the quarter and this follows a 2% decrease in the second quarter. This sequential improvement follows a fairly steep deceleration from a solid start to the year when U.S. sales were up 4%. And we would add that September was the strongest month in an otherwise challenging quarter. With that said, we continue to operate in a generally sluggish sales environment, which we believe relates to the ongoing softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring seasons.", "As we noted on our last call, we had a similar weather pattern back in 2012 and experienced the same type of sluggish demand we are seeing today. What is different is that we had a hot summer across much of the U.S. this year, and we could see that having a positive impact on demand in the quarters ahead.", "And one final comment here would be that our Eastern, Central and Midwest regions, which benefit the most from the normal winter weather patterns, represent more than 40% of our U.S. revenues and continue to significantly underperform the balance of the country.", "We continue to analyze multitudes of data and scenarios including the impact of online competition, general competitive and pricing dynamics, trends and transportation, the number of vehicles entering our sweet spot and OE dealer warranties and services, among others. We do not believe that any one of these factors is having a material impact on our business.", "We have concluded that while it is important to consider each of these factors as we plan for the future. The challenges we are facing today are in fact, transitory. As we anniversary last winter\u2019s mild weather and execute on our growth initiatives in the quarters ahead, we expect to further improve our sales results and ultimately return to our historical mid single-digit growth rates.", "Turning now to a look at our U.S. company-owned store group. Same-store sales were down 2% in the third quarter, which is in line with our total U.S. sales before the positive impact of acquisitions. This follows flat year-over-year comps in the second quarter and plus 3% to begin the year.", "DIY and retail sales at our company stores were down mid-single digits, driven by a decrease in transaction counts, while the average basket size was flat for the quarter. While disappointing overall, sales at the stores updated for our retail impact initiative are bucking this trend with double-digit retail sales increases.", "And while not in enough stores yet to make a mark on our total retail comps, we are confident in the long-term positive benefits of these initiatives. We are on plan to rollout this new retail concept in 150 company-owned stores this year and will accelerate the project to add an additional 300 stores in 2017.", "The commercial wholesale business at our company stores was down low single digits in the third quarter, driven by low to mid single-digit declines at our Major Accounts and fleet business. Sales to our AutoCare Centers were down slightly, although on a more positive note, we added nearly 500 new AutoCare memberships thus far in 2016 and stand at over 16,000 members today.", "This is a testament to the overall value of this program to our independent installer base, and we look to this program to be a significant growth driver for us in the periods ahead. Our average wholesale transaction counts as well as ticket value were both down for the quarter.", "Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers for all our business remain sound. The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11.5 years, lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains.", "Miles driven increased 3.4% in August, the most recent data available and is up 3.1% year-to-date. August now marks 30 consecutive months of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.32 in the third quarter, well below last year and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases.", "We want to also update you on our international businesses which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand and Australia, our core Automotive business is performing well with sales consistently up mid to high single digits. In addition, we continue to see solid contributions from our recent acquisitions and we have made significant progress with the integration of the Covs and AMX businesses acquired earlier this year.", "Likewise, we are pleased to report that on September 1, we closed on the acquisition of ASL, a New Zealand-based automotive aftermarket distributor to the commercial side of the industry. ASL operates 15 branches with approximate annual revenues of US$15 million.", "With these acquisitions, our footprint in Australia and New Zealand has grown now to 546 locations. This represents an increase of more than 100 net new stores over the past three years. Our leadership team in Asia Pacific continues to operate at a high level, and we see continued expansion opportunities in the quarters ahead.", "At NAPA Canada, we continue to produce low single-digit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting Western Canada. The July 1 acquisition of Auto-Camping, a leading distributor of OEM parts in Canada with annual revenues of approximately US$50 million, has been a great addition to our Canadian business.", "Finally, in Mexico, our sales continue to gain momentum as we expand our NAPA footprint. We now have 28 stores in Mexico today, up from 21 on June 30, and we have plans for additional store growth in the periods ahead. We continue to be encouraged by the long-term growth prospects for NAPA in Mexico.", "We have built a solid foundation of international operations, which currently account for approximately 30% of our total Automotive revenues. As we look to the future, we are well positioned for future growth opportunities across these markets.", "In summary, we faced a challenging sales environment in the U.S. during the third quarter, with these headwinds somewhat offset by the ongoing strength of our international operations as well as the positive impact of acquisitions and new distribution expansion.", "We look to improve on this quarter\u2019s performance in the periods ahead by expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new-store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions.", "Turning now to our Industrial business, Motion Industries ended the quarter down 0.7%, which has slightly improved from the 2% decrease we experienced in the second quarter. After adjusting for acquisitions, core Industrial sales were down an approximate 2.5% and again, a slight improvement on a sequential basis.", "As a reminder, this quarter\u2019s results include the August 1 acquisition of OBBCO, a regional industrial safety products distributor with estimated revenues of approximately $20 million. As we have said in recent quarters, our Industrial business has seemed to stabilize, although any signs of a meaningful recovery will most likely occur in 2017.", "The industrial indices we track, such as industrial production, capacity utilization and the PMI, simply remain too choppy to indicate otherwise. What we do know, however, is that we have seen these cycles before, and we are confident in our sales strategies and ability to generate strong growth in this business when the market begins to strengthen. The question right now is one of timing.", "A review of our business by industry segment, top customers and top product categories further supports the choppy markets. Among our top 12 Industry segments, our results were consistent with the second quarter, with three sectors up, seven down and two unchanged from last year. And among our top 12 product categories, six were up and six were down, also consistent with last quarter. And finally, among our top 20 customers, 13 were up and seven were down, which compares to 15 up and five down in the second quarter.", "So the takeaway again this quarter is that our results were relatively consistent with the most recent quarters and remain mixed among our customers and products. With that said, we would add that September was our strongest daily sales month of the year and we are seeing growth across all regions of the U.S. other than in the oil and gas region of the Southwest.", "The encouraging news out of the Southwest is, while still running negative numbers, they are closing the gap. Additional positive news for the Southwest is the move of oil prices back to the $50 range. We are also encouraged to see the level of exported goods improving from the 6% to 7% declines we experienced in the first half of the year. These trends bode well for the industrial markets.", "Likewise, we recently announced the October 3 acquisition of Braas Company, a multiregional distributor of products and distribution services for industrial automation and control with estimated annual revenues of $90 million. The growth prospects for this segment of the industry including robotics, motion control and industrial networking are compelling, and the addition of such a well-positioned business will substantially enhance our automation capabilities.", "So despite our cautionary stance on a near-term recovery, we continue to position this business for strong sales and earnings growth upon a recovery. You can also look for us to execute on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth in the fourth quarter.", "Moving on to EIS, our Electrical distribution segment. Sales for this group were down 9% due to several factors, some of which are also impacting our Industrial business. A few of the more impactful challenges this quarter include further weakness in our electrical markets, driven primarily by our business with the energy sector including oil, gas as well as coal.", "We\u2019re also seeing lower copper pricing and the overall effects on demand. It appears these headwinds will persist into the fourth quarter. So as we work through this cycle, we\u2019ll be intensely focused on making the proper cost reductions and improving our efficiencies while also executing on our initiatives to drive meaningful sales growth over the long-term.", "To that end, on the 1st of this month, we acquired Communications Products and Services, a leading distributor of plant product solutions for both aerial and underground broadband cable and wireless network infrastructure. CPS further strengthens our cable operations in the Western U.S. and should generate approximately $12 million in annual revenues.", "And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business, which reported a 5% increase in sales for the third quarter. This is improved from a 1% increase in the second quarter, driven by an 11% contribution from recent acquisitions. Our acquisitions including Safety Zone are performing well and contributing nicely to our growth strategy for the facilities and breakroom supplies category.", "Core sales for the Office business were down 6% in the third quarter, a decrease from the 4% core sales decrease in the second quarter. Primarily, this was driven by weaker sales through the mega channel, which was down low single-digits following mid single-digit growth through the first half of the year. Sales through the independent reseller channel were down mid-single digits, consistent with the declines we have seen all year.", "From the product side, the facilities and breakroom supplies category, or FBS, posted strong growth in the quarter, while traditional office supplies, furniture and technology products each posted sales declines. This quarter was difficult for us and as you can see in the numbers, but we are confident in our abilities to show more progress in the quarters ahead.", "Moving forward, we are focused on the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing FBS category. Our growth strategy involves strategic bolt-on acquisitions to further enhance our capabilities in this category as well as the execution of our ongoing share-of-wallet and market share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry.", "So that is an overview of our performance by business. We continue to operate in a tough sales environment, but our teams are working hard in all aspects of our business to overcome these challenges and generate growth in the quarters ahead.", "Now I\u2019ll hand it over to Carol, who will provide a financial update and full-year guidance. Carol?", "Carol Yancey", "Thank you, Paul. We\u2019ll begin with our financial review with a look at our third quarter income statement and the segment information and then we\u2019ll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. As Paul mentioned, total revenues of $3.94 billion for the third quarter was an increase of 0.5%.", "Gross profit for the third quarter was 30.4% of sales, which is an increase from the 29.8% in the prior year quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by a favorable supplier incentive, product mix shift into higher-margin categories and the benefit of our more recent higher margin acquisitions.", "Looking forward, we remain focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long-term. The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively unchanged from where we\u2019ve been for some time with very little supplier inflation, if any. Our cumulative supplier price changes through nine months in 2016 were down 0.7% in Automotive, up 0.4% in Industrial, up 0.2% in Office and down 1.3% in Electrical.", "Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses for the third quarter were $907 million, up 4% from last year and 23% of sales. Our increase in expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the weak sales environment across all of our businesses.", "In addition, as we initially integrate our acquisitions into our existing operations, we can experience an uptick in costs. Ultimately, we\u2019re able to eliminate these excess costs and actually reduce our overall cost as we build on the synergies that we create with the combined businesses.", "We would also add that, with certain acquisitions, their models show higher gross margins, as mentioned earlier, but also a higher operating cost as well, so that\u2019s a factor in the current quarter.", "In the current sales environment, it\u2019s imperative that we review in detail any expense that we have to ensure we are operating with the lowest possible cost structure. Managing our expenses with tight cost control measures is ongoing at GPC but especially critical today, and we recognize that there\u2019s always need for improvement.", "Probably the most impactful initiative for us over the long-term is that our businesses are rationalizing their facilities to streamline their cost structure wherever appropriate. This serves to reduce our distribution cost as well as our headcount and payroll-related costs, which are significant expenses for us.", "Thus far, in 2016, we have closed or consolidated a number of distribution centers and branches, and we reduced our headcount by approximately 1%. Although these steps are meaningful, not all of the savings are in our numbers yet, and importantly, you\u2019ll see many more opportunities for further consolidations.", "Our ongoing investments in technology, which we\u2019ve talked about for a long time now, are allowing us to do more and more of this type of rationalization while also maintaining our excellent customer service standards. So going forward, you can look for us to continue building a lower cost but highly effective distribution infrastructure across our businesses.", "Now we\u2019ll discuss the results by segment. Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.1 billion, up 1.5% from the prior year and 53% of total sales. Operating profit of $198 million is down 2%, with the operating margin for this group at 9.4% compared to 9.8% in the third quarter last year. This primarily reflects the pressure on our operating expenses due to the decline in our core Automotive sales.", "Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter, 0.7% decrease from the prior year and 29% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $86 million is down 5%, and our operating margin is 7.4% compared to the 7.7% last year.", "Similar to our Automotive margins, the pressure on the margin for this business relates to the lack of sales growth and its impact on our operating expenses despite good progress with our ongoing cost reductions and facility rationalizations.", "Office Products revenues were $535 million and 14% of our total sales, up 5% overall but down 6% excluding acquisitions. Our operating profit of $30 million is down 17%, and our operating margin is 5.7%. This group experienced significant pressure on their operating expenses this quarter due to three primary factors, the decrease in their organic sales; the rising cost associated with serving a growing number of sales channels; and incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. The Office team is taking immediate measures to address these areas and drive cost savings in the quarters ahead.", "The Electrical Group sales were $178 million in the quarter, down 9% from 2015 and 4% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $14 million is down 29%, and the operating margin for this group is 8.0% compared to a 10.2% margin last year. The decline in revenues was difficult to overcome this quarter, but this team is also working fast to reduce their cost and to show improvement in the quarters ahead.", "So our total operating profit margin for the third quarter was 8.3% compared to 8.9% last year, disappointing but essentially a function of the weak sales environment, which we have discussed, and we\u2019re intensely focused on reducing our cost to drive margin expansion. We had net interest expense of $5.2 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we currently expect net interest expense of approximately $20 million.", "Our total amortization expense was $10.3 million for the third quarter, and we would estimate total amortization expense of approximately $39 million for the full year. Our depreciation expense is $27.3 million for the quarter and we would expect the full-year to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million. So the combined depreciation and amortization number would be approximately $145 million to $160 million for the full-year.", "The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $21.1 million in the quarter compared to $34.3 million last year. The decrease in corporate expense primarily reflects the benefit of gains on the sale of certain real estate as well as the favorable retirement plan valuation adjustments. For the full-year, we currently expect corporate expense to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million.", "Our tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 36.4% compared to 37.4% last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, and the favorable retirement plan valuation adjustment we just discussed, which is nontaxable. For the full year, we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 36.2% to 36.5%. Net income for the quarter of $185.3 million and EPS of $1.24, which was equal to the third quarter last year.", "Now we\u2019ll turn to a discussion of the balance sheet, which we further strengthened in the third quarter with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at September 30 was $225 million, a $26 million increase from last year, even as we\u2019ve increased our spending for acquisitions. So our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across each of our distribution businesses.", "Accounts receivable of $2 billion at September 30, is up 3.5% from the prior year, and adjusted for the impact of currency translation is up 2%. We continue to closely manage our receivables, and we remain satisfied with our quality at this time.", "Our inventory at quarter end was $3.1 billion, which is up 6% from the prior year, although it\u2019s actually down slightly when you exclude the impact of our acquisitions as well as currency. Our teams are doing a very good job of effectively managing our inventory levels, and we\u2019ll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward.", "Accounts payable at September 30 was $3.1 billion, up 9% from last year, including a slight benefit of currency. Our ongoing progress in growing our accounts payable reflects improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. This has had a positive impact on our working capital and days in payables, and we would add that our AP-to-inventory ratio stands at 98.5% at September 30.", "Our working capital of $1.5 billion at September 30 is down from last year and showing steady improvement over multiple periods. Effectively managing our working capital remains a high priority for the Company and we continue to expect further improvement in the quarters ahead.", "Our total debt of $775 million is unchanged from June 30 and it compares to a $625 million in total debt last year. Our debt includes two $250 million term notes and a new five-year 2.39% $50 million term note that closed in July. We have another $225 million in borrowings under our multicurrency revolving line of credit. One of our two $250 million term notes is due this November and we\u2019ve recently entered into an agreement for a new 10-year note with a favorable interest rate of 2.99%, down from the current rate of 3.35%.", "Our total debt capitalization is approximately 19% and we are comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We continue to believe that our current structure provides the Company with both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may have.", "In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We have consistently generated strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we are well positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect our cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full-year and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value.", "Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us and are integral to the growth plans for our Company. Thus far in 2016, we have added a number of new businesses across each of the four business segments. These are excellent strategic fits for us and collectively, we expect them to generate over $600 million in annual revenues going forward.", "As we move forward, we\u2019ll continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. We\u2019ll continue to target those bolt-on types of companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, but we are open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investment.", "Turning to share repurchases. We\u2019ve purchased 249,000 shares in the third quarter and 1.6 million shares for the nine months. Today, we have 4.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.", "Our investment in capital expenditures was $37 million for the third quarter and $87 million through September. For the year, we are continuing to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $120 million to $140 million for the full-year.", "Turning to our dividend. The 2016 dividend is $2.63 a share, which is a 7% increase from the $2.46 per share paid in 2015. 2016 also marked our 60th consecutive annual increase in the dividend.", "Now this concludes our financial update for the third quarter of 2016. In summary, our businesses are operating in a difficult sales environment, but our teams are hard at work to overcome these challenges and to generate growth. From top to bottom, we are evaluating the cost structures to drive greater efficiencies and cost savings. We believe these efforts will position the company well for future sales and earnings growth.", "Now we\u2019ll turn to our guidance for the full-year. Based on our current performance and the outlook for the balance of the year, we\u2019re updating our full-year guidance for total sales to flat to up 1% from the previous up 1% to up 2%. Among our business segments, we\u2019re lowering Automotive sales guidance to up 1% to up 2% from the previous up 2% to up 3%.", "We\u2019re reducing our Industrial sales guidance to flat to down 1% from a previous flat to up 1%. We\u2019re reducing our Electrical sales to down 5% to down 6% from a previous down 2% to down 3%. We are maintaining our Office sales guidance at plus 2% to plus 3%.", "This sales outlook includes those acquisitions included in our nine-month results as well as the Braas and CPS acquisitions that closed this month. On the earnings side, we\u2019re lowering our earnings per share guidance to $4.55 to $4.60 from the previous $4.70 to $4.75 for the full-year.", "So this completes our prepared remarks, and I\u2019ll turn it back over to Paul at this time.", "Paul Donahue", "Thank you, Carol. Before we go to questions, I just wanted to add a few additional remarks we feel are important. First, we want to remind you of the action steps we outlined in our last call which are the four building blocks of our growth strategy. These are: one, executing our key initiatives to capture greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; two, an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused on both geographical as well as product line expansions; three, building out our digital capabilities across all four of our businesses; and four, further expanding our U.S. and international store footprint.", "We are confident that over time, our intense focus in these four key areas will positively impact our sales performance and drive the ongoing steady and consistent growth we look to achieve and our stakeholders expect. Second, we want to assure you that our current performance was not up to our expectations.", "As we speak, we continue to evaluate our cost structure in all areas of the business to drive immediate savings and longer-term efficiencies. Our goal is to show improved results in the quarters ahead and better position the company for sustainable growth well into the future. As Carol shared earlier, we have a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows to support our efforts.", "So in closing as we look ahead, we\u2019re excited with the many opportunities we have at GPC and can point to many positive factors fueling our optimism. We operate in four large and fragmented industries with less than 10% market share in each. The outlook for the automotive aftermarket continues to be positive. The industrial sector is showing early signs of a recovery.", "Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, supporting effective capital allocation strategy, our steady track record of increased dividends for 60 consecutive years and, last, but certainly not least, our team of 40,000 dedicated GPC Associates around the globe committed to delivering exceptional customer service.", "So despite our current challenges, we feel very good about the long-term prospects for growth at GPC. We\u2019ve been operating now for 88-plus years and we\u2019ve been through challenging times before. And as we move forward, we\u2019ll make the necessary adjustments and we will emerge as a stronger company. We look forward to reporting to you on our progress.", "So with that, we\u2019ll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll now take our first question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers", "Thanks. Good morning everybody.", "Paul Donahue", "Good morning, Chris.", "Christopher Horvers", "So wanted to follow-up, start with the September commentary around the U.S. NAPA business and also on the Motion Industries side. Can you put some brackets around that? Is it back to flat? Is it - turn positive? Or was it just simply less negative?", "Paul Donahue", "The Automotive, well, I\u2019ll give you, Chris, the kind of the cadence for the quarter, as I\u2019m sure that will come up. What we saw in our overall Automotive business was predominantly flat in July and August, and then we saw a low to mid single - low single-digit increase in the month of September.", "So we did see some improvement in September. And while it\u2019s early yet in October, that\u2019s holding a bit. So it gives us a bit of renewed optimism as we head into the all-important fourth quarter. And hopefully, if we get a little winter weather headed our way in November, December that can only further help things.", "And in Industrial, we\u2019re seeing some green shoots as well. If you look at the indices that we follow, the ISM September numbers were positive, which rebounded from a negative number in August. So we\u2019re starting to see a bit of an uptick in our Industrial business as well.", "Christopher Horvers", "So just to clarify that, that flat in July and August and up low single digits in the month of September, that\u2019s the U.S. business or I thought the U.S. is actually down during the quarter.", "Paul Donahue", "That\u2019s our global Automotive business, Chris.", "Christopher Horvers", "Okay, any particulars around the U.S. business? Did it follow that similar trend?", "Paul Donahue", "Our overall trend in Automotive was if you go - because you had a lot of calendar movement in the quarter with a couple less days in July, a couple of extra days in August. So it was kind of all over the board, but the positive is we did see a more positive trend in September than what we saw in July and August in our U.S. business, so similar trend to our global business.", "Christopher Horvers", "Understood. And then as you think about NAPA, I think I was curious at the product category level, was the improvement sort of a lag hot weather repair and maintenance on hot weather-sensitive products? Or did you see more broad-based improvement in some of the more core less weather-sensitive categories?", "Paul Donahue", "No. You hit it right on the head, Chris. The growth that we saw in the quarter was temp-related products. So our Electrical business obviously led by batteries was up mid-single digits. We saw a nice increase in our AC type products. We also saw decent business in our tool and equipment side. Where we\u2019re still seeing a bit of a struggle is some of our under car lines, some of our ride control, heavy duty.", "And we don\u2019t often talk about it on this call, but our capital equipment business, so things like tire changers, wheel balancers, lifts, that business has been off as well. So to your point, we did see some of the benefits of the hot temps coming out of the summer, and it drove business in our Electrical and AC business.", "Christopher Horvers", "And then last question, as you think about just - as you look into the fourth quarter, do you have concern that the business could actually ebb from here given the improvement? It sounds like it was the hot weather side. Or is it just simply in the comparisons dropped off so much in the fourth quarter that would neutralize that? Thank you.", "Paul Donahue", "Well, you heard the guidance, Chris, and we did take the guidance down a little bit in Q4. We\u2019re comfortable in the range that we told you folks, which is Automotive being up one to up two. Certainly, we\u2019re taking a cautious outlook, and we would hope to outperform. But again, a bit of that is out of our control, so we\u2019ll hope for a little bit of a stronger core business.", "Christopher Horvers", "Understood. Thanks very much. Good luck.", "Paul Donahue", "You are welcome. Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll now go to Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.", "Seth Basham", "Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question.", "Paul Donahue", "Hey. Good morning, Seth.", "Carol Yancey", "Good morning.", "Seth Basham", "My first question is just making sure I understand some of the trends in the auto business in the U.S. for the quarter. As I heard you correctly, I think you spoke to 0% comps for company-owned stores, but the total U.S. business that was in the second quarter a negative 2% in 3Q, and total U.S. business was down 2% in the second quarter and up 1% in the third quarter, is that correct?", "Paul Donahue", "Let me see if I\u2019m correct with you, Seth. The 2% same-store sales decline in Q3 in U.S. was accurate. Our overall - let me just pull the numbers, our overall business in the U.S., was down 1% and plus - and then, when you add in acquisitions, acquisitions actually added in a point for us.", "Seth Basham", "Got it. Okay. So if you look at the U.S. business, then you saw company-owned stores doing all that work in the independently owned stores on a sort of daily sales basis.", "Paul Donahue", "No. I think the actual - our store sales in our company-owned stores and our independent owners were actually right on cue with one another. On the same-store sales were both down about 2%, and then you add back in the strength of acquisitions, gets us to your down 1.", "Seth Basham", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, if you think about the dynamic between ticket and traffic, particularly on the DIFM side of the business, it\u2019s the second quarter in a row that we\u2019re seeing a decline in ticket on the DIFM side. Is that simply due to deflation? Or is there something else going on from a mix standpoint that\u2019s driving that?", "Paul Donahue", "No. I think that - I mean it could be a bit, Seth, but we\u2019re not seeing anything dramatic. Look, we\u2019re in constant touch with our key customers, whether they be the Major Accounts of which we have a real focus on our top five Major Accounts. We\u2019re very close to our - obviously to our NAPA AutoCare centers. Their business is soft, and I think our business is trending with theirs, and the bay counts, as we do our survey throughout the marketplace, bay counts are down a bit on both sides, Major Accounts and AutoCare. So it\u2019s just kind of a soft environment out there right now.", "Seth Basham", "Okay. Now last question for me is just on gross margins. If you could tease out the drivers of benefit a little bit more, which were the biggest drivers of improvement between supplier incentives and the product mix shifts and the acquisitions that would be helpful. We\u2019re just trying to understand the sustainability of that improvement.", "Paul Donahue", "Yes, okay. I\u2019ll let Carol take that.", "Carol Yancey", "Yes. I would point you more, if you think about where we are through the nine months, so we\u2019re up 17 basis points through the nine months. And that\u2019s probably a more normalized where we would expect to be. But in the quarter, what we had is a combination of the factors mentioned.", "So there was some - definitely, the customer and product mix would be probably a part of it and that\u2019s coming from areas, if you think about what Paul mentioned on the product side and Automotive on the product side, some of the application parts and you\u2019ve got higher margins there, even when you move over to the Office side and the categories you talked about, you have a definite product mix shift there that was positive.", "And then on the acquisitions, we mentioned that they come with a higher gross margin but they also have higher SG&A and then the increased rebates. I think if you look at the quarter, you would probably say that they\u2019re pretty evenly safe of how they contributed, but I would also point you to more than nine months number to say that, that\u2019s you know hopefully, where we can continue to hold.", "Seth Basham", "Very good. Thanks a lot and good luck.", "Carol Yancey", "Thank you.", "Paul Donahue", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now go to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Good morning, guys.", "Paul Donahue", "Hey, good morning, Scot.", "Carol Yancey", "Good morning.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Hi, just one more sales cadence question and I\u2019m sure the horse is grow at this point, but in the U.S., same-store sales, was September positive?", "Carol Yancey", "Yes, it was.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Gotcha. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And another housekeeping item. How big were the real estate gain that you booked in the quarter?", "Carol Yancey", "So the fluctuation between the corporate experience - or the other expense, half of the increases related to the real estate gains on several pieces of property and half was related to the retirement plan valuation adjustment.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Got it, so 50/50. Okay, and then the third question, I guess this is really an opinion at this point, but Paul, you\u2019ve been involved with the NAPA for many years at this point, would you expect better performance from NAPA just given how warm this year\u2019s summer weather was?", "Paul Donahue", "As I said in my prepared comments, Scot, we\u2019re not pleased with where we find ourselves. If there was anything that was a bit of a surprise for me personally this quarter was our core business and you could almost go to all of our business. But certainly, Automotive and Office, the softness that we saw in our core business certainly is concerning and we always expect more out of our teams. So yes, I think that\u2019s a safe comment. We did expect better.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "So do you think there\u2019s any kind of share shift occurring?", "Paul Donahue", "I expected that question, Scot, and I have to tell you that again, as we talk to our key customers, as I was mentioned in an earlier question, we see what their business and how their business is trending, whether it would be with a big national account or with our almost 17,000 AutoCares, and the business climate and the bay count is soft. If we were looking out and seeing a robust business environment with those key customers and key AutoCare centers, I would be more concerned than I am.", "I do believe what we\u2019re seeing right now in Automotive is transitory. I think we saw it a bit when we came out of 2012 in similar weather patterns. So our expectation, Scot, is that when we get back to - if we get back to a normal winter weather patterns that we will see the rebound in our Automotive business. But no, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re losing share.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Got it. All right. Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it.", "Paul Donahue", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll now go to Bret Jordan with Jefferies.", "Bret Jordan", "Hi, good morning, guys.", "Paul Donahue", "Hi, good morning, Bret.", "Carol Yancey", "Good morning, Bret.", "Bret Jordan", "Hi, can we talk a little bit more about the U.S. trends in the quarter? Really sort of regional dispersion and maybe how we started that out the quarter I guess northern performance versus South and West. And I think you commented that the North was still the weakest, but did the back half close as the quarter progressed?", "Paul Donahue", "It did close, Bret, but I would tell you the trend that we saw in Q3 was much the same as we saw in Q2, which is those big northern divisions which, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, is a large portion of our overall business, so the Northeast, the Central, and I compare those two divisions that are performing well and I have to separate out the West.", "The West for us is an outlier and it\u2019s an outlier in a good way. Our Western Division business is performing quite well and outperforming all of our other divisions. But if I take the Florida, Southern Atlantic, there\u2019s still - we\u2019re still seeing that 400 basis point to 500 basis point gap between the guys up north and the guys in the warmer climates and - but we did see that begin to close a bit in September, which is encouraging.", "Bret Jordan", "Okay, great. And then one question on the DIY comp. I think you said it was down mid single-digits, and you said you were sort of examining some - the emerging online competition. Obviously, it\u2019s pretty early for Amazon to be having any real impact given their recent entry in the space. But are you analyzing anything like conversion rates? Or is there any feeling that there\u2019s a competitive shift going on in the DIY market that\u2019s explaining mid single-digit decline?", "Paul Donahue", "Again, Bret, we\u2019re looking at everything, as we always do, in our business, whether it\u2019d be ticket counts and basket size, and we are not pleased with where we find our core retail business. I would tell you that I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re losing share to the online players. That is - I mean clearly, they\u2019re growing their business, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s at the expense of our retail business.", "But I would mention that where we\u2019re encouraged is where we see growth with our impact stores, the stores that we have relayed and retrofitted to the new look. We\u2019ll have a 150 of those by year-end. We\u2019re seeing double-digit growth there. So it tells me that the retail business is there to be had.", "We\u2019ve got another 300 stores queued up for 2017 to go to that new look. So we\u2019ll have, hopefully, north of 450 stores in the new format of our - which would be almost half of our company-owned stores by the end of 2017. And our plan then would be we will be able to move the overall needle.", "Right now with just 150 stores with the new format, it\u2019s tough for us to move the overall retail needle. And I would also mention, Bret, I think that - look, I think the consumer is under a little bit of stress which could be impacting retail across the board.", "Bret Jordan", "Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.", "Paul Donahue", "You are welcome Bret.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.", "Chris Bottiglieri", "Thanks for taking my question. Quick follow-up. Why was California so good? Is that your retail initiative? Or is there something else driving that?", "Paul Donahue", "Our California business I should\u2026", "Chris Bottiglieri", "West Coast.", "Paul Donahue", "Yes. West Coast, it\u2019s really West Coast. Obviously California is a big, big part of our West Coast business. We\u2019ve been aggressive. Our team has been aggressive out there in conversions, bringing some competitive stores over to the NAPA banner. We\u2019ve done a few bolt-on - small bolt-on acquisitions, but our core business is healthier out there as well, which goes back to - and kind of reinforces the comments that you have to be led to believe that the impact that we\u2019re seeing on the Automotive business is being largely driven by weather patterns because in those warm climates, certainly out west is reflective - the business is okay.", "Chris Bottiglieri", "Okay. And then unrelated follow-up. Let me get a sense for as much as you can give us, you kind of answered this on gross margins, what is the inverse of that on the SG&A rate. Can you maybe bifurcate a little bit, tell us how much is kind of integration, one-time costs, that you kind of lap, what are some of the other drivers? I imagine its mix shifting again? And then if you could give us any direction overall, like how much of your - by segment, what your fixed cost structure looks like, trying to get a sense of incremental margins as your sales kind of fluctuates?", "Carol Yancey", "Yes, so I would tell you, the gross margin improvement that we had were across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses. And then at the same time, the SG&A deterioration was in all four of our segments. And when you look at the core sales, the majority of what you\u2019re seeing there is related to the core sales. And where we modeled, where we thought we would be second half of the year, we weren\u2019t quite there. We thought we would be. So we\u2019ve got just - it takes us longer to get those cost out and we\u2019re really adjusting to a lower level of core sales growth.", "And then I think the other big part of this is the acquisitions that certainly - I mean we\u2019ve made 16 or so acquisitions this year, and all those acquisitions come in, many of them come in with a different cost structure, but certainly accretive on the margin side, but they\u2019re coming in with higher SG&A. And in some, you have some incremental costs when you first have these acquisitions, and it takes up a couple of quarters to get those costs out.", "So I think all-in-all, the weak sales factor is the biggest thing that\u2019s impacting the SG&A, but I can tell you, our teams are working very, very hard right now to address all of our costs and we\u2019ve done a lot of work on our headcount. We\u2019ve done a lot of work on our facilities. And then you will see the improvements we\u2019ve done, it just hasn\u2019t been enough to offset the decline in the core sales.", "Chris Bottiglieri", "Okay. Then I promise one small last one, I hope it\u2019s a small one. The other revenue count seemed to kind of get a little worse this quarter. What\u2019s driving that? Looks like the implication I think to the story.", "Carol Yancey", "Yes. So the other revenue line, that is where we have the impact of our additional sales discounts and incentives. And so when we have the acquisitions that have flowed into the segment sales, with those acquisitions come their additional sales, customer discounts, and so a lot of that increase is related to the acquisitions coming in. So it\u2019s really the growth number is up above in the segments and that\u2019s the net adjustment. Yes, we\u2019ll have a more normalized. If you use the Q3 number, that\u2019s probably going to be our more normal go-forward amount.", "Chris Bottiglieri", "Okay. Great. Thanks again for all the questions.", "Carol Yancey", "Thank you.", "Paul Donahue", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.", "Greg Melich", "Hi, thanks. I had a couple of questions. Paul, I\u2019d like to start on some of the breakdowns of what\u2019s been strong or weak. I think you mentioned that fleet in Major Accounts were negative. Were they more negative than the Company? And just remind us what percentage of your sales are in that bucket.", "Paul Donahue", "Well, yes. Thanks, Greg. Those were two challenged businesses for us this past quarter, both down low single-digits. Our Major Accounts business is approaching $2 billion in sales, so it\u2019s a significant part of our overall wholesale business. Our AutoCare center business, which was down slightly year-over-year and I mean very slightly, represents well over $1 billion as well. And fleet, a comment on the fleet. It was down more than the overall business. And again, not surprised, not a total surprise because we have a significant business in the heavy-duty class 6, 7, 8 truck business and we\u2019re seeing softness across that element of our business as well.", "Greg Melich", "Could you speak on that in particular because I think you mentioned ride control and heavy-duty. Are there any shared shifts going on there that could explain that? Or do you think this is just overall demand and I have another question.", "Paul Donahue", "No. I honestly don\u2019t think so. We just spent a day with our heavy-duty team earlier this week, Greg, and we did an acquisition in that space earlier this year. So we\u2019re getting more and more broader in our scope and in our footprint, in our heavy-duty business. And honestly, we think that business is under pressure across the entire heavy-duty industry.", "Greg Melich", "Okay, great. And Carol, I think in your prepared comments, I heard in SG&A there was a real estate sale and a pension valuation adjustment. Could you quantify those?", "Carol Yancey", "Yes, I did earlier. That\u2019s in the other line of corporate expense line. So the delta between last year Q3 and this year Q3, the delta is half related to real estate gains and half related to the pension retirement valuation adjustment, and that is not in the segment margin. That\u2019s in other.", "Greg Melich", "Got it. And the real estate is any of that - is that all just one-off? Or is there any of that, that might occur on, say the pension side if it\u2019s an accrual?", "Carol Yancey", "It\u2019s largely one-off. I mean we have transactions all the time, but there are some more significant ones this quarter, so that\u2019s largely one-off. Therefore, when we gave our guidance for corporate expense for the full-year, you\u2019re going to be back to a more normal run rate.", "Greg Melich", "Got it. And then I guess this is sort of one last question whoever wants to take it. If you think about the change in your guidance for the year, what was the main driver of that? Was it just the business being weaker than expected in the third quarter or what you\u2019re expecting for the fourth quarter?", "Carol Yancey", "Yes. So Greg, it\u2019s a combination of what you said, but the Q3, the weaker sales is the primary driver, which we had that in Q3 and we\u2019re expecting that in Q4, but we certainly factored in what occurred in Q3, but the primary driver is the weak sales, but we took into account the incremental one-time things that we had in Q3 as well.", "Greg Melich", "So you factored in also something lower in the fourth quarter, obviously, but the bulk of it is in the third quarter miss basically.", "Carol Yancey", "Correct.", "Greg Melich", "Got it. Okay. Thanks good luck.", "Paul Donahue", "Thanks Greg.", "Carol Yancey", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll now go to Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Fassler", "Thanks a lot and good afternoon.", "Paul Donahue", "Hi, good afternoon, Matt.", "Matthew Fassler", "Hi, how are you? I want to slice and dice the Automotive discussion, I guess, one other way. We\u2019ve talked about competition, we\u2019ve talked about weather, we\u2019ve talked about regions. If we think about the Northeast and that part of the country that we thought about as being particularly weather-sensitive, it seems to have been challenged for almost everyone who plays in that part of the country for more than the past year. So for a longer period of time, do you think there\u2019s anything from a demand perspective transpiring in that part of the country that\u2019s impacting the aftermarket relative to the rest of the U.S?", "Paul Donahue", "From a demand perspective, Matt, certainly, it\u2019s interesting to listen to our peer groups and the other players in our industry. And if there is one consistent theme, it is that softness up in that part of the country. I would also - in addition to potentially softer overall demand, I would tell you that in terms of the competitive nature of that part of the country, it\u2019s as tough as any market that we compete in. There\u2019s a lot of players. There\u2019s a lot of strong players, a lot of strong regional players. It\u2019s a competitive market and again we don\u2019t believe we\u2019re losing market share, but it is a challenging market no doubt.", "Matthew Fassler", "If I can ask a second question. If you could recap your disclosure of the pieces of your same-store sales numbers, I want to make sure I heard some of the numbers right. Because I think you talked about a negative two decline overall for company-owned stores in the U.S. and I just want to make sure I understand the components of that to reconcile those to the total.", "Paul Donahue", "Well, Matt, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to want to get into all of that detail, but I would suffice to say that our overall same-store sales, as mentioned, was down two. We had a point that - a positive point through acquisitions which led to our overall U.S. business decline of 1%.", "Matthew Fassler", "I guess I was thinking about the comments you made on DIY and commercial. I think you said commercial down low singles and DIY down a bit more. And I was trying to solve that with a minus two that you discussed. And those might not be apples-to-apples numbers. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get my arms around.", "Paul Donahue", "No, the - and obviously, you know our DIFM business is our bread and butter, and our DIFM business is really what drives our overall same-store sales number. Retail is still an overall smaller percentage, but our DIFM business was down in that very low single-digit number.", "Matthew Fassler", "Got it. And then one final question, very brief one, Carol, you spoke about the international mix of business and the impact on the of tax rate. It sounds like that was only one part of what drove the tax rate lower this quarter. But as we think out to subsequent years given the deals that you\u2019ve done outside the U.S., should that tax rate now be below 37% on a secular basis? Do you see that in your future?", "Carol Yancey", "We probably - to your point, we probably are more in a steady state of probably assuming that there is nothing beyond this point and no tax law changes, we probably are in a 36% to 36.5% rate and that would just assume the same mix that we have today, but it would be dependent on future acquisitions or any tax law changes, but I think you\u2019re right.", "Matthew Fassler", "Great. Thank you so much guys.", "Paul Donahue", "Thanks, Matt.", "Carol Yancey", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go now to Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli.", "Brian Sponheimer", "Good afternoon.", "Paul Donahue", "Hey, good afternoon, Brian.", "Brian Sponheimer", "Just one question and may lead to a follow-up about the balance sheet. You had almost a $200 million increase in inventories on a year-over-year basis and $80 million quarter-to-quarter. Some of that\u2019s obviously coming from your acquisitions, but is any - just a lag from a sluggish sales environment? And how do you see that trending throughout the balance of the year?", "Carol Yancey", "Yes. Actually our inventories are flat when you take out the acquisitions and currency. So we don\u2019t think - I mean the acquisition was a pretty significant number in inventory, so we don\u2019t think there is anything there. But having said that, and certainly if you say we\u2019re pleased with flat, but we also know we have further opportunities with some of this facility rationalizations and some of our productivity improvements to further tighten down the inventory. So that maybe a further source of working capital for us going forward.", "Brian Sponheimer", "Okay. So if I\u2019m just thinking about this, if your total sales were flat and acquisitions contributed 350 basis points there, in an ideal world, your flat year-over-year for inventory, is that 3% number a potential working capital source target as we kind of move forward? Or are these inventory initiatives going to require at least some safety stock as you\u2019d handle them?", "Carol Yancey", "I don\u2019t think they will. And I think, like I said, there\u2019s a lot of initiatives going across all of our businesses, but I don\u2019t think we really have that going forward.", "Brian Sponheimer", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Paul Donahue", "Thanks, Brian.", "Carol Yancey", "Thanks, Brian.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our last question from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Elizabeth Suzuki", "Hey, guys.", "Paul Donahue", "Hey, Elizabeth.", "Elizabeth Suzuki", "Hi. I just wanted to start with one question about acquisition opportunities, and you mentioned that you\u2019re open to some larger acquisitions in that typical $25 million to $150 million annualized revenue target. How many such larger businesses are there out there that might actually make sense to incorporate into your business? In other words, how fragmented is this industry?", "Paul Donahue", "Well, if you think about our global footprint now, Elizabeth, and you think about four different industries that we conduct business in, there are multiple acquisition opportunities. So when you take into account Asia Pacific, you take into account Canada, Mexico, U.S., and then our Office business, our Industrial business, our Automotive, we look at - as well as Electrical, we look at all of our businesses. And we\u2019ve actually now - we\u2019ve completed 16, 17 acquisitions already this year, and they\u2019ve impacted all four businesses and have been in most every geographical region that we conduct business in. So there is no shortage of opportunities out there.", "Elizabeth Suzuki", "Great, that\u2019s really helpful. And sort of on the reverse side, have you entertained at all the idea of divesting any of the four business segments? Or do you view them all as core and yielding synergies for the total business?", "Paul Donahue", "Yes. So we get asked that question often, Elizabeth. As of today, we\u2019re quite pleased to be in the four businesses that we\u2019re in. We\u2019ve got strategies in the works in all four. We do believe the four; you mentioned the synergies that they bring to Genuine Parts Company. So as of today, we are committed to all four. That\u2019s not to say at any point in time in the future, if we get to a point where we don\u2019t believe either we\u2019re the best owner of the business or that we can grow a business, we would consider divesting that business. We\u2019ve done it in the past. But at this point, we have no plans to do that.", "Elizabeth Suzuki", "All right. Thanks very much.", "Paul Donahue", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks.", "Carol Yancey", "We\u2019d like to thank you for your support and your interest in Genuine Parts Company. Thank you for your participation today, and we look forward to reporting back out with our year-end earnings in February. Thank you.", "Operator"], "Symbol": "Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:", "Period": "Q32016", "Month": "10", "Year": "2016", "Date": "2016-10-19", "Target": 1}
