Your lines have been placed on listen only until the question-and-answer session of today's conference.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tony Huegel, Director of Investor Relations.

Thank you, Susan.", "Susan Karlix - Manager, Investor Communications", "Thank you, Tony.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Now, Josh.", "Joshua Jepsen - Manager, Investor Communications", "Thank you, Tony. With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2016 on a profitable note. Our results, however, were lower than last year reflecting the continuing impact of the downturn in the global farm economy and weakness in construction equipment markets. All of Deere's businesses remained solidly profitable for the quarter. This shows our continuing progress, managing costs and creating a more flexible responsive cost structure. We also lowered our annual guidance for both sales and earnings, with most of the change due to foreign currency and weaker markets in construction equipment.", "Now, let's take a closer look at our first quarter results in detail, beginning on slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 13% to $5.525 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $254 million. EPS was $0.80 in the quarter.", "On slide four, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 15% to $4.8 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by two points. Currency translation was negative by four points. In comparison with our previous net sales guidance of down about 11%, the difference is largely attributable to lower sales volumes for Agriculture & Turf equipment.", "Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on slide five. Net sales were down 12% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. The decrease was mostly due to lower shipment volumes of large Ag equipment in the United States and Brazil. Partially offsetting these declines were higher sales in Europe. Foreign currency exchange had a negative impact on sales as well, largely driven by the euro and Brazilian real.", "Operating profit was $144 million, down from $268 million last year. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, unfavorable foreign currency exchange, and a less favorable product mix. These factors were partially offset by price realization, lower selling, administrative and general expenses, and lower production costs. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was about 26%.", "Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the Ag business. Slide six outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvests of the last three years and the resulting lower commodity prices, our estimate for 2015 cash receipts is now down about 10% from 2014's peak levels. Our 2016 forecast contemplates total cash receipts to be about $381 billion, down slightly from 2015.", "On slide seven, grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels on a global basis, even after the abundant harvest of the past three years. Global grain and oilseed demand remain strong, while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could result in prices quickly moving higher.", "Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on slide eight. Economic growth is improving at a moderate pace. Farm income remains below the long-term average, and weakness persists in the dairy sector. As a result, we're expecting lower industry farm machinery demand in the EU region.", "On slide nine, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for China and India. Because of the economic slowdown in China, we continue to anticipate lower industry sales. While the government support of mechanization is helping the sector, changes in government subsidies are causing uncertainty.", "Turning to India, the government continues providing assistance to the Ag sector with programs such as minimum support prices for commodities. Although the region has experienced two consecutive below-normal monsoon seasons, our forecast calls for a modest rebound in industry sales in 2016.", "Shifting to Brazil, slide 10 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness there. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2016 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. The situation, however, is more positive in local currency due to the devaluation of the real. Brazilian farmer profitability remains at good levels as crops are sold in dollars.", "Although Ag fundamentals remain positive, farmer confidence is low due to economic and political concerns, growing inflation, and uncertainty over government-sponsored financing programs, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. In spite of these short-term concerns, the long-term fundamentals for our Ag business in Brazil remain strong.", "Our 2016 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide 11. You will note there are no changes from the guidance provided last quarter. Low commodity prices and stagnant farm incomes in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, with the decline being most pronounced in the sale of high-horsepower models. Our forecast for industry sales in the U.S. and Canada remains down 15% to 20%, with large Ag equipment sales down 25% to 30%.", "The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5% in 2016 due to low crop prices and farm incomes as well as continued pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be down 10% to 15% in 2016. Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be flat to down slightly, due in part to weakness in China.", "Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, benefiting from new products and general economic growth.", "Putting this all together on slide 12, fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 10%. This includes about four points of negative currency translation. The deterioration in our forecast is driven almost entirely by foreign currency exchange. Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016, unchanged from the previous forecast. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 23%.", "Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry. Net sales were down 23% in the quarter as a result of lower shipment volumes and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by price realization. Operating profit was $70 million in the quarter, down from $146 million last year. The decrease was driven by lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. The division's decremental margin was about 21%.", "Moving to slide 14, looking at the economic indicators at the bottom part of the slide, GDP growth is positive, construction spending is up from 2015 levels, and housing starts are expected to exceed 1.2 million units this year. In spite of these encouraging signs, the industry is operating at a slow pace. Contributing factors are weak conditions in the North American energy sector and the movement of equipment from energy producing regions to other parts of the country.", "Rental utilization rates continue to decline, economic growth outside the United States is sluggish and the mix of housing starts in the U.S. is skewed to multifamily homes reducing demand for earthmoving equipment. As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 11% in 2016.", "The change from our previous forecast is largely driven by lower sales in the United States and Canada and a negative foreign exchange effect of about one point. The forecast for global forestry markets remains down 5% to 10% from the strong levels we've experienced in recent years, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 7%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 27%.", "Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 15 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. At the end of January, it was eight basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 19 basis points. Even so, this would put the year's losses below the 10-year average of 26 basis points, and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.", "Moving to slide 16, Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $129 million in the first quarter versus $157 million last year. The lower results were primarily due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange translation, higher losses on residual values, primarily for construction equipment operating leases, less favorable financing spreads, and a higher provision for credit losses. These were partially offset by lower selling, administrative, and general expenses.", "2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $525 million which is down from last year. The outlook reflects less favorable financing spreads, an increased provision for credit losses and the negative effects of currency exchange translation.", "Remember that 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of the crop insurance business of about $30 million. Before we move on to receivables and inventory, let's discuss the losses on residual values noted in the earnings release that affected the quarter's results. A majority of the losses were due to impairment charges for construction equipment. The losses were mainly related to short-term leases of production class equipment. We continue to closely monitor the leasing portfolio, adjust residual values on the existing portfolio as needed, and take appropriate actions on new contracts to ensure we are mitigating future risk.", "Slide 17 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $205 million. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables and inventory down about $550 million with reductions from both divisions.", "2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on slide 18 is about 79%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind. Unfavorable product mix, Tier 4 product costs, and overhead spend. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about two points, favorable raw material costs, lower pension and OPEB expense, and lower incentive compensation expense.", "Now, let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on slide 19, R&D was down 4% in the first quarter including about two points of negative currency translation. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3% with about one point of negative currency translation.", "Moving now to slide 20, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 11% in the first quarter with currency translation, incentive compensation, and pension and OPEB accounting for about eight points of the change. Our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 4%. The same factors just cited for the quarter also account for about six points from the full year change.", "Turning to slide 21, pension and OPEB expense was down $44 million for the quarter and is forecasted to be down about $200 million for the full year, unchanged from the previous forecast.", "On slide 22, the equipment operations tax rate was 20% in the quarter, primarily due to discrete items. While it's not our practice to provide specifics on discrete items, I would point out the R&D tax credit was extended for 2015 during the quarter. For 2016, the full year effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 33% to 35%.", "Slide 23 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $2.1 billion in 2016. The reduction from our previous guidance is largely attributable to the forecasted change in working capital and lower net income.", "The company's second quarter financial outlook is on slide 24. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 8% compared with 2015. This includes about two points of price realization and unfavorable currency translation of about three points.", "Turning to slide 25 and the full year outlook, our forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 10%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about two points. Currency translation is negative by about three points. Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is now about $1.3 billion.", "In closing, although Deere expects another challenging year in 2016, our forecast represents a level of performance that is much better than we have experienced in previous downturns. This illustrates the continuing impact of our efforts to establish a more durable business model and a wider range of revenue sources. At the same time, Deere's financial condition remains strong, and the company is continuing to forecast a healthy level of cash flow this year. As a result, we're well-positioned to continue looking to the future and making investments in innovative products, advanced technology and new markets. These actions, we're confident, will deliver significant value to our customers and investors in the years ahead.", "I'll now turn the call over to Tony.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Josh. Now, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure, but in consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, again, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue.", "Carlos?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Thank you. Our first question will be coming from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse Securities. Your line is open.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi, good morning. Congratulations, Susan. We will miss you. So in terms of my questions, I guess, Tony, last quarter you talked about production in large Ag and you talked about as we think about the back half of the year that production should be more in line with retail demand. Can you talk about if there's any change there? And then also any progress you made on the used inventory issue within large Ag. Thanks.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Yeah. So as you think about inventory and some may have noticed kind of along that line with the receivables and inventory forecast that it is \u2013 it did change and the reduction is actually a little lower from what we had in the original budget. And I would point out first of all that's really more related to changes in small Ag. So if you look at large Ag, the forecasted change in dealer receivables is really very, very similar, very much in line with what we had in the original budget. Used equipment, we continue to make progress. It's still \u2013 as we talked about previously, there's still a lot of work there, especially on large tractors.", "I think last time we talked about down 18% roughly from the highs that were set in 2014. Today, we would put large Ag used at about 23% lower. So again, continuing to make some good progress there. Maybe as importantly, as we bring that down, used pricing on our large Ag equipment is remaining steady. So again, continuing to make progress, but those efforts will certainly continue through 2016.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay, thank you. I'll get back in queue.", "Joshua Jepsen - Manager, Investor Communications", "Thank you.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everybody. Congratulations, Susan. My question is on the cost structure here, Tony. And I'm trying to figure out \u2013 I know you have some flexibility. You've shown some really good control on these decremental margins, and I know your most recent contracts have given you some increased down days and weeks and so forth. And I guess I'm just trying to figure out where we are in that process, and if things get weaker, do you still have additional levers you can pull? Or are we getting to the end there?", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Certainly. To your point, from a production perspective, we do have some additional \u2013 we went from \u2013 in our UAW factories previously we had 10 weeks per year, and that has gone to 16 weeks with the new contract this year. That does provide some additional flexibility, and we would have additional flexibility. We've also talked in our forecasts for R&D, while down a bit, is not a lever we pull significantly hard at this point.", "And again, that is trying to take a long-term view. So depending on if our perspective changes in terms of the length of this downturn that would be certainly an area we would continue to be able to pull levers. I would note, from original budget, our SA&G forecast has come down further in terms of what we're forecasting. That's an area we continue to look at and attempt to identify costs that can come out and as those are identified, we'll add those into the forecast. So again, I don't want to imply however that we have the same type of leverage that we would've had coming off of the peak. Obviously, we're already at very low levels. So our ability to pull costs out relative to any further sales declines will be more challenging.", "We've been pretty open about that. This year fortunately with incrementals or decrementals as the case may be, we've gotten some benefit from the pension and OPEB change and some other factors, lower material costs and those sorts of things and so \u2013 but still I think it's demonstrating that we are very focused on cost management and doing an effective job to date. So...", "Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC", "So, someday there will be incrementals again?", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Absolutely. And I'll look forward to that.", "Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "All right. Next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Timothy Thein from Citigroup Global Markets. Your line is open.", "Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you. Just, Tony, the question relates to your degree of confidence on that one and a half to two points of positive pricing that you're expecting for this year and I'm sure you're going to have a lot more visibility on that in the next month or two. But just maybe update us there in terms of any changes, especially interested in C&F. Obviously, you're a lot lower contributor to the overall pie. But just in light of this current and revised forecast, maybe just update us of your thoughts on pricing overall. Thank you.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Sure. I think the important thing maybe to note is as you look at that two points of price realization, both divisions continue to contribute positively to that two points of price realization, and so that has not changed. Certainly, the price environment is very challenging, especially for construction. We have a large competitor who has been pretty open about some negative pricing for their business. And so far, our business has been able to hold the line and keep pricing on a positive slant. That is a challenge, however, but one we remain focused on as we go forward. All right, next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Robert Wertheimer from Barclays Capital. Your line is open, sir.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Congratulations, Susan. We'll miss you, just a quick question on your priorities on use of cash flow. Your down cycle progresses a little bit. There's a little bit less cash flow to be had. Would you see cutting back on share repurchases as the first thing? Would you do anything less with the leasing? What are you thinking on just as you get to the normal, more cyclical lower levels of cash flow?", "Rajesh Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "This is Raj. Now, I want to first say our cash flow from operations is still pretty strong, over $2 billion. And we've talked about our cash use priorities several times in the past. They remain the same. So our highest priority is our single-A rating. We are maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, and maintaining access to attractive funding sources is even more important during a downturn like right now. So next priority is organic and inorganic investments that will benefit the company in the long term. And we are, as Tony mentioned, continuing to invest in R&D, especially with a focus on innovation. And we take a long-term view with respect to inorganic options, and we have discussions over multiple years sometimes with inorganic options that are aligned with our strategy. So we recently announced two acquisitions. One was Monosem, based in France. The other was Precision Planting, based in the U.S. And we will use about $325 million of cash for just those two.", "The next priority is dividends. And our goal is to keep dividends at about 25% to 35% of mid-cycle earnings, and we will maintain our dividends even through difficult downturns. And finally, share repurchases are a residual use of cash and deployed only if the distance from intrinsic value is significant, so it's beneficial to our longer-term shareholders. While the distance from intrinsic value makes repurchases attractive now, our higher priorities will obviously take precedence.", "So the other point I'll make is you may recall that quarter one is typically a significant user of cash on the operations side. So if you put all those together, I think that's a summary of what our thought is on the cash.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Next caller? Thanks, Rob.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is open.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody, and all the best, Susan. I'm trying to reconcile the unchanged U.S. and Canada Ag & Turf outlook and the modifications you made to the commodity outlook in the appendix. In the appendix, you decreased the farm cash receipts projection for 2015 and 2016 mostly due to livestock but also in the crop area. And then the net cash income projection for 2015 and 2016 dropped about 8% and 16% respectively. But despite all of that, you maintain U.S. and Canada end market view. I'm just wondering if you could help us understand why the reduced farm financial outlook really did not impact the end market view.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Sure. At this point, while certainly the statistical modeling that we have in place and looking at farm cash receipts and so on still play somewhat of a role in our forecasting, at this point in the process, the actual orders would tend to take a stronger \u2013 make a stronger impact on the forecast. And as we're seeing those orders come in, we're still very much in line with what we had had for our previous forecast. So we are seeing sales down certainly for North American Ag with a greater impact on the large Ag business, but I would say our order books are very much in line with that outlook.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Hi, Ann.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Just a quick clarification first before my question. Monosem and Precision Planting, are they now included in your revenue guidance, and how much do they impact your revenue guidance?", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "We closed on Monosem in the quarter, so they certainly would be, and we would anticipate some in the forecast for Precision Planting as well.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And how much are they adding to your outlook?", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Okay. This is going to have to be your question, Ann, so...", "Rajesh Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So all I'll say, Ann, is both of them together will be slightly accretive for us and very small in terms of their revenue, so it's not really \u2013 I think let's leave it at that.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Okay. Ann, I'm sorry. You'll have to get in back into the queue for your next question. Next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hi, good morning.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "On Financial Services, the revenue \u2013 or sorry, the net income in the quarter was roughly in line with what you were guiding for the full year if you just spread it equally. But could you talk about the cadence that you're looking at whether or not over the course of the year you anticipate some reduction in the receivables book, and how we should think about any oscillations throughout the course of the year?", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "I think as you think through the back half or through the remainder of the year, one thing I would point out is if you look at our forecast for the provision versus the year-to-date annualized number, it would anticipate some increase there in terms of cost. Certainly, at these lower levels of sales while the average portfolio doesn't change dramatically as you move through the year just like we saw last year you would start to see some impact from that as well. So certainly you see some \u2013 a little bit lower receivables as we go through the year. So I'd say those are probably the two biggest differences from first quarter in terms of headwind for Financial Services as you go through the rest of the year.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Yes, next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "Good morning, everyone, and congratulations, Susan.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Hi, Eli.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "Let me just ask a question on the decrementals and production schedules. It's sort of interesting, I think you said the decremental in farm was 26% and the year is 23% and it's a reverse case, 21% in construction and 27% through the year. Can you talk about how you change your production schedules leading to farm getting better and construction getting worse, it sounds like you cut production a lot more in the second half of the year in construction and sort of maintained a balance in farm?", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Certainly as you look at the forecast, I'll start with construction, when you look at the forecast change for construction, most of that change is really as you look out toward the back part of the year. So as we talked about last quarter, there was some optimism, if you will, towards the back half of the year that we'd start to see, not an incredible amount, but some increase in sales as we went through the year. Most of that optimism candidly has been removed from the forecast, and so what we are forecasting today for construction is we think normal seasonality. So you will see some improved sales as you go through the year, but really nothing beyond again a typical seasonality.", "So with Ag & Turf again, you get some better clarity as you go through the year. We talked about some higher level of impact of FX as well, that certainly \u2013 FX tends to from a decremental perspective provide a little bit of benefit and boost of decremental. So that would also be contributing to some of the change in our forecast, the decrementals on Ag. Those would probably be the highlights I would point out.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. We had in our meeting with Sam Allen. He basically made a statement that you did little cuts in construction equipment and should have done it bigger. Was there any reason why you just wouldn't take construction down faster in the markets other than...", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "That is a good point. I think I would argue that's what we are doing. Again, as I point out, there is little optimism in this forecast for construction beyond the typical seasonal improvement in sales here and there as you go through the year. So it is not anticipating an overall increase in \u2013 or boost in industry demand from these current levels. And so I think that is effectively what we've attempted to do is look at it from that perspective.", "Rajesh Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Eli, this is Raj. To your point, we have not only taken down the market for industry projections for CE, we've also taken down our schedules and our forecast further just to go \u2013 illustrate the points you made that Sam had earlier discussed with all of you.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Okay, thank you. Next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Henry Kirn from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open.", "Henry George Kirn - SG Americas Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone, and I'll echo the congratulations to Susan. In addition to the acquisition that you just made, are there more potential spots where it would be cheaper to buy than build? And under what circumstances would you be willing to meaningfully step up the M&A focus? Thanks.", "Rajesh Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "This is Raj, Henry. Of course, we are not going to talk about any specific M&A and so on. But I will just tell you a little bit about our approach to M&A. It is more strategic than opportunistic. And we take a long-term perspective with M&A. What I mean is we identify M&A candidates that align with and strengthen our strategy really, and we have discussions with them in some cases multiple years before they become actionable. Downturns like the current one we're in tend to sometimes provide a window of opportunity for some of these long-term discussions to materialize into acquisitions. Monosem and Precision Planting are examples of our approach to M&A. So I am going to leave it at that and not talk more.", "Henry George Kirn - SG Americas Securities LLC", "Okay, right.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. You kept the volume guidance for South America unchanged. Do you have more conviction around that figure now than you did back in November? Or is there still a bit of uncertainty? And maybe you could talk about the order book down there?", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Right. I think anytime we talk about the markets really outside of the U.S., for large Ag that South America in particular, the visibility is not as far out. So always remember that versus large Ag in the U.S. and Canada where we do have the best visibility from an order book perspective. So there's certainly, I would say, continued risk in South America and potential opportunity. I would say you have both, so risk \u2013 Brazil continues, while, the farmers in Brazil continue to operate at very profitable levels because of the fact that they do sell their commodities in U.S. dollars, so the FX is benefiting them but the overall government concerns remain.", "The FINAME financing there appears to have stabilized somewhat, Moderfrota is back in place and the funding appears to be in place for that as well. We've heard some positive comments from government officials regarding their commitment to that. But, again, there is always risk and remember their fiscal year end in June. And so what happens with the FINAME financing and other supports beyond June would continue to be a question as well. Now, on the flipside, you have Argentina where we would argue there is potential upside opportunity there if the reforms continue to progress and if those reforms are fully implemented such that we have the ability not just to import but also export and so on. We think that could be a really good opportunity for us.", "You may have heard when we were out traveling with Sam the fact that it is a very profitable market for us and so the opportunity to sell more products into Argentina would certainly be beneficial for us. So there are a lot of puts and takes as you think about South America but all in all, the industry outlook. Again, remember that's on tractors and combines, remained unchanged and so that's really not much change in our current view what that market may look like.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Okay, next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Steven Fisher from UBS Securities. Your line is open.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning and best wishes, Susan. How are you guys thinking about the trade-off of price versus market share in small and medium-size Ag equipment? Because from what we hear, it sounds like everyone is trying to pressure everyone else. So as you guys think about it, I mean, does it make sense to incentivize sales to hold on to you market share? Or do you just leave that to your dealers on the strength of your brand and not given on price?", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "I think I would say it's a similar strategy that what we've had kind of on an overall basis from a company perspective and that is that balanced approach. Pricing continues to be important to us. We continue to, in most cases, trade at a premium to our competition and certainly we would continue to be focused on price realization in small Ag. Now, where we've really increased our focus is on innovation in that area and we brought in some very attractive product. So in that case, quite often, it's not so much about discounting but making sure you have the right features on that product the customers are willing to pay for, and not having excessive amounts of features that they aren't willing to pay for, if you will. So that tends to be our focus. It's making sure we really understand that market that we're delivering the product that customer is looking for and that we can do that with positive pricing.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley Investment Research. Your line is open.", "Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks and congratulations to Susan. So there's been a few questions on Construction & Forestry already but something I just want a little bit more clarity on is, Sam has said at the breakfast in January that you guys are working through excess inventory levels in the channel. And I guess I'm just curious how much progress you made there during the quarter. And if you would now characterize Construction & Forestry industry levels as healthy or in line with end user demand?", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Certainly, as you look at the reported receivables and inventory, you'll note that they're slightly higher year-over-year, so I would say that's still an ongoing focus as we move through the year is to pull those inventory levels down. So if you look at ending inventories, it actually does year-over-year, we would \u2013 with our current forecast, we would finish both inventory and within our factories as well as dealer inventories at or below where \u2013 as a percent of sales where we were at the end of 2015. So still will be a focus. It is not \u2013 we are not finished in that progression, but definitely very focused on making sure that happens.", "Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Larry De Maria from William Blair & Company. Your line is open.", "Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning and best of luck to Susan. Can you just update us on where the pooled fund stands this year? I don't know if that's been worked down, or is there much left for dealer to use? And perhaps is that a reason why you're still getting that nice positive pricing and the steady residual values because the dealers are using those funds? So if you could just update us on that. Thank you.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Yeah. So pool funds, for those that may not be aware, those are funds that dealers effectively earn when they sell new equipment that they then can utilize for various incentives on used. And certainly, we would say overall, it's \u2013 and I'll tell you, really no change from last quarter. Overall, they're in good shape. Now there are some \u2013 we couldn't say that for every dealer. We have some dealers where we wouldn't be comfortable with the level of pool funds they have relative to the equipment that's on their lots. We are seeing dealers shifting the use of those more towards the retail sale portion. As you may be aware, they can use those funds both to provide low or no interest wholesale funding while that inventory is on their lot, or they can also use it towards various incentives.", "I think part of the reason why used pricing is staying high: A), that's historically how Deere equipment has responded in this type of environment; and B), some of those incentives aren't focused on simply reducing the purchase price. So we're looking at things like lower rate financing opportunities, providing additional warranty on the equipment, those sorts of things that provide incentives to the customer without degrading the purchase price, if you will. So again, we did see \u2013 and I want to be clear. When we came into the downturn, we did see some small decreases in used pricing, but they've held very firm at those small single-digit type of declines, at least to date. So we are pleased with that aspect.", "Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Hi, good morning. I'm just trying to figure out what you're trying to imply about incremental residual value losses in Ag. You highlight the construction higher residual values. But when we look at the comments you made about used, you feel in Ag is holding steady. You're obviously making some assumptions around future issues by raising the loss provision. Can you help us understand? What are you implying about your change from provisions and your used equipment comments on Ag when it comes to \u2013 from here going forward, what is the level of residual value risk within the Ag book?", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Right. First of all, you need to separate those two, because provision relates to the retail note portfolio.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "No, I understand. It's a commentary on the health of the end market, where used prices are versus...", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Right, right. but I just want to clarify that, because again, while used equipment prices have held firm from that initial decline, we did see some initial decline. And so when you look at losses on returned leases, keeping in mind the average \u2013 for new equipment, the average lease term is around three years, and used has actually moved to that. It used to be a little bit further out. So most of the lease returns that are coming back today would have been written three years ago, at least on average.", "So you're really still in the height of the market. So recoveries aren't as high as what they would have been historically. They're still very, very strong, but we're still seeing a little bit of a decline in the recovery rate on the Ag equipment coming in. But I wouldn't imply anything beyond that. Certainly from a provision increase, a lot of those increases come from things like a revolving credit portfolio, which is where you tend to see some responsiveness early on, not just the Ag portfolio. So those are the things that are really driving those higher level of provisions in the forecast.", "The other thing I'd be quick to point out is they're higher but they're higher off of historic, as you know, very low levels and let's just say that forecast is dead on and we hit 19 basis points this year. That's still a very attractive level for any portfolio to be maintaining in this type of an environment with the provision on credit losses. So again, we feel very good about the strength of the farmer and their ability to continue to pay for the equipment they have financed with us.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "I appreciate the answer, Tony, but it doesn't really answer the question. I'm trying to figure out if you feel used prices are now sequentially steady.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Yes.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "If they stay at these levels, let's just say this is it, they're this straightforward. What level of residual value risk or losses are baked into your guidance? Because obviously you highlight the construction side today, and I appreciate that. But the used comment sequentially about pricing was interesting. I'm just trying to help everybody gauge where are we. Clearly, there are as you pointed out not quite the recoveries of the past. Can you help us a bit in framing it?", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "I would tell you at this point, what's anticipated in the forecast for Ag is largely inconsequential. Yes, there are some losses in the forecast, but we're not talking about \u2013 especially when you put it relative to the size of that portfolio. You look at those portfolios, Ag or construction as we talk about is more than two-thirds of the impairment charges that we took in the quarter, and the size of the portfolio is significantly smaller. And so again, I think that's the key difference. And I wouldn't extrapolate any of what we're talking about from construction towards Ag. There are significant differences in those portfolios between Ag and construction on our leasing.", "So you think about things like the term of the leases. Most of the losses we're seeing and the impairment that we're taking for construction are around short-term leases. We have less than 5% of the Ag operating lease portfolio would be what we deem a short-term lease, 12 months or less, where you've got 22% of production-class equipment leases that would be in that view.", "We also lease a lot more used equipment in Ag, which again, in our view would reduce some of that risk. So about 42% of our Ag portfolio is used equipment versus about 14% of construction \u2013 I'm sorry, 3% of construction is used equipment.", "And probably the most important difference between those two, similar to what we would talk about from a retail note perspective with the dealer reserve, on our operating leases over half of the Ag operating leases in the U.S. and Canada have some level of dealer guarantee on residual values, which provides obviously protection around any losses on residual value. More importantly, it drives a very engaged dealer in the process when these leases come back \u2013 or when the equipment comes back off of lease. So again, very, very different portfolios and I wouldn't say we're trying to imply anything when we talk about higher provisions or the value of used equipment other than the fact that they're holding steady. And if that continues, our risk on operating leases in Ag are quite low. It's still a risk that we can maintain those used equipment prices but at this point, that is holding up well.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "That's great detail. Thank you very much.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Mike Shlisky from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.", "Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Good morning, guys. And again, Susan, best of luck. Wanted to ask quickly about Europe. I think you had mentioned that Ag sales were actually up in Europe in the quarter. Either way, I've seen data where you're seeing Deere gain some share in some key markets in Europe. Could you maybe just take us through are there any countries that are doing better for you and any that are doing worse, and any product categories that are doing better or worse? And perhaps is it possible for Deere itself to beat your overall market outlook for the year at all? Thanks.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "As you think about Europe, first, to the second part of that question. We certainly hope so. Any year that we enter, we would hope to gain some market share. We have a lot of new product that's entering the European market. We've been recognized from numerous tradeshows with that innovation, both Agritechnica as well as a number of shows since then that we've received a variety of awards for that innovation. So again, especially in some of those key products we would certainly hope to gain some share of it.", "If you think about in the short-term, with Europe, I would note that in the first part of the year that we are getting some benefit from France. They had what's been referred to as a super amortization program which does allow for some additional amortization of the equipment in the early stages of the ownership which is providing some benefit for sales there. And we did see that increase in sales in France. That program is scheduled to end in mid-April and it's based on retail. So those would be tractors that would need to be sold to customers by mid-April and so we are again seeing a bit of advantage from that.", "Outside of that, I think, as you think about Europe, there does overall continue to be some headwind there with \u2013 just like a lot of parts of the world with lower commodity prices. Dairy is a significant market for the European farmer and we continue to see pressure there. I think every quarter, we anticipate in the next six months for that to start to moderate and each quarter it keeps getting pushed out. But it seems to be holding on in a stubborn way in terms of the pressure on dairy right now for those farmers. But with that, I'm not sure I can add much more value beyond that. I appreciate the question.", "Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "That's great, Tony. Thank you.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Yeah. Next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs & Company. Your line is open.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning and, Susan, congratulations. Tony, I'm wondering if you could just update us on your warranty performance on Tier 4 products, either frequency of repair, cost of repair? And you took up your accruals last year, I think, as you typically do with new products and can you remind us from an accounting standpoint when can we expect accruals to normalize if the performance remains favorable? How long before you make that accounting change? Thanks.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "So with the warranty related questions? Yeah. Keep in mind, that's part of \u2013 that would fall into our pricing. And so to the extent you have higher returns and allowances that does affect our pricing, so you would see it there in terms of lower-priced realization, I think would be the answer. But generally, to your point, you will occasionally have some issues in a specific quarter where you had to book some accruals on specific products with new equipment. But generally, that's been a favorable trend and helped from a pricing perspective.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And sorry, Tony, the performance on Tier 4 final products, has that been favorable versus expectations and versus the accounting accruals so far?", "Rajesh Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hey, Jerry, this is Raj. If you look at every new product development program, so every wave effect typically has more issues that come up with it and then it subsides. So if you look at what we have seen in our transitions from Tier 3 and into IT 4 \u2013 into Tier 4, we are very comfortable with what we have seen in terms of the product warranties in R&A with this wave of new product development programs.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "And I did want to clarify my comment. The returns and allowances are in our net sales number. They are not in our pricing calculation. So I misspoke when I said that. So \u2013 but it does impact our net sales.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay, thank you.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Okay, thank you. Next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Emily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Emily McLaughlin on for Seth today.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Hello.", "Emily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Just wondering if you guys could provide a little more color on your lower organic C&F outlook? Just trying to figure out if it's end market demand deteriorating or right sizing of channel inventory.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Lower...", "Emily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And then what's your confidence in your ability to maintain the positive C&F pricing with the current demand environment?", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Sure. Yeah, I mean, basically as I mentioned earlier in the call, it's primarily the lower sales forecast for Construction & Forestry is around U.S. and Canada and so we lowered our end market outlook for sales in the U.S. and Canada. And again, a lot of that is just as oil prices have remained very low, the pressure that's putting on the overall market continues. And so much of the optimism we had of the markets improving as we go into the back half of the year were pretty much removed out of the forecast. So again, we continue to forecast positive price and that's our best estimate at this point and probably can't say much more beyond that. So we have time for one more caller.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question will be coming from the line of Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is open.", "Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, Tony, can you maybe just talk about the margin assumption changes for each segment for 2016, and also where your large Ag utilization rates are currently? Thank you.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "Again, when you think about large Ag utilization, we talked about last year it does vary by \u2013 or last quarter, it does vary by product. So certainly when you think about where we are as a percent of mid-cycle in those products, you'd be at 50% or less in some of those facilities. And so that's where we continue to operate. And I would say mostly as you think about changes in the margin outlook, obviously FX is impacting that and that's probably the biggest change from last quarter on the Ag part. So very \u2013 really very little from a volume perspective in terms of the changes from original budget. Certainly for the year, volumes would have an impact.", "Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations", "So with that, I think we will need to conclude the call.

All of Deere's businesses remained profitable for the quarter and earnings per share was slightly higher than last year.", "Operating profit for Ag and Turf division and for the equipment businesses overall was above last year's levels even though sales were down nearly $1 billion. Our results were helped by the sound execution of our operating plans, the impact of a broad product portfolio and our success keeping a tight rein on costs and assets.", "Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter in detail beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 11% to about $6.7 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $489 million. EPS was $1.55 in the quarter.", "On Slide 4, we see that worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 14% to just under $5.9 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by two points. Currency translation was negative by two points.", "Turning to our review of our individual businesses, let's start with agriculture and turf on Slide 5. Net sales for the division were down 11% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison with the decrease primarily due to lower shipment volumes in the United States and Canada. Also affecting sales was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange.", "Operating profit was $571 million. Ag and turf operating margins were 12.1% in the quarter. The gain on the sale of a partial interest in SiteOne landscape supply contributed nearly two points of operating margin in the quarter. Even excluding the SiteOne impact operating margins were above the levels of last year's third quarter.", "Before we review the industry sales outlook, we are pleased to welcome Deere's Chief Economist Dr. J. B. Penn. He will spend a few minutes sharing his thoughts on the state of the global Ag economy. J.B.?", "J. B. Penn", "Thanks Josh.", "I would begin with a bit of context that might be useful as we ponder the outlook. Slide 6 shows the strong tailwinds that now drive the global agricultural economy. Major changes in agriculture and food markets began occurring sometime around the turn of the century and that ushered in a dozen or so unparalleled years characterized by strong demand growth, record high prices in farm incomes, food price spikes, expanded investment and innovation and increased trade.", "A convergence of forces was responsible. Global population growth, widespread global economic growth especially in emerging market and developing countries, rapid urbanization and biofuels. Now in 2000, the UN was projecting that the population would grow from 6.1 billion in that year to 9.3 billion by 2050. Today that projection for 2050 is 9.7 billion, so that\u2019s another 2.4 billion from today\u2019s 7.3 billion people.", "Although having slowed somewhat, the global expansion continues especially across much of the developing world bringing millions more into the middle class and enabling ongoing improvements in diets.", "On urbanization, we passed the 50% mark of population sometime around 2010 and that is now expected to approach 70% by 2050 with implications for food production and trade.", "Now Slide 7 reflects global Ag as a whole showing the production and consumption of all global grains. Now perhaps the most noteworthy point of this slide and one often overlooked with all the focus on supply, acreage, and yields and that is the persistent consumption growth.", "Consumption remains very strong, still rising steadily year-after-year and it has risen without fail every year since 1994, 1995 even including the great recession of 2009. Now fuelled by earlier high prices and after four consecutive great growing seasons worldwide, commodities supplies now are fully adequate to meet all needs. Prices of course have moved off the previously high levels and farmer margins have narrowed.", "Slide 8 provides more details showing global stockholdings and the supply to use ratio. While carryover stocks have reached levels of 15 years ago and physical quantities it is important to remember that we are now consuming one third more grains, so the supply use ratio is the key indicator. While it has moved above the average of recent years, it remains in a sensitive area and especially so when viewed with Chinese grain stocks excluded. Notably the Chinese are thought to hold about 45% of the global stocks and the supply use ratio actually has ticked down the last couple of years when the Chinese stocks are excluded.", "Now Slide 9 illustrates that even with abundant supply the production consumption balance still can shift rather quickly. Any significant production disruption will tilt the supply use ratio downward and prices will immediately move higher. The recent price movements in response to reports of relatively minor weather events certainly highlighted continued sensitivity.", "You will note from the slide that both corn and soy futures were trading in a rather narrow range in the first four months of this year. Then we saw some reports of adverse weather in Brazil and Argentina in April prices quickly reflected the uncertainty brought. Corn moved almost $0.90 bushel higher, soy moved $3.25 a bushel higher that's an increase of 25% for corn, 36% for soy.", "Then by late June, the South American weather conditions abated followed by the early July USDA WASDE report, indicating larger acreages of both corn and soy. The weather premium quickly disappeared from the corn price and it was reduced per soy.", "Now just for reference, the U.S. drought in 2012 reduced corn yields 22% below trend pushing ending stocks to barely 800 million bushels and prices to new record high. But this year a corn yield reduction of only 4% would have been sufficient to reduce ending stocks to $1 billion bushels and push prices to $5 per bushel or higher, a further illustration of the sensitive supply utilization balance. Now there was some expectation that farmers would reduce acreage in response to the softer prices as we came into the Northern Hemisphere planting seasons.", "On Slide 10, we know that despite the softer prices farmers worldwide did not reduce acreage. Now in the United States farmer supply response this year was influenced by market prices of course which provided a paired, but still positive margin, but they were also influenced by farm program subsidies, revenue insurance and production cost decline.", "For example of the subsidy, the agricultural program ARC County forecast of 2015 payments for Illinois is $0.37 per bushel on corn-based acres and $0.98 per bushel on soybean based acres. So as a result of this combination, U.S. farmers this year expanded planted area for all major crops except wheat illustrating continued profitability despite softer prices.", "Now we also expected a similar reduction in other parts of the world, but we noted there that farmers supply response was influenced largely by currency values and also some policy shifts notably in Argentina. And this crop year major exporters expanded grain and oilseed area all around the world and grains and oilseeds were up 3.7% in South America.", "As an example Brazilian farmers saw corn prices in reais of $5.24 per bushel in September 2015 compared to $3.43 per bushel a year before indicating that it was still very profitable to continue to expand.", "Now Slide 11 speaks to the financial condition of the U.S. farm sector. Overall the farm sector balance sheet remains strong. Farmer debt has been well managed. The financial indicators are still solid. It was not until a 2000 that farm sector equity reached $1 trillion, but then it took only 10 more years to add second trillion dollars and five years later we have added another $0.5 trillion.", "Now a major part of that balance sheet of course is farm land and USDA forecasts land prices to decline in 2016, crop land to decline 1%. This is the first time since 2009 and only the second time in almost three decades.", "Now Slide 12 summarizes the situation across the global Ag sector. As I noted, supplies are fully adequate, the risk premium have been erased from the grain market. We saw very little reduction coming into the year in response to the lower prices and that was because of the aberrational forces at play, the subsidies, the risk measures and also currency values which boosted commodity prices and we're in the fourth consecutive favorable weather year.", "So adding all of those things together barring adverse weather events, little near term improvement in Ag market conditions is anticipated but we would note that the long term drivers, population growth, income's growth and urbanization are still intact.", "Now Slide 13 pertains to the U.S. Ag sector and we note that farming is still profitable despite softer prices as evidenced by the continued expansion of planted acres this year and financial conditions across the sector remain solid. There is some individual farmer stress to be sure but no widespread stress is yet evident.", "And finally Slide 14 lists some key factors that are worth watching in the coming months. And in the short term of course weather is key. We know that demand is strong. We now know that supply depends upon the weather so it\u2019s still weather is the major market disruptor and it's still one season at a time.", "Attention now will turn from North America to the southern hemisphere as the planting growing season gets underway there in late September and October we\u2019ll continue to watch that until next spring in the northern hemisphere when we will start focusing on planting and growing conditions here. And over the longer term, I would just note that any of these geopolitical hotspots that could erupt and become a drag on global GDP would be a negative.", "Lots of other things to watch include relative currency values and the political situation in several countries, central bank behavior all over the world and so I would just conclude by noting that after a dozen years of unprecedented prosperity planting, commodity price, food price and trading patterns are now stabilizing. A new commodity price trading range with favorable weather is emerging and weather remains the major commodity market disruptor. The outlook is still one year at a time depending upon the weather.", "I will now turn the call back to Josh.", "Joshua Jepsen", "Thanks J.B.", "Our 2016 Ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 15. You\u2019ll note there are no changes from our previous forecast. Low commodity prices, weakening farming income and elevated used equipment levels in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipments especially high horsepower models.", "We expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 15% to 20% for 2016 with sales of large Ag equipment down 25% to 30%. The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5% due to lower crop prices and farm incomes as well as persistent pressure on the dairy sector.", "In South America industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to be down 15% to 20% in 2016. This is a reflection of the downturn in Brazil and other commodity driven markets in the regions.", "Shifting to Asia, the industry sales outlook continues to be flat to down slightly. This is due in part to weakness in China partially offset by improving conditions in India where the monsoon rains have been higher than normal.", "Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, again no change from our prior forecast.", "Putting this altogether on Slide 16, fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag and turf equipment are forecast to be down about 8% including about 2 points to negative currency translation. This is unchanged from the previous forecast. Our forecast for the Ag and turf division\u2019s operating margin is now about 7.7% for the year with an implied decremental margin of about 15%.", "Now let focus on construction forestry on Slide 17. Net sales were down 24% in the quarter and operating profit was down 58% due mainly to lower shipment volumes and an unfavorable product mix. The division\u2019s decremental margin was 20%.", "Moving to Slide 18, the economic indicators noted at the bottom of the slide although down somewhat from the previous quarter remain positive. Notwithstanding these positive signals the market demand for construction equipment continues to soften. Among the factors contributing to the weakness, conditions in the oil and gas sector continue to be slow with the impact most pronounced in the energy producing regions of the U.S. and Canada. Contractors are less apt to replenish or grow their machine fleets when faced with uncertain markets.", "Rental utilization rates continue to decline leading to a reduction in fleet sizes and higher levels of used equipment. Also housing starts in the U.S. for single family homes which require more earth moving equipment remain well below the long-term average.", "As a result Deere's construction and forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 18% in 2016. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 1 point. The global forestry market forecast remains down 5% to 10% primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 4.1%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 31%.", "Let\u2019s move now to our financial services. Slide 19 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio which was 24 basis points at the end of July. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 23 basis points, unchanged from the previous forecast. The provision remains below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.", "Moving to Slide 20 worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Co was a $126 million in the third quarter versus a $153 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, a higher provision for credit losses and higher losses on lease residual values. The division\u2019s forecast net income attributable to Deere & Co remains at $480 million for the year.", "Slide 21 outlines receivables and inventories. For a company as a whole receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $764 million. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $500 million with reductions coming from both divisions.", "Field inventory to sales ratios for new large Ag equipment are expected to end the year in line with 2015 year end levels which is consistent with our previous forecast. C&F inventory and receivables to sales ratios are forecast to end the year roughly in line with last year\u2019s levels as well.", "Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on Slide 22 is about 78.7%. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable factors in mind, an unfavorable product mix and engine emission cost. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point, favorable raw material costs lower pension and OPEB expense and lower incentive compensation expense.", "Now let\u2019s look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D on Slide 23, R&D was down 2% in the third quarter. Our forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% for the full year including about 1 point of negative currency translation. This is consistent with our previous forecast.", "Moving now to Slide 24. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 10% in the third quarter. Most of the decline was attributable to incentive compensation, commissions to dealers, pension and OPEB and currency translation.", "Turning to Slide 25, our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 5% with incentive compensation, currency translation and pension OPEB accounting for about 6 points of the full year change.", "On Slide 26, pension and OPEB expense was down $53 million in the quarter and is now forecast to be down about $210 million in 2016.", "On Slide 27, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter and is now forecast to be in the range of 29% to 31% for the full year.", "Slide 28 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is forecast to be about $2.1 billion in 2016.", "The company's fourth quarter financial outlook is on Slide 29. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 8% compared with 2015. This includes about one point of price realization and favorable currency translation of about one point.", "Turning to Slide 30 and the full year outlook, the forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 10%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about one point, with negative currency translation of about two points.", "Finally our forecast now calls for net income attributable to Deere & Company to be about $1.35 billion for the full year. In closing, Deere continues to perform well in the face of challenging market conditions and this is particularly true in relation to previous farm recessions. Our performance in the third quarter and for the year-to-date underscores our success developing a more durable business model into wider range of revenue sources.", "At the same time, we are continuing to look for ways to make our operations more profitable and efficient by seeking out further structural cost reductions. All-in-all, we remain confident in the company's present direction and believe Deere is on the right track to deliver significant value to its customers and investors in the years ahead.", "I will now turn the call back over to Tony.", "Tony Huegel", "Thanks Josh.", "Now we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. However as a reminder in consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Timothy Thein from Citigroup Global Markets. Your line is open.", "Timothy Thein", "Thank you. So Tony, some pretty big moves during the quarter that you alluded to in both corn and soybeans, I guess, or grains in general. But I'm curious, what you're hearing just in terms of overall sentiment from your dealers in North America, and how that's kind of influenced farmer decisions? And especially how that kind of carried through in terms of the early - the spring early order program, how that finished relative to last year. Thank you.", "Tony Huegel", "Thanks, Tim. Yes, as you might imagine, and we talked last quarter and even the early part of the third quarter where sentiment was a bit more positive as those commodity prices were up, and as we mentioned there, that can change in a hurry, and it certainly with the commodity prices coming down, I think it's fair to say the overall mood would be less positive than it was a couple months ago even.", "Related to the spring seasonal equipment, we just finished the first phase, remember these are multiphase early order programs, so I want to stress it's still quite early, but we did see on some of those key products like planters and sprayers as well as spring tillage equipment. We are seeing those early order programs down year-over-year, but as you think about the magnitude of that decrease considerably less of a reduction versus where we were a year ago.", "In fact if you look at just a plant or EOP in particular, which is often considered a good indicator for large Ag and its current environment, orders are down in the single-digit range. So just to give you an idea, again, I would stress that it is quite early.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Andy Casey", "Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Ag and turf margin question. You mentioned the margin increased even without the SiteOne gain. First, was that gain consistent with the 76 million identified in the 10-Q, and then axing the gain out, really it's the first positive year to year gross quarter of 14 but the implied Q4 guidance suggests a fairly deep year to year decline. I\u2019m just wondering what drove the improvement in Q3 and what's changing in Q4 to drive a continuation of the margin declines.", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, certainly, you know, the third quarter was a very strong quarter for Ag and turf, you know, on lower sales, the operating margins were higher. Obviously price realization continues to be very strong. You point out the SiteOne gain that was about 75 million. I think Josh indicated, just under two points of margin there.", "So really a lot of it was cost management, and so we had lower production costs, things like obviously incentive comps, material costs continued to be a tailwind for us. Obviously it had a little higher Tier 4 emissions costs. SA&G was also lower. So those were some of the positives. Obviously volume and FX continued to be drags on the profitability as well.", "As you look out into fourth quarter, I think a couple of things to keep in mind, one is mix shifts, so as you think about the production, a couple of our key factories in particular, you think about Waterloo with large tractors as well as harvester works will see considerably lower production in the fourth quarter of '16 versus '15.", "Just to put some context around that, harvester works for combines would be about a 60% reduction in output hours and Waterloo is about a 20% reduction in output hours, so a couple of, very profitable products for us. The production will be down pretty considerably.", "The other thing, I think that's worth noting is material costs. That\u2019s been a nice tailwind for us through the first three quarters of the year. That actually becomes more flattish. It's slightly negative, but really more flattish in the fourth quarter, so you lose the tailwind in the quarter would be the other item I'd point out. So those are probably the biggest differences as you move into the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse Securities. Your line is open.", "Jamie Cook", "Hi, good morning, I guess Tony, the question I usually ask. Can you just talk about the progress that you've made, you know, in the U.S. or North America on the used equipment issue, where we are relative to last year and relative to your expectations and what that implies for - do we think we have to take incremental inventory out on the used side in '17. Thanks.", "Joshua Jepsen", "Thanks Jamie. Used equipment, and I want to kind of parse that out again as we always do. When you think about large Ag used inventory, we continue to be down about 23% from the peak of kind of summer of 2014. That's consistent with where we were at the end of last quarter, but keep in mind, seasonality does create a challenge in terms of even keeping things flat, so I would say that, that is kind of as expected, at least in line with what we would expect.", "We would hope to see and certainly expect to see progress continue to resume in fourth quarter with that number continuing to move back down, but to your point, we still have a significant amount of work to do yet this year but even into 2017, so, that kind of talks to the inventory balance a bit, and I think when you look at the balance sheet of dealers and the pricing and the valuation of that equipment, generally what we're hearing is that dealers are feeling a little better about the income or the equipment that they do have and the value that it's at on their balance sheet.", "We've seen some pricing stabilization on used equipment, so, again, I think things are stabilizing but I want to be clear we have a lot of work on the actual level of used inventory at our dealers that will continue into 2017.", "Jamie Cook", "Okay. Thank you, I'll get back in queue.", "Operator", "Next question is from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "Eli Lustgarten ", "Good morning everyone. Very nice quarter. One thing economists look at by the way is that the - big movements in commodity price particularly in corn were related to 252,000 money manager wrong contracts that unwound in 11 days to a negative 100. I mean it was really money managers drove it more than the free market. That's public data by the way.", "My question really is looking at production levels that would go into the fourth quarter and actually into next year. You've indicated your inventory levels will be sort of that same place at '15 but we're talking about a U.S. market that's down 20%, 25% and almost 30% percent in big tractors and probably may have some minor fall next year.", "So it's just suggested there's either plant shutdowns coming now or in early 17, and that has - will probably have some weight on the $0.35 that you sort of forget for projecting for the fourth quarter. Can you give us some color on how production levels you started a little bit on, how far down the fourth quarter will be but the inventory levels aren't going to go away. The big shock for farmers\u2026", "Tony Huegel", "I'm going to jump in here because, A, I think you're mistaken in what we've said. Okay, we're not saying that the field inventory levels are the same. We're saying are going to be in line as a percent of sales they'll be in line, so that's implying large Ag is down pretty considerably when you look at field inventories.", "So, again, the reason we're clarifying that is as we talked earlier in the year, when you're looking at total Ag inventories and receivables, you have small Ag in there as well, and we've seen some increases there. But if you look at just large Ag we have taken pretty comfortable reductions in the year to keep those inventory and receivable levels in line with the sales when we get to the end of October, so I think that that's probably the most important statement.", "In regard to 2017 shutdowns and production schedule, we'll talk more about that next quarter when we have the 2017 outlook. So anyway, appreciate the question and we'll move on to the next caller. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Jerry Revich", "Good morning, everyone. Tony, can you please talk about your allocation of pool funds between used transactions versus new this year or the dealers use of pool funds I should say, and how we should think about as we enter 2017 where that balance of allocation of use of pool funds shakes out between new and used just put it into context versus history for us if you don't mind.", "Tony Huegel", "Sure, Yes, and I think there can often be confusion around pool funds. When we refer to pool funds, at least in the U.S. and Canada, those funds are only for used equipment. They earn them on the sale of new equipment, but it's really the funds that are available for them to provide incentives for the sale of used.", "So we often talk about one way they can use those is for helping to subsidize the floor planning but they have of used equipment as well as actual retail, and so we do - we do tend to manage that. There was a period of time where we were starting to see a shift towards more use of wholesale financing and floor planning, but that has shifted back to a very attractive use on actual retail, and pretty much in line with what we would expect.", "So that's been a positive trend that we saw really early in the year, and it's continued through the year on pool fund. So another question around there that I'll throw in as a bonus is you look at pool funds in aggregate, we would say certainly as we look at that relative to used inventory, we would be comfortable in aggregate.", "As we said before, there are clearly some dealers who we would look at and say their pool funds - you know, are too light relative to the used equipment that they have, and that's when we have those individual conversations with those specific dealers. But in aggregate still at healthy levels.", "Jerry Revich", "Appreciate the bonus. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Lawrence De Maria from William Blair. Your line is open.", "Lawrence De Maria", "Thanks, good morning guys. I want to ask about - a little bit about the FINCO and some of the headwinds that are potentially going forward around residual values. I think if we look at the book they said around 64%. That's up significantly from a decade ago around 40%, 42%.", "I guess I'm kind of wondering what kind of risk you guys see from that declining given the weaker market prices we're seeing over the last couple of years and what kind of headwinds to think from that over, the next, maybe year or two I guess.", "Tony Huegel", "If you think about the operating leases just kind of in general, hopefully the read through as you look at the quarter is things seem to stabilize, at least in the short-term in terms of the losses that were recognized, you know, no additional impairments, those sorts of things. Obviously the forecasted income for financial services stayed the same, all positive signs, but to your point, you know, I would say in the near term, short to midterm, there's still certainly risk.", "As we look at future maturities we continue to work hard to reduce the return rate on those maturities as well as finding more effective ways to dispose of those when they get returns so that the loss rates are not as significant, but as long as we stay at these lower levels, as long as, you know, used equipment prices continue to be at more depressed levels, I think that continues to bear watching and certainly has risks.", "So while we take some comfort in the short-term with the stabilization we saw in the quarter, it's going to be a while before we're willing to say we're out of the woods there and so to your point, stay tuned and certainly we would be deciding that at some additional risk.", "Lawrence De Maria", "Right. So to that point, Tony if I could just follow up. When would we expect some of the biggest returns to occur given the peak few years ago and the duration of some of the leases on there, would that kind of the returns for the peak in '17 or '18 or are we going through that kind of bell curve now?", "Tony Huegel", "You're hitting some of that now. We'll hit some pretty strong maturities in the fourth quarter of this year, and then certainly as we move into spring, you know, next year is I think another kind of wave of maturity. So think about timing of when you tend to see a fairly healthy level of retail activity that's when you're going to see some of those - some of those peak.", "So let's go ahead and mover. I appreciate the question. Let's move on to the next caller thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from David Raso from International Strategy & Investment Group. Your line is open.", "David Raso", "Hi, good morning. Really just a kind of big picture question about, you know, all that you know about your new and used inventory in the channel and how production is this year versus retail. Just for a generic framework, if hypothetically retail was flat next year for Ag globally and maybe the same question for construction, how would Deere's production be in that environment, up, down, in line with that retail environment? Just trying to think through all the under production, versus inventory draw down needs. Just wrap it all into that one question.", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, I think in both cases, I would say in line with, which would imply higher year-over-year sales.", "David Raso", "Can you repeat that if flat retail\u2026", "Tony Huegel", "In line with retail.", "David Raso", "Yes.", "Tony Huegel", "Which would imply higher sales because we're under producing this year.", "David Raso", "That's sometimes so just be clear, your production would be higher than retail?", "Tony Huegel", "Correct. Yes.", "David Raso", "And when it comes to the mix of that\u2026", "Tony Huegel", "No, no. Our production would be in line with retail, but it was less than retail in 2016.", "David Raso", "Okay. Let's not confuse it with the comp, just straight out if retail is flat?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes.", "David Raso", "Deere's production year-over-year is flat or up?", "Tony Huegel", "Our production is higher, because we will produce in line with retail. So our year-over-year production will be higher.", "David Raso", "Okay. And a follow-on that the mix within that, if retails flat, but Deere is up because, you're under produce last year, this year, I mean next year you want it under produce, is that particularly a harvester works, Waterloo comment or how should we think about that on the mix of up and flat?", "Tony Huegel", "It's certainly our greatest under production than large Ag in the year. So mix would be favorable year-over-year.", "David Raso", "And does that comment hold for construction in core shares as well?", "Tony Huegel", "That I don't have the details on as well, I have a hard time to answering that so yes, all right.", "David Raso", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.", "Joe O'Dea", "Hi, good morning. On the construction front, could you just talk about kind of where your demand levels stand relative to what you see in the end market activity, and if you see anything on the horizon where some of the challenges from oil and gas or some of the dealer destock if you see some potential near term release from that so that such that your demand could improve?", "Tony Huegel", "I think in the short term and what you're seeing reflected in our outlook on construction is our dealers do continue to be so flat. So as the market continues to decline as we would expect them to and hope that they would they are bringing their inventories down in line with that. Some of that actually is related to the lead times we\u2019re able to have right now in our factories with the lower production, they can get replenishment, the equipment pretty quickly and as a result of that they are able to do more of that de-stocking and make sure that they are putting their inventories in a good low level type of environment.", "So as I turn that around a little bit to the extent you start to see positive turns in that market our dealers are likely in our - would respond maybe a bit more aggressively as dealers would need to do a little bit more stocking up. So it does have some negative now but more positive when the market does eventually rebound.", "Joe O'Dea", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Ann Duignan", "Yes, hi good morning. Good morning J.B., I hope all is well there. My one question, I need to waste my question I guess but it\u2019s one that I am wrecking my brain over. Did you actually record a mark-to-market gain on your 9.5 million remaining shares at SiteOne in the quarter?", "Tony Huegel ", "No we did not.", "Ann Duignan", "Okay. That\u2019s my question and thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Seth Weber", "Hi, good morning. I want to ask about Brazil. I mean I know you didn\u2019t update your outlook for South America for this year but some other data points that we\u2019ve been getting, some of the shipment data our of Brazil for the last couple of months has been a little bit better. Do you think that\u2019s a market that could be up next year?", "Tony Huegel", "Certainly, I mean if you ask me today which market was likely if I had to pick one which one has the best likelihood of being up, I think I would have to say Brazil or South America in general. One of the things to keep in mind is and we talked about this throughout the year is a lot of downturn there has been related to the uncertainty around the government and the overall economy. Farmers have been pretty profitable.", "As a result of that with the new government at least today there appears to be a more positive sentiment, inflation is coming down as an example so the overall economy seems to be showing some level of improvement.", "And in the short term we\u2019re seeing that in the order books as well. Now, the question there is remember there is a conversion to Tier 3 what we consider Tier 3 on January 1 in Brazil on large Ag equipment so that will and dealers know and customers know, that will come with the price increase. So undoubtedly some of the at least short-term order book activity we\u2019re seeing is strength around that buying equipment ahead of the Tier 3 conversion.", "So the real question remains, will we continue to see that demand surge as we go into calendar 2017 or not. But again I think there is some fairly favorable signs that would indicate that could possibly be the case.", "Seth Weber", "And have you been building inventory for that emissions change?", "Tony Huegel", "Our order books would reflect demand related to that but we have not built inventory ahead to have on our dealer lots to lead further into 2017.", "Seth Weber", "Okay. Thanks very much guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Robert Wertheimer from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.", "Robert Wertheimer", "Hi, good morning. Did you see any sequential materials cost reduction that was meaningful to margin, I mean the margins were very strong in Ag and turf on revenues that was down sequentially material seasonally obviously. I am just curious about if you can bridge whether materials is a big part of that or whether it\u2019s something else?", "Tony Huegel", "Actually, if you look obviously we don\u2019t give the actual number any longer but it would benefit in the quarter for Ag would have been slightly less than second quarter for material.", "Robert Wertheimer", "And that\u2019s on a year-over-year basis, okay fair enough.", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, so again it\u2019s starting to come down a little bit which you would expect as we\u2019re looking some slight increase going into the fourth quarter. There was really, certainly was contribution but it was holding other costs and finding ways to operate again as efficiently as we can at these low levels and so they just did a great job working through some of those costs.", "Robert Wertheimer", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Shlisky from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.", "Michael Shlisky", "Good morning guys. Just checking out your slides towards the back, you did update your outlook for the 2016 cash receipts I do see that but I don\u2019t see in there a 2017 outlook although at this time last year in \u201915 you gave us a 2016 outlook. And so kind of wondering if that\u2019s just a reflection of the uncertainty out there or could at least give us maybe a base case scenario or directional view for next year\u2019s restates for both crops and livestock. Thanks.", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, that was - you noted correctly. That\u2019s actually a change we did make this year. Historically we would have provided the first look at a cash receipts forecast out into the future year and candidly it\u2019s just too in our view at this point it is just so pretty mature and preliminary that we decided that would make that change this year. And I\u2019ll note that USDA doesn\u2019t provide, it won\u2019t provide their first 2017 cash receipts outlook until February of 2017.", "So historically we were almost six months ahead of the USDA and so as a result we\u2019ve decided that we will wait. We do expect in November that we\u2019ll have again it\u2019ll still be very preliminary but we will have our first 2017 cash receipts outlook. I would tell you if you look at our number I would call it flattish as this point year-over-year but again I can\u2019t emphasize enough. It\u2019s very, very premature.", "Michael Shlisky", "Okay, fair enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mircea Dobre from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Mircea Dobre", "Good morning, this is Mircea Dobre with Baird. A quick question back at Ag and turf, Tony can you give us any color at this point how much turf and maybe the smaller equipment contributes to operating income and am also wondering how you are thinking about smaller equipment and inventory in the channel, is there any risk of destocking here into next year? Thanks.", "Tony Huegel", "We don\u2019t provide any profitability breakdown by large and small. We do on a annual basis provide some sales breakdown as you know but I think the second part of your question is worth noting especially when you think you about small Ag I would say the higher end of that small Ag business so what really it is attributed to livestock we have seen some softening in the retail environment around some of those product categories as the livestock margins have gotten squeezed a bit.", "And you\u2019ll actually see that reflected a little bit in some of the inventory levels that we report in the appendix. So the 100 horsepower and above you\u2019ll see I forget what slide that is Josh, do you mind look at that up quick. But if you look at it you\u2019ll see still on the mid 30% range.", "Joshua Jepsen", "47%", "Tony Huegel", "47% where we\u2019d be back down typically in the 20% range. Really what\u2019s driving that is the 100 to 200 horsepower the 6000 series tractors are a bit elevated but it\u2019s possible last quarter we talked about this and said this was likely that our expectation is would have those in line year-over-year with some of the weakness in livestock.", "It\u2019s possible that number will be a bit elevated, it should come down but it may not hit quite the same level that we were at as we ended 2016 but again that product is coming from Germany so there is longer lead times not building to retail order, we\u2019re building to forecast and that retail sales forecast has slipped a bit in the quarter and obviously it\u2019s wasn\u2019t dramatic enough for us to change the overall retail sales outlook but it did soften some.", "Mircea Dobre", "But Tony, isn\u2019t there a bit of an issue with under 40 horsepower as well?", "Tony Huegel", "From an inventory perspective I don\u2019t believe that is the case and you\u2019ve seen ours come up. Now remember our sales - our inventory levels are coming up but our sales are too. So it\u2019s really coming up more in line with the sales at this point.", "Mircea Dobre", "All right thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Steven Fisher from UBS Securities. Your line is open.", "Steven Fisher", "Thanks. Good morning. So it looks like your leasing exposure went up in the quarter to about 5.6 billion, it\u2019s up around a 100 million. Can you just talk about how your efforts to effectively discourage some of that leasing activity is being received and when might you expect to see that lease exposure actually start to come down?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, I think you are right in the sense that the overall lease activity has continued to increase, so I think what's also worth nothing is the short term leases and the activity there is down significantly. And so lot of the actions that we were taking at the end of second quarter and into third quarter were focused on reducing those short term leases and that has been effective.", "And so we are pleased with that certainly I think, again you know we said this before our preference would always be a retail node over an operating lease that to the extent our customers continue to prefer an operating lease, our obligation there is to make sure we are structuring those in a way that John Deere Financial can continue to be profitable.", "So that\u2019s where we are focused on. Last quarter we did raise residual values, can\u2019t say across the board but pretty much across the board not just on short term leases. But, I\u2019m sorry we reduced residual values pretty much across the board last quarter to try to correct some of those challenges that we had been facing. All right?", "Steven Fisher", "Can you quantify what the percentage of short term lease is now and how much - and if declined in the third quarter per se?", "Tony Huegel", "I don\u2019t have that number off-hand, but if it was a significantly lower number in the quarter.", "Steven Fisher", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our last question is from Joel Tiss from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Joel Tiss", "Just snuck in there, I will make it quick too. In financial services it seems like the debt is rising roughly about $2 billion while the portfolio is shrinking. I just wonder if you could explain what's going on there?", "Rajesh Kalathur ", "Joel, I'm not sure we are tracking all. Our debt-to-equity ratio, we try to maintain at 7.5 to 1 and that\u2019s been close to that, so we still maintained it around 7.5 to 1. And our portfolio overall has been slightly lower and even if you take a constant FX it\u2019s about flat. So the portfolio has not grown.", "Joel Tiss", "Yes, I know but the debt is up $2 billion over since the end of the year. All right I will ask you later.", "Tony Huegel", "Okay. And I think we did have one more come into the queue so we can go ahead and take that.", "Operator ", "Our next question is from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open.", "Ann Duignan ", "Yes, thank you for squeezing me in. My question is more on the European end markets and we saw German registrations down 21% last month which I don't know if we have ever seen it drop like that one month and I recognize its registrations, not retail sales. Can you just talk about the environment in Europe and France, Germany and U.K. and also how you are feeling about dealer inventories in the region?", "Tony Huegel ", "Yes, certainly, you track things like there is a seam of business parameter and so on. We started seeing even a quarter or so ago that's starting to track more negative, a year ago at this time that was actually moving a more positive direction and we had some relatively positive hope for Europe as it went into 2016.", "I think in the short term certainly you have a lot of factors like Brexit and so on that are causing some uncertainty. There were some challenges and if you look at some of the Eastern part of the EU28 with subsidies and timing of when subsidies were released again.", "And then when you look at France, I mean you are starting to see some indications that the crop there is certainly not what many had hoped and so you are seeing some weakness there. So I think certainly you are seeing a sentiment get a bit weaker here in the latter part of the year. J.B or Raj, do you have anything?", "All right, beyond that I am not sure there is much more, I would say it's your point, it\u2019s one month, it\u2019s registrations I wouldn't read too much into a single month.", "Ann Duignan", "And dealer inventories?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, dealer inventories I think we are reasonably comfortable with, that's one where again we would say used equipment, not an issue at this point but one we certainly have our eyes on and I'd say cautionary. Actually one of the bigger challenges there had been Great Britain, U.K. and with some of the FX and it was if the FX it held up pretty well.", "With Brexit now and the FX changing, that\u2019s actually in a short term created some benefit for their used equipment to move because most of that of course comes to the mainland and gets distributed kind of the Eastern part of Europe. So that\u2019s been a positive again very short term impact of Brexit.", "Ann Duignan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Tony Huegel", "Thank you. And before we close Raj has a couple of comments he would like to make.", "Rajesh Kalathur", "So there have been some questions around our third quarter margins and fourth quarter margins and around 2017 what to expect. I just wanted to make a few comments along those lines. We have mentioned in the past that each of our units plan for the mid cycle trough and peak scenarios, in addition to the following year's forecast and you will have noted our decremental margin performance in the last three years show how well we have executed in this downturn.", "Now as a result of our disciplined process, our margins have improved about 300 basis points at mid-cycle volumes now compared to mid-cycle volumes in 2010. So we have been working on reducing our SA&G, overhead expenses and also structurally reducing our material costs. We have diverted more of our R&D resources to focus on cost reductions in the last two years and we have increased focus on efficiency improvement and structural cost reduction activities broadly and in general.", "Now with such structural cost reduction activities, we expect to improve our pre-tax income by at least $500 million by the end of 2018 if large Ag down turn persists at current levels. Now I should also say our internal goals and targets are even larger. Having said this, you should also note that we have balancing structural cost reductions with investments for the future and we remain committed to maintaining manufacturing capacity to support an eventual turnaround. Thank you.", "Tony Huegel", "All right. Thank you, Raj, and with that, we'll conclude our call. We appreciate the questions and we of course will be around throughout the rest of the day to answer any follow up.

Josh?", "Josh Jepsen", "John Deere today reported solid financial results for the fourth quarter and did so in spite of the continuing impact of the global farm recession in difficult conditions in the construction equipment sector. As in prior quarters, our performance was helped by the sound execution of our operating plans, the impact of a broad product portfolio and our success in keeping the tight rein on cost and assets. For the full year, the company had earnings of $1.52 billion, a top 10-year. In our view, that\u2019s a noteworthy achievement in light of tough business conditions and certainly well above the levels we have experienced in previous downturns. For 2017, we are looking for similar overall market conditions with a slight decline being forecast for sales and earnings.", "Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at the fourth quarter in detail beginning on Slide 4. Net sales and revenues were down 3% to $6.52 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $285 million. EPS was $0.90 in the quarter. On Slide 5, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 5% to $5.65 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 3 points. Currency translation was favorable by 1 point.", "Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let\u2019s start with agriculture and turf on Slide 6. Net sales were down 5% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in most regions of the world, mainly in the U.S. and Canada. One notable exception was South America, which experienced higher sales led by Brazil and Argentina. Operating profit was $371 million and operating margins were 8.4% in the quarter. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by price realization and to a lesser extent, by lower pension and OPEB expense, material and production cost.", "Before we review the industry sales outlook, let\u2019s look at some of the fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 7 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the large crop harvests in 2015 and consequently to lower commodity prices we are seeing today, our 2016 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 6% from 2015 levels. Moving to 2017, we expect total cash receipts to be approximately $367 billion, about the same as in 2016 as lower livestock cash receipts are offset by higher crop receipts.", "On Slide 8, global grain and oilseed stocks-to-use ratios are forecast to remain at elevated but generally unchanged levels in 2016 and \u201817 as abundant crops are mostly offset by strong demand conditions around the world. Chinese grain and oilseed stocks have continued to increase in 2016 with supply, domestic production plus imports outpacing demand. Chinese stocks of grains and oilseeds now represent almost half of the world\u2019s stocks. Given these stocks are unlikely to be exported the world market is sensitive to any production setbacks or major geopolitical disruptions. World cotton stocks have now fallen for second consecutive season and to the lowest level in five seasons, reflecting lower planting and stronger global demand.", "Our economic outlook for the EU28 is on Slide 9. Geopolitical risks such as Brexit remain elevated contributing to the outlook for slow economic growth. Farm incomes remain under pressure and is below long-term averages, especially after a poor harvest in France. The dairy sector continues to experience weakness although there are signs the market is bottoming out. As a result, industry farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be down about 5% in 2017.", "On Slide 10, you will see economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, slower economic growth persists and ag policy changes are causing short-term uncertainty for most domestic and global markets. As a result, we anticipate lowered industry sales. Turning to India, the government continues to focus on reviving growth in the ag sector and improving farm incomes. The value of agricultural production is expected to increase as a result of normal rains after 2 years of below average monsoons. These factors are expected to drive increased industry demand in India.", "Shifting to Brazil, Slide 11 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agri business. Ag production is expected to increase about 7% in 2017 in U.S. dollar terms due to recovering corn and the continued increase in ethanol demand. From a local currency perspective, the change is about 6%. Ag fundamentals remain positive and farmer confidence is at its highest level since 2013 due to improved political stability and signs of economic progress. We expect these factors to lead to higher industry equipment sales.", "Staying in Brazil, Slide 12 illustrates the finance rates for ag equipment. Moderfrota rates announced earlier this year remain at 8.5% for small and midsized farmers and 10.5% for large farmers. The government\u2019s ongoing commitment to agriculture continues and indications of shifting budgets to ensure availability of funds for Moderfrota are positive signals for the farm sector in Brazil.", "Our 2017 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 13. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be down 5% to 10% with the effects being felt in both large and small models of equipment. Still, there are signs that large ag market is nearing bottom as indicated by the fact that the decline expected in 2017 is less than we saw in 2016. The EU28 industry outlook is forecasted to be down about 5% in 2017 due to low crop prices and farm incomes as well as persistent pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be up about 15% in 2017, a reflection of the factors already discussed for Brazil as well as positive industry sentiments in Argentina. Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be flat to up slightly with growth in India being the main driver.", "Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be roughly flat in 2017 with Deere sales outpacing the industry. Putting this altogether, on Slide 14, fiscal year 2017 Deere sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment are forecast to be down about 1%, including about 1 point of positive currency translation. The ag and turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 8.5% in 2017.", "Now, let\u2019s focus on construction and forestry on Slide 15. Net sales were down 5% in the quarter due to lower shipment volumes and higher sales incentive costs both mainly driven by the U.S. market. The U.S. and Canadian markets continued to be extremely competitive and the pricing environment remains challenging. The division incurred an operating loss of $17 million in the quarter due to higher sales incentive costs, an impairment charge for international operations of $25 million and higher production costs. The division\u2019s decremental margin was 33% for the full year.", "Moving to Slide 16 and looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide. GDP growth is positive. Construction spending is increasing and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units again this year. In spite of these positive signals, the market demand for construction equipment continues to be weak. Factors contributing to the weakness have not changed dramatically over the past quarter. Conditions in the oil and gas sector, for example, continued to be slow. Also, construction contractors are delaying fleet replenishment because of the uncertain markets. Rental utilization rate declines persist, leading to a reduction in fleets and elevated levels of used inventory. Housing starts in the U.S. for single-family homes remain below the long-term average and multifamily home construction is slowing due to overbuilding in some parts of the country. On balance, Deere\u2019s construction and forestry sales are forecast to be up about 1% in 2017 with positive currency translation of about 1 point. Global forestry markets are expected to be roughly flat in 2017. C&F\u2019s full year operating margin is projected to be about 3.5%.", "Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operations. Slide 17 shows the provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. The provision at the end of 2016 was 23 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The 2017 forecast anticipates a loss provision of about 29 basis points, up somewhat from historically low levels of recent years. This puts the provision just above the 10-year average of 26 basis points though below the 15-year average of 34 basis points.", "Moving to Slide 18, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $110 million in the fourth quarter versus $153 million last year. 2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company was $468 million compared with $633 million in 2015. The lower results for both periods were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, higher losses on residual values and a higher provision for credit losses. Also, remember that full year 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of our crop insurance business of about $30 million. Deere\u2019s worldwide financial services operation is expected to earn about $480 million in 2017. The outlook reflects lower losses on lease residual values partially offset by less favorable financing spreads and an increased provision for credit losses.", "Slide 19 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the year down $517 million. They are expected to decline again in 2017 by about $250 million. For the year ahead, we expect to produce in line with retail demand for large ag equipment while under-producing in the small ag sector, which is mostly related to midsized tractors and other livestock related products.", "Before getting into cost of sales, let\u2019s discuss the voluntary separation programs initiated during the fourth quarter of 2016 as part of efforts to improve our cost structure. As noted in today\u2019s earnings announcement, pre-tax expenses related to the programs were $11 million in 2016 and will be about $105 million in 2017, most of which will be incurred in the first quarter. These expenses are recorded in the period employees accept the offer. While the voluntary separation programs applied to salaried employees throughout the U.S., a vast majority of those accepting offers were within the equipment divisions. These costs have an impact on cost of sales, R&D and SA&G. Savings from the programs are expected to be about $75 million in 2017.", "Moving to Slide 20, cost of sales as a percent of net sales for 2016 was 78% versus previous guidance of 78.7%, a result of structural cost reduction efforts. Our guidance for 2017 cost of sales is about 78%. When modeling 2017, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: an unfavorable product mix, overhead spending, and Tier 4 product costs. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point and lower incentive compensation expense. Please note that our cost of sales guidance is flat with 2016 in spite of increasing commodity cost, higher pension and OPEB expenses and lower volume.", "Now, let\u2019s look at some additional details with respect to R&D expense on Slide 21. R&D was down 4% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. Currency translation had a negative impact of 1% for the full year. Our 2017 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3%.", "Moving now to Slide 22, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up 3% in the fourth quarter with commissions paid to dealers, incentive compensation, the voluntary separation programs and pension and OPEB expense accounting for 2 points of the change on a net basis. SA&G expense for the full year was down 5% with currency translation, pension and OPEB expense and incentive compensation accounting for most of the change. Our 2017 forecast on Slide 23 shows SA&G expense being up about 1% with a net impact of about 2 points from the voluntary separation program, currency translation and incentive compensation.", "Turning to Slide 24, pension and OPEB expense was down $53 million for the quarter and down $200 million for the full year. The forecast for pension and OPEB expense for 2017 is up about $30 million. On Slide 25, the equipment operations tax rate was 32% in the quarter and 30% for the full year. The lower rate resulted mainly from discrete items. For 2017, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 33% to 35%.", "Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations was $2.9 billion in 2016 and is forecast to be about $2.5 billion in 2017.", "The 2017 outlook for the first quarter and full year is on Slide 27. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 4% compared with 2016. This includes about 1 point of price realization and about 2 points of favorable currency translation. The full year forecast calls for net sales to be down about 1%. Price realization and favorable currency translation are each expected to be about 1 point. Finally, our full year 2017 net income forecast is about $1.4 billion.", "Comparing 2016 and 2017, Slide 28 shows the high-level reconciliation of operating profit for the equipment operations adjusted for special items. Operating profit was $1.88 billion for the equipment operations in 2016 included were special items, which require consideration, a $75 million pre-tax gain from the sale of a partial interest in SiteOne landscape supply, impairment charges for the C&F operations internationally of about $25 million, and voluntary separation programs of $11 million. Adjusted for these factors, 2016 operating profit would have been $1.841 billion.", "Based on the guidance provided for net sales changes in 2017 and operating margins by segment, the implied operating profit for the equipment operations is forecast to be between $1.7 billion and $1.75 billion. Included were the following items of note: voluntary separation program cost of $96 million related to the equipment operations, pension and OPEB expenses of about $30 million and other non-recurring cost of about $55 million. After adjusting for these items, implied operating profit for 2017 is in the range of $1.88 billion to $1.93 billion. On an adjusted basis, the comparison shows an improvement between $40 million to $90 million for 2017 even with lower sales volumes, which are projected to be down about 3%. The lower volumes negatively impact the 2017 forecast. When considering the special and non-recurring items as well as the impact of lower volumes, they show the company is continuing to deliver improved operational performance due in part to structural cost reduction initiatives.", "I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Raj Kalathur, for additional comments.", "Raj Kalathur", "Thanks, Josh. Last quarter, we talked about our plans to improve pre-tax profit by at least $500 million through structural cost reductions by the end of 2018. These benefits would apply to 2016 volume levels. We expect to see the full benefit of the $500 million improvement in the year 2019 and beyond. These cost reduction efforts began in March of 2016 and contributed in excess of $90 million for the year 2016. The 2017 forecast includes an additional about $190 million of structural cost reduction.", "Here is some detail about where the $500 million in improvement is expected to come from. Number one, structural direct and indirect material cost reduction is the largest contributor of improvement, roughly one-third. Now, this is the result of leveraging existing supplier relationships, resourcing and designing cost out of our products. Second, people-related costs are the second largest category of reduction, about one-fifth of the total improvement. The voluntary separation program that Josh discussed is a significant example. Other areas of improvement include changes to our variable pay structure especially under trough conditions as well as lower R&D spending and lower depreciation associated with lower capital expenditures.", "Overall, our teams are making good progress towards the $500 plus million goal and we have confidence it will be realized. In conjunction with sound execution, disciplined cost management will allow us to continue delivering significantly better performance than in downturns of the past. And of course, these same factors will provide a continued benefit when market conditions strengthen. All-in-all then, we remain confident in our company\u2019s present direction and believe Deere is well positioned to provide significant value to our customers and investors in the future.", "Tony Huegel", "Thanks, Raj. Now, we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure and in consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Leon?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse Securities. Your line is open.", "Jamie Cook", "Good morning. I don\u2019t know where to start. I guess, Raj, I appreciate the incremental color that you gave us associated with the $500 million in the savings that you outlined, the $90 million \u2013 the $190 million in 2017. And you gave more color on sort of costs, you know what I mean, the $116 million, but can you just give us more color so for \u201816, \u201817 and \u201818, what are the total \u2013 what are the costs each year associated with the $500 million?", "Raj Kalathur", "So Jamie, we said for 2016, it\u2019s in excess of $90 million on an operating profit basis, okay?", "Josh Jepsen", "The benefit.", "Raj Kalathur", "The benefit. Yes.", "Jamie Cook", "Okay. But what\u2019s the cost?", "Josh Jepsen", "The cost associated with that.", "Jamie Cook", "Yes, I want the cost associated with those savings each year.", "Raj Kalathur", "And we have said the voluntary separation costs are the primary ones if you look at it and it\u2019s about $11 million in 2016, okay. In 2017, we have said that the benefits are an incremental $190 million and we have also said the costs are \u2013 was it, $75 million?", "Tony Huegel", "$105 million.", "Raj Kalathur", "$105 million in total, yes. So, $105 million in total \u2013 in \u201817. So, now there will be some costs, but you will realize that on the structural material and direct - indirect and direct material cost side, the costs will be pretty minimal. The benefits will be substantial. Okay. On the voluntary separation type programs, there will be a cost and we have told you a lot of it in \u201816 and \u201817, okay?", "Tony Huegel", "And as we go forward, Jamie, if there are significant \u2013 to your point, if there are significant costs similar to the voluntary separation, we will certainly call those out as those are incurred and try to keep people abreast of what those are. But at this point, I mean your question about 2018.", "Jamie Cook", "Yes, I was just trying to understand what was incremental to the $11 million and the $105 million that you had pointed out. Because last quarter, you said three buckets, SG&A, material costs, you know what I mean, so I was just trying to get more color beyond what you guys provided?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, undoubtedly, there is some, but there is nothing of significance.", "Jamie Cook", "Okay, I will get back in queue. Thanks.", "Tony Huegel", "Okay, thank you. Next caller.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Andy Casey. Your line is open.", "Andy Casey", "Thanks a lot. Good morning and happy Thanksgiving early.", "Tony Huegel", "Thank you, sir.", "Andy Casey", "I guess I had question on financial services it looked like it took you about $10 million cash charge for impairment during the quarter. You guided contribution up for \u201817. Can you discuss what you are seeing in terms of dealer originations for operating leases? And whether it sounds like you are feeling more comfortable about the residual value risk going forward? Can you kind of talk about what you are seeing?", "Tony Huegel", "Sure. As you think about the maturities and so on with leases, keep in mind that we talked about this last quarter. We did have a significant level of maturities that occurred in the fourth quarter. In fact, if you look at October alone, the month of October in terms of what sales we had of matured leases, about 2x to 3x the typical months that we had. And again, that\u2019s on the sales side. So, we did see again on our maturity, a pretty significant peak in the fall. We will, as we go forward, as you think about lease maturities, you will continue to see some of those seasonal increases. So, as we mentioned before, you will see some increase in the spring generally and then again in the fall. So, typically our second and fourth quarters are the quarters that we will see those. But at this point, we would anticipate what we thought fourth quarter 2016 would be the highest peak from a maturity perspective. Certainly, we continue to see customers continuing to elect operating leases at a bit higher level than what we would have seen on a more historic basis. I think the current market conditions explain much of that. But I would also point out it isn\u2019t at some of the extreme levels that I have seen being reported. If you look over the last 12 months for example, so for 2016, if you look at just the retail financing of equipment, so comparing retail notes versus operating leases. Operating leases in terms of volumes coming in the door were about 25% of the total. That\u2019s up. Historically, we would be in the mid to upper teens. So, it\u2019s certainly at a more elevated level, but not to the degree or to the extent that some perhaps have reported. So, hopefully, it gives you a little bit of color on where we are at with the operating leases. But to your point, as we move forward especially when we get past second quarter with some of the changes that were made, at that point in time on the short-term leases, we would feel and then you are seeing it reflected in the forecast, a bit more confident on that front as we go into \u201817. Right, thank you. Next caller.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Jerry Revich. Your line is open.", "Jerry Revich", "Happy Thanksgiving everyone.", "Tony Huegel", "Thanks, Jerry.", "Jerry Revich", "Can you folks talk about now that you have completed largely anyway that Tier 4 transition how much of the cost improvement that you are seeing in \u201816 and into \u201817 is from lower factory and lower procurement costs now that you are focusing on optimizing the cost structure on the products? How much of a tailwind is that dynamic for you over the 2 years?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes. I think that unfortunately a level of detail, I am not going to be able to provide. But as you think about it kind of on a higher level, I think it is worth noting we still have emissions transition cost anticipated. Some of that is final Tier 4, so we still have some Final Tier 4 conversions. But also keep in mind as we go into 2017, Brazil has a Tier 3 conversion. So, there will be some cost there. So, emissions does continue to be an increase year-over-year. Now, that\u2019s on the one side. To your point, a portion of what we have talked about with the structural cost reduction is going back to some of those applications on Final Tier 4 where we have first and foremost found the most reliable solution. Now going back and looking at, are there ways we can still clearly meet those requirements that do so on a less expensive basis and so that really goes to \u2013 and would contribute to some of that kind of a third of the cost reduction that we are targeting on product costs. A good portion of that does relate to some of the Tier 4 future savings we would hope as we take some of those costs out of products on a go-forward basis.", "Jerry Revich", "And Tony, just to clarify, the transition cost you mentioned there up in Brazil, but globally, they are down, correct because\u2026.", "Tony Huegel", "It would still be an incremental cost on a global basis. You remember, those costs generally don\u2019t go away. And you still have, yes, Brazil transitioning, you have other products on a global basis transitioning. You have got some forestry products in Europe. You would still have some smaller product in the U.S. that we will be going through some transition. China, we have gone through some Tier 3 transition. So, the emissions broadly speaking continues to move forward on a global basis and so that will continue to provide some additional cost as we go forward at least for the foreseeable future.", "Jerry Revich", "Thank you.", "Tony Huegel", "Thank you. Next caller.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from David Raso. Your line is open.", "David Raso", "Hi, good morning.", "Tony Huegel", "Hi, David.", "David Raso", "My question is on pricing, obviously, the 3% was pretty impressive. We haven\u2019t seen that in many, many quarters. So, it maybe dovetails a bit into how you are viewing Deere Capital and the losses for residual values, but can you take us through a little bit, what are you seeing on pricing, the 3% for the quarter and maybe the pricing that you see in the order book and use pricing as it relates to the residual value thoughts for next year?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes. So, as you think \u2013 yes, when you think about the new pricing and specifically in the quarter, I would say it really is attributed to the discounting was down pretty significantly and you saw that coming through in the 3 points of price realization. And I would say that\u2019s particularly true for the ag business as we have talked about with construction, that continues to be actually the opposite story, that\u2019s the very challenged market from a competition perspective and a pricing perspective. With used pricing, I would say more of what we have said last quarter where we really have seen, I would say stabilization of that used pricing as we speak with dealers, much higher confidence as they are negotiating trade-ins, the value that they are able to put on that trade-in and what they feel they can accept. Keep in mind the challenge always on residual values is that\u2019s more about the wholesale perspective and the ability for dealers to purchase those \u2013 that used equipment coming off of lease and adding it to their used inventory level. So, we do continue to see some lower residual values on leasing and you saw that reflected in the results for the quarter. But again, I think the good news there is generally stabilization on that used equipment pricing.", "David Raso", "Okay. And if I can quickly ask, that SiteOne gain from last year, I believe you don\u2019t have any SiteOne gain in 2017 guidance. But given the secondary that\u2019s out there already, can you at least help us with assuming \u2013 can you give us some idea of the size of the gain essentially given where the stock is today versus May to calibrate there or is there any reason not to assume there is a gain, I guess, from the secondary?", "Raj Kalathur", "So David, there is a follow-on offering that SiteOne has come out with, but it\u2019s not in our forecast and that\u2019s probably all we can say about it. They are just doing for follow-on offering as one thing and actually doing it is the secondary thing. So, we don\u2019t want to talk about the probabilities of that.", "Tony Huegel", "And that will be updated \u2013 if and when it happens, it would be updated at that point in time.", "Raj Kalathur", "And it\u2019s not in our 2017 forecast right now.", "David Raso", "I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Tony Huegel", "Alright. Next caller. Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Fisher from UBS Securities. Your line is open.", "Steve Fisher", "Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the pricing question, so it sounds like things are nicely stabilizing in the ag business, allowing you to get that 3% with the lower discounting. Just kind of curious why isn\u2019t that sustainable into 2017 given that you are forecasting a more moderate pricing benefit in 2017 or are you assuming that there could be some upside to that as the year goes on?", "Tony Huegel", "Well, again, I think the thing I would point out keep in mind that\u2019s a quarter-over-quarter difference that you are comparing what happened in 2015 to what happened in 2016. And then so we certainly didn\u2019t see the increased level of incentive that we perhaps would often see in the fourth quarter didn\u2019t repeat in 2016. So again, I think as you go forward, we are still focused on seeing good positive price realization across equipment operations and you are seeing that reflected in the forecast. So candidly, we are still in very low end markets, especially as you think about large ag equipment and so the price realization is I think fairly attractive given that perspective. But it\u2019s really driven I would point out by our ability to continue to innovate. You are seeing that in our R&D spend and now you are seeing the benefit of that as we bring innovative new product out, we are able to then see that in the form of price realization. And so I think again, I think it\u2019s a pretty positive story overall. Thank you.", "Steve Fisher", "Thank you.", "Tony Huegel", "Next caller.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Ross Gilardi", "Yes, good morning. Yes, I was just wondering, can you guys just talk more about how your early order program kind of finished out or is looking now in sort of the backlog by region? And does your current order intake reflect the 15% increase that you are forecasting for South America?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes. So, as you think about orders and keep my early order program primarily relate to the U.S. and Canada on large ag equipment. You see it in limited form in some of the other parts of the world. As you think about the combine early order program, keep in mind, it\u2019s still in process. So, that actually ends in January. During the quarter, we would have ended our second phase of a multiphase program. I would tell you the order intake there was very supportive of the forecast in that regard. And again on large tractors, we continue to be pretty much in line slightly behind on the 8R tractors, if you think about availability year-over-year, but again, very supportive order position on the North American large ag versus our forecast. As you think about outside and I think maybe the most significant one is Brazil in South America and I think the question there that we talked about last quarter was, how much of that is simply pull ahead of that Tier 3 conversion that I mentioned previously. And we are seeing strength in the order book beyond the January 1 date and so that really is why we are reflecting that higher level of sales for the full fiscal year. Certainly, you will see some strength in the next couple of months, this month and December, ahead of that Tier 3. But our belief is what we are seeing in the order book that, that strength will continue beyond December 31. So, the short answer to your question on South America is yes, we are seeing it in the order book.", "Ross Gilardi", "Thanks, Tony.", "Tony Huegel", "Thank you. Next caller.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Wertheimer from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.", "Robert Wertheimer", "Yes, hi, good morning.", "Tony Huegel", "Hi, Rob.", "Robert Wertheimer", "Are you \u2013 now that we have finished out the year, you have noted in the past, obviously how the 100 plus horsepower category isn\u2019t really big farming tractors anymore stuff has crept in. Can you give us a sense of what your high horsepower 180 and above or whatever you want to do is versus maybe the 2002 trough or how far down we are from peak on the 180-hp revenues?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes. Again, we don\u2019t break out the inventory levels and give quite that much detail. I think what I \u2013 I think what is worth, pardon me?", "Robert Wertheimer", "Revenues \u2013 what production was in revenues for you guys versus the prior peak in trough?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes. Again, we don\u2019t guide on what those levels are by product type per se. But I think when you think about the levels that we are seeing from an inventory perspective specifically with that 100 plus, we did end the year with higher levels of 100 plus horsepower tractors. But as you point out, that was almost all below the 200 \u2013 220 horsepower, what we call large ag and really in that 6,000 series type of product. And you see that reflected in our lower receivables and inventory next year for the ag division. Much of that is kind of that midsized equipment getting pulled down further in 2017. And some of that candidly as we ended the year up higher than we would have liked on the 6,000 in particular. We talked a lot about that issue in the past. As you think about large ag equipment, as we expected, we are producing mostly the retail on large ag equipment as we go into 2017 and that\u2019s I think reflected in that sales outlook.", "Robert Wertheimer", "Okay. Thanks, Tony.", "Tony Huegel", "Okay, thank you. Appreciate it. Next caller.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mike Shlisky from Seaport Global securities LLC. Your line is open.", "Mike Shlisky", "Good morning, guys. A lot of questions here, but maybe I will just touch on turf and utility on my question. I think you said that it should be flat in 2017 with Deere outperforming. Can you just give us more color as to why you might outperform, is there a change in dealership networks or new products there or anything I should kind of point to there as to why you might be better than the industry in 2017?", "Tony Huegel", "Sure. I think probably the biggest category or biggest reason there is simply the new products that we have in the market and we would expect those to help continue to provide some market share. So, that would be the short answer. Alright, thank you.", "Mike Shlisky", "Thank you so much.", "Tony Huegel", "Next caller.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Tim Thein from Citigroup Global Markets. Your line is open.", "Tim Thein", "Thank you. Good morning. Tony, just want to come back to one of the headwinds you have cited for ag and turf being product mix. And I know you used to provide that in kind of the basis point term. But I am not sure you can do that now. But just kind of thinking through your comments with producing in line in large ag and not in small, Brazil being up nicely, both of which you think would be positive for mix. So, maybe just put a little bit more color around that your expectations for product mix? Thank you.", "Tony Huegel", "Right. Generally, when we have talked about large versus small, we have also pointed out small really combines midsize and utility. And so what you are seeing in some of that underproduction, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of that underproduction is coming of that midsized product, which again from a mix perspective would be a bit more negative. So, as you think about year-over-year strengths and weaknesses in the business, you are still seeing a fair level of weakness in some of that mid to large equipment at least year-over-year with continued strength in the smaller end of the portfolio. So, that\u2019s just from a product mix perspective and given where South American volumes are today, that geographic mix wouldn\u2019t be as attractive as what it would be if we were in more normal levels. So keep in mind, their production is significantly down as well and so that does put pressure there. So, it\u2019s kind of a combination of those things. Volume candidly though, year-over-year volume for ag and turf is the bigger headwind, there is some mix impact as well.", "Tim Thein", "Alright. Understood. Thank you.", "Tony Huegel", "Thank you. Next caller.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mig Dobre from Robert W. Baird & Company. Your line is open.", "Mig Dobre", "Yes, good morning everyone.", "Tony Huegel", "Hi, Mig.", "Mig Dobre", "A lot of questions already asked, but I am going to ask you a tax question, if you would. Have you formed some sort of a view or do you have any internal modeling as to how your tax rate might progress going forward if what Mr. Trump is proposing out there in terms of tax reform actually comes to be?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes. I am going to take that question and make it broader than just tax. And what I would tell you is the thing \u2013 the most important thing is anything that\u2019s being talked about in media and anywhere else is obviously speculation at this point in terms of what may or may not happen. And so certainly internally, we are evaluating different scenarios. So, the short answer to your question is the, of course, we are looking at what that impact may or may not be, but we are looking at all kinds of scenarios, because at the end of the day, we want to be prepared for whatever does become reality. But we are \u2013 at this point, it would be premature to talk about that publicly just because it would be pure speculation, so \u2013 but we do appreciate the question. Thanks. Next caller.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray & Company. Your line is open.", "Brett Wong", "Hi, thanks. Just wondering if you can talk to Europe a little bit since you haven\u2019t talked about that yet, I am just wondering kind of the drivers behind the 5% and what could indicate bottoming in the weaker dairy industry?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes. It certainly \u2013 Europe as you are well aware, it\u2019s always a mixed bag country by country in terms of where you maybe seeing some strength versus weakness. I will start with dairy though. I mean really what we are seeing there is in some of the dairy pricing, you are certainly starting to see some of that level \u2013 you see some periods where dairy pricing was up pretty nicely, but it\u2019s early. But again, I think that\u2019s what we characterize it as we did. There are signs that it\u2019s bottoming, that doesn\u2019t mean it bottomed or how soon things might recover, but that is a positive versus where we would have been even as early as last quarter incrementally in Europe. But if you think about more broadly, I mean clearly, I think maybe the two of the more noteworthy regions there, France, which is our largest market, went through a very difficult harvest and the harvest is down. Farm incomes are going to be lower. That\u2019s going to put pressure clearly on sales there, and coupled with that, as you are probably aware, there was a tax incentive program earlier in the year in France that did drive a lot of sales. And now while it\u2019s still in place, not a lot of income for those French farmers, so it\u2019s unlikely to have this anywhere near the type of advantages it did last year. So arguably, France would be a more challenged market. In the very short-term, I don\u2019t want to emphasize that, the concerns around Brexit and so on could \u2013 is expected to drive some benefit for the UK. You have seen exports of the used equipment become much more attractive with the FX shifts. And in the short-term we are likely to see some higher level of sales as most of those customers they are expecting that they still see some price increases as most manufacturers are importing into the UK. And so again, with the FX shift, that\u2019s likely to drive higher pricing and so they are buying ahead of that. So, there would be some benefit again in the short-term there. Longer term, obviously, that would likely have more downside than upside. So, I think those are maybe a couple of the more significant and especially when you throw the dairy commentary in the more significant pieces of Europe as you think about 2017. Thank you. Next caller.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Joel Tiss", "Alright. I made it.", "Tony Huegel", "Hi, Joel.", "Joel Tiss", "Hi, how is it going? I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about your produce \u2013 your production levels, because just trying to understand how the volumes of the factories are moving. How much you under-produced retail in 2016 and I know you said you are going to produce in line with 2017 just so we can get a little bit of a sense of the production changes underneath the covers there?", "Tony Huegel", "Sure. Yes, I think \u2013 as you know I would start with while certainly being able to produce to retail in some of those large ag factories is a benefit year-over-year. I would stress we are still at really low levels. We have talked before about capacity being below 50% in most of those \u2013 really across the board in the large ag facilities. That wouldn\u2019t change with the ability to build to retail. Because keep in mind, while we did draw field inventories down last year, it wasn\u2019t as significant of a drawdown as what we experienced for example in 2015. So again, you get benefit, but it\u2019s not like all of a sudden, those factories are running at highly efficient levels. So, I think that\u2019s probably the most important thing to keep in mind. We haven\u2019t talked about the level of specifically what the underproduction was last year. But I think again, you are seeing that reflected in the overall outlook. If you look at the sales, while most of our markets especially our largest market down 5 to 10 on a retail basis, you are seeing our sales reflecting a more positive trend than that. And I think that\u2019s part of that story. So, probably not much more I can say on that, but hopefully gives you a little bit of additional color.", "Joel Tiss", "Am I able to sneak another half a question in?", "Tony Huegel", "I think we are going to have to move on. There is a large number of people still in queue. Yes, sorry. Thank you.", "Joel Tiss", "Thanks very much.", "Tony Huegel", "Next caller.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners LLC. Your line is open.", "Joe O'Dea", "Hi, good morning.", "Tony Huegel", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe O'Dea", "Could you talk about the operating leases and when you see higher volumes rolling off lease in the fourth quarter, just what the experience was with where that equipment went, whether the farmers were leasing it, were then buying it? The dealers are absorbing it whether you took more of it than you normally do, but if we just think about that, is it proxy for dealing with higher volumes coming off lease moving forward?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes. I think in the quarter, we would have seen similar maybe slightly higher return rates. So, it wasn\u2019t a major shift towards customers or dealers keeping that equipment. So that kind of continued. But again, that\u2019s all factored in. Any of those shifts would have been factored into the impairment and loss in anticipation or charge that we would have taken in the quarter as we have through most of 2016. We continue to look out over the next 12 months at our lease maturities and based on more recent activity both the return rate and loss rate would book, what we think is an appropriate impairment on some of those future maturities. So, again, we would have \u2013 I think the key there is we would have reflected that already at least for the next 12 months in that outlook.", "Joe O'Dea", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Tony Huegel", "Okay, thank you. Next caller.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is open.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Yes, thanks. Good morning.", "Tony Huegel", "Hi, Nicole.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Hi. So, just a question around C&F, some of your peers have talked about channel inventory still being too high and needing to work those down at the dealer level for the next several quarters. I am just curious how you view your current dealer inventory levels within the construction business?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, to appreciate that question, we \u2013 as you saw really in our numbers for receivables and inventory last year, our dealers drew their inventory level down pretty dramatically in \u201816. As a result, while we are still on an inventory and receivable level bringing C&F down further, that\u2019s almost all inventory for C&F. There is very little receivable reduction in that division and it\u2019s really just reflective from a new equipment perspective, we think our dealers are in very good shape. Now, the good news there is if we ever do start seeing more positive trends in that market for us, I think we would be in a position where dealers would likely need to add to their inventory from current levels. So again, I think that\u2019s reflective of the good work the division and our dealers did in 2016 that we are able to put that type of forecast for sales in 2017.", "Nicole DeBlase", "And is it a similar dynamic on used inventory?", "Tony Huegel", "No. Used continues to be \u2013 and that\u2019s one of the drags we would continue to point to. I think Josh pointed out in the opening comments. Used continues to be one of those kind of weights or headwinds for that market. Certainly, our dealers aren\u2019t \u2013 we would argue probably in a little better shape than much of the competition, but again, that\u2019s a little harder to gauge as well, but certainly broadly for that market will continue to be a headwind.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Okay, thanks.", "Tony Huegel", "Thank you. Next caller.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies LLC. Your line is open. Can you recheck your phone Mr. Volkmann?", "Stephen Volkmann", "Sorry about that.", "Tony Huegel", "There we go, okay.", "Operator", "The next question comes \u2013 sorry\u2026", "Tony Huegel", "We got it, yes.", "Stephen Volkmann", "So, just a question about how to think about your forecasting ability, I mean, obviously, a quarter ago, you kind of gave us an idea of the full year. We backed into the fourth quarter, which you then beat handily. And normally, I feel like you guys have kind of good visibility quarter out and things don\u2019t change too markedly. And I am just trying to figure out if that\u2019s changed or if you are maybe being conservative last quarter or just how I should think about your visibility relative to history?", "Tony Huegel", "And I am assuming that question is mostly targeted towards ag since that was the division that really had a pretty strong beat in the quarter. I would tell you from a sales perspective clearly, our sales were higher. Pricing again was the incentive spend just wasn\u2019t as high in the quarter. So, that was a big part of the \u2013 most of the beat. But as you think about even on a volume basis, we did see kind of broadly some better sales levels. So, it didn\u2019t come from all U.S. and Canada. It didn\u2019t come even to the extent that there was increases in U.S. and Canada, it was broadly across a number of products. So, it would be difficult for us to even call out unless we put a very long list together where that sales increase came from. And sometimes, we will have quarters where unfortunately everything kind of moves against us. And we have a lot of little things that add up to a big negative. This happens to be a quarter where we have a lot of little things that were positive that all added up to a pretty nice advantage for us.", "Raj Kalathur", "Steve, to add to Tony\u2019s comments, the price and discounts we talked about was beat, and then you also talked about higher volumes and then higher volumes coming from regions 4, 3 and 2 and region 4, multiple units, now had little bit higher volume and then better mix than we had anticipated, lower overhead spending, lower material costs, lower R&D, structural cost reductions beginning to pay off a little earlier. So, all those things added to our beat in the Q4.", "Stephen Volkmann", "Great. I appreciate that. Thanks.", "Tony Huegel", "Thank you.

Your line is open.", "Seth Weber", "And happy Thanksgiving.", "Tony Huegel", "Thanks, Seth.", "Seth Weber", "Most of the questions have been asked. Just a real kind of housekeeping, is there any color on the impairment charge that you took in the quarter, the $25 million, is there anything you can anymore details you can give us on that?", "Tony Huegel", "The only other thing and you will see it certainly in the \u2013 when we release the K that it\u2019s almost \u2013 we talked about it being international. It really relates to both our Chinese operations as well as the joint venture in Brazil. It\u2019s roughly half and half.", "Raj Kalathur", "C&F.", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, for C&F. So again, yes, so, it\u2019s about $13 million related to C&F China \u2013 operations in China and then about $12 million related to the joint venture in Brazil.

Thanks for squeezing me in and happy early Thanksgiving.", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, thank you.", "Adam Uhlman", "I am wondering, Raj, you had mentioned in your remarks that you \u2013 that there had been some changes to the compensation plans I believe if I didn\u2019t really hear that out. I was wondering if you could expand on how you are changing the incentives at the company and what that means for 2017 as well?", "Raj Kalathur", "Yes. So, this is for the short-term incentive. At trough, we had a maximum payout at 13% operating \u2013 return on operating assets that went up to 16% now. So, that\u2019s specifically what I was referring to.", "Tony Huegel", "And then keep in mind, we did increase historically \u2013 that would have been 12% last year for 2016, it went to 13% for 2017, we are bumping that up yet again to 16%.

Net sales were down 25% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in all regions of the world, but the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes of large Ag equipment in the United States and Canada.", "Brazil accounted for most of the lower sales outside the US and Canada. Also hurting sales was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange. Operating profit was $271 million. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, a less favorable product mix, and foreign currency exchange, partially offset by price realization, lower selling administrative and general expenses, and lower production costs.", "The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 27% and 30% for the full year. Quite respectable considering that worldwide large Ag sales were down approximately 35% for the year. Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the Ag business.", "Slide 6 outlines US farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and consequently the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 8% from 2014s peak levels. Moving to 2016, we expect total cash receipts to be about $394 billion, roughly flat with this year.", "On slide 7, global grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels, even after the abundant harvest of the past two years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong, while supplies are now fully adequate.", "Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world, as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could result in prices quickly moving higher.", "Slide 8 highlights the awards John Deere earned at Agritechnica, the world's largest agricultural equipment fair earlier this month. Acknowledging Deere's ongoing research and development efforts, the innovation committee of the German agricultural society recognized innovations from John Deere and partner companies with 3 gold and 10 silver medals.", "It was the most gold and most silver medals ever awarded to one company. In addition during the show, the Waterloo-built 8R Series tractors were named Machine of the Year 2016 by a German publishing house.", "Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on slide 9. Economic growth is gradually improving in the region. Farm income is below long-term averages and remains under pressure. Also, weakness continues in the dairy sector. As a result, industry farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be flat to down 5% in 2016.", "On slide 10, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, the governments continued investment in equipment subsidies and mechanization is supportive of agriculture. However, the economic slowdown there and lower commodity prices have lead to a decrease in the industry sales forecast", "Turning to India, positive consumer and investor sentiment are encouraging economic growth. While the government continues to support agriculture, two consecutive below normal monsoon seasons have taken a toll on the farm sector.", "Shifting to Brazil. Slide 11 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2016 in US dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices.", "However, the situation is more positive in local currency due to the sharp devaluation of the real. That's because Brazilian farmers sell their crops in dollars helping to keep profitability at good levels.", "Although Ag fundamentals remain positive, farmer confidence is lower due to uncertainty over government sponsored financing programs, as well as economic and political concerns, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales.", "Looking beyond these immediate concerns, however, long-term fundamentals for the Ag business in Brazil remain solid. Our 2016 Ag & Turf industry outlook are summarized on slide 12.", "Industry sales in the US and Canada are forecast to be down 15% to 20% with large Ag sales down 25% to 30%. Low commodity prices and stagnant farm incomes are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, with the decline being most pronounced in the sale of high horsepower models.", "As mentioned previously, the EU 28 industry outlook is forecast to be flat to down 5% in 2016 due to low crop prices and farm incomes, as well as pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be down 10% to 15% in 2016. A reflection of the factors already discussed. Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be flat to down slightly, due in part to weakness in China.", "Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the US and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, benefiting from general economic growth.", "Putting this altogether on slide 13. Fiscal Year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are forecast to be down about 8% including about two points of negative currency translation.", "The Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016, due to lower shipment volumes, a less favorable product mix, and a negative impact of foreign currency.", "Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on slide 14. Net sales were down 32% in the quarter and operating profit was down 72% due to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency. The division\u2019s decremental margin was 27% in the quarter and 19% for the full year.", "Moving to slide 15. Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, GDP growth is positive. Construction spending is increasing, and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year. And yet in spite of these encouraging signs, we are seeing weakness in our order books year-over-year.", "Contributing factors are weak conditions in the energy sector and energy producing regions, especially in Canada. We're also seeing a decline in rental utilization rates, sluggish economic growth outside the United States, and importantly, the mix of housing starts in the US skewing to multi-family homes, therefore reducing demand for earth moving equipment.", "As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are forecast to be down about 5% in 2016. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about one point. Global forestry markets are expected to be down 5% to 10% from the strong levels we've experienced the last several years, primarily as a result of lower sales in the United States and Canada. C&F\u2019s full year operating margins is projected to be about 8%.", "Let's move now to our financial services operations. Slide 16 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio at the end of the year was 13 basis points. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios.", "The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 19 basis points. Even so, losses would remain below the 10 year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15 year average of 39 basis points.", "Moving to slide 17, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $153 million in the fourth quarter versus $172 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange translation and higher losses on residual values, primarily for construction equipment operating leases.", "These factors were partially offset by lower selling, administrative and general expenses. 2015 net income attributable to Deere & Company was $633 million, an all-time record high for John Deere Financial.", "The 2016 forecast is about $550 million. The outlook reflects less favorable financing spreads and an increased provision for credit losses. Also remember that 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of our crop insurance business of about $30 million.", "Before we leave financial services, especially with all of the questions we've been getting over leasing. Let's take a closer look at the portfolio composition as shown on slide 18. At 31 October 2015, operating leases made up 13% of the portfolio, up two points compared to a year earlier.", "The vast majority of the impairment charge taken in the quarter was on a handful of construction equipment models. JDF has not been encouraging customers to utilize leases in general or short term leases specifically through pricing or residual values.", "Leasing, however, is becoming more attractive to many of our customers. That's because of an uncertain business environment, coupled with the lack of confidence and clarity in tax incentives.", "Meeting our customers financing preferences continues to be our top priority. We monitor the leasing portfolio daily, taking necessary actions to mitigate risk and expect to continue to see strength in our used equipment values.", "Slide 19 outlines receivables in inventories. For the company as a whole receivables and inventories ended the year down $619 million. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables in inventory down about $650 million.", "Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percentage of net sales as shown on slide 20 is about 79%. When modeling 2016 keep these unfavorable impacts in mind. Tier 4 product costs, overhead spend and an unfavorable mix of product.", "On the favorable side we expect price realization of about two points, lower pension and OPEB expense and to a lesser extent favorable raw material costs.", "Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on slide 21, R&D was down 2% in the fourth quarter and full year, including about three points of negative currency translation in each period. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3%.", "Moving now to slide 22. SA&G expense for equipment operations was down 17% in the fourth quarter with currency translation and incentive compensation accounting for about 12 points of the change.", "Our 2016 forecast shown on slide 23, contemplates SA&G expense being down about 1% with currency translation accounting for about two points of the change, so essentially flat in comparison to 2015.", "Turning to slide 24, pension and OPEB ex pen was up $20 million for the quarter and up $80 million for the full year. Pension and OPEB expense is forecast to be down about $200 million in 2016 due to the fact that we are adopting a change in the measurement of service and interest costs, known as the spot yield curve approach.", "On slide 25, the equipment operations tax rate was 14% in the quarter and 28% for the full year. The lower rate resulted mainly from a reduction of a valuation allowance recorded during the quarter due to a change in the expected realizable value of a deferred tax asset. For 2016, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.", "Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations was approximately $3.1 billion in 2015 and is forecast to be about $2.6 billion in 2016.", "Slide 27 outlines our use of cash priorities which are unchanged and familiar to many of you. Our number one priority is to manage the balance sheet, including liquidity to support a rating that provides access to low cost and readily available short and long-term funding. Thus, Deere is firmly committed to it\u2019s A rating.", "Our second use of cash priority is funding value creating investments in our operations, mostly relating to CapEx and R&D spending, but also acquisitions. Our third priority is to provide for the common stock dividend, which has been raised 114% since 2010.", "Over time, we want to consistently deliver a series of moderately increased dividends, while targeting at mid cycle earnings, a 25% to 35% payout ratio on average. In this regard, we are mindful of the importance of maintaining the dividend and not raising it beyond a point that can be sustained by our cash flow throughout the cycle.", "Share repurchase is are preferred method of deploying excess cash, once the previous requirements are met, so long as such repurchase is value enhancing. Since 2004 Deere has repurchased about 242 million shares, resulting in a net share reduction of 36%.", "Cumulatively from 2004 to 2015, we have returned about 65% of cash from the equipment operations to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "The 2016 outlook for the first quarter and full year is on slide 28. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 11% compared with 2015. This includes about two points of price realization and about four points of unfavorable currency translation.", "The full year forecast calls for net sales to be down about 7%. Price realization and currency translation will offset one another with each expected to be about two points.", "Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is about $1.4 billion.", "I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Raj Kalathur.", "Raj Kalathur", "Thanks, Susan. Thanks, everyone for participating in the call today. In closing, I'd like to summarize a few things, and also reiterate a few things that Susan mentioned about Deere's recent performance and the current Ag downturn.", "We have faced 2 years of lower equipment sales in 2014 and 2015. We are forecasting a third year of decline in 2016. Industry sales of large Ag equipment in North America have declined by more than 60% over this time, again its large Ag in North America industry, relative to the 2016 forecast, okay. This is 2013 to 2016 end.", "And in addition, all key Ag markets around the world and construction equipment markets in the Americas were down in 2015. Even with such a steep industry pullback, our businesses have remained solidly profitable, delivering respectable decremental margin of 30% in 2015. Now we also expect to be solidly profitable 2016 as well.", "Now we also expect to continue generating strong cash flow. Last year, Deere delivered third highest ever level of cash flow from operations and we are forecasting a very healthy level of cash flow of over $2.5 billion in 2016.", "Our actions and proactively controlling expenses, costs, and managing assets have enabled us to deliver substantially better results than in any of the past downturns, at the same time, I should stress that the trends that hold so much promise for John Deere's future.", "The ones we have told you about in the past, based on population growth, rise in living standards and increasing urbanization, they haven't gone away. They are still quite compelling in our view and have ample staying power.", "In fact, the demand for grain has continued to grow and the supply, demand balance is even closer now than last year. That's in spite of record production in some cases, corn as an example, recall that earlier this year, in the summer, corn prices shot up to $4.50 over worries about the weather in the US Corn Belt.", "All-in all then, we believe John Deere can continue to earn solid returns even in a weak farm economy, deliver financial performance, much improved over downturns in the past and longer term see substantial benefits from the world's growing need for advanced equipment and technology solutions.", "Tony Huegel", "Thank, Raj. Now we're ready to begin the Q & A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. In consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Carlos?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be coming from the line of Mr. Tim Thein from Citigroup Global Markets Incorporated. Your line is now open.", "Tim Thein", "Thank you, good morning. Just a question on the production in terms of the split between large versus small Ag. Just within the overall context of the projected $425 million of channel inventory reduction here in '16.", "Can you just kind of give us a sense in terms of just that comment, that split breaks out and even if it's just kind of directionally, again between large versus small Ag? Thank you.", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, and that's an important part to understand as you think about the reduction and receivables in inventory this year and really in context of last year, as well, because when I'll talk first about small Ag, because in the case of small Ag we were actually increasing as part of our strategy and the growth we were seeing in that business, we were increasing our inventory in receivables on that part of the business.", "So it did mute on our reported numbers the impact of the reductions that were being taken in our large Ag product. On top of the large reductions we took in 2014. So as you look at 2016, what you're seeing again is some reduction in small Ag, but you're also seeing some additional reduction in large Ag relative to the lower markets that we're anticipating in 2016.", "But I think maybe where you were going with this is, production versus retail, last year we talked a lot about under producing retail. This year there will be some of that, but not nearly to the same level.", "So we are getting some advantage in 2016 from all of the work that took place in both 2014 and 2015 and able to produce much closer to retail than what we have in the past couple years.", "Tim Thein", "Okay.", "Raj Kalathur", "Next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now open, sir.", "Steve Volkmann", "Excuse me, good morning and thanks for the question. I guess I'm just going to ask about your forecast relative to Ag & Turf being down about 8%, but you have North America down 15% or 20% and so forth.", "It just feels to me like you must be assuming some market share growth or something other than - the numbers just don't quite seem to add up for me. So any of your thinking there would be great? Thanks.", "Tony Huegel", "And it really kind of goes in concert with the last question of it, as well, because keep in mind that the guidance that we're providing is on industry sales and that's more volume based industry sales.", "So as we get some advantage year-over-year, part of that difference that you're seeing is that last year in addition to the lower retail environment we were under producing, under shipping that lower retail environment.", "This year we're - especially on large Ag we're actually able to ship much closer to that retail environment. We also have the advantage this year again of pricing, that would be the other major contributor in the sales.", "Raj Kalathur", "And Steve, one other thing is industry guidance is for the whole goods, okay. So service parts now is a higher percent of our business and it is not down, okay? So - and other than the Americas, other markets are not down as much. So those - if you put all those together, I think you'll get the right answer.", "Steve Volkmann", "Thanks, Raj.", "Tony Huegel", "Next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Joe O\u2019Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open, sir.", "Joe O\u2019Dea", "Hi, good morning. Last quarter you had talked a little bit too early indications of things getting better in Europe. It seemed like registration data over the last couple of months maybe showed some softening there.", "So if you could just talk about in general what's kind of trended in Europe over the past few months? How that maybe influences your outlook there and any details by country you're able to provide?", "Tony Huegel", "Yeah, last year, or last quarter, and I think we had sufficient hedge around that statement of things starting to show early signs. And I think this is why in the sense that one of the anticipations there was around dairy, at that time many were anticipating that the weakness in dairy would begin to moderate, as you moved into 2016, and that isn't happening at this point.", "So it appears that we'll continue to have some weakness in the dairy market, as an example as we go well into 2016. And that's a significant part of the business in Europe. So I think that is probably the biggest difference.", "And Susan pointed out in the opening comments. We are still seeing some positive trends in the overall economic environment. We would stress there certainly as we point to in our slides, there's still some risks there, and so we'll see if that continues to progress. But we did see a little bit of weaker markets that have been what we hoped to see as we move into 2016. Next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.", "Andy Casey", "Thanks a lot. And good morning.", "Tony Huegel", "Hello.", "Andy Casey", "Hi. Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.", "Tony Huegel", "Thank you. You too.", "Andy Casey", "Thanks. So a question on the margin. If I work through all of the puts and takes, it's about a 5% operating margin outlook for 2016 even - and you've embedded about $200 million benefit of lower pension expense or about an 80 basis point margin cushion. If I take that pension benefit out, it looks like your implied decremental margin is somewhere around 40%.", "I'm just wondering why do you expect that to deteriorate from the reported 30% in 2015, especially given the lower gap between production retail for large Ag in the US and higher after market?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, and certainly we would agree, as you take out the pension and OPEB benefit you get closer to 40, just under - just below that. And I think we talked about this really on the last call is you look at large Ag, it is still down year-over-year.", "Now we're getting some benefit, so it's not down as much as maybe the retail environment is, but the production is down year-over-year and is the major contributor from an agricultural perspective is the major contributor to the lower sales would still be large Ag.", "And so when you put that in perspective of where we've been from a capacity perspective, last year we talked about being at about 50% of capacity in most of our large Ag facilities, and now we're further down from that closer to 60%. So we're pushing 40% of capacity in some of these facilities. And so the headwinds just get very, very challenging in that type of an environment.", "And I'd point out, while the near 40% decremental margins may not be as appealing, as the 30% of 2015, relative to what we were able to do historically, that 40% is very, very impressive, especially in light of where we're at within the end market.", "So you're right, but in the sense that it has grown year-over-year, but certainly is still from a historic basis, pretty attractive.", "Andy Casey", "Okay. Thank you.", "Tony Huegel", "Thank you. Next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Jamie Cook", "Hi, good morning.", "Tony Huegel", "Hi, Jamie.", "Jamie Cook", "I guess just some color I mean, because there is a lot of concerns out there, if you guys could just comment, it sounds like you've made head way, but comment on sort of Deere's used inventory levels in pricing and what you're seeing relative to I guess the competition?", "Tony Huegel", "Sure. You know as you think about used equipment and I'll start with it's still a challenge, especially on large tractors. We would continue to say there is more large row crop tractors in used row crop tractors in the market in the US and Canada than we would prefer.", "So it does continue to be a focus of ours, as we go through 2016. But we are making progress, so we are seeing that large Ag inventory coming down. In fact if you look at the high point in 2014, we're down about 18% from that point. So again, making progress.", "The good news there too is our resale values are holding in quite well. We talked last quarter about if you look over a 2 year kind of horizon, down a small single digit, I'd tell you those used pricing continues - the used pricing continues to remain very steady at those levels and versus competition we're maintaining a very healthy premium.", "And certainly from both an inventory and pricing perspective, when you put it in context of where our competition is we're in a much more favorable position. So there is some good news, but again, stress that that is a continued focus of ours in 2016.", "Jamie Cook", "Is there a higher level of confidence you can rectify the situation by, I mean, we are hoping we would be finished with this in '15. Do you think it could go past another year in terms of being where you want to be?", "Tony Huegel", "You know the challenge there is always around what happens in the end markets. And so certainly, our goal and the goals that we set with our dealers would be to get that used inventory in line.", "But it is not an easy process, especially in the sense that we're wanting to balance that inventory reduction with maintaining those strong values. So those two goals are in conflict, obviously with one another and we're trying to strike that balance and have done so pretty well to date. So with that, we'll have to move on to the next caller.", "Jamie Cook", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my questions are on the early order program, I'm just curious if you guys can comment on what you've seen so far and then also just what you're seeing in Europe from an order perspective?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, you know with the early order program, normally we tend to talk about year-over-year kind of changes and it is very difficult because again, this year we've made some changes in that, in some of the structures.", "For example, the combines, some of the discount levels were different year-over-year, those sorts of things. But generally, I think you're seeing reflected in our outlook for large Ag, we're seeing those early order programs come in much weaker again from where we were last year.", "And so what I would say is the outlook that we have is consistent with what we're seeing both in the early order programs, and on the seasonal equipment, as well as what we're seeing in our tractor order book, as well.", "And I think you're aware with Europe, we don't have as - our order book isn't as full. It isn't as extended as it tends to be in the US. And so it's a little harder to gauge the market the coming year.", "But I think what you're seeing in our outlook again is reflective of what we're seeing in the order book, that down a bit from where we were a year ago and that's where we landed on the current guidance in Europe of flat to down 5%.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Okay. Thanks, Tony. Happy, Thanksgiving.", "Tony Huegel", "Thanks. You too. Next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Ms. Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Ann Duignan", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Tony Huegel", "Hi, Ann.", "Ann Duignan", "Can we focus on the fundamentals for this question, just your outlook for the cash receipts for 2016, just quickly confirm that that is a calendar year outlook, not a marketing year.", "And then the real question is that would then include an outlook for '16 and '17, at least for planting in the US. Can you talk about what your outlook is for major crop planting in '16, '17 in the US.", "And then have you contemplated in that what's happening right now in Argentina and what might happen in Brazil, just given currency and what those farmers might want to do. I am just trying to get a sense of how you came up with the cash receipts for '16?", "Tony Huegel", "So which of those four questions would you like me to answer?", "Ann Duignan", "How you arrived at the '16 outlook for cash receipts?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, certainly the '16 cash receipts number is to your point, it is a calendar number, so it does reflect a bit at the tail end of 2016, relative to what we would anticipate for next years crop year.", "We have not at this point disclosed acres and so on for next year\u2019s crop. I don't think we certainly don't anticipate a significant decrease in the acres planted. And think I'll follow up a little bit on the last question you had though, because I think the situation in Argentina with the elections over last weekend could have some impact on that.", "I think that the challenge there it is very premature and a lot depends on how quickly some of these promised changes may occur in terms of both planting and situation in Argentina and then what impact that could have on the northern hemisphere in the US and Canada.", "So there is still time for Argentina farmers to shift and plant more corn acres. Planting so far has been running behind and the expectation has been lower acres in this current year. But that could change and certainly could then impact the pricing outlook for farmers here in the US and Canada.", "But again it would be fairly marginal and short term. And I think the similarly with soybeans it will - we'll just have to wait and see how quickly things happen and in terms of any changes and what impact that has on some of those pricing.", "Now I think to be fair, much of that I think was speculated and priced into current commodity prices in terms of the anticipation of this win and what that might have for exports coming out of Argentina. Right, with that let's go ahead and move on to the next call. Thanks, Ann.", "Ann Duignan", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Ross Gilardi from Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Ross Gilardi", "Hi, good morning.", "Tony Huegel", "Hi, Ross.", "Ross Gilardi", "Tony, could you just give us a little more color on how you formulated the South America industry guide? I mean, certainly you're running - run rate is down more than 10% to 15% and you got the uncertainties around tsunami and so forth.", "I mean, do you really have any visibility on what that market is going to do this year or is that just sort of like we're down a lot, we're going to continue to be down double-digit. But I would think that it\u2019s just very, very difficult to quantify the magnitude of the decline next year for South America?", "Tony Huegel", "I think maybe the way I'd answer that is, certainly when you think about risk and uncertainty, there is a lot of uncertainty in South America and I would say in Brazil specifically.", "Now that uncertainty swings both ways, right? And so there's a possibility things could end up better than this current outlook too, but as you think about it similar to, and we say about any region outside the US and Canada. Our visibility from an order book perspective is strongest in the US and Canada, especially on large Ag and lesser in other markets.", "So you certainly have uncertainty around tsunami, while the expectation is Motor Frota [ph] will come back around the first of December, that's what it's scheduled to do and anticipated to stay in place. There's always uncertainty, certainly around that. And then over the general economy, there's a lot of uncertainty that continues to exist there.", "Again the good news with Brazil is because of the FX rate and the fact that those farmers do sell in US dollars and then when you convert into local currency, profitability for farmers and cash receipts and local currency have remained very strong.", "And so we have under this weakness that we've experienced in '15 and '16 within forecast for '16 in the equipment sales is a farmer base that financially again is pretty strong. So if anything shifts in some of that uncertainty is removed from the market, there is certainly some potential for those farmers to step back in as well.", "So again, I think your point is well taken in the sense that there is a lot of uncertainty in South America, Brazil in particular. We'll see how that develops as we go through the year.", "Ross Gilardi", "Thanks, Tony.", "Tony Huegel", "Thank you. Next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.", "David Raso", "Hi, good morning. Thank you.", "Tony Huegel", "David. You still there? David?", "Operator", "We will be going and getting his line, sir. One moment please.", "Tony Huegel", "Let's go ahead and move on to the next caller and we'll come back to David after if we can get him back on?", "Operator", "Sure. Our next question will be coming from Mike Shlisky from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open, sir.", "Mike Shlisky", "Good morning, guys.", "Tony Huegel", "Hello.", "Mike Shlisky", "Good morning, guys. Are you there?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, we're here.", "Mike Shlisky", "Okay, great. Maybe we could touch briefly on seeing [ph] headlines on the used market in Europe actually over the last couple of months. Are you seeing headwinds there other than of the same magnitude you're seeing here in the United States or is it a little bit more in line over there than we're seeing elsewhere?", "Tony Huegel", "When you think about used equipment, I'll split it a little bit. In the UK, certainly we're seeing some increased levels of used equipment and that's really coming from the - again it's FX driven.", "So the Euro has been impacted more than the British pound and a lot of the used equipment from the UK goes to Europe and into Euro based countries. And so obviously, now with that shift in FX, it is creating more challenge for the export of that used equipment out of the UK.", "Outside of that used equipment is not a significant issue in Europe, but it is one that we're working through in the UK.", "Mike Shlisky", "Super, thanks.", "Tony Huegel", "Thank you. Next caller? Next caller? Carlos?", "Operator", "The next question will be coming from David Raso from Evercore. Your line is open, sir.", "David Raso", "Hi. Thank you very much.", "Tony Huegel", "Sorry about that David.", "David Raso", "No worries. First a clarification on the answer on the order book. Tony, did you say the order book currently is down year-over-year at the same rate as you're guiding the market or is that a generic consistent with how you're guiding the market?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, the order book, our outlook is consistent with what we're seeing in our order books.", "David Raso", "So is it fair to say the orders are currently below that, but as the year goes on the comps get easier? I mean, is that how we're just\u2026", "Tony Huegel", "Well, keep in mind with most of our large Ag equipment remember we're looking at the full year in that anticipation, and again most of those again with the early order programs in particular, you're looking at full year production.", "David Raso", "Okay. And in that forecast is there any period in the year where sales get back to flat? I'm just trying to understand how you're laying this out, just so we understand the improvement in the second half year-over-year at a minimum?", "Tony Huegel", "Well again, that - we would have to get into the detail of product by product in terms of how that lays out in terms of the order books. But again, to your point, you get a little bit easier comp as you go through the back half of the year.", "David Raso", "Okay. My real question, just the targeted dealer inventory changes for the year, can you give us some bogey how you're thinking about dealer inventory changes new and used for the full year and I guess it's more of a North American question?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes. As you think about the inventory, again that's going to be almost all new inventory that you're seeing in our numbers, because the used inventory even if it's financed within John Deere Financial that wouldn't get picked up and in our\u2026", "David Raso", "I understand. Let me just interrupt [ph] the plays, as you view the business, the whole channel obviously all feeds together\u2026", "Tony Huegel", "But the question is around receivables and inventory, certainly when the guidance we're providing on receivables and inventory is on \u2013 is to the extended dealer receivables, that would be new inventory at our dealers.", "David Raso", "I understand that.", "Tony Huegel", "And then of course you have in addition to that, you have work going on that wouldn't be reflected in that number with lower used inventories as well.", "David Raso", "And what is that target that was my question?", "Tony Huegel", "That\u2019s again, we're - that's not a number we've provided in the past. So that's more detail than we're going to be able to provide at this point.", "David Raso", "All right, thank you. I appreciate it.", "Tony Huegel", "Okay. Thank you. Next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Research. Your line is now open.", "Eli Lustgarten", "Good morning, everyone, Happy Holidays.", "Tony Huegel", "Hi, Eli.", "Eli Lustgarten", "Can we talk a little bit about your 2% pricing assumption for the year and talk between the two product lines and regionally and how it breaks down, particularly when you had trouble getting 1% in the past year and the market is weaker and obviously, cost is still down, raw material costs.", "So can we talk a little bit about what's behind the 2% assumption and the probability you think you will stick?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes. Keep in mind that 2% and we don't provide the guidance by line of business or by geography. But I would tell you that both divisions are contributing to that two points and again it's not net of price realization. That's when we talk about price realization or not net of costs. That's looking at year-over-year our pricing and not factoring in what's going on with raw materials.", "What I will also point out is similar to last year, the one point that we recognized in 2015, remember these are rounded numbers, rounded down to 1%, so we were a little over one. And the flip side of that is the 2016 initial outlook is rounding up. And so we're slightly below that 2% price realization. So outside of that there's really not much more I can speak to in that. So we'll move on to the next caller thanks Eli.", "Eli Lustgarten", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is now open.", "Steven Fisher", "Thanks, good morning. Really just want to come back to the question on inventory in the channel and just really to make sure I understand what your messaging is around there. Because it sounds like you said you're going to be producing pretty close to retail, maybe a little bit below on the large Ag. But you said you're also taking inventory out.", "So just trying to really understand what your message is around where you think inventories new and used are in the channel relative to what they should be given the environment that we're in.", "Have we gotten through everything we need to get through and now you feel comfortable with where things are?", "Tony Huegel", "So as you think about, and let me talk about large Ag specifically, because I think that's where most of the questions are targeted at is what's going on with large Ag inventory. As you think about 2016, there will still be some reduction of large Ag field inventory, so dealer receivables in 2016.", "That's in line with and reflective of the lower end markets that we're seeing as we move from 2015 to 2016. So what we did in 2015 was right size that inventory, based on what we saw in the end markets in 2015.", "So there is some additional reduction again in 2016. But when you look at the year-over-year reductions it's much less, again for large Ag it's much less than what we would have seen in 2015.", "So what I was saying earlier is as you think about our shipments to retail, we under shipped retail last year, we will under ship a bit this year, but that level of under shipping is much less in 2016 versus 2015.", "Steven Fisher", "And on the small equipment side?", "Tony Huegel", "Small equipment is just the opposite. We over shipped last year, so we build inventory again as planned, relative both to the strength of the market, as well as our strategy around some market share gains and so on.", "And in 2016 you'll see some further, you'll see some reduction off of those levels as we go through 2016 and get those shifted around a bit. So that's distorting when you look at the reported numbers, distorting a bit of \u2013 of I think what most are focusing on in terms of what's going on with large Ag. So\u2026", "Steven Fisher", "Okay.", "Tony Huegel", "All right. Let's move on to the next caller? Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Jerry Revich", "Good morning. And happy Thanksgiving, everyone.", "Tony Huegel", "Happy, Thanksgiving.", "Jerry Revich", "Tony, can you talk about your pool of funds program, where did the pool of funds directionally stand at year end '15 versus the past couple of years. And based on what you're hearing from dealers the direction that you expect them to apply the pool of funds going forward compared to what we've seen over the past year, any shift in mix between pushing used equipment sales versus conquest customers, any color you could share would be helpful?", "Tony Huegel", "Yes, so as you think about pool of funds, actually they remain at pretty high levels and actually we tell you we ended the year with pool of funds at the highest level in 2 years. So they are still very strong. And the real question I think gets to dealer-by-dealer. So that's when you think about it in an aggregate.", "And certainly, there is some dealers that have very high used inventory and have lower levels of pool of funds. So on a dealer-by-dealer basis which is how we tend to manage it internally, you know, that we'd have a few challenges here and there for sure.", "In terms of how they are using it again, I think that's consistent with what we're looking at. Its pool of funds are there to move used equipment and help incent that used equipment.", "We'll continue to do that as we move through 2016. It's one of the lever that our dealers have available to them to get again especially on those large row crop tractors get that used inventory down. So, all right, with that let's go ahead and move to the next call. Thanks, Jerry.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Chad Dillard", "Hi. This is Chad Dillard on for Vishal.", "Tony Huegel", "Hi, Chad.", "Chad Dillard", "Can you just talk about how much of your agriculture order books is covered for 2016 and how that compared versus the time last year in 2015. And then also in your currency, in your guidance, is that spot or is that actually a forecast?", "Tony Huegel", "So if you think about again our order books, what I would tell you is we don't disclose what percent is covered, but again it would be comparable year-over-year, that's how we \u2013 its really how we set the outlook is based on what kind of coverage we would have. So it would be comparable year-over-year.", "And with the - we don't forecast FX. What we would use is the average FX in the month prior to the guidance. So it would be - and in fact for original budget we would have used the, I think, which was it?", "Raj Kalathur", "September.", "Tony Huegel", "September. Yes, so we would have used the average September rate is what's implied in our forecast.", "Chad Dillard", "Okay.", "Tony Huegel", "Okay. Next caller?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open, sir.", "Tony Huegel", "Hey, Seth.", "Seth Weber", "Hello?", "Tony Huegel", "Are you there, all right.", "Seth Weber", "Hi, sorry. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the construction business. Kind of the way we're coming out of the blocks here off the fourth quarter and relative to your full year guide of only down 5%.", "I mean, are you assuming that the construction business turns positive in the back half of the year and what would be driving that confidence I guess?", "Tony Huegel", "Well, I think the bigger issue is certainly as you look at year-over-year sales, it certainly improves as we go through the year, simply because the comp gets easier. And so you'll see greater weakness year-over-year in the first half versus what you would see in the back half. But again it's more about the easier comp than it is about a strong return to the market at this point.", "Seth Weber", "Right. But is it - but that's the trajectory you're thinking of is that the second half comps are actually positive for construction & forestry?", "Tony Huegel", "Second half is up, correct.", "Seth Weber", "Is up.", "Tony Huegel", "Yes.", "Seth Weber", "Okay.", "Tony Huegel", "Which again \u2013 yes, thank you. Okay, I think this will be our last question we'll be able to get in.", "Operator", "Thank you. The last question will be coming from Mircea Dobre from Robert W. Baird & Company. Your line is now open.", "Mircea Dobre", "All right. Thank you for squeezing me in guys. Good morning. And I think I'll ask you a question about the 50% of earnings that nobody asked anything about. On financial services, what I'm struggling with a little bit is understanding how you view your overall finance receivables as you look at 2016, because I would imagine some of them are going to start rolling off.", "And then not related but still, why did you guys feel like it was appropriate to make a change to your pension accounting at this point?", "Tony Huegel", "So again, which question would you like me to answer?", "Mircea Dobre", "Well, I would like you to answer both if possible, but the first one is probably more important to me.", "Tony Huegel", "You know, financial services as you know when Susan went through her year-over-year changes she didn't mention portfolio balance and it's because there is really very little change in the average portfolio balance.", "It's down very slightly year-over-year and again, that's more of a reflection of - as we talked about last year, 2015 it was actually higher year-over-year and while you have fewer notes coming in because of the trade cycle slowing down you also have fewer notes paying off early.", "And so the notes are extending and so it does help sustain that portfolio balance further into the cycle. And so that's one of the, again one of the benefits we talk about with financial services.", "As you think about pension and OPEB, I think what I would say is candidly it's more accurate calculation, as you look at the method that we have chosen to change to and so that's the reason why we decided to make that change.", "Raj Kalathur", "And then was proposed by our actuarial company.", "Mircea Dobre", "Okay.", "Tony Huegel", "All right.", "Mircea Dobre", "All right.", "Tony Huegel", "Thanks, Mircea.", "Okay, with that, we'll go ahead and conclude the call.

My name is Albert Manifold, I'm the Chief Executive of CRH and I'm joined in the stage here by our CFO, Maeve Carton.", "Maeve Carton", "Good morning everybody.", "Albert Manifold", "And together Maeve and I are going to take you through some detail of the first half results for 2014. We are also going to take you through our progress and our portfolio review, which we discussed with you earlier this year. Give you some sense of how we see the year panning out for our two major markets and indeed other markets around the world and in the end as usual, we will have plenty of time for questions and answers to go through some questions you may have in detail.", "So just looking at some of the key headlines for the first half of 2014, across our two major markets we saw contrasting weather patterns and we saw a modest uptick across both businesses although delivered at different times and quite uneven recovery particularly so in Europe. But, we are going to go into the detail that's going to go into the individual businesses.", "Very happy to see that we delivered earnings in line with guidance just a nudge ahead of guidance and good positive strong operational leverage coming through our businesses on the back of fairly modest top line growth, which really is a testament to the strength of the cost cutting and the restructuring that we did in the early part of the crisis and kept all the way through and morning to pose a dividend maintaining the half one dividend of $0.085 which maintains the strong dividend record we have in CRH fiscal back into 1983 it's incredible on both in dividend record which again is testament to the strength of the profits of our business, to the cash of our business and also to \u2013 we understand what are important to investors.", "Just looking at the big picture overview of the Group in total, you can see revenues ahead by about 4% that's delivered strongly by Europe which is about 7% ahead of the first half of last year, United States about 1% ahead of last year, but very contrasting weather patterns, Europe does feel like it's better in the first half of this year, but it was helped greatly by very favorable weather conditions in the first four months of the year, which helped construction. In contrast in the United States, we had another prolonged extended winter matching what we saw in 2013 and a very slow start to construction. And we saw those trends change and I will go into that in a couple of moments in those two major markets.", "But on that top line growth of 4%, you see strong operational leverage coming through, but an uplift in EBITDA of 27% across our Group which is very good to see and strong margin advance of 1%. And if you think about how we thought about our business and we spoke about our business about bringing margins and returns back to peak during the course of the next cycle, this is a good first good step in seeing margin advance, and the RONAs are advancing by about 1% as well in the first half of the year.", "Before I get into the individual business units, I just want to update you in terms of what the market trends are for the first six months and what we are seeing since the half year and two contrasting patterns. If I look at Europe, you can see Europe started off at a good pick. The first four months on the back of good weather and good momentum, if you recall the back end of last year showed good momentum in the European markets, with good momentum coming through, so good strong start to the year with the first four months up about 10% on last year. And we saw an easing of those trends in May and June. We think some of that was pull forward work into the four months impacting upon those two months, and the trends we are seeing across the European businesses and I will discuss them in detail as I go through the divisions is broadly speaking in line, if a little bit better, in July and August for our major markets in Europe.", "In contrast with the United States, again, as I said we saw a very slow start to the year with the first four months really being pegged down by a very long prolonged winter particularly across the northern states of the United States, and that slowed back and held back our construction business and impacted in particular our Americas product business for the first quarter.", "Both in May and June, when this early summer came, we saw a pick-up in activity level and you can see that coming through the numbers that we are looking at. We also that in July and August continuing along that level, so this good momentum in the U.S. business is primarily led by residential and non-residential. Infrastructure was broadly flat, residential and non-residential are leading the recovery out of this, and we are seeing good momentum coming through up to -- the weekend.", "If I go into the individual business units and spend maybe a couple of minutes in each of the business divisions as such, Europe materials is a business which most of you know quite well, it's a business that manufactures cement and cementitious products, concrete products, and aggregates businesses, primarily in Europe Materials the big countries for us are Poland, Ukraine, Finland, and Switzerland, and across those markets certainly in Poland and Ukraine on the back of good momentum and indeed favorable weather, we saw good margin advances, good profit advances, and good top line advances.", "Switzerland on the back of good residential work, and good infrastructure work also showed a good performance this year. And even Finland, which for the second year in a row seems to be in a malaise of generally floating minus 1 and plus 1, had a tough first half of the year, both volumes and prices were down, but I have to say some of the self-help work our teams did helped our business and we delivered results in line with last year in Finland. But overall, the division showed good advances, overall volumes were up about 7% led by cement, which is about 20% ahead, and I'm very happy to see again on those high fixed cost businesses, good upside leverage coming through and good margin expansions, so a good delivery by this division in the first six months of the year.", "Moving to Europe products, and this is a division that received an awful lot of attention from us during the course of the crisis with a lot of restructuring and cost cutting and resetting our businesses in this particular division, and it's very pleasing to see all that hard work coming through on the back of some good top line improvements.", "The big countries here for us are the United Kingdom, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, and France also is an important country for us as well. And we talk about an uneven recovery coming through in Europe, you hear us in the context I'm talking about, U.K. and Germany strongly performing in the first half of the year. At last, the Netherlands seems to be finding the floor; I think Europe is still forecasting construction to be down in the Netherlands this year. We think we are bumping on the bottom before it starts to pick up in 2015, Belgium showed signs of growth, but France was weak for us.", "But overall, we saw good top line growth and really happy to see strongest leverage coming through this division here, and again that's a testament not to price increases, to volume but also the restructuring and cost takeout that we did coming back to benefit our businesses, keeping our businesses more efficient and showing good bottom line delivery. So good margin expansion as well.", "And our distribution businesses, again, the footprint for these businesses is Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland that's makes up about 95% of the total EBITDA of this division, and this division is the one that's probably influenced most and closest to consumer confidence in the marketplace, because our DIY businesses are selling to the retailers \u2013 retailing people like you and I, the general builders\u2019 merchants are selling to the small-jobbing builder close to the consumer and the slight uptick in consumer confidence came through these businesses this year, and you can see a growth in the top-line and that bottom line improvement again showing good leverage coming through helped by some self-help measures in particular, a rollout of our group procurement schemes across Europe, which again helps to benefit that bottom line and showed good delivery in this particular division.", "So overall, a little bit of an uneven picture in Europe. I would characterize it by saying a modest uptick, uneven, strong delivery in the likes of Poland, Switzerland, Britain, Germany, and flattening out in The Netherlands, slightly weaker in the likes of Finland, slightly stronger in Belgium, so a little of bit of uneven recovery as you would expect in the early stages of recovery from the very dramatic crisis we have been through in the last five or six years.", "Moving across the Americas, I'm looking at our Americas materials division first and just to clarify for everybody in the room and on the lines, this is a business that supplies aggregates, asphalt, concrete primarily to infrastructure businesses, but this business is about 60% exposed to infrastructure and the other 40% split 50:50 between residential and non-residential. And I think most people will know that broadly speaking in 2014, highway funding, which will drive the infrastructure spend will be broadly speaking flat, but maybe slightly up with regard to individual states but I'm sure we can do in the Q&A. Broadly speaking any growth we're seeing this business has been delivered by residential and non-residential growth.", "And the top line there looks flat actually like-for-like sales were up about 4% in dollar terms. And on those reasonably flattish sales, again, we have seen good profit delivery good margin expansion in this business led by residential and non-residential and you can see the effect of that coming through \u2013 with the higher volume is coming through across all our products and good pricing coming through both in our aggregate business and our concrete business.", "I wouldn't be too concerned about the pricing of the asphalt business, the asphalt business is significantly impacted by the cost of bitumen and how we manage the cost of bitumen it's about how you manage the spread in the asphalt business well, the actual price itself. Our winter-fill program has gone well, obviously, it's concluded at the stage, and we think it will support margins in our asphalt business for the remainder of this year.", "Moving to our Americas products business and our Americas materials business is a quarter two quarter three business, our Americas products business is absolutely a quarter one, quarter two business. This is the business that supplies 80% of its products to the residential and non-residential market and in particular in quarter one it was a big sell-in to the likes of Lowe's and Home Depot where we sell a lot of pavers, blocks, architectural blocks, capping stones, hardscapes into those outlets for the early spring season.", "But because of the winter pattern that we saw in North America this year that whole spring season was almost completely wiped out. You would have seen the disappointing results by those two retailers when they reported already their second quarter numbers. So that impacted upon our business for the first four months.", "What we saw then though in may and June as activity levels came back actually we saw increased activity levels and catch up and actually it's good news, bad news because we get the volumes out the door, which is very good but its comes at a cost. Effectively we compressed six months of production into two months and that means we got to double shift our factories it becomes much more inefficient because we're putting -- we're hiring labor higher cost and our logistics costs were significantly higher in those two months. So once we got this out the door it cost us much more and you see the effect of that coming through in a lower EBITDA.", "I should say this business is driven by residential and non-residential, but a strong fundamentals driving this business. We've seen a good performance of this business in May, June, July and in August and each month it has been starting to ease into that deficit we see there at the end of the half year and we think there is a fair change this business will get back to exceed the number of last year by the end of the year. So it's making good progress after a very slow and difficult start.", "Moving to our U.S. Distribution business and again, just to explain our distribution business, it's a business which is largely exposed in two ways, one is we call exterior products and that's the largest part of this division, it makes about 70% of the EBITDA on an annual basis and this business supplies roofing products and siding products for residential developments in the United States. Not for new but mainly for repair and maintenance and improvement across the northern states, the Northeast and Midwest.", "And again, because of the extended winter people just couldn't get out to repair roofs that just held back demand for the first four to five months. On top of that you would have seen that from some of the other suppliers' single shipments, which are a very good barometer for this particular business we're down about 5% in the first half of the year, but prices grew up, and we got squeezed in the middle of the distributor. We just didn't have the value to pass those price increases through. But even with all of those headwinds, the EBITDA in this business was a nudge behind the first half of last year which actually we did a lot of work on the back of the Hurricane Sandy damage that was done across the northern part of New Jersey and New York. So actually quite a good performance by the exterior product part of this division.", "The other part of this division which is normally about 30% of the EBITDA is our interior products business. And this business supplies wallboard, acoustic ceiling tiles, ceiling tiles, ceiling stud support systems for new residential and new non-residential businesses. And again, in the back of the growing market we saw increased volumes and on the back of increased wallboard prices better pricing as well. And that part of the division came through very strong and have to deliver about mild improvement we saw coming through and the margin improvement. And again, just a testing to the importance of balance in CRH not everything moves in sequence, it's important to have a balance posture to our portfolio within businesses and across our divisions.", "So overall the Americas after a slow start which impacted those businesses that had a big first quarter business \u2013 it started come through in May and June and with some good momentum coming through catch up in the infrastructure business in May and June so volumes have been quite good, continued good momentum in residential and non-residential in May, June, July continuing through August and we think this will be a year of progress for our Americas businesses as we service those markets.", "Most probably we're going to talk to you about the [deals] (ph) which is really important to manage our business; it's about the margins within your business. This for me is a window into the health of how our business has been managed, health of how you're managing your cost and how are you managing your selling prices. And happily we can see five of the six divisions showing significant margin expansion in the first six month of this year.", "Now I should say that is coming absent any real price increasing, we saw price increases going through in the U.S. materials business, but that really isn't the back of higher cement prices that's just passing on that no real expansion. We saw a little bit of price increases coming through our distribution business and the distribution businesses in America coming through in the back of wallboard pricing. But actually to counter that net-net prices were back in Europe again.", "So this is really the effects of two things, it affects a slightly higher volume levels but also the effect of a lot of the cost cutting and restructuring work we did on the way down and it gives me confidence that our teams did a great job in the way down in reorganizing our businesses, positioning the right place to benefit for the upside leverage which we are seeing coming through delivering that more than 1% margin increase. And I think it's a real, and it goes under the progress we made, we said we're going to improve margins we said, we're going to improve growth both about 1% in the first half of the year and it's very satisfying for us to stand here before and tell you about progress we've made.", "So with that I am going to hand you over to Maeve, who is going to take you through some of the financial impact of what we've seen in the delivery of these first quarter numbers. Maeve?", "Maeve Carton", "Thanks Albert. It really is encouraging to see that performance five out of the six segments reporting improved margins against the backdrop that we've been talking about modest not even recovery across our various businesses.", "What I am going to do now is talk about the \u2013 how those individual segment performance pose together into the Group outturn overall for the first half of 2014. I am also going to say a few words about how our debt management and financial management process are put to work to create value for CRH.", "So the outturn for the first half of the year we've already seen sales up 4% accompanied by a 27% increase in EBITDA to \u20ac505 million a very significant improvement in operating leverage. The most encouraging part of that result for me is the organic performance line that you can see there. The organic for us means excluding impact of acquisition and excluding translations impact so the underlying businesses really delivering performance.", "Before we talk about that a quick word about the acquisitions impact, the geographic footprint of our operations with significant operations in northern tier states of the U.S. and in northern Europe, countries where the severe normal weather conditions in the winter time mean the construction activity doesn't really get started until quarter two means that the profitability of the Group is very skewed towards the second half of the year and that seasonal impact is reflected in that acquisitions impact that you can see there for the first half of the year.", "Cost savings have been a big focus of attention for management over the last number of years as we make our business as resilient and grind out some of those efficiencies that Albert was talking about. We're on track to deliver 2.6 billion of savings by the end of 2015 and that average has continued very significantly during 2014 whereby the end of June we had delivered 45 million of cost saving benefits.", "So for the first half of the year the underlying businesses particularly in Europe saw the benefit of those cost savings activities which together with the improvement in volumes which delivered better plant utilization and better efficiencies and the combination of all those saw some real profit delivery in the first half of the year where with against the backdrop of a 4% increase in sales so an organic increase of the sales level of \u20ac400 million we saw profit delivery of almost 100 million a 25% operating leverage for the growth.", "Our focus on making our businesses better and improving value for CRH also is seen in our debt position figure and in our management of our debt management and financial management processes. Net debt at the end of June amounted to \u20ac3.7 billion which was almost 0.5 billion lower than this time last year, so significant cash generation capabilities one of the key signs of the financial strength of any company.", "Another indicator of financial strength is the ability of a company to cover its interest cost with cash earnings. EBITDA to interest cover for CRH for the 12 months ended June 2014 was 6.2x, so very healthy level of profitability relative to the financing cost of the Group. So the combination of those two financial measures, strong cash generation and good interest cover support the ratings that we have from S&P and Moody's, so that will be plus from S&P and BAA from Moody's. Those are strong investment grade ratings and the reason those were important for CRH is that they provide access to multiple sources of funding for the Group.", "As recently as last month, we were able to raise 600 million in the Eurobond market the third time we have accessed the Eurobond market in the last 18 months or so. And in rising that 600 million, we also secured the lowest ever interest rates for CRH in the capital markets 1.75%. We couldn't have done that without the financial strength behind us.", "The combination of that 600 million recently raised with the gross cash of 1.1 billion that we have in the balance sheet at the end of June and the 6.2 billion of committed undrawn facilities that are available to the Group mean that as of now we have significant liquidity of \u20ac4.3 billion available to CRH. And what does is give the Group \u2013 puts the Group in a very, very strong flexible position to take advantage of opportunities and acquisitions where we see the possibility of creating value for CRH.", "I talked about the net debt reduction of 0.5 billion in the period a lot of that reduction was delivered through improvements in operating cash flow. The first thing to say about operating cash flow in the half year for CRH is that the seasonal effect that I talked about in terms of the profitability of the Group is also very apparent in our cash flows at the first half where we traditional see cash going out as activity picks up during the year.", "Also against the backdrop of the improving economic backdrop and sales improving we might have expected working capital outflows to increase during the recent period as activity picks up. We are very happy with the results in the first half of the year where as a result of paying attention to the basic fundamentals of financial management which is looking after credit control following up on receivables from our customers, making sure that we manage inventory carefully, the combination of all of those boring day-to-day financial management techniques have resulted in a reduction in working capital workflow, a 13% reduction against the backdrop of an increasing sales environment. So I think that's a very strong performance.", "We have also maintained our discipline in terms of capital expenditure which again against the backdrop of an improving activity across our businesses we saw capital expenditure reduced by 26 million in the period. So the combination of those factors resulted in our \u2013 our operating cash outflows actually reducing by 300 million during the period and that resulted in the net debt reduction. So very strong cash management as well.", "And finally, before I hand you back to Albert, a quick word about our financial discipline and how that's put to work to create value for CRH. First of all, my usual slide in relation to debt maturities where we have shown here our net debt including the 600 million that we raised last month in the Eurobond market spread out by year of repayment and the purpose of that is to show how part of our debt management efforts are directed at making sure that there is no undue bunching of maturities in any one year and that the Group is well organized and as an orderly approach to its debt management.", "Another very important aspect of that debt management is the ability to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment, I have already mentioned Eurobond 600 million which we raised last month and two issues in the Eurobond market last year also securing for CRH long-term fixed rate interest that is, is historically very low. And I think that's best expressed by the blue line on the chart there which shows the average interest rate for CRH from 2012 out from 2020 to 2021 there and beyond.", "As you can see, we are moving from an average interest rate of over 5% in 2012 down to rates that will be in the region of 3% from 2018 onwards. So what that is showing is that the financial management and debt management efforts of CRH are also focused on creating value for the Group by securing lower long-term interest rates which means higher profits which also means lower average rates of debt and lower cost of capital and all of that setting CRH up to create value.", "And now, I hand you back to Albert.", "Albert Manifold", "Thanks Maeve. And just before we leave that slide, I think we glanced over these numbers very quickly. We talked about cash management in the CRH but just look at what's been achieved in the first half of this year. Anybody who runs the business knows and in raising activity levels that leads to an outflow of cash. And working capital for those businesses capital expenditure because the guys in the business will be saying please help fund the growth that we have done in the first half of the year.", "Actually, we reduced working capital by 13%, Maeve talked about all the boring work that's done by the credit \u2013 people, stock management people, that was not a boring results and look at capital expenditure, it's down to 67% depreciation and how we achieved, well, we have seen precipitous time at industry and we just made sure people used all the equipment that we paid from the past to it's fullest capability. There is a lot of equipment and plants lying around and we used that before we got to spend our money on company's business that's what we should do in managing a tied ship, and CRH is a tied ship.", "And then you look at the cash resources over \u20ac4 billion funds available to us hugely important to us, great flexibility and great strength in the balance sheet. And then finally look at approval line that Maeve referred to, the lowering cost of debt. And remember back to February, we talked about the returns that we generated and acquisitions we have done over the last three years.", "Over 95 deals over the last three years, we spent \u20ac1.6 billion on those deals and we generated returns in excess of 11% against that cost of debt. That's value creation coming through, really good performance.", "I just want to update you on our portfolio review, you might recall in the fourth quarter of last year in November, we set out for you that \u2013 with the evolving change or the evolving market circumstances and acceptance that the fact that post crisis world was going to be different to the pre-crisis world, we need to take a relook at our businesses.", "We knew there were parts of our businesses were very good at creating value and driving profitability. We knew that parts of our business that no longer met the regional investment thesis for which we made that investment and we want to have a full look at our portfolio and also a full look at where those businesses were positioned. And we said, it would take this about 9 months or so, we indicated at the end of quarter three we are moving progressing towards that we finish our portfolio review during the course of next few weeks.", "So with regard to that, the whole purpose of this is really resetting CRH for growth, looking where we can leverage our strengths across our businesses looking at where we are best at driving value across our businesses that's what the purpose of this is about. And also making sure our businesses are best positioned in the product markets and the geographies for organic growth and also for acquisition growth as well, which is a key part of CRH.", "And I can confirm to this morning that our focus on our core business is leading to about \u2013 confirm 80% to 85% of our businesses are solidly core businesses and are fundamental part of the growth of CRH going forward. Those businesses actually delivered about 90% of EBITDA in 2013.", "And that will lead to likely divestments over the course of next few years of about \u20ac1.5 billion potentially to get the \u20ac2 billion worth of businesses. That process has already started and a number of those businesses are already out in the markets and are on the block, I'm not going to comment on any specific circumstance today because actually our main concern is our shareholders and creating value for them, while some of them are out there as it is at the moment. Some will be held back so the process kind of improve in the recovery and we will send into the recovery. Through our no fire sales in CRH, this is going to be an orderly managed multiyear process, which will lead to an allocation and reallocation of those funds back into our core businesses where we find the best to create value.", "But one thing, you should takeaway which is active portfolio management is now part of CRH going forward. This is a process that continues on.", "We talked about our core competences and core businesses in CRH and I could be here for another week explaining to you business-by-business, five year to core business, what are the advantages. In an effort to a try and communicate, why we see certain business being part of future of CRH, we want this set out for you some of the core characteristics, the key characteristics we see in some of our better businesses. And we have said that not will be in the screen here this morning.", "The first one there, strong strategic platforms, we just find where we got businesses with good strong logical platforms that is base upon which we can do the business and value going forward.", "So let me give you a specific examples. The obvious one is our materials business in the United States. If we have resource backed asset such as a big aggregate facility close to a market location that seems to be a base upon which we can built a profitable long-term growing business. We are in a completely different part of the business in a different way. I think our European distribution business actually the strong strategic platform there is provided by a network of distribution businesses that are interlinked and self-supporting creating a strong market position in a strong market network that too is a strong strategic platform upon which we can build the business.", "And then we move on the next stage of value creation here. Approving value creation capability, proven operating capability and how do we do that? When in heavy side businesses like ONG again let me use that example. You know, we pursue a solid vertical integration model. So when we have an aggregate facility have to be after that we bring the asphalt business to that business; we bring our ready-mix concrete business to that business. The concrete products business all of them drawing volume down from the core asset and increasing the throughput, increasing efficiencies and profitability of the core asset.", "But also getting profit pick-up in all the downstream businesses as well. We are leveraging the strength of our businesses across the base asset and leveraging the strength is exactly what we do in the other example I gave of Europe distribution. We just do it in a different way.", "Again, just imagine the advantage that we have in procurement, on merchandising, on marketing, on setting prices, on category management and IT across a strong network of distribution business against our competitors who are not so big. So again, levering that scale delivers value for us and it's a key part, the next part of value creation of CRH which is the acquisition of opportunities because we must have role for acquisition growth for us to create value to our aspirations.", "Historically speaking, we have said to you that 2/3rds of the profit growth in CRH has come directly and indirectly to the acquisition process. And we buy businesses; we create profits and returns to our shareholders that's what we do. And we have to have load ahead of us. And again, going back to the examples that I gave you, if I look at the fragmented nature of the materials business in the United States, I know there is enough acquisition a road ahead of us for the next 30 years or so.", "If I look at the distribution business in Europe, it's a fragmented business served particularly in Western Europe servicing all of the markets and again, the advantage of scale \u2013 leverage in our scale provides a lot of acquisition opportunities for us as we develop that business going forward. And all of that overlaid by solid organic growth.", "Again, going back to the examples I gave about the United States construction market, the fundamentals driving that markets are population growth, strong economic growth, demographics; we are going to see construction growth in the United States for all our lives.", "And then Europe, even though the new build markets maybe challenged the slow growth in the western part of Europe, actually the repair, maintenance and approval market, which the distribution business almost exclusively serviced actually is a growing market that is very resilient during the downturn and is going to show a good growth as we felt that it would. Again, a growth market for which we can help deliver value for our shareholders.", "And it will lead to a business which is narrower and deeper, a business that is focused on returns and a business that is focused on delivering value for our shareholders. I could have used the examples of our cement businesses in Eastern Europe which exposed a higher growth there. I could have used the example of residential and non-residential exposed Americas product distribution businesses they just do us in different way but these strong strategic platforms position us with a portfolio of business to drive growth in returns going forward.", "This active portfolio management is not something you start and stop. This is something you start and becomes an active part of your day-to-day life. It's by having the right amount of capital in the right markets focusing the right businesses. We keep one eye on the strategic balance of our business. We know how important emerging markets are and we have developed those in time in a measured approach, but we will keep a very keen eye of the value creation in the short and medium term and delivering across our main markets.", "Now, I know you all want me to move quickly to the outlook and give our prognosis and outlook for the remainder of the year. But, I'm going to take a moment of your time just talk to you about how I see CRH after eight months as Chief Executive in the business.", "We work in our industry to be here at this time. It's a volatile, cyclical industry; it's a terrible business in the way down. It's plus sticky costs, its route to take cost out, you can lay-off and make your structuring. But on the way back up again if you do the right work in the way down you will enjoy the benefits in the way back up.", "And what we have seen in the construction industry in Europe and in the United States, we have seen the signs of growth for the first time in eight years. The U.S. in the past 12 to 24 months have exhibited signs of life surprise, surprise led by residential and non-residential. Infrastructure will come in time when they get the funding right. And now, we are seeing signs of stability come into Europe and growth in the better prepared countries. As a Chief Executive, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else but running CRH at this time in the cycle for construction.", "So that's the organic growth, but how do we do in CRH to make a difference? Well, I spoken to you about continuous improvements. Our business is a business of pennies, pennies matter every single day and we have to manage those pennies very, very carefully and we do that by focusing on a formalized approach continuous improvement to keep KPIs across our key businesses, benchmarking across all our individual divisions and outside of those divisions plus these to reduce our costs and improve our margins. And that perhaps delivered our leverage we saw coming through the first half of this year. And not many companies do that but the real benefit for CRH is when you marry that continuous improvement with our acquisition model is that where we are different.", "And I'm not talking about our industry; I'm talking generally about general industrialists. The average size business in our industry as the revenues of over \u20ac50 million reflection of small local businesses and actually the average sized deal we do when we buy business is about \u20ac50 million of revenues our size. But, what we do is, when we marry that unique acquisition strategy of small mid-size businesses with the continuous improvement market we have in our core existing businesses that's how we create value because our acquisition strategy like happens across many, many deals every year, it's low risk and higher return. And it has delivered results for CRH for decades and will continue to deliver results for decades is how those two married together that's really important. And that will be a key part of driving value going forward.", "And now what's different, we marry that with active portfolio management, strong capital discipline, looking to shape and reshape our portfolio constantly making sure that our assets and capital are deployed in areas where we get the maximum returns. And that's the magic of CRH. That's how we produced industry leading returns for the last 30 years. And that's how we will continue.", "And the last point I want to make to you after eight months in, is the balance sheet. Maeve talked about \u20ac4.3 billion of available funds, you saw the strength of the balance sheet, you saw the strength of the cash capability, the operating cash flow coming through. That balance sheet is the future profit of our business. And I can assure you, we will use that balance sheet wisely.", "So leave you some thoughts after 8 months in, of what we see and what I see personally as a Chief Executive of CRH of the opportunities for us ahead.", "If I can just turn to the outlook for 2014, well, we see a continuation of the modest albeit on even recovery that we are seeing across Europe continue for the remainder of the year. The first four months are in a box they delivered, has been delivered since May, June, July and August pretty consistent is kind of down to flat when we talk to our customers, when we talk to contractors effectively all around Europe as I have done in advance this presentation, the sense we get is that the moment is there, we have gained we will hold and it will be broadly in line for the second half of the year what was a very, very impressive second half in 2013.", "U.S. is different with a very weak first four months because of the weather. But, since May and in June and in July and now in August, we are seeing a fairly sustained delivery of volumes coming through and some price increases coming through as well, which is very welcome. And we see that continuing for the remainder of the year. And that leads the stability United States will be ahead of what was a very strong second half of 2013. And need to confirm this morning the statement we made in May at our annual general meeting when we said the 2014 will be a year of profit growth in CRH.", "So I would like to thank you for your attention for the presentation this morning. We are now going to move to questions-and-answers and we are going to take questions from the floor first and then move to the telephone lines and then move to the Web. And if I can ask you just for the benefit of everybody watching in from outside this particular room to state your name first and the name of your institution and if you kindly wait just for the microphone, the ladies will bring the microphone to you, the microphone gets to you because without that the people will not be able to hear the question on the line. So maybe we will move to the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Barry Dixon \u2013 Davy", "Thank you. Good morning. It's Barry Dixon from Davy. Couple of questions, if I could, just going back to your thoughts Albert eight months in and in terms of the balance sheet and clearly as Maeve has pointed out, the balance sheet is in pretty good shape raising money at historically low levels. And now you potentially have another \u20ac2 billion to add to that. The acquisition activity in the first half of the year, well done in the first half of last year. I mean is that a -- increased financial rigor on your part or how do you see yourself using that balance sheet or I suppose more particularly in terms of at what point do you come under pressure to do something different other than acquisitions with the balance sheet?", "The second question is on incremental margins and 25% at a group level in the first half, it was a great performance and a very different performance, I mean, 37% in Europe and I think 5% in the U.S., is that 25% in your own thought process -- is that sustainable going forward, and is that the kind of incremental margin that you see as being sustainable?", "And then lastly, just a question on Poland in terms of the outlook in the second half of the year and into next year and maybe also your quick thoughts in Ukraine and other political situation, what impact the business there? Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "Thanks Barry. Three questions there. About acquisition pipeline and margins component, maybe if I take the first and third one and maybe at the end pass the question on margins to \u2013 and pull through of leverage Maeve if you don't mind.", "The acquisition on the first half, when you compare them to previous years, there is nothing significant in that. And we have a strong capital discipline in CRH that's always been there, and we keep that rigor and the three years of acquisitions I referred to in February of this year and our results, which talked about the acquisitions we did in 2011, 2012, 2013, the results of those were delivered because we had rigor on acquisitions during that process. There is nothing significant there, it's just the ebb and flow of deals as such our pipeline is good across a wide range of businesses and just a question of being disciplined and being patient, we know this game very well, it has happened before and will happen again. So nothing significant and the pipeline is quite good.", "And I'm convinced that we have the balance sheet to support us, and we will utilize that balance sheet to create value going forward.", "With regard to Poland, I think we saw the first half of the year benefiting very strongly. Overall, the market was up about 20% in volumes at first half. But that level of volume increase is not sustainable, our own sense is, it's going to \u2013 again, you got much strong comparables in the second half of the year against 2013. But we do think the cement market will be up for the full year, we think the cement market will be about 15.2 million to 15.3 million tons in Poland this year, which would represent at about 7% increase overall, so it will taper back a bit against very tough comparables. But, the momentum is good, but the disappointment for me in Poland is the fact that price is going backwards this year, a 7% price increase in our market, that\u2019s up 20% in the first half, should not be a market that has got price declines, it should be a market that sees some price increases particularly so over the last number of years where we have seen difficulties in pricing there.", "With regard to Ukraine, I suppose the direct and indirect consequences of our businesses, first of all, our business are located in the Western part of Ukraine, which is a long way from where the trouble is, we are closer to the Eastern France than we are to the east of Ukraine, and our businesses have actually shown good delivery in the first half of the year probably a follow-through and continuing and finishing our work from last year rather than any new work, and that probably would be the concern I would have with the political uncertainty, and the amount of capital that continues to be invested in construction, Ukraine is primarily residential construction as local people are building apartment blocks, moving out of the country and building apartment blocks. The question is, would that level of activity fall back.", "Actually, when talking to one of our major customers and contractors last weekend, he was telling me that in fact there is a big shift from the East of Ukraine by professional people back into Kiev, back into the west of Ukraine, which is actually our main market, and he anticipates that to be a lift of 2015, but I wouldn't overcook that just yet.", "So I think there is a lot of uncertainty about the second half of the year, and we think this year's profitability in Ukraine for us would be about in line with last year, and so we don't see any huge big decline, I think the effects of us going on in Ukraine will be no longer felt, and just finally, the indirect effects before I pass to Maeve in terms of the sanctions that we are seeing \u2013 Russian sanctions on Europe, it's very early to say whether they are going to have any long-term effect across Europe. It's a concern. It's a worry for a broader general European economy. They have only just started, so we will see what will happen and maybe governments will alleviate or there will be some changes in that. But we have to just watch that and we will update you all this in November.", "Maeve maybe I might ask you to comment on the margins and the leverage.", "Maeve Carton", "Yes. Thanks Albert. So yes, indeed a very strong operating leverage in the first half of the year, 25% on the sales increase of 4% that is largely delivered in the European operations, which had a year-on-year benefit, or a first half to first half benefit that was very strong this year. I think for the year as a whole, we would see margin improvement, that trend continuing across our businesses and hopefully some catch-up in the Americas products business, as Albert was talking about improving markets there.", "So I think it would probably be on real estate you think that the operating leverage of 25% that we saw in the first half of the year would be a sustainable ongoing level, the more sustainable level is probably more in the region 15% to 20%.", "Albert Manifold", "Okay. Next question. Back there?", "Will Morgan - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. It's Will Morgan for Goldman Sachs. I have got three questions. The first one is, could you elaborate a little bit more about the acquisition environments obviously we are seeing historically low levels of financing costs which presumably is pushing up prices, I just wondered if you could talk about the pipeline that you see how attractively priced it is and specifically whether or not you are interested in any of the assets coming out of the Holcim and Lafarge merger?", "The second question relates to the CapEx spend which is obviously down quite dramatically I wondered maybe if you can give a bit of an elaboration on how you would see CapEx depreciation evolving as we move into the second half but also 2015 presumably that's got to step up from the kind of ratios we are seeing at the moment.", "And the third question just relates to pricing power, obviously in Europe pricing seems to be met down you are not really getting any major spread in the U.S., I would imagine U.S. pricing does improve from here but in Europe could you maybe comment a little bit more about where the sticking points are vis-\u00e0-vis pricing and when you can start to see some of that pricing power come through.", "Albert Manifold", "Thanks for the good morning. If I take again the first question on the acquisition environmental pricing and also the pricing, I will let Maeve begin with the second part and the Europe capital expenditure.", "The acquisition environment that we are seeing out there in pricing in particular, there is broadly no change over the last 12 to 18 months, I'm aware that there is a lot of money out there because there is a lot of money out there chasing many assets. And we don't see \u2013 and it's been there for quite some time. So we are not seeing a particular change in that environment. But I do know from my own experience that having unfortunately lived through a number of recessions that the period of most distress, the period of most opportunity is actually as you come out of recession that's because people will find there is a draw on cash now that's when things get tight for them and that's when things bite. And that's when you see opportunities for distress -- sales and distress purchases.", "The second part is, if I think we have been consistent will attain this, one of the reasons in the crisis while we back on our acquisition spend must because we have a little or no visibility every year that is climbing by 10% or 15%. But now at last we are seeing some stability and that gives you a little more confidence when you are looking at your models, when you are looking at your forecasts and that gives us confidence when we look forward with regard to acquisition spend.", "The other point you had is on pricing power, which is really key question \u2013 very important question and if I can start from the U.S. you specifically asked about Europe, but if I start from the U.S. because that gives you an indication the ways things are going. You are right. Again, our goal has been consistent as same you have got to see strong volume is coming through for a period of time to give people the confidence that pricing is back. Just think of the mentality of what is going on and people run materials businesses or any business is construction at the moment. They have been through the most dreadful precipitous falls or volumes have declined by more than 50%, 60% in the worst markets. They are just glad for work. Pricing is not even in their mentality. They just want to see the fact this being filled. As capacity gets eaten back with the more sustained pull through that's when people start move into pricing and we are just entering that phase in the United States so you are right when you say that \u2013 we are just -- coming through now and you see it in the areas with the narrowest tightest supply sides as such as the cement the aggregates but that will drift down through the chain because it starts with top and just drift downs through the chain.", "Europe is at a different stage of its recovery and it's very patchy and it's very weak. And I think we are going to have to see country-by-country a little bit of more sustained pull through on volumes. Just look what's happening in the United Kingdom. You have seen now with helped schemes coming through for the past 12 to 24 months, there is strong volume growth and strong pricing power in the house of individuals just by the residential mortgage. That's what you are going to see country-by-country but only as volumes come back. That will be how I will see at pricing.", "Maeve and\u2026", "Maeve Carton", "And in terms of capital expenditure, yes, we have seen significant disciplined being applied to the capital expenditure in the first half of the year. And as Albert was saying we \u2013 our focus has been to get our operations to use the efforts we have on the ground and make sure we are using those fully before we spend money on expanding the business.", "I would certainly see the ratio of the spend beginning to trend upwards, it's clearly not sustainable, it's continued spending at a level of 67% to deprecation over the long haul, so I would say \u2013 I still think for the year as a whole, the final outturn will likely be around last year's level or maybe slightly less by trending upwards closer to 80% to 100% of deprecation over the next year or two.", "Albert Manifold", "I would like to add because a lot of colleagues in CRH around the world will be listening to this. I would like to use the capital expenditure to have first before we get any new CapEx. This room a little worse. Forgive me, sorry. Just in the front here.", "Will Jones - Redburn", "Thanks. Will Jones, Redburn. Three, if I could please. The first, could you comment more specifically around pricing in Americas products, I think at the start of the year, you talked about a couple of good user volume and this is a descent yes for the pricing, as weather pushed back by a year, any pricing gains, but rather comments there would be great.", "Americas is generally, the like-for-like in the last couple of months to the end of the first half, do you think that's indicative of the second half or kind of push from there just given weather capture and how you expecting all three divisions in Americas to be ahead in the second half as well as the region as a whole.", "And then the final one, just around Holland, there is some better days emerging from the confidence perspective and lead indicates on new housing, is that something the guys in the ground just starting to recognize talk about and if so when is the impact?", "Albert Manifold", "Okay. Just three questions there. With regards to specific to Americas products, well, I would expect on the back of the good fundamental volumes that are driving that market which is exposed to residential and non-residential. I mean residential in the U.S. in the last 12 months forecasted over 10% year-to-date it's about 7% driven by multifamily homes. So there is good momentum there.", "I think the non-residential market was up about 5% or so could be up to 10% originally particularly out west, so those two fundamentals given good volume growth and on the back of that the cement price increases coming through \u2013 those cost increases that allows you pass on pricing. I think the issue we have seen this year has been more to do with the specific weather related issue for the first four months.", "And if I can let that question fall into the next part of your question which was how those divisions will perform for the remainder of the year and talk about products specifically and go into materials and distribution. The products business again has shown a good uptick in its business since the first from May and June. June in particular was strong. July has continued in same vein as indeed is August. And materials business what we have seen in May, June, July is pretty much the same trend, we think it's going to continue if you remember our materials business produce about 2/3rds of its profitability during the key month of July, August, September. I mean we are halfway through that period now with good volume throughout. Our backlog is ahead of last year. Our margins those were ahead of last year.", "So all the indicators are pointing in the right direction, we have to continue that trend and like was the distribution, if I back out the first four months which hit the exterior products which is offset by the interior products as I explained you in the presentation. I think the momentum is good for that particular sector. The flip side of the bad, winter is in fact that \u2013 work is put off but also damaged during the bad winter. So we get to do that work during the summer.", "So I think, my own gut feel is actually we will see progress in all three divisions over last year in the Americas.", "You just specifically asked me about the Netherlands, I will say specifically how we see things going there. Netherlands is coming down after \u2013 now four years of very steep declines residential is still forecast to be down \u2013 new residential is forecast to be down about 9%. Overall construction flat maybe minus 1% for this particular year and it feels like that in the Netherlands, it will feels like we got off to a great start with good strong spring sell through, it just kind of repeated out a bit. And I think that's what we are going to see in Holland for the remainder of this year.", "What we are seeing though again, talking to contractors, talking to our customers out there is I think they have quite hope for 2015 coming through starting to see some plans in their order books. They took more planning going on applications for house starts as well. So we are starting to see the Netherlands start to pick back about. I think we will see that in the back end of this year, if we get a bit of weather uncertainty in 2015 and that's our view. Sorry, here in the front.", "Yuri Serov - Morgan Stanley", "Yes. Good morning, Yuri Serov, Morgan Stanley. Two or maybe three questions, well, first of all, on acquisitions, there was a question about your appetite for the assets from Lafarge and Holcim. I would like to press a little bit more on that. I'm not asking for specifics obviously you cannot give specifics but on the other hand in your portfolio review one of the conclusions that you came outwards was that you were thinking about de-prioritizing Europe and especially new built Europe as an investment destination mainly with the assets that Lafarge and Holcim are going to dispose off or actually in Europe expose to new built which is cement. What's your thoughts around that? Thanks.", "Secondly, U.S. infrastructure you are saying is still flat, on the other hand your asphalt volumes are up by 3%, obviously that's not fine, but that seems like they are reasonably decent performance coming out of a recession. So at what levels will you start sounding more positive from U.S. infrastructure and what are your expectations of how that's gong to develop into business.", "And just one quick question to clarify you are talking about disposals of 1.5 billion to 2 billion in the next few years, is the amount of money that you are planning to receive, I mean what do those numbers represent? Thanks.", "Albert Manifold", "Thanks Yuri. I thought I'd dodged Holcim and Lafarge question so far but thanks for bringing it. If I leave the disposals question for Maeve at the end, maybe I just address this specific question of Holcim and Lafarge. CRH have their own strategy for value creation. We are not reliant on anybody else producing any of the list of assets that they wish to dispose off.", "We set out our stall during the course of this year, our business is going to be focusing on returns for our shareholders, we got strategic platforms, we are not a cement business. We are a broad based building materials business, a diversified business with many geographies and we look to extract value across those businesses that service different markets in different geographies and cement is part of that.", "Whatever we do, it's up to CRH to decide what we do and it will all be about value. If you buy a business that's too expensive, you spend rest of your life paying for it. I know that you are better experienced. So if we can buy businesses from whoever they are, wherever they are at the right price and create returns for our shareholders, that's the key focus not any particular suite of assets that are for sale at the moment. And I don't think it helps anybody they are going to specific circumstances as such. We note the fact that produce list like anybody else they can see value there. We will enter into proposals and have discussions but more than I want to say.", "And specifically on the U.S. infrastructure and the fact that asphalt volumes are up about 3% in the first half of the year that's quite regional actually more than anything specific. At the end of the day, the spent towards infrastructure from the federal government is flat. What you are seeing is a little bit of an uptick coming through particular states attend the needs of those states, you see what's happening in Florida with the sure expansion of Florida, they have got to build infrastructure at a higher rate. So the state itself is committing more money to infrastructure spending. There is a big bill going in front of the Texas legislature in November this year to increase the states contribution by $1.8 billion annually to funding in Texas again because Texas is going to be the fastest growing state in the United States.", "We have seen it come to Ohio, we have seen it come to Maine, Pennsylvania but they are making small adjustments because the federal government support the level of infrastructure that it needs. And that might provide a little bit of growth during the course of this year. But the long-term trend will not change until you see a long-term federal program put in place for funding and obviously, we don't see that coming through this year and the discussion will happen in next year. That answer your question? I think it does. Okay.", "Maeve Carton", "The divestment program earlier in the year and I think the portfolio review we talked about approximately 10% of the businesses which at the end of last year we wrote down to an expected value and that's obviously included in the total number approximately 800 million or so of the 1.5 billion to 2 billion is that 10% or so. And then the balance is really \u2013 the next 10% which we have been looking at more closely in the last number of months, we believe somewhere a little bit more than half of that is likely to \u2013 is for divestment. And so that's where we arrive at the 1.5 billion to 2 billion.", "Albert Manifold", "Any further questions here from the floor?", "John Messenger - Redburn", "Thanks. John Messenger from Redburn. Can I just come back to the drop through kind of answer earlier from Maeve just in terms of that 15% to 20% is what symbol going forward? Yes. Coming back to your point Albert, your pricing tends to follow 18 months, 2 years beyond the pick up in volume. When we think about that pricing down and picking up unless you are worried about cost inflation pressures which I guess will be understandable, but they will be a bit more labor pressure potentially there. But, surely that 15% to 20% if anything to 25% we saw in the first half is a good reason why that actually should continue and it will become more price driven rather than volume driven once things pick up a bit of junction. What is making you more cautious other than say that you are not caution on these kind of things?", "And then the second question is, just around acquisitions going forward, you laid out the four kind of platform drivers in terms of why you are good at doing them, but could you give us a little bit of flavor on \u2013 because clearly emerging markets want to be part of this. But, can you give us a bit of a commentary around China businesses, India, why you want to go because it looks to me as though these are going to be platforms start ups when you start to spend from here in terms of what you do. And not looking for geographic but from the point of view of the last few years CRH went off kind of going a little bit wider and also did deals that were clever in terms of shareholder equity positions and JVs. And JVs were also part of what CRH did originally, but are you now looking to make sure you buy things lock the stock in parallel, so you get full control of cash flows and that actually the experience of last few years the Denizlis, the Unilands and all the rest of them, those didn't prove great. Is that just because of the unique transactions or is that something going forward really buy businesses in totality rather than leaving shareholder and partners?", "Albert Manifold", "Okay. John thank you for that very detailed question, the last question maybe I will take that one first and pass again the follow-up question to Maeve on the drop down margins back to here.", "Just generally in our emerging markets strategy I want to be absolutely clear. CRH over the next number of years will increase it's expose to emerging markets. And we will do that because the nucleus of the world is different to the east. If you look at construction growth and the forecast for construction growth it is clearly going to be driven by India and China and Brazil and Indonesia for the next 25 years. And if we aspire to being a global leader at supplying building materials we must be in these markets.", "But being in those markets, what are we going to be in those markets for? We are going to be there to make money and make returns that's what CRH focuses on. Long-term I'm an emerging market bull, actually short-term I'm bit of a bear. I think they are going through period of readjustment. They saw strong growth for the last 8, 9 years on the back of a lot of cheap available finance flowing from the developed world into the developing world that has now changed. And what you are seeing is, countries such as India, where Prime Minister Modi has started down the road, you have seen it with Xi Jinping in China for the last couple of years where they are starting to make the fundamental adjustments to their society and economy that they should have been making for the last 10 years. And that adjustment is coming at a cost in terms of progress, development and economic growth.", "And you got issues such as overcapacity you got issues such as oversupply and pricing, so this huge complexity is there. Indonesia just starting now that whole process. We have got two very good foot prints in Southern India and Northeast China. We have a temptation to try and measure our progress in these things in years actually they should be measured in decades because that's how the countries would have evolved. And we will support them when we see the returns coming through.", "The method doing so, you rightly said going back to the history of -- actually JVs that's what we did participation, understanding our business, the slow stepping. I don't see that changing. It is more complex in managing your relationships, but we do more time looking and talking to understanding our partners than we do actually understand the business themselves because actually when you get in and run the business actually the dream is over you got to work with the partner, it's a marriage.", "So we have been quite good at picking our partners very carefully and most cases it has worked out very well. It's a lot risk way for us to enter into new businesses, new regions and new countries. I think we will continue. That's not to say that if we see the right opportunity for a wholly-owned business in India or China because your proven capability there now that we will step up and take a 100% deal. So I don't want to exclude anything. They will remain part of what we are doing going forward.", "Maeve Carton", "Okay. And if we come back on the margins it's obviously very gratifying to say that 25% operating was in the first half of the year. And that was delivered without any pricing increases. So we are obviously looking \u2013 we will be looking forward to the benefit of price increases over the next number of years. I think in indicating a sustainable level of drop through from increased sales and trying to be realistic taking into account the mix of our businesses and the other side of price increases for us is cost increases as well. So I think it's a mixture of the mix of our businesses and being realistic in terms of the overall deliverables. We are starting to expect to be able to deliver a good drop through from top line growth.", "Albert Manifold", "I think \u2013 and the follow-up, I think we are working in fairly benign cost environment at this particular time right now because that's not obviously going to be the case and we know that. So I think just factoring into those numbers we have to more careful. Sorry to say. Gregor, here in front.", "Gregor Kuglitsch - UBS", "Couple of questions, the first one on the Ukraine, can you just give us the actual pro forma sales and EBITDA obviously since the Lafarge asset coming in which hasn't \u2013 last year wasn't in the numbers. So it make the pro forma number from the prior years, we just got a feel but your comment on being flat on that is an organic or whether that basically -- the acquisition offsets the underlying decline.", "The second is on U.S. infrastructure, this is highway bill which is expiring shortly, just wanted to get what your guys in the ground are thinking in terms of what we should be expecting for multiyear solution perhaps as except to 2015 event.", "And then finally on the portfolio review and divestments and this maybe a bit controversial, but clearly you sort of described CRH as a asset manager of building materials companies. Is it not a case in that basis that you actually sell assets when they're performing extremely well which is always a very difficult thing to do as supposed to looking at it, I mean clearly, I guess looking from the margin profile of the business that you got to identify they're clearly sub par some of them perhaps structural that is obviously also very well performing businesses within the CRH and if somebody pays you a stupid price wouldn't you be disposing of it?", "Albert Manifold", "Again, may be I'll take the second and third questions Gregor with regards to the specifics on the U.S. infrastructure and also in terms of your comment on the portfolio and divestments, maybe you can fill in the detail of Ukraine.", "I don't have great insight, I'm going to share with you this morning with regard to what's going to happen in 2015 with long-term funding in the U.S. and we as part of associations are consistently working with politicians to set out for them what we believe is a very compelling case to increase spending with regard to infrastructure spend on the United States.", "Everybody we speak to agrees with us, nobody has any suggestion as to how we're going to do it because it's tied up U.S. politics which is very, very difficult. So I don't have any insight, other than to say that this constant roll forward is not sustainable because with price increases coming through, of course, you're getting net-net a slower and lower spend on actual infrastructure. And the key is that so much of the spent now has been focused just on repairing the infrastructure that's there. Remember that's 30 million people come to this country every 10 years, where is the houses, the schools, the roads, the hospitals that these people are going to live and work in, who is building those?", "That's why you are seeing the states make those changes that are necessary and the federal government as it always does eventually will step up to the place. And what we're doing is trying to catch the federal government as part of other members of the association to do that. But with regard to 2015, we've just got the Highway Trust Fund funding; they will begin transport in for next year. We just got the extension to May next year we continue our work with -- as soon as we know something we will tell you.", "And with regards to the portfolio, your interest point, I just want to clarify, we're not an asset manager of businesses. We're an industrial group that manages a broad diversified portfolio of businesses of selling into the building material sector that's what we do. We just happen to do so with one eye on the portfolio and actively manage the portfolio in a disciplined capital way. And in doing that and setting out our portfolio we were in very clear earlier this year through a number of business that we are selling that are actually good businesses that just don't fit with CRH.", "For a many good businesses that do not have the capability to step up in size and scale, but we can leverage the strength of that as we spoke earlier. So they are good businesses we are just the lone parent for them, and we will dispose those businesses in time as we find the right prices for them. So your comment is, we are only selling difficult business, no it's not, because as we step out in our portfolio no one ever backs 1000, no one ever gets 10 out of 10. There are business that we step out into there are good businesses. And in fact, if you look through the disposals over the last three or four, you'll see we have some very good disposals of some fine businesses, but again, we are just the lone parent for them. I think that will continue to be the case. Maeve any specific\u2026", "Maeve Carton", "The operating profit last year was in the region of \u20ac18 million, so there is a \u2013 I think \u2013 as we said earlier our expectation for the full year this year even though we're well ahead in the first half of the year is for the overall profits likely to be the same as last year in spite of the benefit of Mykolaiv coming in.", "Gregor Kuglitsch - UBS", "EBITDA.", "Maeve Carton", "EBITDA, in the region of 30 million.", "Albert Manifold", "I don't know, any other questions going forward today. Okay, well, there you go. Just in the front.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So just a couple from me, if I could please. On the net debt, I think last year the inflow is about 1.2 billion half to full year. Are you thinking a similar profile this time around or say probably slightly high profits obviously lower CapEx but any thoughts around year end net debt please. And then just the depreciation charge I think dropped 20 million first half on first half is that going to happen again in the second and because you're spending less than depreciation this year should we expect the depreciation drops again in 2015? Thanks.", "Maeve Carton", "If I deal with the depreciation first, the charge for \u2013 the first half of the year I was talking about 20 million part of that is the non-depreciation of those assets which were impaired at the end of last year that was about 275 million if the impairment charge related to plant and equipment last year, so having written those down the depreciation charge reduces. And then there is also some exchange impacts also with the U.S. dollar primarily U.S. dollar denomination depreciation cost is a little bit less than the first half.", "So both of those effects will flow through into the second half of the year and so we would expect the full year depreciation charge to be somewhere in region of twice the first half number. In relation to net debt and the movements that seasonal effect that I talked about in terms of the cash flow to the half year with the build up of net debt to the half year as we build up to gear up for the level of activity that traditionally reverse us significantly in the second half of the year and as usually a swing of somewhere between 0.5 billion, 600, 700 million of inflows in relation to operating cash in the second half of the period.", "So we would expect the net debt absent of further acquisitions and absent of any major divestments which are obviously harder to factor into it to be lower than last year.", "Albert Manifold", "Thanks Maeve. And just consent of time and there are people on the telephone on the wire as well. And may be we could take our first call from the telephone please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Yassine Touahri [Exane BNP Paribas]. Please go ahead sir.", "Yassine Touahri - Exane BNP Paribas", "Yes, good morning. So the first question, first on organic growth. So you discussed about organic growth in the first four months of the year in the U.S. and also in Europe could give us a figure for EMEA margin, I think you told us it was flat to slightly down in Europe, could you quantify? And what was it in the U.S. and also a question about the flow through. I am not sure I understand the 25% of flow through that you are discussing in H1 part and I think my calculation are wrong, but when I do the increase in EBITDA in H1 divided by the increase in sales, I cannot see the flow through of 34%, so if you could explain how you come to your 25% portfolio that would be very helpful. And that would be my two questions.", "Albert Manifold", "Okay. May be I'll answer the first question, partly answer the second question and then let Maeve give her comments on it.", "With regard to the organic growth, what we have said in May and June and continuing in June and July, we see the European business flat to minus 1% that specifically would be a range across all our businesses maybe recovering back a little bit better now during the month of July and August so that's broadly flat. I think it will really be September, October and we see delivery of those months because May, July and August are difficult months in Europe to call construction a lot of people are in vacation. Activity levels actually drop down to seasonal lows so it's hard to get a run through. But our sense in looking at our order books; our sense in talking to our customers is that it will be broadly flat for the remainder of the year against what was a very good finish to 2013.", "In the United States, the indications that we showed in our presentation this morning of the good growth we have seen both in May and June and we're saying confirm to you that's continuing now on July and in even August, we see that continuing because all the indicators tell us that they are in terms of our order books and indeed the margins in those order books.", "And before I pass the question on leverage and flow through over to Maeve, I suppose the one point I would make and that is that when you see what high fixed cost business is that normally have a high contribution per unit coming through. You see more volume coming through those businesses, obviously they're the once with the higher flow through as you call the higher operational leverage coming through. So it's very specific to the business, so we get a very different operational leverage coming through with our distribution businesses as we do with our heavy side aggregates businesses and concrete business and cement businesses and that's the big thing. But with regard to the actual specific you dealt already Maeve, maybe just to help people --", "Maeve Carton", "And just to follow-on on Albert's point there. In the first half of the year, the significant part that the flow through came in our Europe business and in particularly in our Europe materials businesses with our margins almost double in the first half of the year. So that fixed point being very obvious there. The 25% Yassine that we were talking about is the organic improvement. So it's an improvement of 99 million in organic EBITDA and that means excluding exchange impacts and also excluding the impacts of acquisitions and also the excluding the impact of oneself restructuring cost which can distort the numbers a little bit, so it's the underlying improvement in operating profits just approximately \u20ac99 million on the equivalent underlying increase in sales which is just under 400 million. So that gives you the 25% that we've been talking about. Those numbers are on Slide 12 of that presentation if you'd like to look through them.", "Albert Manifold", "Thanks Maeve. Can we take another call please?", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Robert Eason [Goodbody Stockbrokers]. Please go ahead.", "Robert Eason - Goodbody", "Hi, good morning. I am Robert Eason from Goodbody. I have just a few questions. If I can put you a bit more in the working capital after the strong performance in the first half can we expect there to be actually a working capital inflow for the full year. The working capital volume from the second half, is there something that you're doing structurally behind the scenes on working capital to improve the metrics on that front and if so can you just give us a bit more flavor on that?", "Just on the financial charge, can you just give us a bit of guidance what we should expect for the full year for the financial charge and just in relation to your asphalt operations in the U.S. can you just give us a bit more detail on bitumen costs and your winter storage and as a result your expectations for that input cost in terms of a year-on-year change?", "Albert Manifold", "Maeve, if you take the first two and I come back on the second.", "Maeve Carton", "Yes, okay. If I talk about the working capital first Robert the \u2013 last year we had an inflow in working capital of 118 million, I think that is reflected some good efforts by CRH and obviously, what we had at the first half of the year was a reduction in the seasonal outflow. So a strong performance as I was saying \u2013 as I was chatting through the presentation that is not delivered by any magic formula that's delivered by really hard work right across our 3600 locations where we just focus on the basics of running the business \u2013 of managing working capital well and that starts with credit control \u2013 its about you have to pay attention to inventory values and managing inventory well.", "One of the things that have been really gratifying right through the last number of years is that with that focus on the detail and the fundamentals of managing our business as well, we have seen no deterioration in our working capital statistics. So we have not seen any significant increase in the level of bad debt experienced and also we have seen things \u2013 the things we measure everyday like day sales outstanding days payable outstanding stock turnover.", "We've actually seen improvements in both the receivables and payables side of that equation and we found it harder to move the needle on inventory, but having said that our inventory metrics did not reduce either during that period. So we think that's really a testament to that good day-to-day management. So I have no magic bullet to talk to about that but just a good basic on this regard financial management at its best.", "I think for the year as a whole the outturn at the end of the year, it's one of the things that we find hardest to predict for the Group as a whole. It's very sensitive to trading in the last month or six weeks of the year. So last year you remember we had a very good finish to the year particularly in Europe and that meant activity was strong in the \u2013 just in those last few weeks. Depending on how things work \u2013 at the end of the year that will have an impact on the final outturn.", "In reality though I'll be very happy if we're reporting a small outflow in working capital for the year as a whole because that will be in the activity has picked up and this trend that we're seeing is continuing even stronger. So I can't predict the exact answer, but I think, I don't think the number will be a big figure in the cash flow for the year as a whole, which means I am confidently expecting a significant inflow from working capital in the second half of the year.", "Albert Manifold", "And the finance charge.", "Maeve Carton", "And the finance change. It was approximately 150 million for the first half of the year I'd expect that to be slightly lower in the second half of the year, so a number for the year as a whole slightly below last year is 300 million so somewhere in the 290, 295 million for the year as a whole.", "Albert Manifold", "Thanks Maeve. And specifically Robert with regard to your question on asphalt volumes and pricing cost and the deep margin, as we've said earlier the 3% volume increase we've seen in the first half of the year was very strong. I don't think it will be maintained at that level. I think there is some possibility we will see volumes up this year and last year on the back of growing residential, non-residential and specifically on the fact that we're seeing a little bit of more stays spending coming through the support of that business but we'll see how the year pans out.", "With regard to our winter-fill program and just to remind people who are listening in and in the room. We store at the end of the winter season about 860,000 tons of bitumen in our winter storage which was a pearl necklace all across the north of America. This is very expense for us to do, it costs $600 a ton to do that. It\u2019s just a touch below last year as costs and we think that, what we have in the tanks and give about the rack prices at this moment in time the marketplace will support our asphalt margins this year. So I hope that's clear for you Robert.", "Robert Eason - Goodbody", "Yes. Sorry, can I just have one follow up question, just in relation to Slide 25 where you outlined your equity accounts -- investments can you give us the full year EBITDA figure for 2013?", "Maeve Carton", "I'm going to give -- I think it was around 160 million for 2013. I'll check that Robert and come back to you if I am wrong with that. The operating \u2013 the PAT number for equity account and the numbers at the end of last year excluding impairment is 61 million. I think it's around 160 million mark of EBITDA.", "Robert Eason - Goodbody", "Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "I think one more question. I got some question from the Web, I want to get to I it. I'm just going with the tight time today. May be I can take one more question from the telephone please.", "Operator", "We'll now take our next question from Gerard Moore, Investec. Please go ahead.", "Gerard Moore - Investec", "Hi, good morning. I just got one quick question and that relates to the Americas materials business and more specifically the paving business within there. So wondering if you can give us an indication of how significant was the improvement in the margin in that business and where would you \u2013 where were the margins being at compared to normalized level what this business should be achieving? Thanks.", "Albert Manifold", "We saw a good up tick in the overall activity levels in our construction business, but margin slightly -- only slightly ahead of last year and we're not back to where we are. We're back about 70% to where they were pre-crisis but up tick in last year in terms of construction margins in the U.S. on our paving business.", "Gerard Moore - Investec", "Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "Okay. Just considering our time here and what I am going to do is, we had a number of questions coming from the Web and some which \u2013 among which I failed to answer Barry Dixon from Davy asked me a question on this, sort of outlook for Poland, one on the which I have been asked update on quality infrastructure spending and where that is given last year? And with regard to that we have any of the growth issue we're seeing in Poland is largely coming through in the back of better residential spend.", "The EU funding that's in place now from 2013 to 2020 commits about \u20ac17.6 billion of EU funds which will have to be matched with 50-50 by the Polish government out in particular projects -- infrastructure projects. They have been very slow to get those tenders awarded. There is a lot of tenders out there in this current year we estimate our current -- and we're running to almost about \u20ac1 billion will -- work actually will take place. So the significant amount of work that's still out there and I should say because of the rough sea and the red tape and because of funding constraints that Poland had but no longer has they actually left with 25% of funding from the previous trends behind them.", "So we think it bodes well, I think its getting better, I think we've learned some of the lessons from the last bidding more out there. So a lot of tenders that are out there that seems to be a lot more sensible and we think it bodes well that could be more 2015 than 2014.", "Also asked to comment on the capacity in India and the fact that in recent times, there was some publicity in Andhra Pradesh where our businesses are located on capacity reductions in India and we would have seen that last week whereby there were some reports, I think that India Cement in particular whereby they were reducing capacity in India in response to the over capacity in that market. And we saw that and we see that in the marketplace but that is just a natural evolution of old cement capacity being taken out of the marketplace because it's too high cost. The significant over capacity in India, overall capacity in India is about 350 million tons and demand is about 260, 270. And in fact that capacity is going to increase by about 40 million tons over the next three years. So the gap is actually going to widen because the markets only rolling about 5% or 7%.", "So what you see is effectively the survival of the fittest, the high cost producers are having to close down and shut down and that's what's been closed. In fact our business in India you may recall we invested in the business call Sree Jayajothi which added another cement plant to our many plants, so our volumes in fact in Andhra Pradesh and Southern India will grow this year up to about 5.3 million tons of sales from about 3.8 million tons last year.", "One question on just kind of what's driving the strength of our building materials business in Switzerland. I think I said that earlier on, as a result of very strong residential and particularly strong infrastructure work in the region where we are in Switzerland is quite regional specific, our businesses service effectively Zurich north and North Eastern part -- North Western part of Switzerland that's specific to us and what we're seeing is a dynamic in that particular part of Switzerland that's driving the good volume growth for us this year although prices are weak in Switzerland on the back of a strong Swiss Franc.", "The last comment we have is, could we please update on the Lemona acquisition and how trading is going in Spain? Lemona, you may have recall was a cement business that we swapped with Cementos Portland Valderrivas and we exited our equity stake in Uniland about 18 months or so. And we have this year started to put volume through that plant we've plugged it into our network very well. We're shipping about 300,000 tons out of Spain into the United Kingdom here and into our businesses in Belgium and that business is performing inline with expectations and reasonably well. I should say the prices in that part of Spain are probably the best part of Spain as well so it's held up quite well.", "My overall comment on Spain is that the Spanish cement volumes are down again this year. We don't have huge exposure to it because when we were buying both Lemona it was effectively an export business for the next five years and I think Spanish cement probably will be about 10.5 million tons this year which -- when you consider that was probably a normalized level it should be about 25 million tons going forward. But we do see some signs of life and recovery coming back into those markets in time. It's true that Spain is too good and too strong in economy to be at 10 million tons cement market with construction to where it is. And I think they're making some structural reforms that will facilitate and allow that growth come through."], "Symbol": "CRH Plc (NYSE:", "Period": "Q22014", "Month": "08", "Year": "2014", "Date": "2014-08-19", "Target": 0},

I\u2019m the Chief Executive of CRH and I\u2019m joined here this morning by our Finance Director, Maeve Carton. And for the next hour or so what we want to do is take you through our results for the first half of the year, talk to you about an acquisition we\u2019ve just announced this morning of C.R. Laurence deal in the United States, talk to you about some of the key issues we\u2019re focusing on at this moment in time and our outlook for the rest of the year.", "As usual, we\u2019re going to do Q&A at the very end, probably get about half an hour or so of that, and we\u2019ll have questions from the room and we\u2019ll have calls down the line as well. We\u2019re taking a slightly different approach to it this morning. We\u2019re going to show a video where we\u2019re going to show you a little bit about our business, but I\u2019ll talk to you more about that as you go through the presentation.", "So to start, what I want to do is just maybe just show a couple of slides myself, which just talks about some of the key issues, the key areas of focus that we\u2019re working on in CRH. And none of these should be a surprise to any of you. What we\u2019re looking at in CRH, and we spoke about last year, is we very clearly said that, as the cycle was turning, we were focused on bringing margins and returns back to peak in the quarter this current cycle. ", "And I\u2019m glad to say that we showed satisfactory progress in the first six months of the year, with all six divisions showing an improved margin performance and, indeed, an improved performance in returns. So good to see that coming through. So a continuation of that.", "What we\u2019re also seeing, of course, is the continuation of the portfolio management that we spoke about last year. You will recall that in October of 2013 \u2013 November of 2013 we spoke about a strategic review over our business and at the end of that we identified \u20ac1.5 billion to \u20ac2 billion worth of businesses probably wanted to dispose of and reallocate that capital back into our businesses. Well, we\u2019ve disposed about \u20ac1 billion of the program. We identified about \u20ac1.5 billion to \u20ac2 billion. We\u2019ve \u20ac1 gone.", "And we\u2019ve happily reallocated that back into some of the big transactions we\u2019ve done this year; LafargeHolcim and now this morning C.R. Laurence. And they are earnings enhancing, returns enhancing and value creating for our shareholders. So we\u2019ve made good progress there and I want to reassure that\u2019s a continuing part of our business going forward. Of course, having done two big deals now in the first eight months of this year our focus clearly should be, and will be, on integration of those businesses CRH.", "Integration in terms of deriving the synergies, arriving at those synergies, getting those, capturing those. But also driving performance and focusing on those businesses because they\u2019re fine businesses with great growth platforms: four in LafargeHolcim and now one other one in Americas Products.", "So five new growth platforms. But we need to integrate them, bed them down, run them at the rigor that we run the traditional heritage businesses in CRH and, of course, then use those as growth platforms as we go forward. And finally, all of this done against the backdrop of the strong financial discipline that we expect within CRH; the strong rigor that we bring to our businesses.", "And, again, this morning we want to reconfirm to you the comments that we made in February of this year that we are intent on returning our debt metrics back to normalized levels at the end of 2016, even after doing this $1.3 billion deal because that\u2019s what you expect from CRH. Both Maeve and I will talk more about that later on during the presentation.", "Well, you\u2019ll have seen the numbers this morning that are well out there at this stage. Sales, EBITDA and margins ahead, so good progress in the first six months of the year. And really, as an operating guy, an operations guy, I look at the constant currency basis and you can see modest recovery in the first less important half of the year in terms of sales revenues ahead 3% but very good leverage drop through to the bottom line, leverage of 26% coming through to the bottom line.", "So very satisfactory to see that coming through, and again an improvement in margin. Of course, the business has benefited from positive tailwinds on currency and you can see that coming through in the reported numbers. But as I focus on, I focus on the right-hand side of that page and we\u2019re delighted again to confirm yet again a further year of delivery and dividends. The 31st straight year on interim dividends confirmed again at \u20ac0.185.", "And we\u2019ll talk more about that, I\u2019m sure, in the Q&A. But we do appreciate the importance of dividends to our shareholders. We appreciate the fact that you have supported us through five difficult years of the downturn. We have delivered dividends and maintained it at level. But, as the business grows and the profitability grows and the cash growth, we know the expectation on dividend and we\u2019ll review that again when we come back to look at this in the full year in February.", "What we want to do now is actually \u2013 unusually we\u2019re going to try and give you a sense of the breadth of CRH. We\u2019re not a typical building materials business. We\u2019re not a pure play. We\u2019re not a pure cement play where it\u2019s easy to say we buy and sell grey powder. We\u2019re not a pure distribution play. We\u2019re a broad portfolio of businesses across regions and sectors and sometimes it can be difficult to convey that to you.", "So what we want to do is we want to bring you to our businesses. So what we have done is we\u2019ve made a video, which lasts about 15 minutes, in which I and my colleagues who deliver these results will talk to you about their businesses, from their businesses and show you the breadth of their businesses, the products that they sell, how they produce them and, of course, how they deliver the results for the first half of the year.", "So we\u2019ll let this play and at the end of it I\u2019m going to come back, Maeve\u2019s going to talk about the components of the profit performance and the cash conversion and I\u2019m going to talk to you about some of the key things before we go into Q&A and the outlook for the year.", "[Video Presentation]", "Albert Manifold", "CRH is the largest building materials company in North America. With operations in all 50 states and throughout Canada we are the leading supplier of materials and products to the infrastructure, commercial and residential construction sectors. We\u2019ve seen continued positive momentum through the first half of the year. Residential and non-residential demand has been robust while the infrastructure market remains broadly stable.", "This is feeding through to health volume increases across all our businesses in which we\u2019re delivering solid margin expansion as a result of our disciplined pricing and cost control as well as a favorable currency effect. Looking now at each of our U.S. divisions in turn. Our Americas Materials division had a very strong start in what is the seasonally less significant part of the trading year. Here\u2019s Randy Lake, CEO of that division, to tell you more.", "Randy Lake", "I\u2019m proud to be able to share details of our strong performance during the first half of the year. This is a testament to the hard work of everyone at Americas Materials. It\u2019s been real team effort and puts us in a great position for the second half of 2015.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Americas Materials has had a great first half, with strong demand leading to healthy volume and price gains across our main regions and product areas. This is particularly the case in the central, western and mid-Atlantic markets. Yes, we too have had a few setbacks due to bad weather in Texas and the Midwest but overall we\u2019re very happy with the trends that we\u2019re seeing across the board.", "As you know, our business is predominantly about renewal of aging infrastructure and with our leading market positions in well-populated regions we have the capability to deliver on projects both large and small. A great example in the Northeast right now is a project to provide 250,000 cubic yards of high-performance concrete and 335,000 tons of asphalt to the reconstruction of one of the busiest runways at JFK airport in New York.", "This solid momentum in our markets is translating into significant profit. The result of tight cost control and commercial management that we\u2019ve continued since the downturn, we\u2019re really seeing those efforts pay off now and you can see it in our margins. The infrastructure sector, which is 60% of our business, is largely stable.", "Increasing investment by state and local governments is offsetting some short-term funding uncertainty at the federal level. Interesting to note that 38 states have now brought forward supplementary funding initiatives, of which 29 are either in process or pending. We\u2019re also seeing a substantial uptick in highway contract awards, which is feeding a robust pipeline of projects across the country.", "Randy Lake", "In the second half of the year we see strong backlogs continuing to drive ongoing activity throughout the business. I look forward to updating you all again early in the New Year.", "Albert Manifold", "Turning now to our products division. For the first half of 2015, I\u2019ve seen a marked improvement on the weather-affected start to 2014. Here\u2019s Keith Haas, CEO of Americas Products, to give you a sense of the trends we\u2019re seeing in these businesses.", "Keith Haas", "I\u2019m delighted to update you on what\u2019s been driving the strong performance of Americas Products during the first half of the year. Americas Products delivered a solid performance in the first half, particularly in the Sun Belt and West Coast regions, driven by steady improvement in both residential and non-residential markets.", "The residential sector continues to improve in all regions, with particular strength in multi-family construction. U.S. housing starts are at a post-crisis high, with a welcome improvement in the larger, single family segment. Meanwhile, continued job gains and rising consumer confidence are driving an increase in home improvement demand; a trend that we hear echoed by our large retail customers as well.", "The non-residential market is showing solid growth. Leading indicators, such as the Architectural Billings Index, have been consistently positive in recent months and we are seeing improvement across the board. It\u2019s interesting to note that it\u2019s not just about new build and non-res. There are many projects to repurpose and refurbish the existing building stock to suit current usage requirements, which also generates demand for our products.", "While our strong out turn in the second half of last year means that the comparatives are tougher for us in the remaining six months of 2015, we\u2019re focused on continuing to drive performance through innovation and collaboration across our businesses. And I\u2019m confident that we can deliver further gains in the second half of the year in both volume and margin across all our businesses. Our backlogs are strong and I\u2019m encouraged to see capacity utilization rates improving across our three product groups.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "As you can see, in addition to the factors currently driving our strong performance, the indicators show that we can expect continuing positive developments in the second half and beyond. I\u2019d like to thank our team in Americas Products and I look forward to updating you on our full-year performance at the beginning of next year.", "Albert Manifold", "What you\u2019re seeing here are the benefits of CRH\u2019s balanced at work. While Randy\u2019s business is 60% exposed to infrastructure, Keith\u2019s business is 45% exposed to residential and a further 45% exposed to non-residential. This gives us our desired breadth of exposure to different end uses in different sectors in the markets in which we operate.", "And now to our Americas distribution division, a business that is also seasonally biased towards the second half of the year. Here, Bob Feury and his team delivered an increase in EBITDA in a tough market, supported by some top-line growth and a strong focus on cost management and commercial excellence initiatives.", "A particular highlight has been our transition to a regional service center model; effectively transforming the business from managing branches to managing markets. This has delivered improved working capital, cash flow, and reduced costs and accelerated growth through the addition of low-cost service centers. While the RMI-focused residential roofing market has been slow, the commercial roofing market is more robust and has driven strong results in the first half of the year.", "Order books are in good shape as we look ahead to the second half of the year, bolstered by some storm-related repair work across the Midwest. The wallboard market continues to bring modest volume and pricing gains, with the West and Northeast delivering particularly good growth. So, overall, good economic momentum in North America that we\u2019re all very well positioned to benefit from. With all our businesses seeing demand on the rise, there\u2019s nowhere else we would rather be than here in these markets at this point in the cycle.", "Let me now touch on our businesses across Europe. Our heavyside business is resource backed and vertically integrated, with leading market positions in cement, aggregate, ready-mixed concrete and concrete products across generally stable Northern European economies.", "You will have heard me refer to our lightside businesses as being an innovation machine. Here we create unique engineering solutions to aid the construction process. Our distribution platform then caters for the needs of the small and medium-sized builders through our general builders\u2019 merchants, our specialized central heating and plumbing businesses and also our leading DIY brands.", "Overall, we\u2019ve a really strong footprint in Europe and, while market conditions have been mixed, we are now seeing some positive signs of recovery. Looking at our trading performance. Against the mixed economic backdrop and market challenges in some of our largest markets, for example Switzerland and Finland, profit from continuing operations was ahead of last year.", "This is a testament to the resilience of our European business and highlights the benefit of our balanced portfolio. A continued focus on cost management is also helping us deliver profitable growth and we\u2019ve taken the right steps to ensure that all our businesses are well positioned for the recovery phase of the cycle. Let\u2019s look at each of our European divisions in turn. First to Europe Heavyside and to Managing Director, Ken McKnight.", "Ken McKnight", "I\u2019m pleased to have the opportunity to update you on the performance of Europe Heavyside, where we have worked hard to produce a steady first-half result; this despite challenging circumstances in some of our core markets.", "In Western Europe the recovery in the Irish construction sector continues to gather momentum, with domestic and export demand driving healthy cement volumes. The UK market is also performing strongly and in the past few weeks we have commenced the integration of our newly-acquired assets from LafargeHolcim, which gives us our strong position in this market.", "Our structural and concrete products businesses in the Netherlands are also performing well, benefiting from a revival in residential new-build construction as well as further commercial excellence initiatives to deliver a good operating leverage. We are particularly proud of our recent success in securing a three-year contract to supply all of the landscaping products for the Amsterdam Municipality; a testament to our quality products, competitive pricing and sustainability record.", "We have, however, faced headwinds on a few fronts. In Switzerland a cooling in the residential market together with a strong Swiss franc has resulted in challenging trading conditions. In Finland markets remained weak in the early months of the year. However, we are now beginning to see an improving demand backdrop.", "In Eastern Europe, where we are this year celebrating 20 years in Poland, our cement and downstream businesses are performing well in competitive markets. The situation in Ukraine remains uncertain, though our volumes are holding up quite well. Again, in this region we continue to win contracts to supply major infrastructural developments.", "Recent examples include a contract for 1 million cubic meters of concrete for a railway station in Poland and another is our involvement in a world [indiscernible] Overall, I think it\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s pricing pressure across the region but as volumes recover we expect prices to follow.", "Given our successful efforts to manage cost during the downturn, I am confident we are in a good position to capitalize on this recovery. I look forward to coming back early in the new year to give you a full update on the trading of Europe Heavyside.", "Albert Manifold", "The main takeaway here is the importance and value of our broad footprint in Europe, demonstrating a key element of our strategy at work. And now for a few words on Ken\u2019s lightside segment.", "Ken McKnight", "As with most other European divisions, it\u2019s been a good first half for lightside too, with sales from continuing operations ahead of last year, despite lower project activity and fewer working days. Our core countries contended with a mixed economic backdrop too and this is reflected in performance.", "For example, Halfen, our engineered accessories business in Germany, had a slow start to the year but has since improved and the outlook for the second half is more positive. Halfen was also recently included as one of the top 100 most innovative medium-sized companies in Germany; recognizing its continued growth in new products and solutions.", "In the Netherlands we\u2019re seeing encouraging signs in the residential and new-build market. The Swiss and Belgian businesses were broadly stable, while France remains extremely competitive. Meanwhile, Ancon, our engineered accessories business in the UK, continues to deliver strong growth and good for enterprise for its exceptional achievements in international trade; its second Queen\u2019s Award in three years.", "Albert Manifold", "And, finally, to Europe Distribution, where I\u2019ll hand you over to our Managing Director Marc St. Nicolaas for an update.", "Marc St. Nicolaas", "Despite challenges in some of our markets, Europe distribution has continued to deliver a solid top-line performance in the first half of 2015. Throughout our businesses we have been pushing a range of performance excellence initiatives, particularly in procurement, customer service and productivity. The impact of these initiatives is really beginning to come through.", "Our businesses are largely exposed to repair and maintenance demand, which, in mature European economies, typically represents 50% to 60% of construction spend. With more than 650 stores in six countries across Western Europe, we are well positioned for growth as economies improve. For us the first half of the year was really about the Netherlands and our sanitary heating and plumbing business in Belgium, Germany and Switzerland.", "In the Netherlands, our largest market, we posted a strong performance in the first six months; driven by a recovering residential backdrop. We are seeing some really encouraging signs here. The number of housing transactions is up, house prices are rising and consumer confidence is improving from month-to-month. We have driven top-line growth by expanding our private-label offerings and we have also implemented stock-availability initiatives to ensure stronger customer service.", "I\u2019m happy to say that this has enabled our businesses to outperform the underlying market during this period. Another highlight was the solid performance of our sanitary heating and plumbing businesses in all our markets. Belgium, in particular, was strongly ahead, with our consolidation strategy really paying off and with repair and maintenance activity remaining resilient, despite a more subdued residential market. So, overall, a good first half for Europe Distribution, leaving us well positioned for the second half of the year.", "Albert Manifold", "So, as you\u2019ve seen from the numbers and as my colleagues have outlined, we\u2019re still in the very early stages of recovery in Europe but our actions on reining in cost during the downturn and our strong footprint leave us well positioned for the coming upturn. We\u2019ve already seen the benefits of increased utilization levels in the United States and we look forward to further benefits in Europe as demand returns to more normalized levels.", "[End of Video Presentation]", "And I suppose that really is the story of the first half for CRH; each of the businesses in the United States and, indeed, in Europe delivering at different points of the cycle. And, as I said there, really the benefits of the work that we did in 2011, 2012 and 2013 in taking costs out and managing our businesses well and reorganizing coming through now at this stage.", "We\u2019re seeing very good leverage coming through our U.S. businesses; above and beyond what we should have expected in normalized times. And at the start of what\u2019s the recovery in Europe, we\u2019re seeing that starting to come through. If you look at our European businesses, at three big countries in Europe, being the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland, what we\u2019re seeing \u2013 and Finland, of course, we put with that as well, we\u2019re seeing a very mixed position with volumes ahead both in Poland and the Netherlands, but volumes well back in Switzerland and Finland and yet, against that backdrop, we show an improvement in profitability.", "So that\u2019s how the six divisions have performed and I think this chart shows further \u2013 we\u2019re focusing on the idea of improving margins and very satisfying to see all six divisions showing an improvement in margin and, I should say, although we don\u2019t show it there, an improvement in returns.", "So you\u2019ve heard from the guys how the divisions have done and now maybe it\u2019s time to pull it together from a Group perspective and see what the components of the profit and how that\u2019s changed over the first six months of this year to last year and, indeed, how we\u2019ve converted it into cash. Maeve?", "Maeve Carton", "Thanks, Albert. Don\u2019t you love that slide with all the arrows going up? It\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019m going to talk about the components of performance, as Albert said, and that strong performance, with all those arrows going up, is really the main contributor to our financial performance this year with sales growing to \u20ac9.4 billion, an EBITDA up \u20ac50 million; a 10% increase in overall EBITDA.", "That positive performance from the operations, though, does offset a couple of negatives in the numbers, which I\u2019ll talk about now. The first negative is actually the other side of a positive; the positive being the divestment program which, as Albert said earlier, is well underway. We\u2019ve generated proceeds of \u20ac1 billion from divestments since this time last year.", "But, of course, as those divestments happen, we lose the sales and profits from those businesses. So the first negative, if you like, is the loss of \u20ac34 million of EBITDA from those divested businesses. The second negative a once-off item where we\u2019ve made a provision in the first-half numbers for a fine levied by the Swiss Competition Authority, which they announced during this year.", "The Competition Authority, or the Commission, did not publish the basis of their finding. We think it\u2019s ill-founded and when they publish the basis, which we expect sometime in October, we expect to be vigorously defending our position and appealing that fine. But, in the meantime, in accordance with good, prudent financial practices, we\u2019ve made full provision for our share of that fine in the first half of the year. That\u2019s fine, of course, against the whole industry; \u20ac32 million being our share of it.", "The positive currency impact is a factor in the performance for this year with particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc helping to contribute to improvement and, as you can see there, a \u20ac59 million positive impact from that. But the key part of the financial performance is, of course, that strong continuing operations, which delivered \u20ac69 million of incremental EBITDA on sales of \u20ac248 million.", "That \u20ac69 million is a nice big number in itself but what\u2019s more important about it is that it represents an operating leverage of 28% on those incremental sales. So we\u2019re really seeing the benefits, as Albert said, of all the hard work during the downturn, of our balanced portfolio and our good positions in North America and in the more stable markets of Europe and we\u2019re benefiting from the economic momentum there.", "So, overall, a story of strong operating leverage. Now this couldn\u2019t be a results announcement without me talking about the cash flows either. And the cash flows in the first half of the year have a characteristic of being an outflow rather than inflow at operating level because, of course, in the construction industry, which means a lot of it happens outside in weather conditions, the big season for us is the middle of the year.", "So during the first half of the year our working capital levels are building up and so at the half-year typically we have an outflow which, for the first half of this year, was \u20ac613 million. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re looking at that saying, well, that\u2019s all very well but it\u2019s \u20ac173 million higher than last year. But, if you look closely at the movement in the numbers, the big contributor to that increased outflow this year is \u20ac125 million of extra capital expenditure in the first half being \u20ac338 million.", "Most of that increase comes from our U.S. operation where, as the year is progressing, we\u2019re reinvesting and investing in our businesses in the U.S. to make sure they\u2019re well positioned to benefit from that good momentum, which Randy and Keith talked about. The other thing I would draw your attention to for the year is the working capital figure.", "As I was saying, the first half of the year typically in our business sees us building up working capital for the busy season. And I think the thing that is important about this for this year is that the number, the outflow, is actually pretty similar to last year. It\u2019s still a big number but similar to last year, even though our activity is improving. So we\u2019re seeing sales go up, profits go up but the outflow from working capital staying pretty stable. So that\u2019s really the effects of our strong cash management processes and capabilities coming through for the rest of the year.", "Albert Manifold", "Well I think, as Maeve says, no one likes to see a cash outflow like that. But the only time as a Chief Executive or, indeed, as a senior manager of the business where we are happy to see that kind of an outflow is when it\u2019s for capital expenditure supporting growth. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re seeing now at this stage. We are getting to capacity utilization issues out West in our products business, in particular, supporting residential and non-residential in the United States.", "And, again, that CapEx is supporting that growth in business. So it\u2019s the only time I\u2019m happy to see it but it\u2019s good because it\u2019s the future of our business. What I\u2019d like to do now is maybe just talk about three or four key themes that we\u2019re focusing on in CRH during the remainder of this year and, indeed, next year; some of the new to you, some of them not so new. And the first one is this issue of the reallocation of capital.", "Last year we were very clear. We set out our stall and we said we want to be identified businesses \u20ac1.5 billion to \u20ac2 billion worth of businesses, we set out our stall and we said, we want to be identified businesses \u20ac1.5 billion to \u20ac2 billion worth of businesses that we were going to sell over the next three to five years. Not that they were bad businesses.", "Some of them weren\u2019t great, some of them were very good businesses but they just didn\u2019t fit the returns profile that we wanted in our business or we couldn\u2019t see ourselves growing those businesses within those sectors. Well, we\u2019re very happy to say we\u2019ve had very good progress in the first half of this year, another \u20ac670 million of divestments in the first six months, bringing our total divestments in 12 months to over \u20ac1 billion.", "So well down the road towards achieving that goal. And, of course, that money has been redeployed back into very good acquisitions. When I look at some of the areas where we sold, businesses which are in lower growth areas, particularly in some of the parts of Europe, where perhaps they were in heavy concrete-type businesses, which would have seen strong growth in the early 2000s, but have run out road, we\u2019ve reallocated that capital back into the higher growth businesses of LafargeHolcim and now today into C.R. Laurence.", "So good concepts, good ideas in terms of boosting our returns and our margin. And I want to assure you that we are seeing this now really as an embedded part of how we do our business in CRH going forward and an embedded part of any acquisition we do, be it LafargeHolcim or C.R. Laurence or acquisitions in the future going forward.", "As I talk about LafargeHolcim, maybe perhaps what I might do is just bring you up to speed as to where we are. Now, just to remind those of you in the room or on the lines, this is a deal that we signed in February of this year; $5 billion of sales, $750 million of EBITDA and a $6.5 billion price ticket that came with it.", "So a very big deal for us. But it wasn\u2019t one group. This is a industry by business that we\u2019re sold by Lafarge and Holcim as part of their merger. So they never actually worked together. And, in fact, it was very interesting when we pulled all the managers of these businesses together for the first time, most of them had never met each other.", "Well this was not one group. We described it as four growth platforms. And all those growth platforms are now a part of CRH, with the exception of the Philippines. That deal has not closed yet and should close some time towards the backend of September or early October at the latest. But the Americas and European parts of that business have closed in late July/early August. Now we have only had this business for three weeks. We have our feet under the table and all we can do is confirm to you that the trading environment in the countries that we\u2019re operating in seems to be broadly in line with our expectations. But what we will do is we\u2019ll update you fully in November, when we have our feet under the table and when we get a sense of what those businesses are doing.", " The only good thing about the frustration of the last six months of not being able to get our hands on these businesses is that we\u2019ve been able to prepare. And good collaboration between the businesses and we hit the ground running on August 3 with seven individual integration teams across the platforms, one in each of the platforms. ", "So each of the divisional teams in CRH and in LafargeHolcim businesses have integration teams. And they\u2019re working on the things that you would expect, such as commercial management, procurement, purchasing, engineering, managing the production sense, IT, talent management, all those things you would expect to be working on the ground. And all of that\u2019s happening in each of the divisions and there\u2019s oversight at a Group level. I and Maeve and, indeed, Mark Towe, our other executive director in the United States, with some other senior experienced executives sit on an advisory board, giving oversight to all of this. ", "So we are really getting into the teeth of this now. I expect the process to take somewhere between six to 12 months, probably six to nine months, actually. And we\u2019ll update you, as I say to you, as we go through this in November. And, again, this morning we want to confirm to you that the \u20ac90 million synergy that we spoke about in February, we\u2019re reconfirming that target this morning. And, hopefully, there\u2019s some upside in that as we go forward. ", "I also want to talk to you about the C.R. Laurence acquisition that we\u2019ve announced this morning. There were four growth platforms with LafargeHolcim that came along and go on top of our existing business. And now we have a fifth new growth platform. We\u2019ve been talking to this business for about 10 years. We know these people really well. I met Don Friese for the first time about seven years ago. And this is a very complementary business to our Oldcastle BuildingEnvelope business. ", "And let me just take a moment to explain to you what BuildingEnvelope actually means. It\u2019s actually a glazing business or a glazing systems business that supplies glass, effectively to the non- residential market and a bit to residential. Our business in the United States is a $1 billion business; EBITDA of north of $100 million. It\u2019s a very fine business, very good returns and it posted strong growth again this year.", "What this C.R. Laurence business does is that it actually sells products that are complementary to that business. Our heritage business largely sells glass, not float glass but what we do is we buy in float glass and we shape and bend and cut and mold it and send it back out to our customers within 24 hours in the way that they want. So we sell glass. What C.R. Laurence does, it sells all the products that a glazing contractor or a glass shop need to put the glass in place.", "So all the extruded aluminum, which we manufacture, by the way, as well, and all the things, the doors, the hinges, the handles, the handrails that go with any kind of a glass application, this is what C.R. Laurence sells. So it\u2019s entirely complementary with our business that we have at the moment.", "So now we have a complete package to sell to the one customer. This market sector in the United States is about $25 billion market sector. Combined, these two businesses will have revenues of about $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, and EBITDA are north of $222 million, $225 million. It\u2019s a very fine business.", "We paid a rich price for this. It\u2019s 11 times EBITDA. We like to sell businesses for that; we don\u2019t like to buy businesses for that. But it comes with a very significant synergy element to it and they\u2019re easy-win synergies. There\u2019s $40 million of synergies, at least, identified in this business. But a lot of them are just purely on the integration of supply chain. And let me explain what that means.", "What we do is we\u2019re a very big manufacturer in our OBE business of extruded aluminum. So all the aluminum that holds the large glass panels in place in office blocks, in stores, in shops, we extrude and we manufacture that. Actually, C.R. Laurence buys about 10 million kilos of extruded aluminum every year and almost none of it from us.", "So we will shift across that supply back into Oldcastle BuildingEnvelope. Likewise, we buy a significant amount of the products, the hardware. All the accessories that the glazier needs to put the glass in place, we buy from other people other than C.R. Laurence. So we will then bring that into the OBE business. So we\u2019ll cross sell and merge the procurement channels together.", "That alone will deliver about $25 million of synergies to the two businesses. Secondly, of course, we\u2019ve got some restructuring and reorganization to do. We\u2019ve both got complementary footprints in terms of the geographies we serve and, indeed, customer base. And that should save about $5 million on an annual basis.", "And then, of course, there\u2019s pull-through demand. We thought we were very good in Oldcastle BuildingEnvelope. With 15,000 customers, we turn our business around in 24 hours. C.R. Laurence has 60,000 customers, 60,000 glaziers and glass shops around North America. Their average order size is $350. They process 7,000 orders per day and they ship within 24 to 48 hours.", "This is as much a distribution business as it is a manufacturing business. And what we now have access to is all those glazing market outlets through our glass business that [indiscernible] bring to us. And we believe conservatively that will bring another $10 million business EBITDA business to us.", "So that\u2019s how we conservatively get to the $40 million and we think we\u2019ll get there within two years. Not only that is, we\u2019re seeing this being exposed to the high growth non-residential and residential growth markets of the United States. And if I had to pick any markets where I want to be exposed to in the world, I would want to be exposed to the U.S. residential and non-residential market.", "It\u2019s growing this year at a clip of about 6% per annum. I don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon. So well positioned for organic growth, good position for synergies and we think some upside on those numbers as well. ", "Just looking at the financials. As I said to you, we paid 11 times earnings but post synergies of $40 million it gets down to 8 times. And, in fact, with a bit of growth coming through there we think we\u2019ll deliver very well. I should say, though, it is still earnings and returns accretive from year one. So a great fit for our business and a testament to the strength of CRH that we can handle all of this out of our existing resources. The cash conversion we see in our business is coming to the fore again. So a good deal for us. And, of course, the key issue for us is to move forward and integrate that.", "And that really is the focus now for CRH over the next 12 to 18 months. We\u2019ve done two very big transactions this year. Lafarge Holcim, done through our heavyside and materials businesses and now our products business in the United States. A completely separate part of the CRH, the broad balance we have within CRH. But the focus of both of those businesses has got to be on integration. And that\u2019s where our focus will be over the next 12 to 18 months. Applying the rigor and discipline, the way we run our businesses in CRH, to those businesses but also keeping our eyes and ears open, because we learn every time we buy a business. And there\u2019s lots to learn from Lafarge and Holcim and lots to learn from C.R. Laurence. ", "But, at the end of it, we\u2019ll be ready and we\u2019ll be back in business again for further acquisitions. But for the next 12 to 18 months we will do deals, of course, because small deals coming to CRH bolt on to what we do. But all of those deals will be funded out of divestment proceeds. ", "Our focus now is on the integration of these two businesses for the next year or so. But maybe, having done all these deals, what I might now ask is Maeve to explain exactly how the debt profile of our business is going to change and be adapted to the spending for the deals and also then, of course, exactly what that means for our debt metrics at the end of 2015.", "Maeve Carton", "Well, before talking about the future debt profile, have a quick look at the debt profile as at June 30. Albert talked just there about a rigor and a discipline and he not only stole my thunder with the slide but stole my thunder in terms of what I was going to describe the way we think about finances. A real rigor and adjustment to the way we think about finances and manage them. And I think a couple of the actions that we took in 2015 demonstrate that; that planning ahead, being sensible, prudent and whatever. ", "The first was in February when, with the announcement of the LafargeHolcim transaction, we also announced a share placing, in which we issued 74 million shares and raised \u20ac7.6 billion of cash. That was part of prudent planning for that acquisition. So, at the same time as announcing it, securing a significant part of the funding upfront. And then also negotiating with our bankers the financing for the remainder, which got paid a few weeks ago. The second step was the raising of $1.75 billion in the U.S. bond markets in 2015. We hadn\u2019t been to the U.S. bond markets for a number of years so we were delighted to get back in there. Our bonds\u2019 activity in the last few years have been in Europe.", "And, with our return to the U.S., we were delighted to have such a demand for our bonds that the amount we raised matched the highest ever amount we ever raised in the bond market. And probably even more interesting was that that activity in the market was taking advantage of the current very low interest rate. So the 10-year tranche that we got out of that $1.75 billion was at the lowest rate we\u2019ve ever paid in the U.S. bond market.", "So, again, a very satisfactory outcome, planning for the debt maturities. As you can see there, those actions are part of our planning for making sure that debt maturities are evenly spaced out and not going to put the Group under pressure at any given time, but also organizing for the future in terms of securing long-term interest rates at the current low level.", "We used $1 billion of that $1.75 billion to buy back early bonds that would have normally been repaid in 2016. That gave rise to a \u20ac38 million hit in the first-half profits but will secure lower interest costs in 2015 and 2016. So, overall, our financial discipline and approach is to support our commitment to our investment grade rating.", "So I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering, how can we maintain that commitment to investment grade rating after the amount of money we\u2019ve just spent on acquisitions in the case of C.R. Laurence and LafargeHolcim. So, in order to explain how we believe \u2013 how we can be confident about that, I\u2019ve gone back to the yearend debt at the end of last year, just because the middle-of-the-year debt can be distorted by those cash outflows that I was talking about, which are seasonal in nature, which represented a multiple of approximately 1.5 times our EBITDA for 2014.", "If you layer onto that the cost of debt for the LafargeHolcim transaction, our debt before C.R. Laurence had gone up to \u20ac7.4 billion on a pro-forma basis. And then when you add on C.R. Laurence the debt is \u20ac8.6 billion. And when you add the EBITDA of CRH, C.R. Laurence and LafargeHolcim the multiple is 3.5 times. That is a level that\u2019s significantly outside the comfort zone for me, for sure, given that CRH\u2019s long-term average net debt-to-EBITDA number is somewhere in the 2 times to 3.5 times range, which is also consistent with our credit rating. So our commitment is to get our metrics back down to those normalized levels by the end of 2016.", "And the last part of this waterfall shows you why we\u2019re confident in saying that we can do that. We need to reduce that \u20ac8.6 billion of debt down to around \u20ac6 billion and that will get us below the 2.5 times EBITDA. And so we need \u20ac2.5 billion of cash inflows or debt reduction. And we\u2019ve split how we think about that into cash from operations and cash from divestment. On the operations side we\u2019ve put in \u20ac1 billion here and we believe that\u2019s a conservative assumption.", "If you look back at last year, in 2014, you remember our operating cash flow for 2014 showed \u20ac900 million of operating cash flow generated by our business. That translated into a reduction in overall net debt, after acquisitions and divestments and dividends, of \u20ac700 million. So if you put that in context, \u20ac1 billion over the two-year period 2015 and 2016 certainly feels achievable. ", "The second item is the proceeds from divestments. Albert has already talked about the fact that we\u2019ve generated \u20ac1 billion of divestments so far since this time last year when we announced our divestment program. So of that \u20ac1.5 billion, we\u2019ve already delivered \u20ac1 billion. So we\u2019re well on track to deliver that. ", "Albert Manifold", "Plus all of those numbers there that Maeve was talking about were from a base 2014. The \u20ac1 billion of cash that\u2019s been generated from operations there is actually on a 2014 number. Of course, it doesn\u2019t factor in the growth we\u2019re seeing in our business in 2014 nor, indeed, what we anticipate during 2016. And it\u2019s a very clear statement b y Maeve and by me and by the senior management. We are absolutely committed to restoring our debt level to those levels by the end of next year and we\u2019re confident that we can. ", "Just to conclude this part of the presentation, I just wanted to talk a little bit about the remainder of this year and how we see the overall year ending up. You\u2019ve heard all our guys in their narratives talk about how they see the second half of the year. ", "Well, Europe we see is going to continue on the way that the first half went. And, in fact, July and August has been exactly that. Very much a bit of a mixed bag but we\u2019re holding our own on costs, smart commercial management, being very tight about our businesses. And we think the second half in Europe is going to be broadly in line with the second half last year, which, by the way, was very good.", "United States had a cracking second half in 2015 and it\u2019s going to be very difficult to match that, yet the momentum of the business is strong. Volumes are good, very tight commercial management, very tight cost control; all of the things Randy and Keith talked about of all the good work done over the previous years are still there now and the leverage is very good. And we do believe with that momentum, with that demand structure, with our management of the businesses, that we will see growth in our EBITDA in the United States in the second half of 2015.", "And all of that leads us, when you put it together, that we think we\u2019re going to see good progress in the second half in EBITDA for CRH as we go forward. So what I\u2019d like to now do is move to the Q&A part of this morning. As always, for those in the room or, indeed, those on the wires or those online, if I could ask you please to perhaps just give your name first, the name of your institution and we\u2019ll endeavor to answer your questions. And we\u2019ve probably got about 20, 25 minutes or so. So maybe the first [indiscernible].", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Q - Arnaud Lehmann", "Thank you, good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. Arnaud Lehmann, Band of America Merrill Lynch. I have three questions, if I may. Firstly, just coming back on your H1 results. Looking at Europe, I think I understand volumes across the board; some pluses and some minuses, probably broadly stable. It sounds like there was a bit of pricing pressure as well. So could you discuss that a little bit and how you manage in this context to do broadly stable earnings? That\u2019s my first question. My second question is related to LafargeHolcim asset. Could you help us understand the contribution of this asset? Potentially this year you said the contribution so far is in line with expectations. ", "Consolidation from August, probably a bit of seasonality involved. I would expect H2 to probably be a bit bigger than H1 for this asset in terms of profit contribution and the Philippines obviously being delayed by a few months. So what sort of impact should you expect in H2? And the last question is on your balance sheet. You obviously stated very clearly that you\u2019re committed to an investment grade rating. Is that something you have already discussed with rating agencies after the LafargeHolcim deal and maybe ahead of the CRL acquisition? So you are committed to it but are the rating agencies in line with your view?", "Albert Manifold", "Okay, thanks, Arnaud and good morning. I\u2019ll take the first two questions with regards to the volumes and pricing environment in Europe and also with regard to the LafargeHolcim. I think Maeve will have a comment on that as well, by the way. And, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll leave the balance sheet question and the rating agency to you, Maeve. Just with regard to Europe, what I think we are seeing is very early stages of recovery. This feels like the United States of about 2011, which is a patchy volume recovery.", "And, as I go through our footprint in Europe, and our footprint is broadly speaking a Northern European/ Eastern European footprint on the heavy side, so if you look at what we have. Ireland volumes are up but prices are down. UK volumes up and will be up and prices up. Belgium prices are down but volumes flat. Netherlands volumes slightly up and prices so-so, Switzerland volumes and prices down. Germany volumes slightly up, prices so-so, Poland volumes up, prices down, Romania, not in our business yet but in LafargeHolcim, volumes up, prices down. Finland volumes down and prices slightly up. ", "So a real mixed bag; the process of improvement on volume starting to come through. And this is typical of what you see in heavyside businesses, be it cement, construction or, indeed, other commodity products; the scramble for volume starts to slip back in.", "And what\u2019s happening is, we saw it in the United States, we should have seen price increases in 2012 and 2013. Do you remember it was only last year we started to see prices come through? [Indiscernible] only got price increases last year. And this year they\u2019re well ahead. They\u2019re up 6%, 8% and we ourselves are well ahead. I think that\u2019s the kind of curve we\u2019re seeing in Europe.", "I think it\u2019s a flatter curve in Europe but I think at last we\u2019re starting to see some of that drift through. We\u2019ve been to hell and back in Europe and we\u2019re not out of the woods yet but at least we\u2019re starting to see some improvement. I\u2019m disappointed as an operator in the pricing environment in Europe. I think it should be better. But it is what it is. And how will we manage it? Good, tight commercial management. We fight for market share. We hold our market position in every market we\u2019re in, tighter controls.", "The integrated model works very well in this because we can protect ourselves because we sell so much of our products to ourselves. About one-third of our cement in Europe is sold to ourselves. That\u2019s a great strength to be in on January 1 every year. You don\u2019t have to fight that volume. That\u2019s ours. And we can protect pricing that way as well because we sell to ourselves. So that\u2019s how we produce the profits that we do and it\u2019s why we\u2019re probably ahead of our peers is because of the value of the integrated model. And that\u2019s how we do that across Europe. I expect it to improve next year but it will be a slow pull out.", "With regard to LafargeHolcim, the challenge we have is that we\u2019ve literally had the business for 24 days, of which there are Sundays and Saturdays in that. And our ability to begin to understand the numbers has been very limited. This goes from the Philippines, well, not yet, but it goes from Eastern Europe all the way to Canada and all the countries in between.", "So all we can do this morning with any certainty is confirm to you what we\u2019re being told, is the trading environment is in line with what expectations those countries would be. And if you look at the read across that was done, Barry and Bob did a very good note on this quite recently where they said, look, if you just read across LafargeHolcim [indiscernible] what they\u2019re saying about those markets that\u2019s how those countries probably are trading. And they\u2019re exactly right.", "So what they said about Canada, broadly flat, that\u2019s a big market. What they say about the UK, it\u2019s up, it\u2019s broadly up. And what they said about the Philippines, again broadly up. And so it\u2019s there for us. But when we get into the businesses, we\u2019ll get an understanding and we will give you a detailed update in November when we get there.", "Maeve Carton", "Of course, the contribution in the period immediately after acquisition can also be impacted by some of the accounting entries that we are required to do for valuations of inventory and things like that. So there will be a lot of moving parts to working that through. In relation to the investment grade rating, as we\u2019ve said on a number of occasions and said again this morning, our investment grade rating is really important to us. In considering the LafargeHolcim deal first and, of course, more recently the C.R. Laurence deal, we thought about what would be the impact of this deal?", "How does it fit with our cash flow characteristics? And that slide that I showed you, how we see our credit metrics getting back to normalized levels by the end of 2015 would have been part in our thought processes feeding into that. We can\u2019t speak for the rating agencies but we thought very carefully about it and believe that our cash characteristics and strong track record will be taken into account by the rating agencies when they consider it.", "Arnaud Lehmann", "Thank you very much. Thank you.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I\u2019ve got three questions. One is on CRL. Maybe you can give us maybe a little bit of a better feel for what kind of growth this business either has been printing for the last few years or what do you expect in terms of organics? Obviously I think you describe it as a high-growth business in your outlook.", "The second question is on operational leverage. I think, Maeve, you mentioned first half was 28%. I seem to remember last year you were also in the 20%\u2019s but equally you\u2019ve traditionally talked about 15% to 20%. So I just wanted to understand whether your view of operational leverage has perhaps changed a little bit. I understand obviously there\u2019s a lot of moving parts with pricing but maybe a view on that.", "And then finally, I think CapEx went up quite a bit in the first half. Can you give us a sense if that is going to be a recurring feature for the next few years? Obviously the US coming back, so where that\u2019s trending. Thanks.", "Albert Manifold", "I\u2019ll take the first question and maybe give the leverage question, the CapEx question, to Maeve. CRL, as we said, has been a high growth business and, in fact, really since 2010, going back to the last five years, which are probably the most relevant, this business has been growing at a CAGR of 10% per annum. That is against a very lackluster backdrop, a very difficult backdrop, in the United States. And that has been organic growth and a little bit of acquisition growth.", "As I said, it\u2019s done 30 deals over the last 20 years. It\u2019s got very strong brand names acquired in those businesses. But really it\u2019s the channel, the access to market that it has developed. And it\u2019s a very innovative business. It\u2019s bringing new products and access to the customers that\u2019s been driving those sales and we\u2019re looking to piggyback upon that.", "So very strong growth historically. We\u2019re looking for that to continue.", "Maeve Carton", "The operating leverage side. Yes, we delivered a 28% operating leverage in the first half of this year, largely driven by that very strong momentum that we saw in the US.", "When I gave the indication last year of somewhere in the 15% to 20% range as being a long-term estimate of where we think our operating leverage is, that was taking into account cycles, the mix of the business and all the moving parts that feed into these calculations and that view really has not changed.", "There will be distortions or different numbers in short periods and, of course, you\u2019ll know that the first half can be very distorted by small numbers. But there\u2019s nothing in the trend that would change our view about that. We\u2019re delighted with the good performance in the first half of the year and look forward to continued good performance in the second half.", "Albert Manifold", "Well, the one thing about leverage, of course, we have \u2013 bringing it on to the CapEx, Maeve, is the fact that the LafargeHolcim deal that we are acquiring probably comes at a higher leverage. And when we digest those businesses I think we\u2019ll maybe go back and revise that 15% to 20% that you\u2019re talking about to [Multiple Speakers]", "Maeve Carton", "Yes. Given the margins of that business, absolutely. On the CapEx side, yes, as I was saying earlier, the increase in CapEx in the first half of the year reflects our willingness and readiness to invest in the businesses when we see opportunities for growth and our commitment to making sure that our businesses are ready and able to take advantage of the markets that they find themselves in. So we\u2019re absolutely ready to do that.", "What we did during the downturn was hold a very tight rein on the CapEx. Some of that helped by the business and nature of the business as the lower levels of activity have lower wear and tear on the equipment and, therefore, the need to actually spend money reduces as well. But also the natural characteristics of our capital expenditure, which is primarily made up of a large number of small projects. So that gives us great flexibility in tough times to pull back when we need to.", "What I\u2019d also been saying, though, was that over the coming years as we see markets picking up it\u2019s not sustainable to keep the levels of CapEx at 65% or 70% of depreciation. It was going to be trending up anyway. And in 2015 we saw the beginnings of that in the half year. I would expect that to continue through 2015, 2016 and over the next number of years it would be at or around 100% of depreciation. And it may even get over that in occasional years. Typically for us, capital expenditure spikes in years when you\u2019ve significant cement-related investment. And that can give rise to higher expenditure and that can reduce backend\u2026", "Albert Manifold", "[Indiscernible]", "Maeve Carton", "Exactly.", "Yassine Touahri", "Yassine Touahri, Exane BNP Paribas. First question on your US materials business. We\u2019ve seen some of your peers publishing relatively good margin expansion in the first half. I think that your \u2013 in the aggregates in this field the margin was up by more than 300 basis points. In the asphalt business we\u2019ve seen one of your peers publishing very strong margin improvement in the second quarter, with more than 700 basis points.", "Have you seen these kinds of margin improvements and do you expect these kind of margin improvements for the second half? Or is your business different? And then my second question is on CRL. Could you give us the operating profit for this year? And also could you give us a sense of what was the operating margin in 2005/2006 at the peak before the crisis and whether you think we can go back to peak margin in this business?", "Albert Manifold", "In CRL or in\u2026", "Yassine Touahri", "CRL.", "Albert Manifold", "Well, let Maeve answer the historic question with regard to CRL in terms of margins. I\u2019ll talk about the materials businesses. The business you refer to in terms of \u2013 it\u2019s very hard to get a comparison across peers in asphalt because we\u2019re by a country mile the largest player and probably the person you\u2019re referring to, we know who it is, is only a small player. I would say the big margin expansion we\u2019re seeing in our business this year is actually on the aggregates business, not necessarily the asphalt business, in the first half.", "Remember the first half of the year is seasonally less significant for us and really the asphalt business only kicks off in May for us. The volume levels come through May and June that we\u2019re reporting here are not necessarily representative of the full year. I think we would have seen the aggregate expansion primarily due to the fact that we\u2019ve got a better production balance than \u2013 I know that sounds very technical but what that means is effectively when we crush stone in a quarry we crush it to many different grades. And if you have all parts of the construction cycle being busy you can sell all of your stone. If you\u2019ve only small parts of it busy, you\u2019re left with mountains of stone.", "But what we have in the United States now is all parts of the construction cycle are busy. So that allows you to get good production efficiencies and, of course, get good sales for all that product and that helps our margin. Of course, higher volumes help our margins as well and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving a lot, with good commercial management, our aggregate margins this year.", "Of course, asphalt, the margins will expand this year. We have seen falling bitumen costs but, of course, a lot of our contracts are [indiscernible]. And we\u2019ve talked about this in the past. The fact that our customers read the newspapers too. And what they do is they expect to see the pass-through of falling diesel cost, falling asphalt and the falling bitumen costs to them.", "And, particularly in the second half of this year, where you\u2019re seeing rack prices for bitumen down 15%, 17% in the months of June and July, they are being priced into contracts of work that we\u2019re doing today and in September. So you will see falling asphalt prices. But we will see margin expansion, because we will try to hold onto that. But, of course, remember, we much prefer low-price bitumen because low-price bitumen is low-price asphalt and low-price asphalt is more volume. And we make far more money breaking and crushing rock and coating that rock with bitumen than we do marking up high-price bitumen.", "That\u2019s what we want. We want to sell volume. We just don\u2019t want to [indiscernible] bitumen. So that\u2019s where the key is for us. It\u2019s cost efficiency, good production balance, good aggregates volumes being driven by good market demand and good asphalt demand as well. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. The margins you refer to, I know who you\u2019re referring to, that\u2019s probably not representative of what we see. With regard to CRL, in terms of the current year EBITDA is 115. I\u2019ll let Maeve comment on the depreciation and the amortization to give you the operating number and the margins, Maeve.", "Maeve Carton", "The depreciation is a relatively small number historically; about $10 million to $15 million. Obviously, under CRH\u2019S management that will be a different number, because we\u2019ve got to work through the valuations of the balance sheet and so on. So that could be a different number going forward.", "It\u2019s a high-margin business, also characterized by very strong growth, as Albert was talking about. One of the characteristics of this business is a very, very strong focus on customers and being ahead of the customer needs and serving their needs. So that has protected the business in terms of its margins through the downturn. So it\u2019s been a really resilient solid business.", "Clearly, some margin declines as activities fell back during the downturn. But during that period the business continued to innovate, to service customers really well, maintain its customers, continue with service, continue to grow, continue to make acquisitions right through the downturn. So a very, very focused business, but very resilient model. So we\u2019re delighted to have it on board.", "Yassine Touahri", "Do you have a sense of what were the peak margins?", "Albert Manifold", "The margins are broadly consistent over the years. But that growth that you\u2019re seeing now at the moment, effectively what this business does, it sells small price ticket items matched with large price ticket items. So there isn\u2019t the attention to the pricing of those items by our customers. So we do manage to hold the margin quite well. So what you\u2019re seeing now in the current year is typical of what we would have seen historically over time.", "Barry Dixon", "Barry Dixon, Davy. A couple of questions, please, Albert and Maeve. Just moving on the CRL, I think the statement, it seems that it has some businesses outside of the US. And maybe you might just give us your thoughts in terms of the potential for growing that glass business, that architectural glass business, plus CRL outside of the US. And I think Europe and Australia are two of the markets in which it\u2019s involved.", "The second question, perhaps then just moving on that, in terms of the development of the business. You\u2019ve also announced that you did a small acquisition in the European products business in Australia. And so you might just talk to the potential for building out that Australasia business. You now have China, India, the Philippines and these potential two businesses outside of that. And so, maybe, I suppose, the potential for growth and the timeframe maybe for growth for that third geography.", "Just on the integration of the Holcim-Lafarge assets, and you\u2019ve reiterated the synergy target and the timeframe on that. You might just maybe talk a little bit, Albert, in terms of the \u2013 your target of getting back to the Group peak margins and returns. How dependent is that objective on the successful integration of these assets and the achievement of that \u20ac90 million of synergies?", "And I suppose a slightly related question is, has the deal or the two deals that you\u2019ve announced this year, has that changed your longer term view on your vision for CRH over the next five years, either in terms of geographic balance or divisional balance between heavyside and lightside? Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "Well, three questions there. First of all, with regards to CRL \u2013 and, actually, the question with CRL and the question with the small acquisitions we\u2019re doing this year are both actually linked because they\u2019re actually \u2013 they do open a little bit of a window into the future strategy of CRH because CRH is changing. There\u2019s no question about that and changing because we need to change the environment that\u2019s actually out there.", "This business that we\u2019re buying in CRL has plans, before we buy it, to become a global business. It currently sells all through North America. It\u2019s got 42 locations all through Canada and the United States. But it\u2019s got locations here in the UK, in Germany and in Denmark and plans to expand through Europe. It\u2019s also got a market down in Australia.", "And there\u2019s no way are we going to constrain those plans. In fact, we\u2019re going to encourage those plans. But what you will start to see, because for the first time in CRH, we\u2019re looking at probably a global business across CRH. Our business is we report U.S., Europe, Asia. That\u2019s the way we report regionally, which is quite a heavyside way of doing things. You become local businesses. There is not a heavyside business.", "So this business will be run in an entirely different way. It will be the first truly global business within CRH. It has good prospects for growth. And what we\u2019ll have to do is piggyback on top of our lightside business that we have, the footprint we have and the knowledge we have of those markets, plus all of Western and Eastern Europe, which will be a big plus for the business and are not factored into any of the numbers we have here.", "The second point is Australia. It\u2019s only a small deal, in mid-teens but it\u2019s in a very fine business called Hubert, which is a composite access chambers business. It\u2019s part of our lightside business. But, again, a strong growth business. It\u2019s grown from very low levels five, six years ago to being a decent sized business with great returns. And it was delivered by our team down in the office in Sydney. We opened up an office in Sydney last year. We spoke about it last year. And, again, they\u2019ve had a number of deals coming through the door.", "And, again, looking at Australia and New Zealand and looking at the future growth that we see down there and the spread of a global business that we are now, again it just testifies the fact that this is an area of interest to us and we will be developing our business going forward with regard to that. The last issue was the issue of bringing in returns on margins back to peak, which actually all of this is balanced, stretched, returns driven. It\u2019s all about that, margins returned back to peak, because we equate that with shareholder value.", "And what these two deals have done, or will do, is, in fact, we believe they will advance that process and speed up that process. Why do I believe that? Well, if I look at the LafargeHolcim deal that we acquired, we paid 8.5 times EBITDA for a quality heavyside asset at a trough in the cycle. They are better returning assets than the existing heritage business within CRH. So even at the existing level, they will enhance the returns.", "Likewise, with CRL, the growth dynamics we\u2019re seeing on the top line and on the bottom line, when you marry that with our Oldcastle BuildingEnvelope business and, of course, look at the international expansion opportunities that brings and, of course, all the add-ons we can do into that lightside product business, which we like and is a key part of the strength and future of CRH, again that will enhance the returns. So I would expect both of those to advance us down the road towards bringing those margin returns back to peak.", "Christen Hjorth", "All right Christen Hjorth, Numis. Just a couple of quick ones for me. In terms of employing your capital and strategy and process of doing that, obviously there are a lot of opportunities out there. And you\u2019ve talked previously about maybe adding bolt-ons to the assets acquired from Lafarge and Holcim. How do you decide where to employ that capital? And what\u2019s the process of making that decision? And then secondly, just a bit more color on the guidance for H2. I think you said good progress. Is that excluding the acquired businesses or on an organic basis?", "Albert Manifold", "Maybe I\u2019ll pass the second question to Maeve in terms of the second half in terms of what that means, whether it\u2019s heritage or including LafargeHolcim. The question in terms of how we allocate capital going forward, it\u2019s a key question within CRH and it\u2019s tied back into the strategy of CRH going forward. And our strategy that we have at the moment, I think it\u2019s really going to bring benefits in the next five years or so.", "We\u2019re very much focused on businesses that are generating cash, profits and you can convert those profits into cash and you can access that cash and you can reallocate that cash back in. For us that has been in known businesses, in known areas, or adjacent areas where we feel comfortable. So heavyside, distribution and in building products but the geographies become key to us now. If I look at the building materials sector and look at the footprint of CRH, we\u2019ve got a great footprint, given what we\u2019re faced with in the next five years or so.", "Most people who know me know I am an emerging market both. I believe in emerging markets in the future. But that\u2019s a long-term comment. Short-term, we\u2019re faced with challenges. And I know the model very well. If I look at the BRICs of five or six years ago, and look at the challenges they\u2019re all faced with now. And that\u2019s because they didn\u2019t make the fundamental adjustments that were necessary, at the time of buoyancy and growth that were necessary to stabilize their economies. And they\u2019re doing it now from a position of weakness.", "That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything bad. It just means you can\u2019t make profits in those countries for the next five years or so. But we have a minor exposure to that and it just testifies to the strength. As we always said about emerging markets, it\u2019s not too much, too soon, nor too little, too late. It\u2019s the measured approach, because emerging markets are going to grow for all of our lifetimes and lifetimes beyond. There\u2019ll be plenty of places where we can grow in those markets. For us it\u2019s about returns and margins and cash now, today, tomorrow, next year, next five years, and look at our footprint. We\u2019re the largest building materials business in the United States. We\u2019re the largest heavyside materials player in Europe. We\u2019re the number two, number three distributor in Europe.", "We\u2019ve got great footprints in a market that is clearly recovering and a market that\u2019s just about to recover. Provided we\u2019re not idiots and we run our businesses well, with good cost structure and good cash conversion, you can see what we\u2019ve done, typical CRH, we\u2019ve done it for the last 20 years and what we\u2019ll continue to do, those small bolt-ons to those businesses and the adjacent businesses.", "And every now and then a platform step out, like CRL, or like Eastern Europe, or like into distribution, where we do best, we\u2019ve bed it down. Look at SHAP five years ago. That was a new business and now look at \u2013 it\u2019s an embedded part of our business. So I would expect in the next two or three years to be very selective on add-on deals. We can be. But in 2017, 2018 move back into the acquisition game again, looking to see exactly how we can step out and build beyond.", "Because what we are seeing here is that we are just at the cusp in CRH to our organic growth potential in our two core markets. And the fact that we\u2019ve yet to deliver on two of the biggest acquisitions we\u2019ve ever done in CRH, we have not yet realized the growth potential of those businesses yet. And I think we\u2019re just at the cusp of a very significant growth period for CRH and [indiscernible]", "Maeve Carton", "Yes, thank you Albert. The second-half outlook statement that we gave refers to our continuing businesses, so the businesses that we have in the balance sheet at June 30. As Albert said earlier, we\u2019ll update you on our expectations for the contributions from both LafargeHolcim and from C.R. Laurence in November.", "Albert Manifold", "We\u2019ve run way over our time and I\u2019m not going to get to the phone lines and I\u2019ll take the web questions. We\u2019ll have to actually respond to them in writing. I\u2019ll stay in the room if you don\u2019t mind, because we\u2019ve got about three more minutes left, so I might just take Will.", "Will Jones", "Will Jones, Redburn. Three if I could, please. On Europe, the guidance for the second half, I think in end of the first half you did better on the like-for-like EBITDA than you thought you would in May. Your comps eased quite significantly on sales second half versus first.", "Is the flattish commentary potentially conservative against what you did in the first half and how last year evolved? Just to come back, secondly, on Americas Materials, the margin expansion of about 140 basis points in the first half. Do you think that\u2019s indicative of the full year? Or, with it being a big second half business, should we potentially expect more than that in the second half?", "And within that, the asphalt price decline of 2% in the first half, are you saying that we should think of a bigger number, just given where bitumen is, for the second half? And sorry, just to tie up on disposals. I think \u2013 is slide 16 excluding anything you get from the Philippines, the \u20ac1.5 billion? So you\u2019ve still got another \u20ac500 million back in the core business to go and find?", "Maeve Carton", "Albert, if I could just take that question first. The \u20ac1.5 billion is not exactly a projection. What we\u2019re saying is that that\u2019s the kind of proceeds, together with cash flow of \u20ac1 billion that will get us to the answer. And, in saying that, we\u2019ve said we\u2019ve already delivered \u20ac1 billion. So delivering \u20ac1.5 billion in total over the two-year period looks achievable. So that\u2019s the context. So it\u2019s not a specific number.", "Will Jones", "But there are still disposals in the core business to go and find, yes.", "Maeve Carton", "Yes.", "Albert Manifold", "With regards to the European volumes and you said you\u2019re alluding to the change in tone maybe since what we said in May, and what\u2019s happened in June, July, August, you\u2019re right. Actually the second half of last year was flattish, but actually the challenge out in Europe there is probably more to do with pricing than it is with volume. And I think we\u2019re just being cautious and careful with regards to how that comes through. That\u2019s a very heavyside comment. I think that\u2019s good. The lightside business and the distribution business are solid and they should do well.", "So our comments overall are with regard to Europe and you\u2019ve seen, if you look, I think it\u2019s on slide 28, if you look at it in terms of constant currency performance of the heavyside business, you can see a reduction in top line. They\u2019re down by 1%, 2% and the heavyside businesses and it\u2019s pretty flat on the EBITDA.", "So it\u2019s fairly flat and we think that\u2019s going to carry on for the second half of the year. We don\u2019t see any change with regards to that. With regards to margin performance the first half of the year in Americas Materials, I would be vary of the first half of the year always in [indiscernible] unwinds. Remember two-thirds of our profitability in Americas Materials is generated in July, August and September. September is our biggest month across CRH.", "So really until we get to the end of September we don\u2019t really have visibility as to how the year is going to shape out. I actually think the margin you\u2019re going to see in the business will be squeezed because what we\u2019ve seen is \u2013 it\u2019s well known that energy prices are down. We\u2019re under constant pressure from our customers, which leads me into the last question in terms of asphalt pricing, the very point I made there about the fact that rack prices for bitumen are down 15%, 17% in June and July and, indeed, in August. That\u2019s going to be factored into the work that we\u2019re doing in August, September and, indeed, October.", "I still think we\u2019re going have margin expansion because that\u2019s what our business is about, about managing the expansion. For the asphalt business we want the volume for the aggregates, as I said.", "David OBrien", "Hi, just one quick one for me, David OBrien, Goodbody. Just following up on Americas Materials and the paving business, in particular. Margins have been maintained. Can you \u2013 have you got inflexion point where you can start to drive down forward now at this stage? How do you expect them to evolve?", "Albert Manifold", "I think we use \u2013 our paving business is very important to us because it\u2019s an important part of the chain. It\u2019s not necessarily important per se in its individual area in terms of making profitability. But it is profitable. What it does do, of course, is it gives a great pull through demand. 60% of all the paving that we do is done with our own asphalt. So we can specify our own asphalt. And, of course, 30% of our aggregate in those asphalts comes from our quarries as well. What I can confirm to you, in maintaining it that\u2019s been a big help for our volumes back up the chain.", "But what we are seeing, and I think Randy said it in his piece, that the backlogs from those businesses are strong, they\u2019re ahead of last year and we\u2019ve picked up a positive momentum in margins second half of the year. Okay, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just winding up at the back here, I\u2019m sorry about that. We\u2019re going to have to end it here for this morning. I want to thank you all for your participation this morning. My apologies for those down the line that we didn\u2019t get to and, indeed, what we will do is we\u2019ll endeavor to respond to those questions. I know there\u2019s quite a number of questions that have come in on the line.", "I just want to leave you with one slide, all of which is familiar to you. But the single thought I would say is that we are moving into a new phase of the construction cycle into two major markets, which is the Americas and Europe. The Americas more clearly defined. All we\u2019re discussing now is the pace of growth. I think this is a long unwind, a longer construction cycle, because of the depth of the decline we saw before this. And normally it\u2019s seven years construction cycle peak to peak, trough to trough. We think this is a 10-year unwind.", "And remember, infrastructure is flat. Infrastructure hasn\u2019t started yet. And that\u2019s 50% of total construction spend in the United States is all purely driven by res and non-res. So that has yet to happen. And we think that\u2019s more sustained demand for it and we think we\u2019re very well positioned to do that.", "And in Europe we\u2019re starting to see, at last, stability come to the market. Last year, some kind of modest growth. It feels like the early signs of recovery. I think it\u2019s going to be much flatter curve, but I think our positioning on the heavyside businesses of Northern and Eastern Europe is very strong and the balance that we bring through our distribution business and our lightside business, particularly with exposure to RMI positions, is very well for growth. So I think, as I said, with the organic growth profile we see across our businesses in those two major markets and the fact that we\u2019ve yet to deliver on those two big acquisitions, I think we\u2019re poised for a period of very significant profit growth in CRH in the years ahead.", "Albert Manifold"], "Symbol": "CRH, plc (NYSE:", "Period": "2015In", "Month": "08", "Year": "2015", "Date": "2015-08-27", "Target": 0},

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Albert Manifold. Please go ahead, sir.", "Albert Manifold", "Good morning, everybody. Albert Manifold, CRH Group, Chief Executive here. You\u2019re very welcome to the CRH conference call this morning, which accompanies our trading update issued in advance of our Annual General Meeting tomorrow. With me on the call is Senan Murphy, our Group Finance Director; Maeve Carton, our Group Transformation Director; and Frank Heisterkamp, our Head of Investor Relations.", "Following some short introductory remarks, we\u2019ll be available to take any questions you may have on the statement. We have about 45 minutes scheduled for the call, so I propose we finish at the best 9:15 this morning.", "Now our update this morning provides details of our trading performance for the first three months of the year. Before going into the details, I should explain that in today\u2019s announcement, we compare our year-to-date trading performance to pro forma 2015 results. Now this means that we\u2019ve included the 2015 trading results of the acquired LafargeHolcim and C.R. Laurence businesses in the prior-year comparison. Although we didn\u2019t own these business at the time and we\u2019ve excluded all contributions from divested entities and we\u2019ve also adjusted for any one-off items.", "So this should give you a clear picture of the underlying performance of the Group\u2019s continuing operations. We will also discuss the business comparison on a constant currency basis.", "In trading terms, we\u2019ve had a very satisfactory start to the year. Group sales in quarter one were up by about 9% compared with the same period last year. Performance by our European divisions has been stable and we\u2019ve also seen some good demand in the Philippines. But overall this performance was driven largely by the continued positive momentum in the Americas where we\u2019ve delivered sales growth of 22% in the period.", "Now let me take you briefly through our operating regions. Starting with Europe, the stabilizing trends noticed towards the end of 2015 have continued across our main markets. This in tandem would generally favorable weather conditions led to overall solid demand which combined with the generally competitive pricing environment resulted in overall first quarter sales in line with 2015.", "Now looking at each of our European segments in turn. Firstly, European Heavyside showed a broadly stable first quarter of the year. Despite improving demand drivers in some of our main markets, regional variations translates into sales which were in line with pro forma 2015. At a country level, the demand environment in the U.K. was somewhat mixed but stable overall with downstream activities impacted slightly by some project delays, there were fewer contracts just awarded in the second half of 2015 actually, but this is partly offset by higher cement volumes.", "So overall, a slower start in the U.K. but we\u2019re not concerned, we don\u2019t believe there is a structural issue here. We see our backlog ahead of us, and they are building up well and expect to catch-up fully by the end of the year.", "Switzerland has improved volumes but the pricing environment remains competitive. In the Netherlands, construction market continues to recover, primarily driven by increased residential activity. In Poland, cement volumes are broadly in line with the prior year, although pricing pressure remains. Meanwhile in Finland, we delivered good volume growth on the back of improving non-residential construction activity. France has also had a good start to the year with volumes marginally ahead there.", "And across South East Europe, we\u2019re continuing to see good amount and higher volumes particularly in Romania. Our Europe Lightside delivered sales growth of 6% in the quarter, primarily due to increased demand in the U.K., Germany, the Benelux and also again in France. Sales in our Europe distribution division were in line with the first quarter of 2015.", "In the Netherlands, our merchanting business continues to benefit from improving residential construction trends, while in Belgium our Sanitary Heating and Plumbing businesses continues to show good growth. The market backdrop in Germany remains stable with a modest increase in underlying RMI demand. Volumes in France again are resilient in the competitive environment and we are seeing some forward positive looking indicators in the residential newbuild markets. Markets in Switzerland and Austria remain competitive.", "Turning to the Americas operations now. Well, sales in the quarter were 22% higher than 2015, benefiting from stronger demand and mild winter weather patterns in the United States. Activity in Canada\u2019s Eastern provinces where our businesses are primarily based were stable although the demand backdrop further west remains mixed.", "In our Americas Materials businesses, sales for the first quarter were 27% ahead of 2015. In the U.S., we had improved demand for aggregates and readymixed concrete, which together with positive pricing trends, contributed to the division\u2019s positive momentum. Asphalt volumes were also strongly ahead although prices here reduced due to the continued low input cost environment. Remember though this is a distinctive season of businesses and typically setting less than 10% of our annual asphalt volumes in the first quarter of the year. Canada, our demand as I said remained broadly stable compared to 2015.", "Looking at Americas Products, again improving demand and favorable weather saw the first quarter deliver a 22% growth in sales compared to 2015. Shipments at our Architectural Products businesses were particularly strong with volume growth of 35% while sales at our Precast businesses were also ahead. Volumes in our architectural glass and project activity at our BuildingEnvelope business were ahead of the prior year and trading for the C.R. Laurence business is very much in line with our expectations.", "Looking now to Asia, rather say it in Philippines, I guess, first quarter demand for cement was strong and sales were 12% ahead in quarter one of 2015. We expect continued growth for that market going forward.", "So overall, these were the major trading trends in each of our respective divisions. In addition, we\u2019ve also announced today that our divestment program to generate nearly \u20ac80 million of proceeds from disposal in the three months of the year. Over the same period, we spent a similar amount about \u20ac85 million on both on acquisitions mainly in our Americas Materials segment.", "Just looking now at the outlook for the remainder of the year. Well, for the first half of 2016, we expect the EBITDA in Europe to be slightly up on the pro forma prior year period, while the Americas with the benefit of positive demand environment and the strong start to the year, it is expected to be well ahead. The Philippines is also expected to be ahead due to continued demand. And bringing all this together then at a Group level, we expect the EBITDA for the seasonally less significant first half of the year to be close to \u20ac1 billion, which represents about a mid-single-digit percentage increase versus pro forma half one 2015 results. ", "Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect a broadly stable backdrop in Europe which continues to support some improvement across our main markets. In the Americas, we expect further progress in the second half with continued growth in all sectors. Results in the Philippines are expected to be ahead of the prior year and for the Group as a whole, we expect continued progress in the second half.", "So, look, we\u2019re now happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Albert Manifold", "Responses are going to be more directional than quantitative at this stage. Just for good order, could I ask you to please state your name and the name of your institution that you represent when posing your questions. And now I\u2019m going to hand it back to the moderator to coordinate the Q&A session of our call.", "Operator", "And our first question comes from Paul Roger from Exane Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Paul Roger", "Yes. Good morning, everyone. So I\u2019ll first start with three questions, if I may. The first one is on guidance. You\u2019re talking about mid-single-digital EBITDA growth in H1. Obviously, you\u2019ve just said you\u2019ve got 9% like-for-like sales growth in the first quarter. I wonder if you could help us understand. Are you just being conservative, or is there something we should be aware of, like a tough base for example, that means that Q2 will be a lot tougher? So that\u2019s the first one. The second one is a bit more sort of on the detail. Is it possible to actually give us the restated EBITDA for H1, H2 and full year 2015 just so that we can understand the guidance a little bit better? And then finally, can you talk a bit more about the competitive pricing situation in Switzerland and Poland in terms of what\u2019s behind that and whether there is any sign of stabilization? Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "Thank you, Paul, and good morning to you. I\u2019m just going to repeat three questions just for clarity. The first question our guidance, how we rationalize our guidance for the half year given the strong performance in the first quarter. Second one was just breaking out half one and half two which I\u2019m going to pass to my colleague, Senan, in a moment. And then third one, which is on pricing in Portland and Switzerland.", "So maybe I\u2019ll take the first and third question and then pass it to second question to Senan just when I finish with that.", "With regards to the guidance, Paul, you should remember that the first quarter of this year or any year for us of course is very much the low level of activity, and of course our low level activities percentages look very impressive.", "I think what we have to look at is what is the ongoing run rate that we\u2019re seeing across our businesses and I think pretty much what we are seeing is a continuation of the run rate we saw in quarter three and quarter four of last year continuing into this year. And so the rate that we\u2019re seeing in quarter one is against a quarter one last year which can be very impacted upon by lower volume levels and by weather.", "What we\u2019re looking at is trying to guide the market as accurately and as best we can to where we see the growth rate for the half year and that\u2019s where we\u2019re coming out and we do as best we can. Of course, these are only forecast going forward. We wait to see how the year passes out, but we\u2019re trying to be as accurate as we can to looking at the overall run rate and taking the account of the fact that the first quarter is very much the slower part of the year for us.", "With regard to pricing in Switzerland and Poland, I think Switzerland first, I mean, the same dynamic in both but I think both just to give the background to everybody. And obviously with the revaluation of the Swiss franc a couple of years ago, that meant obviously it was perhaps more exposed to imports into our country from surrounding countries for cements was advantaged by the Euro-Swiss franc raise and that has continued for a couple of years.", "We have seen during the quarter 2014 and that has stabilized somewhat and even in recent weeks I see that continue to stabilize again, and I would think that during the quarter of this year we will see certainly stability in pricing in Switzerland and perhaps towards the backend of the year an improvement.", "With regard to Poland, I think what you\u2019re seeing - and by the way, Poland is also Romania but you have mentioned Poland but I\u2019d say the same dynamic there again, is we\u2019re seeing the last throws of the struggle for volumes and market share as volumes are growing strongly and they have been growing strongly, although slow in the first quarter, but broadly speaking I expect in the Eastern Europe volumes to be ahead for the full-year both in Poland and in Romania, people are what we say sorting our positions and that does mean there are price pass goes on.", "This is typical of the end of a low period of activity. As volumes come back, people are scrabbling for volume and are doing so on price. But I expect given the amount of investment that\u2019s gone in there by the cement majors and the fact that these investments need to be paid for and returns will need to be generated, I expect commonsense to prevail probably during the quarter of this year but certainly into the course of 2017. And in particular to Poland, I would be hopeful that during the course of this year, we\u2019ll see stability and perhaps may be some price growth, if not this year, certainly next year.", "Maybe I might pass over to second question with regards to half one and the full year breakdown in terms of the [indiscernible].", "Senan Murphy", "Paul, as we guided in the document for half one, we\u2019re talking about a reported EBITDA of close to \u20ac1 billion. The reason we put the amount out there was recognizing that last year\u2019s number from a comparison point of view will be difficult. Mid-single-digit growth on a like-for-like basis is obviously what we\u2019re guiding. If you worked back from the \u20ac1 billion towards that figure of the mid-single-digit growth number, you\u2019ll get back to approximately \u20ac950 million on a like-for-like basis last year, recognizing there is one-offs and various items moving.", "If you split that out further, you know last year we reported \u20ac555 million for our heritage business. There is a number of one-offs and pluses and minuses in that, but on a like-for-like comparisons probably adding back \u20ac30 million to that number and arriving at about \u20ac585 million is what we disclosed last year around on a continuing basis. The difference between that \u20ac585 million and the \u20ac1 billion minus 5%, we would describe to probably the two large acquisitions done.", "They weren\u2019t owned by us in the first half of last year but that\u2019s ultimately the number that we would picked up from a management point of view. On a full-year basis, when you\u2019re looking at the comparisons, at the results at the end of the year, we talked about the contribution from LafargeHolcim assets last year at about \u20ac820 million and the CRL acquisition, if we had owned it for 12 months last year, of approximately \u20ac100 million. So those are the kind of the main moving parts in terms of full-year if you would add onto our heritage business and the half year that you would add on to our heritage business.", "And the difference between obviously heritage plus the acquisitions is guiding us towards a mid-single-digit growth.", "Albert Manifold", "And I\u2019d say, Paul, there is a lot of detail there going through all of that and again it\u2019s all sometimes quite hard to just to look numbers down the line. But I\u2019m very happy for yourself or anyone phone call if you want to follow-up on any of those detailed numbers to contact our IR department after that and they\u2019ll take you through them if we having to do so.", "Paul Roger", "Yes. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "No worries Paul. Have a good day. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Gardiner. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Robert Gardiner", "Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions from me, please. I just wondered if you could give us maybe a little bit more color on the strength of trading in the United States and the Americas, Americas Materials in particular. I know it\u2019s a small part of your overall year but the trends looked super positive, and likewise if you could maybe comment on pricing in that market? And secondly, maybe if you could comment on the M&A pipeline. So obviously the focus is deleveraging and paying down debt, but at the same time there is a lot of assets on the block and you are being linked with some of them. So I was just wondered if you would mind to comment on that, please.", "Albert Manifold", "Sure. Robert, two questions there. Just again to repeat the questions just in terms of the strength of the U.S., what\u2019s the underlying, Robert says super positive about. And also some comments on pricing and then also just comments on what we\u2019re seeing on the M&A pipeline. And maybe I\u2019ll take both of those.", "With regard to the U.S., I wouldn\u2019t agree it\u2019s super positive, it\u2019s positive. It\u2019s too early to say and just to restate where we are with regard to our asphalt volumes, the first quarter is only 10% of our asphalt volumes and there is only 20% of our aggregate volumes. Now we just compare that to the third quarter, for instance just showing how important that is. The third quarter is one-third of all of our aggregates volumes about nearly 45% of our asphalt volumes are done in the third quarter. So that\u2019s the really important to get the sense of where the trend is.", "In saying that we do have visibility looking forward with regard to order books and our backlog. And I have to say that, as I said early, the pace of growth that we saw coming in the last four or five months of last year is continuing forward into this current year in our Materials business. And so it\u2019s positive and the positive environment, state finances have improved, people feel the stability of the FAST Act, although we don\u2019t believe that FAST Act is going to impact any numbers in 2016 but it\u2019s more a 2017 phenomenon. It is really on the back of what was planned in the second half of last year over the back of what state finances could afford or project for this year. And again on the back of an improving U.S. economy, that\u2019s an improving number.", "And also pricing, as you rightly say, we\u2019ve had some good pricing dynamics now in the United States for the last two years. And by the way, this is the story of Europe going forward for the next two or three years. Once pricing is established you embed it. And as I\u2019ve been visiting investors over the last few years on the road, I can recall conversations in 2011 or 2012 and people asking me where pricing stood with the conversation and that I have with the United States is what is rate of pricing. So once you reestablish them they are there. And I think they are there again in the United States this year.", "And broadly speaking I would expect to see aggregates following a similar trend of somewhere 3% and 5% between the course of 2016 with December of last year, likewise asphalt - it\u2019s not a pricing issue in asphalt, it\u2019s about expect margin management. And given the dynamics with regards to commodity pricing in our winter-fill program, we\u2019ve had a good winter-fill program. We\u2019ve seen oil prices dip down into the low 30s during the course of the winter. You know we buy all the way through the winter and I\u2019ve seen now this morning West Texas Crude is back up to maybe $45 a barrel.", "So our winter-fill program has been very encouraging and we\u2019ll be supportive of expanded margin on top of the fact that overall I would expect asphalt pricing to be down in 2016. But that is a positive for our business and I\u2019ll explain to you why it\u2019s positive for our business is because when you sell into fixed at state budgets with lower priced asphalts, we can sell more volume. And we make all our money selling rock. The fact that we coat it with expected bitumen is just a way of selling rock.", "So we sell more stone and more rock, that\u2019s where we make our money. So with lower priced asphalt we sell more volume, more stone, that\u2019s good for us as well. So I think that the margin on asphalt would be supportive of some margin expansion because of the dynamic of the winter-fill program and indeed lower priced asphalt should allow more volume.", "And lastly with regard to cement pricing in United States, I think broadly speaking cement pricing, again going back to my comment of what you would look as being an accepted part of our business and if we see again in the region of 5% to 6% price increasing across United States from regional variations and that will be supported the prices - increases in prices of readymixed concrete as well. So positive pricing margin dynamics of course are three main product areas.", "Positive volume environments so far, our visibility probably takes us out to June-ish at this stage but it\u2019s a good indication of where it goes and we\u2019re well set for a good year in our Materials business.", "With regard to the M&A pipeline, as you rightly say, I\u2019m always interested to open the paper every day and see what business we\u2019re bidding on. That\u2019s the first I hear often about it and feel it\u2019s always interesting to see - you must remember, people are trying to talk of competition for deals, so anybody who has got a checkbook be that PE or CRH or anybody else, our name is associated with this, I would have to say the properly involved in 10% of the stuff we\u2019re associated it.", "In saying that, I would say that it is general distress that\u2019s across the sector with regard to leverage balance sheet. When I\u2019m talking about small businesses or big businesses which is behind people disposing their businesses has meant that there has been a continuous flow two or three years of deals in the block, and I would see that continuing probably at a stronger pace than 2016 than maybe 2015 which was out of strong pace.", "In saying that, this is a buyer\u2019s market and at this moment of time we have - we\u2019re not buyers. At this moment in time, we\u2019re focused on delivering and we\u2019ve done very significant deals last year. We have said - we\u2019re very consistent. We compress two to three years of acquisitions into one or two big deals. They just came that way at the right price. And this is the year for delivery of CRH, the delivery on earnings, delivering cash and delivery on deleveraging. And we take the long-term view of our business. We\u2019re patient buyers and we run our business as well and our focus very much is on returning our debt metrics back to normalized levels during the course of 2016 and that\u2019s where our primary focus would be.", "But the pipeline is good and strong and I think it\u2019s going to remain good and strong because there are an awful of sellers out there than there are buyers.", "Robert Gardiner", "Okay. Thank you very much. Very helpful.", "Albert Manifold", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gregor Kuglitsch from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Gregor Kuglitsch", "Good morning. I\u2019ve got two questions, and they\u2019re both a bit technical. So the first one is on the first-half guidance. I think you\u2019re guiding to mid-single-digit EBITDA growth, as you say in your statement. So can I ask what kind of top line you are assuming to get there? Obviously you were up 9%, which I think is exceptional because of the U.S. I just want to understand what sort of top line you are associating with that mid-single-digit EBITDA growth? And then secondly, can you give us an update, perhaps also within that \u20ac1 billion, which I believe is a reported number, how much restructuring costs or integration costs do you plan to or are implied or included in that kind of guidance, because I think you were guiding sort of north of \u20ac100 million for the full-year? Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "Thanks Gregor. Two questions there. Just to repeat them again, one on the give some background to the figure terms of what\u2019s the top line revenue number might be in terms for the first half, and the second in terms of with restructuring costs in terms of this year, what\u2019s implied in the \u20ac1 billion number. Maybe I might pass first question in terms of revenue guidance to Senan, and maybe Maeve might help us with the restructuring costs of getting a better understanding of that. Senan?", "Senan Murphy", "Yes. Good morning, Gregor. So I\u2019ll just say in terms of our Q1 top line, 9% overall. Americas 22% of the assets you saw, and Europe as we said, in line with pro forma. Acknowledge the fact that Q1 is a seasonally small quarter, so as we look to the half year we would expect to see that that 9% in our year would be more mid-single-digits as opposed to 9%. The 22% in the U.S. or in the Americas business is up very small base.", "Albert Manifold", "Maeve?", "Maeve Carton", "And just in relation to the restructuring and integration costs, we think we were updating the market in February where we indicated that there would be costs of north of \u20ac100 million in respect to primarily the migration costs for in respect to the HR system [ph], somewhere around \u20ac100 million to \u20ac120 million mark is our expectation. Those costs are going to be back-ended into the second half of the year primarily, so the costs in the first half would be relatively small.", "Gregor Kuglitsch", "Okay. Can I have a question also operationally on the U.K.? Can you give us some additional color, because I think there was some disruption on the Highways England? So, if you could maybe give us your feel whether the Q1 slowdown that you saw in the UK is whether - what\u2019s your opinion, was it temporary, or was it something to do with the wider macro or maybe some color there would be helpful? Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "Yes, Gregor, I was down on the ground myself there quite a bit last week just turning our businesses and talking to the guys there. Actually I\u2019m very comfortable with the situation there. I think what you rightly refer to is probably there was a slowdown in contract awards just move away from the Highways Agency to the Highways England in the second half of last year that perhaps caused a little bit of administrative hiccup and a bit of a speed bump. But broadly speaking now what we\u2019re starting to see over the last six weeks if I look at the contract awards, look at our order books, I\u2019m quite comfortable where we are.", "The cement volumes are good, concrete volumes are good, pricing is good and I expect during the remainder of the year to show progress again in the U.K. So comfortable with the way it is and really have to say very pleased with some very fine business we bought over there, super assets, great team and a great addition to CRH.", "Gregor Kuglitsch", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Arnaud Lehmann. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Arnaud Lehmann", "Thank you very much. Good afternoon - sorry, good morning Manifold and Maeve. Two questions on my side, please. Maybe a more specific follow-up about your comments on potential acquisitions and deleveraging. We know that obviously Heidelberg Cement is trying to buy or is working on buying Italcementi, and as part of this acquisition they have to sell some assets including in Belgium and potentially North America. Now specifically on the Belgium assets, we know you have some downstream operations. So I\u2019m not sure if you can answer that but would you have any potential interest in the cement plants in Belgium? That\u2019s my first question. My second question, if you could - you gave a bit of a mixed message on France. You say it\u2019s stable, but you see positive lead indicators. Are you trying to imply that you believe that French volumes could start to pick up going in to H2 2016?", "Albert Manifold", "Okay. Thank you. Just for everybody, the line may have broken there something that gentleman asked the question, Arnaud Lehmann, good morning, Arnaud, from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Two questions there. One on our interest in particular asset that may be out there, particularly you\u2019re referencing the assets that may come on the block by as a result of the acquisition of Heidelberg Cement of Italcementi. And secondly with regard to our overall volumes on France and our outlook for France, and maybe I\u2019ll take both of those.", "Just going back to my previous comments there to Robert\u2019s question with regard to - look, we are linked with many acquisitions around the world and most of them are not true. With regards to the specific assets you mentioned both in the United States and Belgium, U.S. cement is of interest to us. If it fits with our network and it goes well and I\u2019m fully aware of the asset that may spin-out of the potential acquisition of Heidelberg and Italcementi with regards from a competitive point of view, mostly fine assets.", "The specific question you asked me about Belgium, the CCB plan which is probably for sale. For competition reasons, I had to say its fine assets, very well located assets. You rightly say we have good downstream assets there and certainly it would make a good fit with our businesses provided the value is right. So broadly speaking we would have an interest, but of course it\u2019s all subject to the returns and the value criteria that we express across CRH.", "And with regards to the French - comments on the French market, it really - the sentiment we\u2019re trying to get to across France is there is a recovery residential market in France which is probably the only driver of French construction at this moment in time. It does tend to be an Eastern France, Southern France phenomenon and I would expect French volumes to be up may be 1%, 1.5% of a low base. And for the last 12 months we\u2019ve broadly seen up maybe in north of maybe 2% or so, but I have to say that it\u2019s still off of very low base. Activity levels in France in 2015 were at 1964 levels. So it\u2019s easy to grow small percentages on top of small numbers, but it\u2019s good to see good direction and I think pricing maybe get a little bit in Belgium [ph] and in France again this year. So a little bit of recovery, but very fragile and very early stage.", "Arnaud Lehmann", "All right. That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.", "Albert Manifold", "Thank you, Arnaud.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Eason from Goodbody. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Robert Eason", "Good morning everyone. I really only have one question. And it\u2019s just a follow on from the remarks about your winter-fill, but just expanding into kind of more general energy-related costs. How are you positioned as you go in to this year in terms of hedging across your different operations in terms of energy costs?", "Albert Manifold", "Thanks Robert. Just on the winter-fill, look, our winter-fill program is not finished yet. Actually our winter-fill program goes for September all the way to May or such, and I have to say that I think we\u2019re pleased given the pricing of bitumen during the course of the season that we\u2019ve done a good job again. Broadly speaking just for everyone\u2019s point, we store, we buy during the course of the winter period about 900,000 tonnes of bitumen and that puts about north of 40% of our total usage of the year during the winter period.", "The reason we buy it during the winter period is because that is when the oil refineries are at maximum production. They don\u2019t want to have bitumen lying in their tanks and they sell it off at a lower price than they do during the summer period which is a low period of production, and they can leave the bitumen and they can play the markets. So we do tend to enjoy a cost advantage in buying our winter-fill during the winter period \u2013our bitumen during winter-fill.", "So it has been good this year. We\u2019re happy the way it has gone. Of course there is two sides to this equation, it\u2019s what you buy and what you sell. And I think we\u2019re, broadly speaking, happier to see, as I say, West Texas Crude is back to the 45 bucks a barrel today. That\u2019s higher than it has been during the winter period. That would be supportive of our winter-fill program in terms of margin support as well. So we\u2019re happy the way it\u2019s gone over the last four, five, six months. Yes.", "Robert Eason", "And just general, your other energy-related costs. How are you hedged out\u2026", "Albert Manifold", "We\u2019re fine. What we tend to do broadly speaking, the big energy cost was our diesel and gasoline. I mean, if you look at what is petrol - the gasoline now is sort of $2.20 a gallon, that\u2019s the cost in U.S. and down south, its $1.80 a gallon. So, I mean, we\u2019re back down to very low levels and in terms of diesel and gasoline, there is a big expense for us for our internal and outbound logistics. So that\u2019s a bit advantage again to us.", "Of course our customers read the papers as well. So they will expect to have that pass onto them. So we should have some gain there. We\u2019d be hopeful of that. And we hedge forward about depending on the product we\u2019re in of coal, pet coke, diesel and gasoline. We tend to hedge forward somewhere between 25% and 50% of our usage just to cover off. We don\u2019t try and make money on this. We just try and make sure it\u2019s stable.", "And with our coal and pet coke, it\u2019s been broadly in line and they\u2019re fine. No big shifts and no big movements there as well. Gas has crept over a bit in recent times but it\u2019s only couple of percent, so no big shift. The big movement is the movements in oil, and I think the fact that oil, as I said, the fact that oil is now $45, $46 for Brent. Broadly speaking I think that\u2019s where it\u2019s going to be for the next two to three quarters. I think that provides within opportunity again to again sort of getting advantage with regard to margin, but also particularly with regard to our bitumen business, the fact that asphalt prices coming down, we look at that as being a positive and as we ship more volumes.", "Robert Eason", "Can I just have one more question there? Just given the robustness of the first quarter, what sort of insights can you share in terms of the operating leverage that you\u2019re seeing in the business, and I know Q1 in terms of seasonality, etcetera. But has operating leverage surprised on the upside in relation to the way that volume dropped through?", "Albert Manifold", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s more returning to the longer term trends that we\u2019re looking at. Leverage is impacted by so many things. The mix of businesses that are stronger than others. Obviously there is different cost base, but I would say - I\u2019d be guiding people back down to the lower end of where we have been. Consistently we\u2019ve been at sort of - we\u2019ve been guiding to the 15% to 20%. I\u2019ll put people maybe at the upper end of that range but certainly that was what we saw last year was a result of strong tailwinds of commodities, very strong pricing, currency coming back to help us, all of those things helped us in 2015. Hard to see that perfect storm coming again, but I think we will see good delivery on leverage. Of course it\u2019s low volumes coming through. By the time we get to the first half of the year and we report them in August, we\u2019ll have a much better view for what that is.", "Robert Eason", "Great. Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from William Jones from Redburn. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "William Jones", "Thanks. I think I\u2019ve got three quick ones, if I can please. First, just around the synergies on the LafargeHolcim deal. Perhaps you can just give us a kind of qualitative update on where you are as we sit a few months in to the year? And just as a reminder of the \u20ac120 million total target, how much of that do you think will happen in 2016? Second one was just around disposals. Perhaps you could - of the \u20ac80 million or so, perhaps you could just give us an idea of where they were, if they were concentrated in any one area or division? And are we looking now at that number, the cumulative number, being closer probably to the \u20ac2 billion, rather than \u20ac1.5 billion for the total portfolio review program? And then the last one is just really a question around the highway contract award data that we see. I don\u2019t know if you guys track that or not, but it has been weaker now for a few months in a row and difficult to know whether it\u2019s sort of comparative from last year, or something to do with the FAST Act renewal timing? But just wondered if that\u2019s anything you recognize or see on the ground as an issue, or are you still very happy with just that general outlook for U.S. highway specifically? Thanks.", "Albert Manifold", "Hi, Will. Good morning. Three questions there. Just obviously on the highway contract awards in terms of some of the various [indiscernible] we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of months. I\u2019ll take that one. And the first question with regards to update for the synergies and with regard to LafargeHolcim, I\u2019ll ask again Maeve to update you on it. And just on the disposals where we are with the overall - I mean, Frank has been heavily involved in doing that, so I\u2019ll actually leave it to talk to a lot of this and maybe ask Frank just his comments with regard to where we are with regards to the overall program.", "With regards to the highway contract, I wouldn\u2019t react insignificantly to some of the variation you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of months. Small volumes, quite regional movements, Florida, South Carolina, Georgia have seen some slowdowns there but nothing significant. More to do with the timing of ordering contract than anything more significant. No structural shift. No need to be concerned. We look at this through backlogs going forward that go forward for many months rather than specific awards in a particular week or a period or a month.", "And so it\u2019s just more regional little bit of shift. Nothing significant. They are big regions for us by the way anyway, and even though the Florida awards are down, our Florida business is up again in the first quarter.", "William Jones", "Okay.", "Albert Manifold", "So no need to be concerned about that whatsoever. Maybe comment on synergies in terms of what we expect this year in terms of overall in terms of costs.", "Maeve Carton", "Okay. Thanks Robert - good morning, Will. As you\u2019ve pointed out, we increased our forecast for the synergies focus with regard to Holcim transaction to \u20ac120 million over the three year - I think the first three years.", "In very rough terms we expect that to be delivered broadly equally over the three years. As we said back in February, or at the end of February, the businesses have now been integrated into CRH and we\u2019re running them as integrated business in each of the regions and that have been - the progress on that\u2019s been probably faster than - very much in line with what we expected and hoped for. So the progress of integration is very - and we\u2019re very happy with this. So we\u2019re on track to deliver around 40 million for 2015, 2016 rather.", "At CRL equally very well integrated into our BuildingEnvelope business. There the synergies were in the order of $40 million and we\u2019ve indicated a three-year period for those, and again that business is very well integrated and running very well together, so we\u2019re very much on track for those two.", "Albert Manifold", "Actually one comment I\u2019ll just pass it on. I was in New York two weeks ago meeting investors and actually I was asked to update me on the integration team, it took me completely by surprise because there is no integration team any more. The business has been integrated [indiscernible] over and done at this stage. So we\u2019ve done it faster, just focus on synergies.", "William Jones", "Great.", "Albert Manifold", "Yes, may be on the disposal, Frank just to update people.", "Frank Heisterkamp", "Good morning, Will. The only thing there is obviously a note in the statement this morning we had. So far this year roughly \u20ac80 million on disposal proceeds that we generated from - I think, the most noteworthy point is that when we came out, I think you remember 18 months ago little bit over, we started the disposal program and announced it first, tied \u20ac1.5 billion to \u20ac2 billion and then we were asked about timing and expectations, I think we were looking at several years.", "Now here we are 18 months later. We have total proceeds from the program just over \u20ac1.5 billion achieved already. I would expect that this continues throughout the year probably not at the same speed that we have seen last year, but I would expect the proceeds to increase because I think it\u2019s noteworthy when you talk to the divisions reviewing the portfolio and considering disposals of certain assets, non-core assets is I believe is very much embedded kind of in the day-to-day thinking of the management team, not just the senior management team and all the way down to the organization.", "So I would expect this continues at steady flow of disposal proceeds coming in. I can\u2019t give you a number what I think the target for the end of the year because honestly there is no fixed target for the end of the year. But I would expect this to continue at a steady rate.", "William Jones", "Great. Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "Quite frankly there is no target there. What we can tell to you is the efficiencies remains very much the core of what we do in CRH going forward.", "William Jones", "Thanks.", "Albert Manifold", "Thanks, Will.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Betts from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Mike Betts", "Yes. Thank you very much. I had two questions, please. First one on Americas Products, the difference between the 35% growth in Architectural Products and 5% in Precast. Could you give us just a little bit more detail about what you think is behind that? And then secondly, just a very general question. Cement pricing, Albert, all the majors were talking about an improving outlook when we had their comments in March. It sounded from your comments on sort of Poland, Switzerland, and Norway that you had that view as well. Is this something more for the future, though, or have you seen any sign of it sequentially in Q1 versus Q4? And could you also talk about what you\u2019ve seen in France in terms of cement pricing, because I think it\u2019s surprisingly been quite a bit off in the last couple of years? Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "Hi, Mike. Good morning. Two questions there, which I\u2019ll take both of them. The second one on cement pricing with regards to where it was in Europe in Q1, Q4 in specific countries that you talked about. I\u2019ll talk about them in seconds, but maybe I\u2019ll address your first question which is on the differences between the performance of our two of our - three component parts of our Americas Products business, being an APG, which is grown, as you rightly say about 35% of Precast which is about 5% of difference.", "And really it\u2019s the nature of the product that we have. Our APG product which is Architectural Product Groups, effectively what they sell are formed and value-added blocks, pavers, cap stones and concrete products. And at this time of the year, effective what we\u2019re selling in is we\u2019re selling in largely most of our products into the two big box stores, Lowes and Home Depot into the early season sell-n for their spring seller.", "So effectively our selling products was there where people are improving or renovating their back garden, their back lot or the patio area. So at this time of the year, we\u2019re selling in, in February and March in for their spring season. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s a very strong seller. And what you see now is we\u2019re seeing now in the month of April that business goes flash for four to five weeks because that\u2019s when they sell the product out of the stores. And what we watch for and I want you guys to watch for is when Lowes and Home Depot report their first quarter sales numbers to see exactly what they report because if they report strong reports we get a second sell-in there which we don\u2019t budget for, we don\u2019t account for, we don\u2019t expect but it\u2019s sometimes we get it. We get a second sell-in, and if they get good sell-through they pull ours through, sort of a late spring, early summer. So that\u2019s the strong demand period for that product.", "Precast on the other side of things is of course very much - Precast tends to be heavy residential, particularly non-residential and also infrastructure, and of course that\u2019s impacted by the general construction seasonality. So that\u2019s of course as you can expect our business the Northern parts of the United States is significant impacted by the cold winters and it\u2019s at lower levels of activity.", "What we have seen though even though it should be a slow part of the year, we had a good start to last year at the Precast was ahead about 5% which is just the nature of the - the heavy nature of that business being the infrastructure non-residential which is the difference between the two of those. I see some issue with particular with the first three or four months and the difference selling periods for those products.", "And with regards to cement pricing in Europe. You\u2019re comments on quarter one versus quarter four, no difference. I would say no difference at all. I mean, the pricing effectively for Europe is done at these times. Now we\u2019re in the middle of us. So we\u2019re starting out now, really as the season starts to pick up, particularly we should go to Eastern Europe is the later part of - later season pickup. So now is when you start to push pricing.", "The pricing in Western Europe now is impacted by the cold winters has been may be about a month earlier. Specifically the countries that you mentioned there with regards to France. Yes, seeing a slight improvement in France although as you absolutely correct when you say, Mike, is that pricing slipped in - tail end of 2014, 2015 but I see - I think it will be slightly up again this year but it\u2019s a way back.", "With regards to Switzerland, I think exactly the same situation. I think there has been - I would note that in the last - I would say in the last four or five weeks that we\u2019ve seen a little bit of stability counter-pricing in Switzerland and I will be more positive about pricing in Switzerland this year than I have in for the last couple of years. I think it\u2019s kind of - I think it\u2019s worst to stable, at best it could be up.", "With regard to Poland and at the eastern corridor that I talked about, and you mentioned Norway, but we don\u2019t cover Norway so I can\u2019t comment on it, but Finland we do. I think Finland, Poland, Romania, those markets there, now is the time Finnish pricing is been okay. It\u2019s fairly lackluster but good volume growth there. But Poland and Romania will be a very important issue. I think what we saw in both of those markets last year, you saw strong volume growth but you saw pricing go down.", "Now pricing does not tends to work in a V-shape. It tends to flatten out in the U. So you tend to have a clear stability before it goes back again. In saying that I think that all of the people in the industry have had several years of very difficult environment with regard to volume. There has been no pricing increases impact, as I said, in real price decreases and I think people have invested in significantly a significant amount of high and expensive cement equipment that has to be paid for.", "The new regulations are opposing significant emissions constraints upon people. It requires consistent capital expenditure, and all of that means that people have got to get return. I think there is - my own general sense is there is a need and a desire to want to get some cement pricing try and generate that in a world of slower volume growth.", "My own sense is that across the market you\u2019re talking about, I mean, I could go market by market but it will take an hour to do it. My own sense is that we will see during the quarter 2016 stability and a little bit better beyond that towards the tail end of this year and certainly in 2017, I think should become established.", "By the way, this is the United States of 2012. That\u2019s where we are in Europe now. Not that the hockey sick recovery but we had this very same issue in the United States regarding to Ag, cement pricing as well.", "Mike Betts", "Thank you very much.", "Albert Manifold", "Okay. I\u2019m just cognizant of our time here. I could just maybe take maybe one more call or maybe two more calls if you could squeeze them in quickly. So we\u2019ll do it as quickly as we can.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Elodie Rall from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Elodie Rall", "Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe two remaining on Europe just given following up on what you\u2019ve said through the call. I don\u2019t quite understand why you were thinking in guide that EBITDA will be stable in H2, given your comments on the main market, especially U.K., France, and given that it\u2019s already up a bit in H1? And second, maybe a word on Brazil. I know it\u2019s a small market for you, but do you have any indication on trends so far? Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "I\u2019m sorry, Elodie, could you just repeat the second part of that question. The line just broke up there, I\u2019m afraid. We didn\u2019t hear it clearly.", "Elodie Rall", "So the second question is on Brazil. If you could give us some indication on the year-to-date trends there and what you\u2019re seeing in that market?", "Albert Manifold", "Okay. Maybe I\u2019ll take the question on Brazil first, then maybe I\u2019ll pass the question on the overall first half in terms of how we see the trends for the first half and second half to my colleague, Senan, he might just take that one.", "With regards to Brazil. Look, Brazil has had a tough line over the last 12 to 18 months. GDP is due to 4% - I think 3.5%, 4% this year. Volumes are down by 4% or 5%. Prices are down by 5% to 6%. So it\u2019s been a very challenging environment for everybody in that marketplace. What we have done is of course we have plans in there small part of our business and it\u2019s not going to be a very significant part for CRH.", "What we have to do in time is to look and see exactly how we can build that business from strength. We have a platform down there. We have got some good people down there and what we\u2019re working with our own expertise, trying to establish a business plan for us going forward in the phase of fairly tough volume environment and very tough prices. So we\u2019ve had a double whammy. But we are long-term players. I believe in South America - I believe in Brazil, it has historically been a very good place to do business for cement people in particular and there is good demand dynamics going forward, strong population growth.", "So the long-term dynamics are good. I think it\u2019s just a question from our point of view with our team down there to figure out what\u2019s the step - how we step our business up and across. But we have a good footprint there and I\u2019d be positive about that business going forward.", "Maybe Senan you might just comment in terms of the half one and half two.", "Senan Murphy", "Yes, in terms of the EBITDA, obviously what we said is for the half year where we have good line of sight as we look out now over the next three, four months that we would guide close to a \u20ac1 billion, which is mid-single-digit growth over the pro forma last year.", "When we talk about second half, what we\u2019re guiding is that we\u2019d expect to continue to make progress on the EBITDA in the second half. At this stage, it\u2019s too early to be more definitive on the second half. We\u2019ll have a better indication of that as we get to the half year and we\u2019ll give you more clarity at that stage.", "Elodie Rall", "Yes, thanks. But my question was mostly on Europe, because you\u2019re guiding for EBITDA being stable in Europe in H2. And given the comments you\u2019ve made so far, I just struggled to understand how it can be just stable?", "Albert Manifold", "Like anybody else, we can only talk with accuracy with what we see in front of us. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball that can tell us what the second half of the year will bring. We\u2019re commenting what we see for the first half of the year, and what that would lead to with our own experience for the second half of the year. I think when we come to August we\u2019ll obviously be much better informed in regard to it. Everybody can have different views but as we see as - our view is to try and to mitigate the best information we have and that\u2019s what we see at this moment in time.", "I\u2019m just going to take one more call if I can, please. So just - because I think we lose this call in about three minutes, so maybe I\u2019ll just - maybe get through it quickly and answer it quickly as we can.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Christen Hjorth from Numis. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Christen Hjorth", "Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick ones from me. I now you broke down that pro forma EBITDA for last year. Could you quickly run through the H1, H2 pro forma for revenue for the Group? And then secondly, in the U.S. on the residential side, just your view of outlook in terms of both newbuild and repair and maintenance?", "Albert Manifold", "I\u2019ll take the second part in terms of residential. With regards to the breakdown of that, I\u2019m going to ask very quickly just in sense just touch it on. But a detailed question I think it\u2019s probably best taken offline in terms of hard to give numbers down the line. So I\u2019m very happy. So maybe I\u2019ll deal with the residential in terms of that.", "Look, the drivers of the U.S. economy in terms of construction going forward, obviously three majors being the infrastructure which is 50% of construction growth. For us, we seem to be in a world - obviously with the FAST Act there committing extra funds to it. I think it provides more stability and visibility than any times from this year with continued safe spending. I mean, we see there, there are something like it\u2019s 41, 42 initiatives across many states. In fact over the next five years on top of the federal funding, it\u2019s going to commit about $22 billion or $23 billion of extra funding over the next five years means that our sense is that the growth in the infrastructure, certainly for our area of infrastructure is going to be in that 3% to 4% in the next couple of years.", "So that gives growth there, a good growth with regard to that. With regard to specific questions on residential, non-residential. I mean, the ABI is a very good indicator in terms of where residential is going. I think what we\u2019re seeing now in the growth in non-residential is as a result of the ABI index of 12 to 14, 15 months ago which was in the high 50s.", "You would see that come back down during the course of 2015. It actually dipped a lower I think with that 49 in January back to about 50, 51. 51 now I think it is. So I think what you\u2019re seeing is - so that would mean that I would expect non-residential the pace of growth to slow down but of course once it\u2019s above 50, it\u2019s growth.", "But the pace of growth would slow down. Residential for me is continues long-term growth here. I mean this year we\u2019ll do in the region of 1.1 billion homes significantly below the long-term needs of the United States, growing population there. So I think that\u2019s going to be continuing good new story there of sort of mid-single-digit growth in residential. So I think that underpins good construction activity during the course of 2016.", "With regards to the number, maybe I might just leave the numbers on the revenues.", "Christen Hjorth", "Sure.", "Albert Manifold", "Because I\u2019m just looking at the time. We\u2019re going to lose the call in another 30 seconds. Look, sorry for rushing at the end there. Look, I just want to say thank you for your attention this morning and look, we look forward to updating you at the end of August, August 25 when we\u2019re going to report our interims for the first six months.", "As I said to you most of our comments this morning were more directional and that\u2019s specific in nature. But activity has been good in the first quarter. It bodes well for the first half as we\u2019ve indicated this morning and we\u2019ll update you in the actual numbers when we see you in August.

I\u2019d like to welcome you to the 2016 Interim Results for CRH here today in London. My name is Albert Manifold; I\u2019m the Chief Executive of CRH. And I\u2019m joined here on stage by Senan, Senan Murphy.", "Senan Murphy", "Good morning, everyone.", "Albert Manifold", "Senan is our new CFO. And together, for the next 30 minutes, so we\u2019re going to take you through a presentation of really what\u2019s behind the results you\u2019ve seen this morning, the story behind them, and how we see the world, a little bit about 2016, of course, upfront. But I\u2019m going to take about 5 minutes, at the end of that presentation, before the Q&A, just to take you through the changes that we\u2019ve been through in our business, and looking at where we are now and where we see the next few years.", "The years 2009 to, I suppose 2012, 2013, we had a terrible recession, significant restructuring cost cutting, really sort of getting in pace with the volumes we saw there. 2014, market changed. We reset our business for the next phase of growth across CRH. I suppose, 2015 really was the year of big deals, and 2016 is a year of deliveries, as we said last year. I think it\u2019s good to ask ourselves the question now, as we see the year coming out ahead of us, where 2017 is going to be, and, indeed, the years to 2020, 2021, and just give you a sense of where we see our business. And after that, of course, we\u2019ll go in to Q&A here in the room, and we\u2019ll have people on the wires as well.", "So maybe just kicking off, looking at some of the key messages, I\u2019m not going to dwell too much on this page. Two points I want to make about this. I came up through the operations of CRH and for me as an operator, the real health of the business is shown by the margins and the returns that deliver by the business. And we can see our business, again, ahead in the first half of the year, ahead of margins and returns in all divisions, real, great strength coming through, and also very strong, tight cash management, delivering a very good cash performance for the first half of the year. And Senan is going to take you through how our cash performance in this first half of the year should unwind towards the end of the year and give you a sense of where we see the year-end debt level, which is crucial to us, of course, returning to the M&A game.", "Looking at some of the key numbers here, and this is a page of big numbers at this stage, and again, two numbers I\u2019d just like to highlight you there. The EBITDA margin, on a pro forma basis, almost 1% ahead of last year. A real sense of good leverage in our business, tightly managed. This business has come back. And for the first time in, since, I guess, 2010, 2009 actually, our dividend moving ahead. Really, a sense of showing that our businesses are moving ahead in terms of performing ahead of our plan, good strong cash performance, and, really, a sign of confidence of where we see the business going forward. I\u2019m glad to see that returning again. We had a progressive dividend policy for 26 years, we held it for the last seven years. To me, that seven years is almost as impressive as the 26 years before that. But now we return to dividend increases again, which is good to see.", "We\u2019re going to talk about the trading performance of the businesses across our new structure. We announced there, a couple of weeks ago, that we\u2019re reporting with the Americas, as we\u2019ve always done, but now Europe, and a division in Asia as well. I\u2019m going to go through the performance across those three territories, just to give you a sense of how our business has performed. Just looking at Europe, first and foremost, the map on the right, with all the different colored shades of blue, that shows you the countries that we\u2019re in across Europe. Very substantial business, at this stage, of size and scale and breadth, really, as a result of the big transactions we did last year. But more importantly, it shows you across Europe the GDP trends. All of those are showing growth in 2016. That\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve seen that in quite some time. So, we\u2019re seeing some very early stages of recovery starting to come through, it\u2019s low growth, it\u2019s slow but it\u2019s starting. The impact of Brexit, the vote was only nine weeks ago today, is not really fully understood here in the UK and also in continent of Europe we haven\u2019t really got a sense of what the impact in the medium term will be, I am sure we\u2019ll talk about that later on. As of yet we haven\u2019t seen any real impact on our businesses. But one thing is for sure, is construction markets across Europe are well below long term trends and needs and construction spending is forecast increases. What we need to debate, of course, is the pace of that growth and the period of which it\u2019s going to extend over.", "Looking at the trading performance for the first half of the year, you can see really two quarters very different in Europe. The first quarter, relatively flat with the first quarter of last year, but in the second quarter we returned to growth. I should say all of that growth is volume led, there is still almost no pricing in Europe and that one or two markets we do see pricing coming through, but it\u2019s all running that, but that\u2019s entirely consistent with what we said in the past in that recovery will come to in volume first and then prices will follow. Do you remember the USA in 2011-2012 that\u2019s where we are het again volumes come back first and it took two or three years before pricing became an embedded part of the business and is there now a conference that will happen in Europe in the years ahead.", "So, looking at the growth rates that we\u2019re seeing in quarter two and for the first half of the year, we expect that modest low level of volume led growth to continue for the remainder of the year across Europe. And just to give you a sense of our businesses in Europe now post the big deals that we did it\u2019s important now that CRH is now the largest heavyside business in Europe, across 13 major geographies a very deep embedded business across residential, non-residential and indeed infrastructure. These new platforms that we acquired last year in the United Kingdom, in France and Germany and in Southeast Europe will not only give us growth to acquisition but as we said last year, will beget a decade of further vertical integrated growth in our business that\u2019s what we always do. We buy the platform and we grow downstream and we will intend to do that on those new platforms. I should say I am talking about Europe here, but I am going to include Canada and the Philippines in this as well, is the integration of those heavyside assets we bought last year is now complete, they are now CRH there is no more LafargeHolcim; it\u2019s now CRH. We\u2019ve done very well. We\u2019ve done quicker than we thought. Our synergy delivery is on track and in fact we identified 40 million of synergies this year, but during the course of this year we\u2019ve identified a further incremental 10 million this year or we\u2019re tracking about 50 million this year. So we should increase the overall total by about 10 million, but again we\u2019ll come back and update to you with us at the end of the year when we\u2019ve delivered.", "Well, let\u2019s talk about what we\u2019ve done rather than what we\u2019re going to do. Just turning to the Americas and very different click on terms of economic growth here across the pond in the United States and even Canada, but particularly in the United States, very positive economic momentum and of course construction market as you will have seen are consistently outpacing economic growth and we\u2019re seeing this in our businesses, primarily led by a very strong consistently strong residential and non-resident markets probably moving in the range of 3% to 3.5% volume growth year-on-year which is consistent with what everybody is telling you. Infrastructure is also powering ahead, good strength consistently coming through underpins now by long term funding that\u2019s in place that for 2020 gives us good momentum behind that business and all of these underpinning a very good pricing environment as well, as we seek to recover seven years of no pricing in the United States this is our third year of getting pricing back and we\u2019re still not back to where we should. So that coming through on top of volume is very good for our businesses. And just to give it a size and scale of the USA one number I want to pick out on the right hand side of the page which really stands out for me, over the next decade the U.S. will spend $10 trillion on construction. That\u2019s the size of the GDP of China, the second-largest economy in the world. So a very significant opportunity for us in the U.S. as we go forward.", "Looking at the performance of our U.S. business, a very strong first quarter. Now, that has to be taken in to consideration of very favorable weather. In our businesses in the U.S., we would not expect to start working until the second week of March. Actually, for the second week of January we were back working, so we effectively had almost two extra months of construction spend. Happily, we didn\u2019t borrow from the future, because the backlogs were very good going forward. So it was just extra work that needed to be done. But we\u2019ve returned to more normalized trends in the second quarter, and they\u2019re the trends that we\u2019re seeing rolling out during the current quarter. I mean, it\u2019s going fairly well, we\u2019re halfway through our most important quarter, the third quarter in the United States, and it seems to be tracking the second quarter volume level, pricing levels we\u2019ve seen there.", "Margins and returns in the U.S. ahead in all divisions, as they are in Europe, again, again, the real sign of health of our business coming through. And happily, the Canadian business is fully integrated now as part of our Americas business, integrated with the business itself, the border, performing very well. The interaction between the two teams has gone very, very well. The Canadian team have stepped up and the performance in the first half of the year of 2016 is ahead of the first half of 2015, and we\u2019re delighted to see that. ", "Again, just a sense of the opportunity we see, and what we see our business delivering across the Americas, and specifically in the United States. We\u2019re the largest building materials player in all of the United States, and growing. The top 10 players in the United States only make up 25% of the total aggregate and asphalt market out there, so significantly fragmented market, many, many years of consolidation to come, which is exactly where we want it to be. The margins and returns that we are generating through our U.S. businesses are ahead of where I, as an operations guys, and we, as a team, would expect them to be at this point in the cycle, which is very interesting. Not really surprising, but interesting, and it\u2019s caused by couple of things.", "During the period 2009 to about 2013, we went through a very significant restructuring program. We took out to the \u20ac2.5 billion of costs across all our businesses. But we also reinvested in our businesses. We reinvested across our group, in the teeth of the recession, \u20ac2.5 billion in capital expenditure. Now that went in to make our businesses more efficient, more effective, better placed, and better balanced. And we\u2019re seeing the benefit of that coming through now as the volumes return with higher margins, and good leverage, and good drop through to the bottom-line, which is contributing to better returns.", "And I should say, with regard to CRL, the C.R. Laurence business which we acquired last year, $1.3 billion deal last August, the integration of that business has gone well. It\u2019s performing very well, synergy delivery is on track, and, again, that business is ahead for the first half in 2016 versus a pro forma 2015. So, delighted to see that. And the team did a great job there, as well. Just moving to our new division of Asia, which is primarily about Philippino business, the business in the Philippines, and just to remind you of what that is. The Philippines is a country of 100 million people. Ours is a cement business there. It\u2019s a 20 million tonne cement market, and we\u2019re the number two player there with about 6 million tonnes of cement capacity. We are completely sold out, by the way, as is everybody. We\u2019re importing cement to supply that market. The business has gone very well, driven by strong residential, strong repatriation of funds from overseas, Philippines who are sending money back to build the residential market, but very strong commitment to infrastructure. And the new administration has almost doubled the commitment to infrastructure in the next five years, which is good to see. And that\u2019s going to underpin demand for those markets again for the next decade or so and the key chance for ourselves is to build capacity to match demand and supply of the market which we will do. And we have signaled that to the market and we\u2019ll let you know about we make a decision in 2017-2018. With good growth in top line, good control of costs, profit ahead and we\u2019re very pleased the way that has landed within CRH ahead of last year. Just to call out to two countries at the bottom of that chart there India and China neither of which I should say are consolidated in the EBITDA number we\u2019ve seen this morning. India is a 50-50 joint venture, broadly speaking volumes are ahead in India, prices are back. We deliver on average and this should we will do again mid single-digit returns on that business that\u2019s a long term play for pretty good business.", "China, a much more challenging environment, the overall market for many businesses in China significant volume reduction down in that business and grappling with the challenges of overcapacity that was going to be with us and that will play up overtime our investment there is a 26% holding in the northeast of China [indiscernible] in the period.", "So pulling on that together and just to give you a sense and take walk through our first half performance in 2016 versus last year. On the left hand side of the slide you can see the EBITDA performance for CRH last year of \u20ac555 million. To that we add the pro forma first half LafargeHolcim of 2015 to give us \u20ac934 million as a pro forma half one 2015 results for CRH and the growth you can see coming against that in this current year is pretty much all coming from the heritage businesses which is a real final strength in our core asset base businesses, delivering good volumes, good pricing, good margins and better returns. I should say with regard to LafargeHolcim, they are also delivering very well as indeed our CRL, with LafargeHolcim specifically last year they delivered an EBITDA pro forma of about 820 million that was up from the previous year of 750 million so very significant uptick in one year for those businesses. And we said in February if we could hold that for this year I thought that will be a very good performance, well actually the first half of the year you can see they are actually ahead again, so good to see that. On all of those coming together to deliver an EBITDA figure for the first half of 2016 of \u20ac1.12 billion. So that\u2019s really a little bit of what behind the delivery of the numbers themselves, the story behind it, what\u2019s driving the numbers.", "I am going to ask Senan now to take you through the actual components of the actual profit growth itself and crucially take you through what\u2019s been happening in the cash side of things and where we see the cash ending up and debt ending up at the end of the year. Senan?", "Senan Murphy", "Thanks Albert. Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure for me to be here and this is my first opportunity to actually to speak all of you at a results event. And with a very strong set of results it certainly a nice way to be able to start this conversation. So today what I\u2019d like to do is just spend a few minutes running through some of the highlights of our financial performance for the first half of the year.", "So starting sales and earnings. Today we\u2019re reporting a sales number of \u20ac12.7 billion for the first half of the year that is a 35% increase over the corresponding period last year. In addition, we\u2019re reporting an EBITDA of \u20ac1.12 billion that is more than double the EBITDA that we reported for the first half of last year. Very strong performance. As you can see on this slide there are number of components, number of elements that are driving that strong performance. The one that stands out most for me however, is the organic growth is this significant organic growth that we\u2019ve delivered in the last six months. What you can see here is organic sales growth of \u20ac800 million in the first half and a corresponding EBITDA growth in organic terms of \u20ac150 million. That converts to a 19% operating leverage. That\u2019s significant profit delivery. Obviously, the other significant component in the first half of this year is a contribution from those large acquisitions that Albert mentioned earlier that we completed in the second half of last year.", "Here you can see that those deals are contributing nearly \u20ac2.9 billion in sales and over \u20ac380 million in EBITDA in the first six months of this year. As Albert mentioned earlier on, those deals now are fully integrated in to our business, they\u2019re delivering on their synergies, they\u2019re performing in line with our expectations, and we\u2019re very happy with the way they\u2019re operating.", "Next, we move on to our operating cash highlights. The key takeaway for me on this slide is the fact that our cash flow from operations in the first half of this year is \u20ac300 million better than the corresponding period last year. Again, there is a number of key drivers behind that. Obviously, our earnings delivery, our earnings growth is a major contributor, and, certainly, our ability to be able to convert those earnings in to cash flows. But there\u2019s two other items that I\u2019d like to call out here on this cash flow that bear attention, our capital expenditure, and our working capital.", "On capital expenditure, we\u2019re investing over \u20ac400 million across our business in the first half of the year, that equates to 80% depreciation. I guess, in addition, there\u2019s a very strong focus and control around this to make sure that, that capital spend gives us a strong return on investments. And the best way to think about that, or articulate that, is that during 2016 we would expect that 40% of that capital spend is on expansion activity, or expansion investment, as opposed to maintenance or replacement activity.", "The other item that\u2019s worth attention here is the working capital. You can see, in the first half of the year, that we had an outflow in working capital. That reflects the seasonal nature of our business. We always have, in the first half of the year, a situation where we ramp up our working capital balances in preparation for a busy second half of the year. So rather than focusing on a movement here, I think what\u2019s more important is to focus on the absolute balances. And if you look at our working capital balances at the end of June, and think about them as a percentage of sales, what you will see is continues improvement over previous years.", "So this area gets a very strong focus across the business. It\u2019s one that everybody is measured on, and it\u2019s one we pay a lot of attention to, and, as a result, you\u2019re seeing progress year on year. And finally, moving on to our net debt. Albert gave you the summary in his introduction. We\u2019re ahead of our de-leveraging target. What we\u2019ve shown you here is our forecast year-end net debt position. Rather than focusing on the mid-year one, which is obviously impacted by that seasonal working capital feature I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re looking forward to year-end. And what we\u2019ve shown you here is our expected movement in net debt over 2016.", "The big standout you can see is a \u20ac1 billion of cash inflow from operations. So that is that strong earnings delivery we\u2019ve talked about being converted in to cash. It\u2019s also worth highlighting here that we are assuming for this year, that our acquisition activity will be funded by proceeds from divestments. That was the case in the first half of the year. We spent \u20ac150 million in the first half on acquisitions, and that was largely funded by the \u20ac140 million of proceeds that we got from divestments. And the final feature on this moment that is worth acknowledging is that we will be spending approximately \u20ac400 million on dividends back to our shareholders during 2016. So where that leaves us with is a position whereby at the end of this year we\u2019re comfortable and we will be at or below \u20ac6 billion of net debt. When you think about that net debt as a ratio to EBITDA, it sets us up to be in a position where our net debt to EBITDA by the end of the year is at two times or below.", "So the summary for me is that we\u2019re ahead on our deleveraging targets and we\u2019re well on track to move our balance sheet back to normalized levels. And that we\u2019re well set to exit 2016 with a really strong balance sheet.", "So I am going to hand you back now to Albert. He is going to give you a little bit more color about the second half outlook.", "Albert Manifold", "Thanks and leave that slide up there for a moment because that to me is probably the most important slide in the presentation this morning. We went to our shareholders 16, 18 months ago, we asked them to trust us. We said, we want your money please, we\u2019re going to take that money, we\u2019re going to borrow more money and we\u2019re going to invest in assets that\u2019s great value for your our shareholders. And a key part of that promise to them was we will pay back that money we borrow as quickly as possibly can to get the debt levels CRH back to where you expect them to be. And its credit to Senan and his team, may even the team before and did all the people in our group that we focused on that and it provides very strong tight cash management and are well on track to deliver our planned impact ahead of our plan.", "Just looking at the outlook for the CRH Group before I talk about where I see us going in the next few years. We\u2019ve signaled well to with our announcement at the end of October where our earnings levels are going to be somewhere north of \u20ac3 billion I don\u2019t know specifically where they are going to be and where it\u2019s going to land it depend on whether how long the season goes, volumes, pricing, whatever. We\u2019ll let you know as soon as we know. And as Senan has made clear to you the net debt at 6 billion you\u2019re looking at a net debt EBITDA ratio below our normalized levels at about two which is very good to see. That\u2019s going to be delivered by as I said earlier on modest growth continuing in Europe, it\u2019s a slow unwind, but growth all the same.", "In the Americas we have a very challenging second half comp, you will recall at the second half of last year there was no winter, in fact we worked all the way through Thanksgiving up to Christmas. We planned to work the Thanksgiving. This year, we plan to work Thanksgiving as well by the way. With given the pact of growth in the economy, given the pace of growth in construction markets, we still believe the second half performance in the United States will be ahead of the very, very good second half performance of 2015. And as we said, the back half in the Philippines is positive, good volume growth, good pricing, shows continue to deliver good profitable growth in the second half of the year.", "So that\u2019s how 2016 shapes up. And now let\u2019s talk a little bit about where actually 2016 leads us on to. This is the foundation for the next few years. And what I want to talk about is where we\u2019re positioned in our markets and how we see 2017 to 2020 rolling out and the next phase of growth for CRH. Let me start about this year. This is the foundation, this is a year as we set off delivery and for us talk about delivering our EBIT targets and our cash markets, plus some other interest and things are happening within our business. Our margins and returns are being restored very quickly. Of course that\u2019s to the strong operations delivery of our businesses, but it\u2019s also about disciplined capital management. In the last three years we disposed off over \u20ac1.5 billion of businesses at 10 times EBITDA, and we reinvested that at 8 times EBITDA. That capital management philosophy has been very supportive of improving returns in our businesses.", "And the last point, crucially, there, strong cash generation capability. Cash is the life blood, the oxygen of the business. We\u2019re using it now to restore our debt metrics, for sure. But as always, in the future, we\u2019ll use it for growth, capital expenditure, acquisitions, looking after our shareholders, but, in particular, growing our businesses. And having that oxygen, having that cash going forward is crucial to that growth story. And I think we\u2019ve proven again our ability, as we have in the past to deliver strong cash generation in our business. If I was standing here this morning and had to invest my elderly mother\u2019s pension fund, the two places in the world, I would invest her meager pension fund would be the United States and Europe. And, hey presto, look where we make 90% of our earnings.", "The two parts of the world where we see the most constant stable earnings flow in the next few years, where you can get cash out, and it\u2019s predictable, and you can plan your business, and you have visibility are the Americas and Europe. And 90% of our earnings are earned in those two geographies. Not only that, look on the right-hand side, we\u2019re the largest building materials player in all of the United States, by a country mile. Also, post the big transactions last year, we\u2019re the largest heavyside player in all of Europe. So we\u2019re in the right footprint, and we\u2019ve got leading positions. Crucially, we have got well-invested businesses that have the capacity to bring back volume through those businesses that gives good drop-through with leverage to the bottom-line.", "Our biggest business in CRH, U.S. materials, is only operating at 70% capacity, thus, it could put another 30% of volume through tomorrow, if the markets were there. Our cement business in Europe are working at less than 70% capacity. And, as anybody who runs a business knows, it\u2019s that filling up of capacity, where you get that good leverage and drop-through to the bottom-line, that helps deliver those increased margins and those better returns. And it should continue so, if the volumes come through. So we\u2019re in the right markets, got great market positions, we\u2019ve got the assets ready to go. But where\u2019s the volume going to come from? And that\u2019s about the cycle.", "And let\u2019s just stop and look at the cycle in Europe and in the U.S.. It\u2019s our contention, and I\u2019m going to discuss it in a moment, is the U.S., is not even yet at mid-cycle. And Europe, as we all know, is clearly just starting on a very slow growth phase. It will be low and slow, but it\u2019s growth. Just looking at the U.S., and there\u2019s a lot of facts on this page here, but three numbers I want to read to you, 4 million homes underbuilt since 2010, one in every six miles of U.S. roads in need of repair, and $225 billion of FAST Act highway funding put in place between 2016 to 2020, as U.S. construction activity levels returns to long-term trends, we believe we are going to see a sustained period of construction growth in the U.S. for the next five years, which sets our businesses up very well to enjoy the benefits of that.", "Looking at Europe, 400,000 homes per annum in housing starts below the long-term average, 2015 for the first time a decade, EUROCONSTRUCT showed that all 19 countries showed construction market growth, I can\u2019t remember when I last saw that, and over $1 trillion of private money available for investments in European infrastructure over the next decade, up about 35% to what it was in the previous decade. If you can recall the first slide we showed on Europe, GDP up in all major countries. EUROCONSTRUCT showing increases in 2015 and in 2016, for all of the big 19 countries it measures. And if you look to the presentation today, go to page 39 for those of you have it, look at the volume increases across all our markets. All of the 13 markets where we do business volumes are up. I can\u2019t remember when I have seen all of those three businesses pointing northward. And not, for a second saying Europe is in the hockey-stick growth both Europe stabilized over the last 12 or 18 months it is a volume that recovery it is going to be slow, but it\u2019s happening and pricing will follow in time.", "Look, it\u2019s very easy to stand here this morning and present a great set of numbers for CRH this is a good news day for CRH. All of the hard work that we\u2019ve done in the teeth of the recession and as we work past that recession doing big deals betting them down has been to get it to this point in time. In CRH we would believe that great companies produce superior performance not just in or two years but over sustained period of time. And looking at where we have our footprint and looking at our market positions and looking at where we are in the cycle and looking at what we do in terms of generating profitable growth, improving returns and margins and cash we believe the CRH has a great opportunity to capitalize on those market positions in the years ahead.", "Okay. So with that that\u2019s the end of the presentation part of this morning. And now going to move to questions and answers. Initially I would ask we go into the room probably give about 20, 25 minutes here in the room. We will have people on the telephone lines and particularly those on line who want to give questions. So If I can ask you can just raise your hand so the people with the microphones will go around, you can give your name and the name of the institution first and we get to as many people as we can. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Q - Yassine Touahri", "Good morning. Yassine Touahri from Exane BNP Paribas. A few questions. Firstly, on would you, there are a lot of political changes in Europe, in the UK, it\u2019s an election year in the U.S., there will be a lot of election in Continental Europe, how do you think this could impact your business? Do you see this as an opportunity? Do you see more infrastructure spending? Or do you see this as a risk? Then, my second question would be on cost inflation. What we\u2019ve seen since the beginning of the year is that commodity prices have started to increase and coal prices, asphalt costs are rising today. Do you think this could slow down the pace of your margin expansion next year? Or do you think this could be offset by more pricing? And the last question on capital allocation. We\u2019ve seen that you created an Asia division, does it mean that you\u2019ve got ambition to become bigger in this region through acquisition, or through CapEx?", "Albert Manifold", "Okay. So three questions there. One, discussing the political changes that may be coming in the United States and Europe 2017 with some elections in Europe and also at the end of this year the presidential in the U.S. and the impact that may have on infrastructure and a question on some cost inflation coming in whether that was with the margins we can manage our margins and the last question the ambition we have for acquisition based on the Asia business.", "On the first question, with regard to the political changes I think the U.S. has set its stall out with regard to infrastructure spend, absent what happens on the political stage. And the federal government have committed to the fact that funding and cash in place to increase funding for the next five years. In addition to that, we\u2019ve seen across the last 12, 14 months 18 states deliver specific stage initials that will deliver about 27 billion of extra funding to highways and road programs again over the next coming years. It is interesting to note if we add both of those together and look what happened over the last four or five years, because we can be seduced in to thinking that the current environment is the new normal, we spent, in the United States, about $420 billion on roads over the last four, five years, four years. In the next four years, with the federal money and the state money that\u2019s committed, that\u2019s likely to be closer to $470 billion.", "So I think we\u2019re looking at a very significant uptick of 11%, 12% in actual dollars of spend available for U.S. infrastructure in the next number of years. With regard to Europe, of course, a lot of the European infrastructure spending comes from the European Union, and, of course, it comes from local governments. Most of that is focused, over 50% of that is focused on Eastern Europe, and most of that is focused on big countries, such as Poland and Romania. I don\u2019t think that any of the elections next year going to have a significant impact on that. They are long-term programs that take place over decades, and they\u2019re put in place for seven, eight years, or so, so I don\u2019t significantly, I think it\u2019s going to be a significant difference.", "With regard to cost inflation, and what we\u2019re seeing in our businesses. For the first half of the year I\u2019ll actually say, probably, we have seen cost deflation in our business with commodity prices. And we cover forward a lot of our other costs, electricity, coal, petcoke, oil, et cetera, et cetera, so it tends to evolve over time, we\u2019re not seeing any cost inflation pressures. But normally, we do have a good track record of passing on cost inflation in our businesses, in particular, in periods of better volumes. In tough periods of volume is more challenging.", "So I don\u2019t have any concerns in terms of margin compression with regard to any cost inflation we might see in our markets, and with regard to the Asia division, the Asia division really was a reflection of the fact that we had a business of size and scale out there in the Philippines. The Indian and Chinese businesses do take up a lot of management time, they need dedicated management focus so it\u2019s to reflect that. We have an ambition about growing our businesses in Asia, but very much in line with our long-stated strategy of slowly but surely feeding it out.", "You\u2019re not going to see a big explosion of CRH investment. We\u2019re linked with every second deal out in Asia, but that\u2019s the newspapers for you. We have a steady, progressive approach, built over decades, of how we see Asia evolving because of the slow game. And this, just setting up a division, doesn\u2019t signify any change in that strategy. It\u2019s a slow build out.", "Gregor Kuglitsch", "Gregor Kuglitsch from UBS. I\u2019ve got three questions. The first one is on pricing in Europe. Can you give us a little bit of an outlook when you see that turning, I think it was quite clear still under pressure in most of your geographies in the first half? That\u2019s the first question. The second question is can you give us some kind of sense, it\u2019s obviously difficult for us to do, as the business stands today, what you think, at the peak, on a pro forma basis, the EBITDA was? So against the \u20ac3 billion, do you have a rough guestimate for us, just so we have a little bit of reference point.", "And then as we go in to next year, I think you sort of called out, you\u2019ll be back in the M&A game, I think that\u2019s what you said. So, can you give us a little bit of color as to what kind of direction you\u2019re thinking? Is it rebalancing more away from cement and heavyside, which obviously you went a little bit overweight, or is it more a geographic game? So if you can give a bit of color of what we should be expecting in terms of M&A in to next year, please. Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "Okay, there\u2019s three questions there. Very quickly, on the, the pricing in Europe, you\u2019re right, it remains very challenging. And I do think that what was the pricing is behind us. What is significant, if you look on page 39, I\u2019m sorry to say, but a lot of the facts are on that page in terms of volumes and pricing with Europe, on the left hand side of the column, you\u2019ll see all the arrows pointing north, all pluses, which is volume. On the right hand side, which is pricing, all the arrows are pointing south. That just doesn\u2019t make sense. But actually, if you stop the clock and look at where you are in recession, the early stages of recession, normally, and we\u2019ve said this before, you see a scramble for volume as people try to fill capacity. And that tends to come at a little bit of pricing indiscipline. There are some good markets around where we start to see pricing coming back. And I believe that in this time make sure we would be in a better place and in 2018 we will be in a better place again, it\u2019s a long slow unwind, but I think we\u2019ve turned the quarter but it is challenging absolutely right.", "With regards to where we are, with regard to EBITDA and our business of this year versus where we were in terms of peak, it\u2019s a very different business of course and it\u2019s like comparing apples and oranges, it was below 3 billion in terms of peak in where we were plus our business now is completely different [indiscernible] different size, the volumes are impacted otherwise I am not too sure is actually comparable in terms of looking where it was. And with regards to the M&A and looking at that and where our focus is going forward, you\u2019re absolutely right we\u2019ve taken a shift towards the heavyside businesses but that was opportunity driven and we did say last year we felt that the deals that we did last year on the LafargeHolcim deals were very much three or four years of acquisitions compressed into one deal we saw the opportunity and we basically just executed that opportunity.", "We do have a long term strategy I think the balance business is against end use across different products and different geographies, that has not changed and will not change. Over time it will redress itself because when you make a big step to one direction you\u2019re not going to auto correct in 12 months, it will take time, but overtime what has dealt and delivered for CRH has been having a balanced strategy, it\u2019s help us ride out the recession much better than anybody else, strong cash flow, better balance to returns, better balance in terms of end user exposure and we think it\u2019s the right strategy about business going forward and that\u2019s what we will return to in time.", "Robert Gardiner", "Thanks. Rob Gardiner, Davy. Three for me again, it\u2019s brief, but just to go back on the European pricing and the kind of competitive dynamics there just to pick out a couple of markets where you have very large operations like Switzerland, Poland and even the Philippines related to what some peers are reporting, I don\u2019t know if you would just expand on the kind of competitive dynamics in those markets? Two, in terms of again back on M&A you obviously passed on a lot of deals this year I just wonder in terms of where price expectations are now, have they moved, are they reset higher? And just going back on the UK there the Brexit so rather than ask what\u2019s going to happen as a result of Brexit I am just wondering may be how your mind as a CEO changes due to the uncertainty, does it affect your CapEx decisions, capital allocation here, how you think about that? Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "Okay. They are three good questions there, Bob, I have to say and specifically going back in the pricing in European and you mentioned Switzerland, Poland and the Philippines and you\u2019re right, we have lost market share in Poland and we\u2019ve lost market share in Switzerland and we\u2019ve lost market share in the Philippines. Now, most people I know in CRH know that is, just goes against the grain we don\u2019t give away market share. But when I see the fact that and I take a country like Poland as a good example. Poland this year will have about 15.8 million tons of cement which is about 2% up on last year. That\u2019s the same level of cements demand as in 2008. The price of cement is 25% lower in Poland today than it was in 2008. And since then there are cost increases, increased regulation, increase of duplication, all of that has come through our businesses. So I believe as a chief executive of business we have to earn a price that helps us generate a level of profitability because return for the investments that we\u2019ve made the hundreds of millions of investment we\u2019ve made. You referenced other people who have produced results, we\u2019re down 9% on our volume in a market that\u2019s up 2%. All those are up double-digit percentage but their prices are in the toilet. I have no idea what they are at? But I know in running a business to the long term value for shareholders I have got to get paid for the product that we\u2019re selling.", "So, we\u2019re patient and we\u2019re showing forbearance, it won\u2019t last forever, but we\u2019re doing what we can. And that\u2019s the same story in Switzerland by the way and the same problem, people chasing short term gain by dropping prices that is not conducive for us running a long term business generating terms. In the Philippines it was the same case in the first-half of the year. We held our price in fact we increased price when others dropped us and one player in specifically decided to increase our volumes. Now they came back and they\u2019ve increased their price back to where the normal prices for everybody else in the market and the volume is coming back.", "So it\u2019s about strong leadership in a markets where in markets we\u2019re not the price leader but we\u2019re trying to show a solid price leadership in terms of getting returns to our shareholders I hope it will come through in time I believe it will. That\u2019s what\u2019s behind the differences you\u2019re seeing that we\u2019re talking about. We\u2019ve got M&A you\u2019re exactly right that we cut on a lot of deals in the current year. And in the last month or so there was two very big chunky deals in the U.S. both of them on price expectations and was in the right time presenting, we wouldn\u2019t have done them because at the moment we\u2019re focused on de-leveraging. And I would have to say it\u2019s ever been [indiscernible] I always hear we spent too much for business. You know that said that we\u2019re always [indiscernible] that we paid too much. I will never pay, we will never pay for our synergies to all the people, we will never do that.", "And I think the deal flow is good, there is a lot of deals out there I think we\u2019re in period whereby many companies and groups are going to have to consistently de-leverage and sell businesses and I believe we\u2019ll be in those [indiscernible] money available to continue to do the deals. That\u2019s a lot of deal flow out there and I think prices are pretty much exactly where I\u2019d expected them to be.", "With regard to how I would do the UK and looking at here at the moment, we haven\u2019t seen any dramatic move in nine weeks since the [indiscernible] and the house builders are continuing on to build and making all the right signals. They\u2019re continuing to finish out what they\u2019re going to do. I think there is little impact and visibility that we have through 2016 so in terms of that part of the market in terms of the non-res market share that\u2019s a little bit soft with the high end things here in London but [indiscernible] but nothing significant, nothing dramatic. And infrastructure I mean very firm commitments given by the government that they are going to continue with those major infrastructure programs that we\u2019ve seen in terms of high speed too. I was in England in terms of one of the things I\u2019ve asked.", "So from our point of view we have a heightened level of awareness and caution for sure. And it doesn\u2019t stop us pulling back on projects it just makes us question a little bit more earnestly and follow the trends a little bit more carefully. And I think everybody will be in the same way. This gain has yet to play out and it will probably be in the medium term rather than the short term. We should keep an eye on them.", "Arnaud Lehmann", "Thank you. Good morning. Arnaud Lehmann from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I have three questions if I may, first few a general one for you Albert. You\u2019ve done -- the portfolio was quite turning, you\u2019ve done the acquisitions now you\u2019ve almost done the de-leveraging. You\u2019ve explained clearly your view of the cycle for Europe and the U.S. What\u2019s left for you to do as a CEO in the next one, two, three years beyond just running the cycles? That\u2019s my first question. My second question is just a follow up on M&A, you expressed your interest or you said the assets were in good shape in Belgium and the U.S. from HeidelbergCement and steel, while obviously you didn\u2019t proceed with these acquisitions. Do you have any comments to make on those? And lastly, you said your strategy is more about pricing rather than volumes. However, when I look at your Americas metals business it seems like you have more volumes and competitors, but maybe such less pricing. So could you please comment on that?", "Albert Manifold", "Okay, three questions there. First of all, the [indiscernible] business is kind of about the CEO you just how this [indiscernible] I am just a guy passing through here. I represent the seventh CEO of CRH and I\u2019ll be eighth and ninth and tenth it\u2019s about the companies not about an individual. What I did say to you was CRH regardless of to be a great company and great companies produce superior performance over a sustained period of time. We have a good cycle. We\u2019re in the right side of history at this moment in time and look at the cycle. You\u2019re right we will pay the cycle well.", "But we\u2019re generating a lot of cash, as Senan has explained, and that cash will be put to use in terms of acquiring further businesses, increasing the breadth of our businesses, the depth of our businesses in creating further value for our shareholders. That\u2019s what we as a team are focused on in CRH. That\u2019s the future. With regards to those Belgium assets you refer to, yes, I think they were very fine assets. We had a good look at them. We spoke to Heidelberg about them, but at the end of the day they decided to sell them to Cementir. And I wished Cementir very well. They\u2019re a good player, they\u2019re a good operator, they run their businesses very well. And I think Heidelberg got a good price. I wish them both very well and what they did.", "With regard to the U.S., yes, our volumes are ahead. I wouldn\u2019t get too concerned about the volume increases in the first half of the year. It\u2019s very much the slow end of the year. I would look at the full year. So plus we\u2019re seeing sort of mid-teen growth in the first half of the year, overall we\u2019re looking at sort of the 4%, 5%, 6% volume growth at best for the full year, which is more in line with everybody else. I would say that the weather up in the North and the North East was very favorable in the winter season, which is where we are strongest. So we are the ones who would benefit most because of that.", "I don\u2019t think it signifies anything else other than that. And in terms of the cost dynamics that you see, again, that\u2019s over a 12-month period. You find one or two or three months where we\u2019re doing a lot of base work, the average price drops down, rather than the high value-added stone. It doesn\u2019t indicate a different change in construction, it\u2019s just the type of material you\u2019re supplying at a particular time. And particularly with lower volumes, it can give you, screw your percentages. I\u2019d watch it over the full year, rather than the six months. ", "John Fraser-Andrews", "John Fraser-Andrews, HSBC. I want to carry on, on American materials. After the very strong performance in half 1, and I note what you\u2019ve just said about the weather in the North East, but you also said earlier that your backlogs were very good that you haven\u2019t borrowed from the future in terms of what\u2019s happened in Q2 and current trading. So can you indicate where those backlogs are? Are they consistent with that 4% to 5% volume growth in that American materials? Can year say, within half1 to what extent was that very strong EBITDA increase bolstered by any stock profit on your bitumen purchasing program? And can you give a comment on where the contracting margins are trending in that materials business?", "Albert Manifold", "Okay. The first and the third questions are yes/no answers, so I can just give you, and I can go in to the bitumen prices in one second, in the middle. First of all, in the backlogs, just to confirm, the backlogs are exactly where we would expect them to be. They\u2019re pretty much in line in some of the business, and ahead of last year, and are consistent with the volume guidance we\u2019re giving for the full year. So they\u2019re in pretty good shape at this point in the season. With regards to the contracting margins, contracting margins are actually ahead, again. Again, good to see that because, again, it really attests to, I suppose, the strength that contractors feel about bidding work going forward. That\u2019s the part of our business where we\u2019ve got the longest lead times, most of our work is almost 12 months ahead. And the margins are ahead in that business at this moment in time.", "Specifically about bitumen, and what\u2019s bitumen, the benefit we got with lower bitumen in the first half of the year, again, it\u2019s over the full year. We do most of our bitumen in the second, like this quarter and next quarter. But specifically to your question, everybody has seen the price of oil for down and, indeed, the price of bitumen reduced during the first half of this year, our customers, too. Most people who follow our business very well in the United States know that our asphalt business is a significant user of that bitumen. It\u2019s actually half of our total energy costs bill. We spent about \u20ac900 million on bitumen last year, but you\u2019ve got to slide and dice that. About one-third of all our contracts for asphalt have got these clauses in them called escalators. And that means if there\u2019s a move in the price of bitumen we have to automatically pass that on or give that benefits to our customers, because it\u2019s the major cost component in asphalt. So immediately if there\u2019s a price that automatic past precaution so we don\u2019t have a benefit there. Another one-third of our asphalt work is short term bid work, so our bidding work today that reduce sometime in the next 10 or 14 days and actually again there is a natural flaw there because you\u2019re bidding on the current price of bitumen. So you\u2019re seeing that, people are seeing that coming through.", "The last one-third, you rightly say, is the piece we\u2019ve tried to hold on to. But I should say in time it\u2019s just back into the marketplace. We don\u2019t just dump all our winter-fill as people see onto particular market it\u2019s spread out over the whole year and remember it\u2019s less than half of our total bitumen needs in the full year going to a vertical, it\u2019s an advantage, but not as much as people think. So in a full year basis I would say you would look at the benefits you have of reduced energy because it\u2019s not just about bitumen, the other half comes through so another 25%, 30% comes from diesel and gasoline and electricity, these prices are well known and customers will demand them passed through to them in lower logistics costs or whatever.", "So our advantage in the full year basis is measured this year in tens of millions of dollars not hundreds of millions. It\u2019s good we\u2019re glad to have it, but it\u2019s nowhere near significance people might think and in the first half of the year you can imagine it\u2019s a lot less than that due to the fact that we don\u2019t have big volumes, the big volumes come through and had to.", "Robert Eason", "Robert Eason from Goodbody. Just a few questions. Just in relation to U.S. products I have two questions, just on the non-res market, what is your thought on that you know there are some talking about projects being delayed ahead of the presidential election, so just your general commentary around U.S. non-res markets? And second with U.S. products compared to the last couple of years the drop through in terms of organic growth just down a bit in the first half may be just go through the dynamics with us and the expectations of drop through the volumes continue to come through that business. And coming over to Europe and European materials and your consistent comments about the pricing environment in European materials and we have to wait for it. In terms of that drop through coming through like should we start stepping up the drop through into the second half or are we really talking about 2017 and 2018 before we get that kind of real strong double-digit drop through. I am sorry, just one financial question. Just kind of the note 12 you talk about acquisition costs and there are 25 million last year, there were 1 million this year and but you just simply say it does not include ongoing kind of inspiration costs, can you just give us a flavor of what those ongoing inspiration costs were in the first half and what we should be looking in for the full year and is there any carry over into 2017.", "Albert Manifold", "Before I pass the acquisition question to Senan in a moment. First, I have that conversation with Mike I kind of start booking price increases for-- so that we find that to be the most consistent external guidance in terms of [indiscernible] non-res construction as it actually follow the good six to nine month lead time. I know there is some contradictory information out there from [indiscernible] we actually kind of figure out that as talking to developers, talking to contractors, get all of this very consistent what we\u2019re seeing with ABI so that 3% to 5% growth seems to be going forward, it seems to be in commercial, lodging, office space, warehousing and that seems to be the area for us continue to grow our order books are good, our purest non-residential business is all capital bidding envelop and some of our products businesses the order books for those businesses look pretty strong for the remainder of the year. So it looks to be in good shape. So nothing -- any sign of pull back there at all.", "As I mentioned products business, you\u2019re right we saw the drop through in the first-half of the year was 11% leverage was supposed to what you would expect to see from 15% to 20%, that\u2019s a product mix issue more than anything else with the -- in our Americas products business and APG pretax which is kind of a heavy industrial infrastructure type business and also we have OBE. What we did see in the first-half of the year with a higher than anticipated spend on U.S. growth and infrastructure they performed better in the first-half year, they tend to be more lower commodity type margin of that products. So in that compressed six month period they\u2019re the ones that perhaps pulls down that drop to, it\u2019s just a mix issue over the 12 months it should even itself out over time.", "And third issue with regards to European pricing, seriously I would say from -- when I am saying to you on the stage is there at the moment I look there we\u2019d like to talk about things that are being delivered for rather than most common. I hope I wouldn\u2019t be saying I think didn\u2019t think this coming, didn\u2019t need this coming but I think it\u2019s going to take time, it\u2019s going to patchy ultimately take that from back but [indiscernible] wait before talking about before bookings into any numbers.", "Will Jones", "It\u2019s Will Jones from Redburn. Three as well, if I could at least. The first is on the UK volumes in the first-half I think it was at plus 21% number on to then for the first-half. Is that a one off or is it something around how you\u2019re running the strategy in time that please? And second was I think in the annual report there was a reference to it an ongoing dispute with [indiscernible] financials and regarding the final payment for that deal. Can you just update us on where that is at please? And then last one is more [indiscernible] one around distribution which obviously given everything with LafargeHolcim and CRL in the last couple of years just taken bit of a back seat if you like in terms of development inside the group. How do you see that business in terms of how big it needs to be, or any other measure over the medium term, both the U.S. and Europe just strategy related to that area?", "Albert Manifold", "We\u2019ll see questions two which I am going to answer, one which I won\u2019t. I have no intention of probably going to start talking ourselves and LafargeHolcim on an open microphone, so that will be out in the fullness of time. And with regards to the cement volume you referred to that is periodically and we were required and happy to do so to supply cement to the LafargeHolcim as part of disposal which is why it skewed our volumes much higher than they should be. Our real cement volumes are up 4%. So there is an internal -- it\u2019s just there is a one off we have to supply volume perfectly [indiscernible] to stay where they were doing they continue this side of it.", "And with regard to distribution, Europe distribution, I think our American distribution as well I have to say we actually and distribution is a key part of what we have going forward. I mean have done of course an option to acquire a very significant business in France coming up in the next couple of years. We have a participation in Samse which is a big business in the eastern part and southern part of France, very fine business, generates good return. France of course is a difficult place construction wise. But the residential market is strong and in particular there is a one part of France where we do see growth in residential going forward absent any kind of a difficulty to the overall French construction market hit it and south and the east.", "So distribution remains core to our business it\u2019s the key focus for us and in a couple of years time we\u2019ll be talking here hopefully about stepping up that investment, which seem quite investment of \u20ac600 million to \u20ac700 million going into that again. So it\u2019s key part of what we do, I wouldn\u2019t just misinterpret the last 12 months.", "Christen Hjorth", "Christen Hjorth from Numis. Just a couple from me. Can you give a bit more color on the additional synergies which have been identified in LafargeHolcim assets, and also, the scope for additional synergies going forward versus the target? And secondly, CapEx at 80% of depreciation, how do you see that playing out for the next couple of years?", "Albert Manifold", "Okay, I\u2019ll pass CapEx to Senan in a moment, to talk about that. With regards to the additional synergies, mainly coming through an improved process and greater cross-selling between our businesses. If you can recall, a big part of what we said about the footprint of doing the LafargeHolcim deal was we saw great synergy between our businesses, how they would fit together. And I think, perhaps, we\u2019re seeing more savings, in particular, which we\u2019re seeing between our Belgian and French businesses than we would have anticipated, and also, between our Canadian and U.S. business, which has allowed to step up the improvements in the course of this year.", "With regard to making any further statement with regard to synergies, I think what we\u2019ll do is at the end of this year, when we report our results for 2016 in spring of next year, we\u2019ll update you in terms of where we see the targets, as we achieve them. Senan, in terms of the CapEx, I think 80% is a measure over the first six months. So, obviously, you need to extrapolate that over a longer period of time. I think it\u2019s probably a fair reflection to think about our CapEx as being in line with depreciation, so at about 100%. We should certainly be in the 90% to 110% range.", "In terms of our CapEx, I think it\u2019s worth highlighting the fact that 65% of our CapEx today is going into Americas business. So you would expect that in a business where we\u2019re closer to full capacity. And then for example, in our European heavyside business, where we\u2019re not at full capacity, you would have a lower amount of CapEx. So I think the fair number to think about is about 100% depreciation. And in terms of where it\u2019s going obviously, it\u2019s going more and more, but it\u2019s going into expansion. We are obviously looking Asia as well in terms of CapEx, going forward. That will be something we\u2019ll come back to you with in the future. I\u2019m just conscious we, I need to give some time for people on the telephone lines, [indiscernible], and also the wires. So we might take one or two more questions from the floor, before we go down the lines on the wire side.", "Glynis Johnson", "Glynis Johnson from Deutsche Bank. Just one question, if I may then, please, and it really follows on the CapEx, but in more general terms. You talked about a 70% utilization in U.S. materials, but obviously you have a number of products within that. I wonder if you can give us a bit of color about the different product areas, either relative to each other or relative to that 70%, so we can see where you are more strained in terms of the capacity available.", "Albert Manifold", "Okay, as a general overall comment with regard to capacity, first of all, it\u2019s more regional differentiation than actual within the actual project, within the product itself. What I would say to you is that capacity is something, we\u2019re not measuring capacity as three shifts, seven days a week, because you can\u2019t sustainably run a business on that basis. We look at a capacity probably about 2 in a quarter, or maybe 2.5 as the absolute maximum we can get.", "Looking on that basis across all our material business lines on our materials business, OMG business, so aggregates, asphalt, ready-mixed concrete, and, indeed, our precast business in products, again, at 70%, there\u2019s plenty of headroom there regard to it, going forward. The area where we might be tight in capacity in our products business. And that would be regional, were we\u2019ve seen the strongest of growth, which would be in the Southern States, and particularly out west. And, in fact, we\u2019re building capacity there. But back East, we still have plenty of capacity.", "So maybe if we looked at a little bit of Florida, Texas, maybe as you go further west, and in to the Pacific Northwest, that\u2019s where the capacity might get a bit tighter. But again in the city, we\u2019re actually constructing factors for the future there as well. So, all told, I think we\u2019re still comfortable with the figure we\u2019re going to you of 70% of the big profit earners in the materials business across all the range of businesses, across all the geographies would have that capacity spare.", "We might take one or two more questions from the floor, before we go down the lines on the wire side.", "Aynsley Lammin", "Aynsley Lammin from Canaccord. Just one very quick one on kind of acquisition spend of the leverages that\u2019s in expected. Just give us a feel for what level of acquisition spend you would be comfortable with, what we should expect in 2017 and 2018 or the other side what kind of range of net debt to EBITDA you\u2019ll be targeting?", "Albert Manifold", "Okay. I have been very consistent to over the years and part of our investment offering is looking at net debt to EBITDA that we\u2019re very comfortable with and the normalized level, as Senan has said around will be about 2.2 times or so. And looking at that level where we are at the moment, we\u2019ve no intentions stepping on net debt back up between half which was after LafargeHolcim deal. So the key within the comfortable and historically normalized level within CRH we would anticipate 2017 if we got a debt level back to where we\u2019ve indicated which we think we will, probably somewhere in the region of 1.5 billion to 2 billion will be appropriate in terms of our own debt metrics.", "All right. So I am just going to may be move if you don\u2019t mind, to the telephone lines, in terms of any calls or indeed if any questions from the web I might take those because I know people are frantically waving me to stop this part of the call. Thank you very much indeed.", "Okay. First, and there are number of questions coming here. First question on capital allocation may be I might talk about, and Senan, you might in on this question. On capital allocation how do you prioritize capital expenditure versus dividend? Which is good question in terms of -- well, I don\u2019t think at this moment in time anybody buys CRH stock purely for dividends, we\u2019re not of dividend yield business. We\u2019re a business that grows its bottom line and provides both in the stock price. And I think everything we would do is supportive of that. We see deals out there that we can buy businesses at price that create value and provided we consistently see that going forward we will be in the acquisition game. I will be very supportive of expansion CapEx. And I\u2019ll ask Senan to help in a moment, in terms of where the pace of that actually is. If I look about our capital expenditure going backward and indeed going forward the best returning investments we have in CRH is internal CapEx. We\u2019ve been very consistent of us and the more CapEx we can put into our businesses to improve our processes, to expand our footprints the more we will do. So actually we will prioritize both of those because they bring growth. Of course we do recognize that the dividend is very, very important as well which is why we\u2019ve shown that this morning. Senan in terms of CapEx I wondered you might just talk about, historically, what it\u2019s been and as we look at it going forward.", "Senan Murphy", "Yeah I think look, we\u2019ve talked about CapEx earlier on a couple of times in the, again the ongoing guidance is that our CapEx going forward you\u2019d expect it to be in the 100% plus or minus on depreciation and more and more obviously there is an emphasis around expansion CapEx. I think you can all rest assure that there isn\u2019t any CapEx deals that come to Albert and myself that get turned down because of any obsession with using debt targets. So we\u2019re investing where required in our businesses and supporting growth to do that and I think that certainly continues to be the case. So if you go back and get my view on that question, CapEx obviously in terms of good returning CapEx is our first priority having the capacities to do acquisition than obviously is what Albert has talked about secondly. And this year obviously our focus was to get our balance sheet back and healthy so that we would be in a position to be able to do that in 2017 and beyond.", "Albert Manifold", "I\u2019ve controlled the questions, so you get the next couple. One here working capital of sales has improved again is that sustainable and do you think you can improve form here?", "Senan Murphy", "Again as I talked about working capital as a percentage of sales it\u2019s something that, it\u2019s a continuous journey, it\u2019s a focus around the business. But I would say I mean Albert gave some credit to some finance people earlier on this goes across the business. So everybody in the business focuses on working capital. It\u2019s actually part of our bonus theme, a part of our management. So everybody is focused on around the business. Albert talked to that cash been [indiscernible] and so all of our business leaders all think of that cash and run their business, has been focused on our working capital. So, all of our business continues to grow. I think we have opportunity to become more and more efficient in terms of the way we operate and it\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen promised is that continuous improvements are only around CapEx as a percentage of sales continuing to improve. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve shown you throughout 2015 and obviously we\u2019re still on that journey in \u201816 and it will continue to be a focus half to 2016 as well.", "Albert Manifold", "Well for me a good question here, it says talking about the -- give me a sense of what the strategy of CRH is going to unfold, what\u2019s your next big deal or deals coming from in the next few years ahead. We have been very consistent over the years talking about the balance spot we\u2019ve had, the CRH balance portion of the end use and marks and products and I\u2019ve been very clear about that. And I suppose if I look at some of the deals that were of interest to us during the course of this year, it was a very big distribution business in the United States, which we\u2019ve passed on because of price and timing.", "But that was a nice business, that\u2019s indicative of how we feel, the strength we feel about and it continue to invest in the United States economy, it\u2019s a great place for the business. There was a very big heavy side business from the U.S., which have been very good to our business if we [indiscernible] price that made sense to us. Again, we couldn\u2019t but again an indication of plugging back into the heavy side business in the United States, which we see as a source of sustainable growth going forward.", "The question I asked from somebody about distribution the fact that we\u2019re focusing on -- we\u2019ve a very big deal coming our way on French distribution hopefully in the next two or three years. We have faith in distribution in Europe, it makes very good returns, margins are ahead of that business for the first-half of this year. Again, looking at that so it\u2019s really filling up the strategy in areas where we have faith in our business and we\u2019ve a proven ability to deliver profit and improve those business and building out our footprint, running the model out in geographic on the vertical integration basis.", "I do think of course the challenge with our business is we wouldn\u2019t have to continue to step out. It\u2019s interesting if we go back 10 years in time and look at price of our business, it didn\u2019t exist 10 years ago. How small was Europe distribution 10 years ago? How small was our OBE business 10 years ago? How small was our APG business 10 or 15 years ago? All fundamentally important parts of our businesses now, we have great growth vehicles that are there that may not be immediately obvious to you. Our life side business in Europe didn\u2019t exists 10 years ago, it\u2019s now \u20ac1 billion, 100 million EBITDA business. It\u2019s based on innovation and growth, searching new markets and actually that is the trend that it\u2019s going to continue in our markets and we have to invest in those trends going forward.", "So I think there is a continuation of filling out our geographic spread, continuing with the vertical integration because we get very good returns but always productively looking for the associated businesses side in the construction market. But as the market is changing and we have to adopt those changes in the future as we have done over the last decade and the past. I think we\u2019re ready for that. And we\u2019re waiting and there is one more call in there [indiscernible] okay, take it.", "Operator", "We have a question from Mike Betts from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mike Betts", "I have two questions if I could please. I think you talked about your volume guidance for the year, 4% to 5%. Can I ask what you\u2019re thinking on price? And I think you touched on it a bit sort of more base material, but the 3% obviously in H1 is somewhat low than the 7%-8% your competitors are achieving. I mean do you think you\u2019ll get that high for year? Or do you think 3% is a better glide. And then secondly, in the [indiscernible] cement plant that\u2019s out in Canada, could I just revisit that and ask do you now see that as a threat or an opportunity? I mean an opportunity I guess [indiscernible] potentially in the U.S. but maybe a stretching Canada and how you planning to deal with that? Thank you.", "Albert Manifold", "Mike, and just to be clear Mike is talking about the U.S. market there, referring to the fact that our volumes were ahead and our prices were ahead by 3% when others were reporting a price increase of maybe 6%, more 6%, 7%. Again, I suppose, just be careful about looking making long-term judgments based on the first half of the year. We will guide you towards that price increase that we\u2019re indicating, so 3%, 4% for the full year rather than anything higher than that. And then we seem to be, my opinion, in that sort of early mid-cycle phase of the U.S. where we\u2019re looking at volumes up 3%, 4%, pricing, on average, about 3% in terms of our products. It\u2019s to do with mix, of course. But, generally speaking, I would say it\u2019s across the range, about that level. ", "Specifically with regard to McInnis cement, and just to fill everybody in the detail, this is new cement plant that is being constructed out in the very Eastern Seaboard of Canada, which will bring new capacity on to that part of Canada. And the question is will that impact upon our business at this year or next year or year after that, either in Canada or North America. That business is not up and running yet. And our business, as I said, in Canada has shown good growth in the first six months of the year, volumes and prices are ahead.", "With regards to what it means for the markets going forward in the future, well, I can\u2019t speculate. All I can tell you is that there are imports of cement all along the Eastern Seaboard of United States, and the price of cement in the United States is $10 a tonne higher than it is in Canada. The cement plant was built on water, with the specific capability to export. I\u2019ll let you draw your own conclusions as to where most of that cement may end up. Okay, I hope that answers your questions, Mike. Just returning back to two questions I have on the wire. One here, topical question, Senan, the FX impact in 2016, what do you think, given the weakness of sterling, that will be for CRH for the full year, please?", "Senan Murphy", "Yes. So, FX, obviously, sterling is our biggest factor. But if you look around our business, at today\u2019s exchange rates, if you were to apply them to our business and look out to the second half of the year, probably talking in or around EUR80 million of FX headwinds, the majority of that in sterling. Again, using today\u2019s exchange rates, you\u2019re probably talking about EUR50 million of that headwind caused by sterling. So as you remember, or look at sterling, average exchange rate 2015 to average exchange rate 2016, assuming today\u2019s price holds for the rest of the year, we\u2019re talking about a 12%, 13% devaluation in sterling when you apply that to our UK earnings. That\u2019s what you end up with.", "Albert Manifold", "And just a last question here, because I\u2019m just, they\u2019re winding me up here at the very end here. Just in terms of the EUR1 billion cash flow versus EUR3 billion, given what we\u2019ve done in previous years, why that reduction in cash conversion in 2016?", "Senan Murphy", "Yes, okay, I guess, looking at that conversion between EUR3 billion EBITDA and EUR1 billion this year, I think it\u2019s a very strong conversion. If you go back to 2012, 2013, 2014 there\u2019s a couple of features that certainly have changed in our business since then. The first thing is that our level of CapEx now, obviously, is much higher than it was back in those years when we were, obviously, minding our CapEx, or constraining our CapEx. The second thing to bear in mind is that our debt levels, our leverage levels are higher now. So I think in 2014, we would have been at a net debt number of about EUR2.5 billion, today, we\u2019re obviously on track to be at EUR6 billion or below at the end of this year. So, obviously, that drives the higher gross debt level, drives up our interest cost. And then, the other feature, I think, is that our effective tax rate has gradually gone up over the last number of years as the mix of earnings we make in dollars has increased.", "Albert Manifold"], "Symbol": "CRH plc (NYSE:", "Period": "Q22016", "Month": "08", "Year": "2016", "Date": "2016-08-25", "Target": 0},

For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Joe Veltri, Head of FCA-Global Investor Relations. Mr. Veltri, please go ahead, sir.", "Joseph Veltri - Head-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Tara Lee, and good day to everyone on today's call. The earnings release that we issued earlier today, together with the presentation material from this call are now available on the FCA Investor Relations website. Today's call will be hosted by the Group's Chief Executive, Sergio Marchionne; and Richard Palmer, the Group's Chief Financial Officer. After introductory remarks by Mr. Palmer and concluding remarks by Mr. Marchionne, they will be available to answer your questions.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that any forward-looking statements we might make during today's call are subject to the risks and uncertainties mentioned in the Safe Harbor statement included on page two of today's presentation. As always, the call will be governed by this language.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Joe. Good morning or good afternoon to everybody. We can now move to slide four of the deck, outlining the results for Q3. Our worldwide shipments were up 1% at 1.1 million units with the Jeep brand continuing a strong performance with shipments up 27% versus the same quarter of last year, and up 22% year-to-date at 956,000 units.", "Group net revenues were \u20ac27.5 billion, up 17% or 6% at constant exchange. Adjusted EBIT was \u20ac1.3 billion with adjusted EBIT margin for the Group at 4.7% from 4.1% last year, and in NAFTA, adjusted EBIT margin was at 6.7%.", "Adjusted net profit for the Group was \u20ac303 million. The Group recorded a quarterly net loss of \u20ac299 million after \u20ac943 million of unusual items, of which \u20ac761 million was due to recall campaign of reserve adjustments in NAFTA and \u20ac142 million was due to incremental incentives and inventory write-downs related to vehicles damaged in the Tianjin port explosion in China in the beginning of August.", "The Tianjin impact is expected to be recovered in future quarters through insurance claims. At September 30, net industrial debt was \u20ac7.8 billion versus \u20ac8 billion at the end of June and total available liquidity was \u20ac24.9 billion.", "During the quarter, the all-new Fiat Toro mid-size pickup truck was presented in Brazil and the Jeep Renegade was introduced in Japan and in South Korea. On July, the 30th, S&P raised the outlook on FCA N.V. to positive from stable. Also FCA was once again named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. On October, the 20th, the IPO of 10% of Ferrari was priced with net proceeds to FCA of \u20ac0.9 billion. We're on schedule to complete the spin-off for the remaining 80% in January 2016. On October 22, a new labor agreement was signed in the U.S.; a four-year agreement with wage increases for all eligible U.S. hourly and salary-represented employees.", "Finally, we are confirming our full year guidance. Worldwide shipments expected around 4.8 million units. Net revenues over \u20ac110 billion, adjusted EBIT equal to or in excess of \u20ac4.5 billion and adjusted net profit of around \u20ac1.2 billion. And our net industrial debt has been adjusted to \u20ac6.6 billion to \u20ac7.1 billion range from the \u20ac7.5 billion to \u20ac8 billion previously to reflect transactions completed in connection with the Ferrari IPO.", "These guidance figures do not reflect the impact of the previously announced spin-off of Ferrari planned for January 2016 and it should be noted that we expect that Ferrari will be reported as discontinued operations in FCA's 2015 year end financial statements following the approval of the spin-off transaction expected at the Shareholders Meeting scheduled for December, the 3rd.", "Moving to slide five that shows the Group's operating highlights for the quarter. Shipments were up double digit in EMEA and NAFTA offsetting declines in LatAm and APAC, resulting in the 1% increase at Group level. Net revenues were up 17% or 6% at constant exchange, driven by the higher revenues in NAFTA, EMEA, Ferrari and Components offsetting lower revenues in other sectors.", "Adjusted EBIT for the Group increased by 35% at \u20ac1.3 billion with NAFTA more than doubling and LatAm returning to profitability despite continuing poor market conditions in the region. Margins increased to 4.7% compared to 4.1% in Q3 2014, driven by NAFTA that improved to 6.7% from 4.45% in the prior year.", "Adjusted net profit for the quarter was \u20ac303 million, and as I already mentioned, the net loss of \u20ac299 million includes the after-tax impact of the unusual items of \u20ac602 million. Net industrial debt was \u20ac7.8 billion, down \u20ac0.2 billion from June 30.", "Turning to page six, we can see the year-over-year changes in adjusted EBIT for the various areas of the Group. NAFTA again was the main contributor to growth with adjusted EBIT more than doubling. EMEA improved by \u20ac79 million from prior year with Ferrari and Components also showing higher results. These improvements more than offset declines in APAC, LatAm and Maserati.", "Adjusted EBIT includes a positive FX benefit of approximately \u20ac200 million mainly due to the translation impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar year-over-year. Compared to Q2 2015, adjusted EBIT declined by \u20ac200 million with improvements in Ferrari and LatAm driven by increases in Pernambuco volumes with some 10,000 units 20,000 units. They were more than offset by declines in Asia Pacific due to market conditions and to the Tianjin port disaster mentioned previously.", "Moving to slide seven, we show the change in net industrial debt during the quarter, which was reduced by \u20ac0.2 billion compared to the end of June, mainly reflecting positive FX impacts from translation related to the devaluation of the Brazilian real. Cash flows from operating activities were \u20ac1.4 billion, driven by adjusted EBITDA for \u20ac2.7 billion and the negative impact from seasonal working capital for \u20ac1.2 billion. CapEx for the quarter was \u20ac2.2 billion.", "We'll now review the performance by region, beginning with NAFTA on page eight. Industry in the U.S. and Canada continued to strengthen and Group sales were up 7% year-over-year. In the U.S., we sold 573,000 vehicles, an increase of 7% over Q3 2014, driven by Jeep, which was up 26%, resulting in the best ever quarterly performance for the brand. Ram brand increased by 4%, while Chrysler was down 4% and Dodge down 9%, mainly due to discontinuing to the Dodge Avenger and lower Grand Caravan sales.", "Total market share was 12.4%, up 10 basis points, with fleet mix at 18% flat versus prior year. U.S. dealer inventory ended September at 76 days of supply versus 71 days last year. The main reason for the increase is due to the Renegade launch and the Fiat 500X launch.", "In Canada, vehicle sales were up 1% to 79,000 units, the Ram brand was up 10%, and Jeep was up 8%.", "In Texas, which is the largest truck and SUV market in the U.S., the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Renegade each received the top award in their segments from the Texas Auto Writers Association, while the Ram 1500 and Ram 2500 were both recognized as the Truck of Texas in their respective categories.", "Moving to slide nine, shipments in NAFTA were up 12% year-over-year to 685,000 with growth across all markets. Net revenues increased by 35% or 15% at constant exchange driven by the higher shipments.", "NAFTA adjusted EBIT more than doubled to \u20ac1.2 billion and adjusted EBIT margin came in at 6.7%. For the first nine months of 2015, NAFTA adjusted EBIT margins improved to 6.1% from 4.1% last year. And we're on track to achieve the full year target of 5.5% to 6%. The stronger improvement in adjusted EBIT was driven by volume growth due to the Jeep brand led by the recently launched Jeep Renegade.", "Our net price increase is due to positive pricing actions and dealer discount reductions, which more than offset increased industrial costs due to the increased recall accrual rates and product costs for vehicle content enhancements, partially offset by purchasing efficiencies. Other primarily reflects the positive impact of FX translation mentioned earlier.", "Compared to the previous quarter, adjusted EBIT declined by \u20ac140 million, mainly due to the higher industrial costs, partially offset by volume and mix effects.", "As mentioned previously, moving to page 10, during the quarter, we recognized an adjustment related to our recall campaign accrual in the U.S. and Canada, resulting from a change in accounting estimates. This change is due to the continued increased trend in the frequency and size of recall campaigns and the changes in the regulatory and operating environments that have been evolving in recent periods, but which crystallized for FCA during the third quarter.", "Other results of these events, we've reviewed our campaign reserve adequacy process. It's concluded that while the campaign adequacy model is sound, it needs to be updated to incorporate actuarial methodologies that give greater weight to the more recent calendar year trends in recall campaign activity. This resulted in a \u20ac761 million charge in the U.S. and Canada for the estimated future recall campaign cost per vehicle sold in prior periods. As it relates to prior period sales, the change in estimates was excluded from adjusted EBIT in NAFTA for the period.", "This review also resulted in adjustment to the accrual rates for campaign reserves recognized in the period in which vehicles are sold. The results of this increase amounted to approximately \u20ac65 million of extra cost for Q3 2015, which is included in our adjusted EBIT for NAFTA.", "Moving to slide 11, LatAm; the industry was down by 19% versus last year driven by continued macroeconomic weakness, particularly in Brazil which was down 25%, while Argentina was up 4% driven by advanced purchases due to political uncertainties. Sales for the Group were down 28% with share in the region of 14% for the quarter.", "In Brazil, market share declined by 160 basis points due to strong competitive pressure. However, FCA increased its market leadership over the nearest competitor to 500 basis points, which is 140 basis points higher than the Q2 GAAP.", "FCA also maintained its leadership in the A/B segment with a 21.2% share. The all-new Jeep Renegade continued its growth trend, reaching a 25.2% segment share in the quarter, doubling from the 13% in Q2 2015.", "Stock levels in the region were at 39 days of supply versus 36 days of supply last year. In September, the all-new Fiat Toro mid-size pickup was presented in Brazil with production to start in Pernambuco in Q4 of this year.", "Moving to slide 12; shipments in LatAm were down 31%, with Brazil down 35% and Argentina down 9%. Other results, net revenues were down 30% or 15% at constant exchange. Adjusted EBIT was \u20ac28 million positive again compared to \u20ac62 million a year ago. The decrease is primarily due to lower volumes, higher input cost inflation and Pernambuco start-up costs, partially offset by favorable net pricing and positive product mix mainly attributable to the new Jeep Renegade. Adjusted EBIT margin was 1.8% versus 2.9% last year.", "Moving to APAC on slide 13; industry demand rose by 3% with growth in all major markets, except Japan. Group sales declined 23% year-over-year, mainly driven by China, down 26% due to the significant contraction in demand for imported vehicles as competition from local producers intensified, and also due to the interruption of supply due to the Tianjin port explosion.", "Sales in Australia were down 32% with demand impacted by price increases required to offset the Australian dollar weakness. Group share in the region declined by 21 basis points compared to last year with share losses in China, Australia, India, and South Korea, with Japan slightly up. Inventories at the end of September were at 99,000 units versus 115,000 units at the end of Q3 2014, with 22,000 units of China inventories still blocked at the port as a consequence of the explosion. In September, the all-new Jeep Renegade was launched in Japan and South Korea with the units imported from the Melfi plant.", "Turning to slide 14; shipments in APAC were down 45%. Half of the reduction was due to the blockage of shipments from the Tianjin port and all brands were down year-over-year. Net revenues were down 47% on the back of the lower volumes. Adjusted EBIT for the quarter was a loss of \u20ac83 million versus the positive \u20ac160 million last year, reflecting the lower volumes; negative net pricing, particularly in China, and partially offset by lower marketing spending. Compared to Q2 2015, adjusted EBIT declined by \u20ac130 million, mainly due to lower volumes and negative impacts of FX.", "For the EMEA region, on slide 15, the European passenger car industry in the quarter was up 10% to 3.4 million vehicles, driven by growth in all major markets. For the Group, sales rose 12% to 222,000 units.", "In the EU, Group share increased by 20 basis points, driven by growth in Italy, France and Germany, while share was flat in Spain and the U.K.", "In Europe, the Fiat brand maintained its market leadership in the A and L0 segments and the new Fiat 500X confirmed its leadership in its segment in Italy with a 19.6% share. For light commercial vehicles, the industry in Europe was up 10% year-over-year with growth in all major markets, except Germany. Group sales were up 6%, with share in the EU at 10.7%. The Ducato maintained its segment leadership with 12% sales growth.", "In September, the Fiat Professional brand received its second consecutive Van Fleet Manufacturer of the Year award, while both the Fiorino and Dobl\u00f2 commercial vans received individual awards in their categories.", "Moving to slide 16; shipments in EMEA were up 15% to 250,000 units with passenger cars up 16% and LCVs up 10%. Net revenues were up 13% on the back of these higher volumes. Adjusted EBIT for the quarter was \u20ac20 million versus the loss of \u20ac59 million last year. This represents the fourth consecutive quarter of positive results for the region. This was achieved with higher volumes and better mix, thanks to the new Jeep Renegade and 500X, and improved net pricing driven by favorable FX as well as pricing actions in non-EU markets. This was partially offset by higher industrial costs resulting from the higher cost of vehicles imported from the U.S. due to the stronger U.S. dollar, higher SG&A primarily related to advertising for the new launches. Compared to the previous quarter, adjusted EBIT was down by \u20ac37 million, mainly due to the seasonal impact of lower volume.", "Moving to Ferrari on slide 17, there will be a separate call for Ferrari following this call. But the results were: the shipments were for the quarter up 21% to 1,949 vehicles. And the business created an operating margin, EBIT margin in the quarter of 19.4% versus 15.7% in the prior year.", "Turning to slide 18 on Maserati; shipments in Q3 declined by 22% with North America down 41%, Greater China down 24% and Europe up 5%. Net revenues were down 21%, primarily due to decreased volumes, down in line with weaker segment demand in the U.S. and in China. Adjusted EBIT decreased to \u20ac12 million from \u20ac90 million last year due to the lower volumes, unfavorable mix and industrial costs, also including start-up costs for the upcoming Levante SUV.", "Slide 19 covers the Components businesses. Magneti Marelli had a strong quarter with net revenues up 9%, while adjusted EBIT was up 75% to \u20ac84 million, driven by the higher volumes, by cost containment actions and efficiencies.", "Adjusted EBIT margin was 4.8% versus 3% last year. Order intake was \u20ac562 million with over 2/3 of those orders coming from non-FCA Group customers.", "For Comau, net revenues were up 43% due to body assembly, powertrain and robotics businesses. Adjusted EBIT rose by \u20ac7 million due to the increased volumes. For Teksid, net revenues were down 7% year-over-year, mainly due to a 13% decrease in the cast iron business volumes, partially offset by an 18% increase in aluminum. Adjusted EBIT was negative \u20ac2 million, down from positive \u20ac2 million in the prior year.", "Slide 20 outlines the main events that occurred after the end of Q3. The IPO of 10% of Ferrari was successfully completed and the stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, RACE. It was listed on this October, the 21st, at $52 per share, the top of the price range, with the offering being well over-subscribed.", "The spin-off of FCA's remaining Ferrari shares to FCA shareholders is proposed for approval at the Extraordinary General Meeting on December, the 3rd, and the transaction is expected to be completed in early January 2016.", "FCA's net industrial debt is expected to be reduced by a total of \u20ac1.6 billion, as a result of the net proceeds from the IPO and the impact of the transactions related to the spin-off.", "In the U.S., FCA reached a new four-year labor agreement with UAW with wage increases for all eligible U.S. hourly and salary-represented employees. The agreement eliminates the Two-Tier wage structure via a multi-year wage progression plan.", "The cost impact on Q4 2015 compared to year-to-date run rate is expected at around \u20ac30 million and for 2016 at around \u20ac390 million for the full year.", "In China, the new GAC-FCA joint venture plant in Changsha started production on October 19. The plant has annual production capacity of 275,000 vehicles and will produce the Jeep Cherokee to go on sale in China later this year.", "Now moving to slide 21, we review our expectations for the industry demand in 2015. For NAFTA, we now assume the industry to go to 21 million units from the 20.5 million we were projecting in Q2. This reflects a higher forecast of the U.S. market to 17.8 million vehicles for the year.", "The LatAm industry is now forecasted to further decline to 4.1 million vehicles versus our Q2 forecast of 4.2 million due to continued poor trading conditions. In APAC, the industry is forecasted to decline by 0.5 million units versus our Q2 estimate, to 27.8 million units due to a reduction in the Chinese industry with expectations now at 18.2 million units versus 18.7 million in Q2.", "Forecast for India, Australia and South Korea are confirmed. The forecast for EMEA has been revised up to 16 million units versus 15.7 million in Q2 with the Italian market now expected to grow by 12%.", "Finally, on slide 22, we are confirming our full year guidance as mentioned before.", "And with that, I bring my comments to a close. I'll hand over to Mr. Marchionne. Thank you.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Thanks, Richard. Just a couple of general comments about the quarter and some of the things that we are seeing since the last time we spoke. One about the quarter itself, I think we're encouraged by the results that we've obtained so far, especially in terms of EMEA and Latin American performance.", "We have been obviously highlighting the cost competitiveness of our Brazilian operations and I think that even in market conditions which are less than exciting, we have been able to post profit and I think it's the beginning of a recovery path. I'm encouraged especially about the performance of the Jeep brand in Brazil, which is now leading the segment with Jeep Renegade well ahead of our competitors and that's only happened roughly about four months after launch. So, I think we are \u2013 the traction that Jeep is achieving in the jurisdiction is impressive and I think it's an indication on the way in which the brand is being received on a global scale, especially in terms of North America margins, which have improved over Q3 of 2014.", "The real issue for us, especially in view of the reported earnings from our other two Detroit colleagues here in the last couple of days, undoubtedly they're impressive numbers coming out of both Ford and General Motors and obviously we're envious of those numbers. And so, we've been able to try and understand the structural differences between our reported earnings and theirs. And fundamentally, you can break them down into two buckets. The first one is \u2013 and we have simulated our earnings on the assumption that we match the portfolio distribution of our competitors and we get to roughly double digit margins by just simulating a similar portfolio to theirs using our own products and not theirs, because obviously we have no privative of information to \u2013 we have no access to their margin. But we get to roughly double digits and I think the spread between that and what they've reported in Q3 is really a volume issue and which doesn't necessarily make me feel better but at least it's understandable.", "And so, there are a number of things that we're doing. I think I'm encouraged by the volume growth that we've had over the last five years. And I think, as long as we continue on that trend, we will close the gap at least on one part of the differential in relatively short order. What concerns me more obviously is the fact that the portfolio skewed in a way which does not reflect our competitors and as a result of that, I think we're going to be spending some significant amount of time here over the next quarter to try and understand how we can improve the offering into the market, especially in view of what I consider to be a generally believed fact that gasoline prices will continue to stay at the low end of the spectrum at least in the foreseeable future. And I think, they were underrepresented in some significant areas in the large SUV market, which given the work that we're doing now on the renewal of the Ram brand may offer interesting opportunities going forward. I'll leave it at this, I think we will give you a better update as we complete the quarter and we enter 2016.", "I think you will be incredibly foolish for anybody who sits in my shoes to ignore the magnitude of the events that has characterized the third quarter from an operational standpoint and I'd like to go through some of them if we can and just, so that we get our bearings fixed on what I consider to be significant shifts in the position of the industry. The first one has to do with what we've seen in China in the last quarter, and not only our results are disappointing and we've recognized a couple of things. One, obviously that the impact of the fire in Tianjin has been devastating not just because of the loss that we booked on the destroyed material that was at the port, but also the fact that we were impacted by having the number of vehicles locked in pending resolution and therefore we were absent from the market.", "But I think, when you also look at the performance of Maserati, you combine it with the Jeep story, you recognize two things that I think, that the import function into China is going through a fundamental change. And this has got a bunch of ramification in terms of our expectations going forward. One, I think it reinforces the wisdom of the decision to localize Jeep, in fact that we're going to be in the market with a locally produced Cherokee within this year, then we'll start production on the Renegade in the first half of 2016. It is an indication of what I consider to be a very wise move, not to get trapped by this stiffening of the import function into China.", "And I \u2013 and so, while it has \u2013 it certainly has no impact on our ambition for Jeep on a global scale because of the localization push that we've undertaken. And as a matter of fact, I think the 1.9 million number, that we set as a target for 2018 is probably understated based on what I know today. But, I think that it has to have implications for the development of Maserati and for the development of Alfa. And I think, pending resolution of that issue and getting a better clarity on the market dynamics in China; one of the things that we will be doing is looking at the pacing of our Alfa Romeo development on a global scale, a big chunk, \u2013 I don't know whether it's a big chunk, but a relatively significant portion of our volume ambitions for 2018 for Alfa were China driven.", "I'm still of the view that the total potential of the brand in terms of an expressed volume unit target of 400,000 by 2018 is achievable. I think we need to be very careful to not to create excessive expectations about what China can contribute to their objective.", "And I think it requires us to rethink certainly the sequencing of the product or the product launches. And it's my gut and right now it's purely if you ask that if my gut is right, I think that we will see a positive impact on the amount of capital that's being absorbed by Alfa between now and 2018. I think that the plan in terms of its product content is unchanged, but the sequencing will change. And I think \u2013 and the number itself of 400,000, I think will probably hold, but the origin of that volume I think we'll have to change in view of what we know about China.", "The other thing, which I think Richard has been incredibly articulate on, is this question about the recall provision. We have debated just on the lengths inside our shop, I think it would be negligent on our part, not to recognize the fact that there have been structural changes in which the regulatory environment and OEMs are now interfacing.", "There is a hike in the level of scrutiny both from the outside and internally as a result of an external pressure, which has caused and will cause going forward a different approach that the way in which recalls have been executed. And I think the prudent thing to do is not to ignore that fact but to build in into our economics recognition of change and effectively use that as a means of changing our pricing approach to ensure that we'll recover that part of the equation, which has so far appeared to be anomalous as a one-off, I think it's going to become much more structural at least in the foreseeable future and I think it was only prudent that we take the provision itself.", "A couple of comments about this Dieselgate story and then, I think we'll open it up for questions.", "I obviously, as a number of you have done in the last sort of while, have gone through an incredible barrage of articles and speculations about this Dieselgate story, the implications, the origins and the problem. And I think we can also adhere and speculate I think unnecessarily about this issue, right? There's not a doubt that the problem does exit. I think we cannot confuse the events in terms of their importance. The origin of this problem was a governance failure. It was not the failure of technology. I think that there was nothing that I have read or that I know that would suggest that diesel as a means of providing combustion for our units is either in danger or should be eliminated because of the potential malfeasance of an agent in the market.", "I do not think, and I have not taken the view that diesel is dead, I don't think it is, and as a one additional factor on the question of Volkswagen, I have the utmost respect for the organization, I've had it since I've been involved in this industry for a long period of time, and I think it will be improper and I certainly on my part, it would be improper to make any type of disparaging remarks about their performance.", "Failures like this is unfortunate as they could happen to anybody. I think besides this, it is unfortunate because it is relatively large, but I continue to believe that VW will come out of this stronger after its adjustment process, and then ultimately it will come back to be a viable competitor in the marketplace, and I'm not dismissing them at all going forward.", "I think that the important thing to realize is that most organizations that are faced with issues of this caliber will end up carrying out initially some commercial practices that all of us in the marketplace may find a bit unnerving. And so we have already seen at least on the European side a level of generosity in pricing which has been caused by this event. I think hopefully it will correct over time so that we can restore some level of profit expectation in the marketplace, in a market which has already been plagued of what I consider to be unnecessary pricing pressure.", "So I think we need to be careful of looking at this forward. I'm not changing my view about our profitability targets in EMEA. I think we may be living it through some skittish times over the next one quarter or two quarters until we get stability in the marketplace. Overall, the business is in good shape. We continue to perform well across a variety of fronts. I think, we need to seek clarity certainly on the APAC issue, especially in view of the weakness of some of the currencies in the jurisdiction and some of the changes in the environment, especially in China. But, overall, I think we're maintaining and confirming targets for 2015 and certainly, I have no indication today that 2018 targets are not achievable.", "Joseph Veltri - Head-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Mr. Marchionne. Before we begin Q&A, I just want to note that, as Richard mentioned in his comments, last week, Ferrari began trading as a public company following their IPO and as a result, the management of Ferrari will conduct their initial analyst call later today to review their Q3 results. In order not to preempt their call, we would prefer not to comment on Ferrari's quarterly performance beyond the prepared remarks already made. Therefore, we would appreciate your cooperation by holding any questions on those topics for the Ferrari call later today.", "With that, I'd like to turn it over to Tara to begin the Q&A session please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. We will now take our first question from John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good afternoon, guys. Just a first question; I mean, you highlighted the fact that you think that the major differential from your operating margins versus GM and Ford's is a function of mix. I'm just curious, how you think you'll get there as far as pushing the product and imagine that Durango will be a big part of it. But also, as we look at that mix getting larger and maybe less fuel efficient, how much investment do we need to make not just in the product development itself, but also in powertrain development to meet CAFE standards in North America?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I'm going to give you a dumb answer for the question, because the detailed articulation of an answer is going to take an hour. One, there is nothing that we currently have \u2013 there is not a thing in terms of matching product portfolio that currently does not exist within the environment that we're managing. The amount of work that's gone on in the last, probably 24 months in preparation of the renewal certainly of the pickup truck and the SUV world would allow us to enter that market. And relatively inexpensive and relatively acceptable cost in the area which I think has been left to the near exclusive use of some others.", "And I think it is important that we recognize that, given the strength of the brands and given what we've been able to do over the last five years that we have a reasonable chance of getting at least part of that market. And without causing sort of additional strain either on our capital expenditure profile, or on our commitments to powertrain. The powertrain solutions are already baked into our development. They equally impact, not only the vehicles that we're thinking of getting involved in but they impact vehicles that would have been developed to replace current ones.", "So, I do not see any sort of seismic shift in terms of our capital profile. I do see an unexplored potential at our end to try and access those markets. And I think, we need to do it in all conscience. We're going to be spending the next 60 days taking a very hard look in view of the fact that we're going to have to launch some investments now in North America to replace some vehicles in the 2017 to 2019 timeframe.", "And so adding on this product development to an existing program is not going to twist us into a pretzel. I think we'll able to do it and I'm not at all concerned about the powertrain impositions, because they actually given the size of the vehicles are quite beneficial given the technology that we have available. They're actually beneficial to the (37:58).", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got you. And then second question just on the UAW contract; obviously there is some puts and takes here, there is certainly some different interpretations. Just curious, as you look at this, does the contract that you agreed to at this point change anything as far as your view as profitability going forward or is it really just, from a continuation of what you have with some opportunity to work on things in the next couple of contracts?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Two broad comments, one, obviously to the extent that we're increasing labor costs, it has an implication and it does have implications on our profitability. And so there is obviously a very clear sharing of the objective with UAW to do a full and complete rollout of our WCM or World Class Manufacturing initiatives across the whole plant network and I would expect that we will get some of those increased costs back in terms of efficiency, just out of running our industrial footprint better.", "I think that it would be foolish to assume that whatever we've passed on is going to end up \u2013 whatever we've absorbed as additional cost is going to end up as a margin erosion. I think that we will have to find ways to offset the increase in cost. I as you well know from public statements that I made, I shared with William the view that somehow we need to increase the distribution to our workers. And the question was the timeframe within which we were going to do this. I think we have now agreed a timeframe that's going to govern the sales (39:46) well into 2023, because of the progression with Tier Twos. And so, it's livable. I will not, on the basis of this agreement, change any of the product plans that we have put together nor would I change our view as to what gets allocated. It is undoubtedly clear that to the extent that you have got higher margin products that are potentially available for production in the U.S. that those are the ones which should be favored in terms of localizing because of the fact that they have the best chance of margin (40:24).", "It's a complicated question, given the extent to which we've already invested in other places. But as a general comment, to the extent that this ends up being a structural change it only makes the sole issue about sort of capital returns even more of a difficult issue to try and solve, because we end up \u2013 at least, where I sit I end up looking at an equation where we appear to be inadequately compensating our workers, and we certainly have inadequate compensation on the capital provider side.", "So, as managers of this distribution of wealth between capital and labor, which is the classic economic quandary, I mean, we've agreed now to a set of escalating cost, some people are bandying around the cost of \u20ac2 billion over the period between now and 2019. The number is actually less than that, but it's broadly in line with the cumulative cost increase that we're expecting over the period of time. That number needs to come out, either out of the market in terms of pricing or it needs to come out of the capital structure and the cost of running this thing.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then just...", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "And I don't have an immediate answer to this. Yes, go ahead.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Yes, then just a last one, so I don't take up too much time. As you look at the globalization of the Jeep brand, I mean obviously it appears to be going a little bit faster and maybe better than we had anticipated, and you cited potentially getting more than 1.9 million units, which is your target in 2018. I mean, what do you think the upside is and in what markets do you think you're really going to get that in?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "No, look, I made the comment, because I think that the rate at which \u2013 look, we sold more Jeeps in Europe in the first nine months than we sold in the whole 12 months of 2014. As of today, we've sold more Jeeps worldwide than we've sold in the whole of 2014 on a global scale. So, this brand is not getting a phenomenal amount of traction, we need to make sure that we're supporting it as it expands. We'll give you an update at the end of January as to what we think a possible revised target is going forward, and we're not going to speculate on that number today.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Martino De Ambroggi of Equita. Please go ahead.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Thank you. Good morning, good evening, everybody. First question is on NAFTA region. You gave a target of a round rate in Q4 of 7%, I understand maybe ForEx is helping a little bit, but do you confirm 7% or maybe you should revise it upwards for Q4?", "And my question is, obviously you don't want to talk about next year, but should we take the 7% as a floor for next year, roughly?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Yes, I'm not \u2013 look, the 7% is doable. I don't know of a reason why we will go back in 2016.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay. I suppose it could have been revised upwards, that 7% at least in Q4, since you already achieved it...", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "If it is, it's going to happen in January next year. We're not going to upgrade anything today.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay. And the second question is on financial costs. If I remember correctly, you had a target of a \u20ac1 billion reduction for different reasons, nonrecurring cost and so on. This year will be higher than last year. So, could you update your view, following also the Ferrari deal? What are the targets in terms of financial costs and in which timeframe?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Martino, that number obviously was through the 2018 timeframe originally. I think we're going to make some significant reductions in our financial charges next year, given obviously that we are getting the proceeds from the Ferrari transaction. We are also going to actively look to remove the debt in the FCA US company and remove the ring fencing.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Sorry, Richard, we are going to remove the ring fence next year, not actively, it's done, it's just they have to wait.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer", "So, that's going to give us the opportunity obviously to utilize our cash more freely on a global basis and reduce the amount of cost of carry that we have in our financial charges. So, clearly, we're going to give you some guidance for 2016 as was mentioned in January. But I would expect our financial charges to be a very positive contributor to the year-over-year improvement from 2015 to 2016 based on those actions we'll be taking.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay. If I may, just one more question on the Chinese port explosion; you quantified \u20ac142 million provision, but did you quantify also a rough indication of what was the impact on the profitability for the missed volumes for the APAC region, and I was wondering if also Maserati was affected?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer", "So, in terms of the port, Maserati wasn't affected. And in terms of the volumes, about half of our volume miss for the quarter in terms of shipments was related to the port. So, I think we could quantify a number...", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Richard is looking for the answer.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Yes, no problem.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, about \u20ac80 million to \u20ac100 million of the impact of year-over-year change was due to that volume reduction due to shipments not being made out of the port.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Brian Johnson of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes, good afternoon. I have a couple of questions. First, again to kind of go on the differences with the other big Detroit based part of the businesses. We did see in a couple of the others and Ford was fairly open about it, a significant commodity tailwind in their margin, you don't flag that in your comments. Of course, it's great to think that production cost, efficiencies and supplier relations drive it, but are you seeing a commodity cost impact? If not, why not, and when could it come through given at least on the U.S. dollar basis, where all the commodities have gone?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Brian, we're not seeing a significant impact yet, because of the lengths of the contracts we have in place. And we expect to start to see more of an impact going into Q1 of next year.", "Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. So it really relates to the timing of the supply contracts. Second question kind of ties into the longer-term effects of Volkswagen, whether you agree with the regulatory approach or not, it seems like they are making the internal combustion engine, whether diesel or gas increasingly more expensive.", "I certainly understand your view that, on a footprint adjusted basis, you could be in good shape for 2017 to 2020, but if we kind of think about the hockey stick currently for 2020 to 2025 in Europe CO2, and U.S. CAFE. How do you think being a skeptic seems on electric, what you're going to need to do with hybrids, what you're going to need with EVs to have a competitive cost effective lineup in say 2023?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I actually think, Brian, that most of the fleet will go to hybrid by that period of time.", "Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And in terms of the \u2013 what two efforts you have underway in the capital investment to get your fleet there?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "The issue about the capital is in our plans and it's already in the 2018 \u2013 it's in the 2018 target numbers, the real issue to me is not capital, it's a question of being paid for all those technology that's going in. And we -everybody has had these wonderful ideas about the fact that battery cost per kilowatt hours would drastically drop. We've seen indication with people expect these costs to be less than \u20ac250 a kilowatt hour, it's just, one, we haven't seen it yet. I think it may be overly optimistic in terms of why I think technology will ultimately deliver price.", "I think a lot of this has to be seen. I mean it's just \u2013 the costs are significant. And I think we are experienced since now we're going to be launching our first plug-in hybrid in the first half of 2016, I think for the new minivan. I think we'll be able to experience the pain of that technology and the cost of that technology going into the vehicle by going into the market. It's an unresolved issue to me, but having said that, regulations will dictate its introduction, so we have zero options.", "Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And that gets to the point you made in the spring around redundant CapEx. Final question, since your share of pickups as a percent of NAFTA sales is, as you mentioned, lower than of the competitors; so, you're implying that you would increase capacity or increase your share in pickup. So, are there other very profitable niches that you could be gaining presence in?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I think it's both because I think we have a unique opportunity now with the renewal of the pickup line with a new architecture that's coming in with the powertrain that we selected, pretty significantly increase output, and I think that's something that we have studied. I can confirm to you that numbers will go up, the availability of pickups will increase. And then we will also be exploring as a result of that investment, ways to enter into other segments, I think it's important. There are a very few markets in the U.S. that can be characterized as oligopolies, and that's one of them. And I think that we need to go out there and just like to get a fair share of that market, nothing else.", "Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And just to close that, can you do that without upsetting the delicate pricing balance?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Yes.", "Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Well, by the way you can see this from our market share gains in Ram over the last five years.", "Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Thomas Besson of Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux", "Thank you very much and I have a few simple questions, please. Could you first confirm that the Q3 2015 NAFTA adjusted EBIT margin is fully comparable with what you showed in Q3 2014, given the changes you've made on the calculation of future recall costs. I think it's not completely clear for the market.", "Second question, can you please make a comment about the prospects for the APAC margins in, at least in Q4, if not in 2016? Have you found another way into China, than the Tianjin port, or should we think that the profit margin from APAC is going to stay negative in Q4, what's the timeline to get back into profit?", "And last question, you suggest in NAFTA, some positive pricing action to compensate for the higher industry recall cost. We've just had this afternoon Ford coming out with Friends and Family Incentive Program for November and December. Do you think that with the industry margins for the Detroit 3 OEMs at the highest level it's ever been, that you can still raise prices here? Thank you.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Well, and the one, the ability to raise prices in market is a market-determined exercise that the market will not bear, we will not pass it on. I can tell you from our experience over the last six years that whenever we have for cost reasons, tackle this issue we've been successful in obtaining them. And I think a lot of the gains 2014 to 2015 are also due to the fact that pricing has improved and then effectively we have in some fashion share that pain with the dealer network.", "I think that this issue is inevitable, whether it happens now, or it happens later, whether somebody else joins the bandwagon or not, it is almost an irrelevant issue, it needs to happen, because I think these costs are structural. And they will impact on our margin performance going forward.", "On the China issue, obviously, we're working pretty diligently to try and get to a breakeven or a positive number in Q4. I think time will tell. I do not have a view today. But I think certainly the loss that we booked in Q3 should be substantially reduced in Q4. I have expectations that it will be positive in next year notwithstanding the changes in market conditions. I think the biggest upside for us is going to be in terms of the earnings from the joint venture that we have with the production of the Cherokee and the Renegade in 2016 with the industrialization of the Cherokee starting as early as Q4 of this year.", "On the first question, that you asked about whether our numbers are comparable Q3 2015 to Q3 of 2014, the impact of the adjustment is roughly \u20ac65 million in the quarter. So, I mean technically they are not comparable because there is an additional charge of \u20ac65 million in the quarter for that, for that revised view on recalls, but otherwise the numbers are absolutely calculated on the same basis.", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux", "Great. And I have one small question that I forgot, if I may. Could you please specify the exact timing of the \u2013 for 80% distribution, should we expect it to be at the very beginning of January next year, and is it going to occur in just one shot or in several instances?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "We're not going to use multiple shots to do this. It will be a one-time event. But the actual date has to be voted on by the shareholders, on December, the 3rd. It's my expectation, that we'll do this on the first business day of 2016, which based on my calendar is January 4 of next year.", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux", "Great. Thank you. Very clear.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Mark Clothier of Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.", "Mark Clothier - Bloomberg LP", "Hey, guys, thanks for taking some questions. At the UAW press conference last month, you said that once the UAW wrapped and Ferrari was listed, that consolidation would be next on your list. So what's next as you work on that? And secondly, has VW's crisis changed your preferences in anyway?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "The consolidation story was not a flavor of the season. I mean, it's something that's structural to this industry, and it didn't go away. I think the Volkswagen story and the cost associated with what I consider to be a very stiffening environment of regulations and of compliance only makes that thesis more valid today than it even was back in April 9. I haven't given up on the notion, I think, what I will not do, and I can't. If I thoroughly start speculating about what our next moves are, because this is something that needs to be discussed and understood, not just with me, but also with our board, and this issue has been debated and it's been canvassed at length, but then we have had some industry contacts as we would expect it to have with other people, who share those view, I think incredibly premature for us to express a definitive view, and my preferences have fundamentally not changed, but it doesn't mean anything.", "I mean, at the end of the day, this is something which in the scheme of things is inevitable. And so whether it happens now, it happens next quarter or three quarters from now, the direction is right and I think that the economic justification for the move is right. And I also think that we need to get ourselves out of this problem of alleged wealth distribution between labor and capital, and I think we're doing both of them an incredible amount of the service and I think we need to resolve this issue. But I have nothing to admit.", "Mark Clothier - Bloomberg LP", "When you say industry, discussions with industry contacts, who share this view, do you mean other automakers?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Those are the only kind of guys that would have a relevant role to flag.", "Mark Clothier - Bloomberg LP", "So that's a positive development, right? I mean you had not gotten feedback like that before?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I'm not sure that's true. I think that this noise in the background has been existent for quite a while. There are a number of people \u2013 we're not lunatics here, and there are a number of people who run the business who understand the implications, but you just have to look at their numbers. And so that reality is shared, not just by me, but by some others. And so, whether they are the ideal people with whom to strike something or not is a separate question.", "I think that there is, at least in some parts of the industry, there is a shared belief that this fix needs to happen and there needs to be paradigm shift in a way in which we approach this business. And by the way, I think we shouldn't be speculating about who we're talking to, who we're not talking to, but I think we're going to waste and you're going to write lots of stuff on this and people will be called in, so you could talk to Sergio. In the end, it doesn't solve anything. My advice is to let the industry come to its senses and work its way through the issues. It will happen, give it time.", "Mark Clothier - Bloomberg LP", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Alberto Villa of Intermonte SIM. Please go ahead.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte SIM SpA", "Yes. Good afternoon. First question is on the LatAm resilience in terms of operating profit. I was wondering if you can give us an idea of I mean what is your view, because we're seeing volumes going down strongly again in the fourth quarter as far as we have data and you have been able to turn positive. Just wanted to know...", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "You should be delighted. You should be absolutely delighted.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte SIM SpA", "I'm, but just to understand whether there were I mean like temporary layoff components or things that are not structural that...", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "No, no. I mean, just a moment; I think whatever we're doing, everybody else is doing.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte SIM SpA", "But, for example, you don't cut price as much as your competitors, so you took a view of losing some volumes to preserve profitability.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "But I'm not sure that's quite relevant today. I mean, to be perfectly honest that you're now asking what we do in terms of tactics of maintaining profitability in Latin America and to be perfectly honest, I think that's a comparative issue vis-\u00e0-vis FCA. Look, I had been...", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte SIM SpA", "No, just wondering if you...", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Sorry. I've been repeating ad nauseam and I will repeat it again just to avoid confusion. We do have the lowest cost structure of any other car producer \u2013 compared to any other car producer in Latin America. It's that simple. Somebody else (61:17) I can break even, if they break even I make money.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte SIM SpA", "Okay. Thanks. And the second question is on Maserati performance in the U.S., which was not so delightful, in the third quarter. I was wondering if there are specific reasons behind the drop in volumes?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "No, I think, we need to \u2013 and look, this is reflective of what I think the brand should be doing. I think, we need to pace ourselves in these markets, the total volume ambitions for Maserati until 2018 of 75,000 cars, that's the number that I outlined for 2018, it's a number that should not be violated and we should not be rushing to try and get there. And what happened in the last 12 months is that I think we've accelerated the pace beyond what I consider to be the natural absorption rate in the markets.", "We need to slow it down, we need to take a deep breath and just work our way through the issues and effectively get ready for the Levante launch and manage that in a very tight way, as a premium brand out to managed distribution. And to be perfectly honest, I don't think that was done, we're in correction mode now, and I think we need to work our way through that issue, hopefully by 2016, the issue will be back on, especially with the Levante being in the market.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte SIM SpA", "Okay. Thanks. And the last one is on the recalls, the cost of \u20ac73 million that you booked as let's say pertaining to the quarter. I was, I mean, trying to understand because this issue of recalls is becoming more and more current, what in the future might be the cost for recalls that could be reasonably forecastable for us?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I think that the provision that we have made, and I want to preempt Richard from answering, if he has anything else to add to this. The provision that we have booked reflects our understanding and our expectations as to what our exposure will be on the recall side, based on what we know today. It's our best estimate of the impact of this new regulatory environment and the response rate that FCA has experienced with these issues. Just read it as that, I have no better information. If I had better information that suggested a cost higher than this, I would have booked it.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte SIM SpA", "Okay. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Larry Vellequette of Automotive News. Please go ahead.", "Larry P. Vellequette - Automotive News", "Thank you for taking my question. I had two I'd like to discuss. One, in the UAW contract, you outlined a series of product allocations in that schedule. And I was wondering, if in doing this, you identified whether or not any more manufacturing capacity in North America was necessary going forward?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Well, in terms of sites, not; in terms of capacity, yes.", "Larry P. Vellequette - Automotive News", "So, you're just going to be making that up through increased efficiency?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Or increased headcounts, one of the two.", "Larry P. Vellequette - Automotive News", "Okay.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Or a combination of both.", "Larry P. Vellequette - Automotive News", "Okay. And the other question I had, regarding your earlier comments about your rethink of Ram, and moving into segments. I'm going to go out on a limb here and make an assumption that you're talking about a large SUV, a truck-based SUV. And I'm wondering, if that's the case, how might that square with a Grand Wagoneer that you've said might be delayed until 2019?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Not the same animal, as you well know, these are two different.", "Larry P. Vellequette - Automotive News", "Okay.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I don't think anybody who buys a large SUV today would ever be confused about trading it for a Range Rover.", "Larry P. Vellequette - Automotive News", "All right. But do you think there is room in a large truck-based body-on-frame SUV for Ram to make some headway?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "There's 300,000 people a year that believe that story.", "Larry P. Vellequette - Automotive News", "But they're going elsewhere. All right, thank you very much.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "For now, yes, thanks.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Good afternoon, everybody. A couple of questions; one is, there have already been a few questions on this change in direction in NAFTA. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of what you're contemplating in terms of your expansion in trucks? Is there are a commensurate reduction also in expansion for other areas of the company, which would be facing maybe structural or competitive challenges? And when you assess the market's ability to absorb this without it affecting price, is it your thinking that demand for these segments is going to grow in the future?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Yes. Look, I think it's absolutely premature to try and discuss what compensation maneuvers we will carry out. A couple of basic points, which I think are going to be shared by everybody whether they tell you this or not is that, there is not a single doubt the margin generation of the larger vehicles is significantly higher than it is in what I consider the commodity and the passenger cars. And it's something that we've struggled with now for the last three years or four years, especially after the introduction of the Dart and the Dodge and the Chrysler 200, it is an issue that needs to be addressed, it needs to be addressed because industrialization and variable costs for these things are just not paying the piper. And so we need to find a better way to manage this, and that's a separate and completely separate discussion from our willingness to enter what I consider to be a more profitable market segment. And the answer to your question, just to give you a benign answer, I think that there's additional volume potential for these vehicles and that we will be riding the growth curve of that segment. I don't think anybody is threatening others with taking current volumes away from a competitor. I think the market itself will bear enough of an opportunity for us to be present.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Can you address the deficiencies in some of these challenging segments by stopping investment and exiting there, or do you always believe that the company needs to be in those segments?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I think the company needs to find an intelligent way of being present. And because of our global footprint, and the fact that a lot of these cars are really our mainstay products in other jurisdictions, we need to learn how to make them in an intelligent way. And to be perfectly honest, I fail to see why people like the Asians can effectively compete here and we can't. We need to understand that much better. And I think that we're in the discovery mode now, I think we have a lot of work to do at our end. I am comfortable that we'll find a solution that will put that issue to bed.", "Certainly, when you look at prioritizing investments, if any rational human being, given current market conditions, would favor larger vehicles, given our margin generation in the smaller stuff. And by the way I'm not offended by this from an environmental standpoint because technology will compensate for the size. I think that these vehicles will require additional technology on the powertrain side to compensate for the emission status, and I think that the market will bear it and I think those are ideal vehicles within which to try it.", "We'll see what happens when the introduction of the plug-in hybrid, with the minivan. But I think there are other things obviously that are going to be rolled out from our product portfolio including belt starter generators, things of that caliber, which will keep on reducing the impact on the environment from a larger vehicle. So, we need to continue to work, and I think we'll give you an update on that on our portfolio strategy at the end of January.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And just lastly, I was hoping you can comment on the Latin America trajectory from here. Maybe just tell us what the run rate of Pernambuco is right now. Obviously, it ramps up through the middle of next year.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I'm just giving you numbers off the top of my head. I think it's probably running between 65,000 and 75,000 cars a year on an annualized basis. It will probably by the time, we finish ramping it up, it will be over 100,000 and will be crossing over 100,000 by the second quarter of 2016.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll now take our next question from Richard Hilgert of Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research", "Thanks for taking my questions. Couple, just to get a little better understanding; I know it's been asked a couple of times. Most of my questions regarding NAFTA and other regions have already been asked. But LatAm, with the improvement in the third quarter how much of that could be attributable to the Renegade launch, and then are we \u2013 or should we expect to see further improvement in the fourth quarter or is this pretty much where we're going to be at going into the beginning of 2016?", "My second question is on the performance of the Ghibli in Maserati, given your earlier comments about how Maserati has \u2013 you wanted to dial back the volume and have a steadier growth rate going through your 2018 target. Was that Ghibli \u2013 was that the model that you dial back or is there a demand issue going on with the Ghibli that volume wasn't or isn't as good as what you might have thought it would have been, and given the decline in volume at Maserati, I was surprised to see the EBIT drop as much as it did. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit there, maybe there is some cost going in because of the SUV ramp-up that might have affected that?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Just to deal with the Maserati issue, the quarter has been impacted by ramp-up costs of the Levante, which will go into production at the end of this year, beginning of next year. I think we need to be \u2013 we're not going to decompose it, but just to give you a broad answer on the Ghibli, the Ghibli is absolutely fine. I think that there is a natural absorption rate of a vehicle in a market and I think that the minute that you try and exceed those, if you misread the absorption rate which I think has happened here on Maserati, you end up having to dial it back.", "Our own ambitions for the brand had never been built on volumes, which were \u2013 the run rate that we had certainly in some parts of 2015 and the early parts and at the end of 2014. We've probably broken the speed of sound and I think we need to dial it back and in fact we allow this brand to build a piece of the time to get to 75,000 vehicles a year, which is the target for 2018.", "In terms of the Latin American numbers, the best way to assume the profitability is to assume that we're making zero profits out of the horizontal plan that we are making 1.8% margins result attributable to the other side. That's probably the easiest way...", "Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research", "Okay.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "...for you to understand.", "Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research", "Okay. And one last follow-up on just a housekeeping item; if I take a look at the EBITDA in your slide deck, you've got \u20ac2.665 billion. If I back into an adjusted EBITDA number using what you've got in the press release for adjusted EBIT and the difference their between that and your EBITDA number in the press release, I come up with an adjusted EBITDA number of \u20ac2.726 billion. Is the difference there financial services?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, it is.", "Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research", "Okay.

Moving on to Alfa Romeo, I took your comments that you're keeping the 400,000 unit target for 2018. But you've \u2013 having adjusted your some of the definition in particular relation to China. Could you give some indication on where you think that you'll be redirecting these units?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Where else, but China. I mean that I'm going to have to give you a dumb answer because I gave you a broad indication of what I think market conditions in China are going to dictate us. Based on what I see today in terms of market performance, I still think that Alfa belongs in China, the expectations of volumes out of the total pool of 400,000 cars by that date were, I think given current market condition is not achievable. So, we need to find it somewhere else. And I think Europe and NAFTA are probably the best areas to deliver it.", "But that's going to require rejigging on the launch of the cars because there are cars that are more ideally suited for these markets than they would have been for China. And so, we need to work over the next 30 days, 60 days to try and refine them and give you a better answer by January of next year. But look, two things, one, the product plan is confirmed, the sequencing is going to be adjusted in mainly of the capital phase overall by 2018, although over the term until 2019 or 2020 we'll spend the same amount of money as we had originally forecasted and the numbers are not shrinking.", "Stephen M.

I just want to make a - sort of an opening remark before I pass it on to Richard who as usual will be doing most of the heavy lifting during this call. We have made a decision here to conform our guidance to what other industry participants has chosen as an appropriate set of parameter and in contrary to what we\u2019ve done in the past what we have provided a phenomenal amount of granularity in the forecast. ", "We have decided to live in ourselves to what we consider to be sort of directional shift in the movements of the key metrics that govern this business. And I think it\u2019s been done in order to provide sort of a very simple set of reference points within which we can manage the business and they can act as a point of reference and measurement in terms of the achievements that we intend to deliver certainly within 2016 and ultimately the completion of the 2018 plan.

Before starting, I would like to remind you that the Group\u2019s results presented today include those of Ferrari unless otherwise stated this is from a comparability with prior periods, the prior quarters of the year and our previously provided guidance. Under IFRS accounting standards for the 2015 financial statements Ferrari will be accounted for as a discontinued operation for 2015 and for prior periods.

Ferrari will be having a \u2013 is planning to have an announcement of its results from February the 2", "Looking at the Group\u2019s results for 2015, we closed S well in excess of guidance. Worldwide shipments totaled 4.6 million units with the Jeep brand continuing its strong performance posting an all time record shipments number of 1.3 million units, up 21% year-over-year. As a result, Group revenues were up to \u20ac113 billion. Our adjusted EBIT was \u20ac5.3 billion with 4.7% margins, up from 3.9% last year and with all segments profitable in Q4. ", "Adjusted EBIT margin in NAFTA was 6.4% for the full year and reached 7.1% in Q4 in excess of our previously given guidance. Adjusted net profit was just over \u20ac2 billion for the year. In Q4, we recognized a one-off charge of \u20ac830 million due to the realignment of our US production portfolio which we will discuss later in the NAFTA section. ", "After giving effect to the January 2016 Ferrari spin-off, our net industrial debt stood at \u20ac5 billion and total available liquidity stood at \u20ac24.6 billion.

The start of the local production of Jeep Cherokee in China of the new Fiat Tipo Sedan in EMEA and the new Fiat Toro mid-size pickup truck in Latin America.", "In December, we prepaid the FCA US 2021 senior secured notes using cash on hand and this is another important step towards our plan to remove the ring-fencing provisions around our debt in the first quarter of 2016.

Our adjusted EBIT at \u20ac5.3 billion was 40% higher than 2014 and our margin was up 80 basis points to 4.7%. The adjusted net profit number was just over \u20ac2 billion, up 91% from prior year. ", "Net industrial debt was reduced to \u20ac5 billion, post the Ferrari spin-off from \u20ac7.7 billion at the end of last year driven by the \u20ac1.5 billion from the separation of Ferrari positive cash flows from operating activities and some favorable FX mainly due to the devaluation of the real.", "Total available liquidity, as I said, was \u20ac24.6 billion post the Ferrari spin-off and included \u20ac2.5 billion of the syndicated to RCF which would increase to \u20ac5 billion of availability after removal of the ring-fencing provisions. ", "Turning to Slide 6, you can see the year-over-year changes in adjusted EBIT for the various segments of the Group of which I will provide details in the respective sections. Adjusted EBIT increased by \u20ac1.5 billion in the year and was driven by strong improvements in NAFTA, EMEA, Ferrari and the Components businesses, which more than offset the drop in Other segment.", "Moving to Slide 7, we detail the reduction in net industrial debt from the \u20ac7.7 billion at December 2014 to the \u20ac5 billion. This reduction is comprised of positive cash flows from operating activities driven by improved EBITDA up to \u20ac10.7 billion and net of capital expenditures which came in at \u20ac9.2 billion for the year. There were positive translation impacts of about \u20ac0.7 billion and the \u20ac1.5 billion impact of the IPO and spin-off of Ferrari.

The Chrysler brand was also up 5% for the year and despite the slowdown at the end of the year for the changeover of the minivan. ", "Dodge brand was down 10% for the year due to the discontinuance of the Avenger model. Our fleet mix was substantially in line with prior year at 22%. US dealer inventory ended the year at 81 days of supply versus 76 at the end of September. The increase was primarily driven by product changeovers. ", "In Canada, the Group was the market leader reaching market share of 15.2% with a record vehicle sales of 293,000 units. The Jeep and the Ram brands both posted record annual sales. ", "In Mexico, we had our best annual sales since 2013 with sales up 13% to 87,000 vehicles. At the November Lost Angeles Auto Show, we presented the all new Fiat Spider, which will support Fiat brand expansion in North America and the Jeep Wrangler backcountry special edition.

Net revenues increased to \u20ac70 billion due to higher shipments, positive net pricing and favorable FX translation. ", "Adjusted EBIT more than doubled versus 2014 to \u20ac4.5 billion. Adjusted EBIT margin for the year was 6.4%, up 220 basis points year-over-year and 7.1% for Q4. The strong improvement in adjusted EBIT was primarily driven by volume growth mainly from the Jeep and Ram brands led by the Jeep Renegade and Cherokee, also by positive net pricing, which more than offset the FX impact of the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. ", "This was partially offset by higher industrial cost due to vehicle content enhancements, as well as warranty and recall costs, partially offset by purchasing efficiencies. ", "NAFTA 2015 adjusted EBIT excludes the charges previously mentioned regarding the realignment of the production capacity to better align with market demand and the \u20ac760 million charge recognized in Q3 related to the change in estimate of recall campaign costs. ", "Moving to Slide 10, LATAM industry was down 21% versus 2014 driven by continued macroeconomic weakness with Brazil down 26%. Sales for the Group were down 30%. The decrease was larger than the industry decline as pricing actions were taken to protect margins. The Group remains the market leader in Brazil and increase its lead of its nearest competitor to 380 basis points. However market share in Brazil declined by 170 basis points to 19.5% due to strong competition and pricing pressures. ", "FCA also maintained its leadership in the Brazil A/B segment with a 22% share. Fiat Strada and Fiorino confirmed their leadership with segment share at 54% and 70%, respectively. The all new Jeep Renegade continued its growth trend reaching a 30% segment share in Brazil for the fourth quarter.", "In Argentina, market share was 12%, 150 basis points down from 2014 mainly due to continued import restrictions. Stock levels in the region were at 39 days of supply inline with the end of September.

Other results, net revenues were down 25%. Adjusted EBIT was a negative \u20ac87 million for the year compared to a positive \u20ac289 million for the prior year, mainly due to the lower volumes. ", "Positive pricing actions more than offset higher industrial costs related to import cost inflation and the start-up cost of the Pernambuco plant while SG&A increased to support the Jeep Renegade launch costs. ", "Adjusted EBIT margin was negative 1.4% and adjusted EBIT margin in the fourth quarter was positive. 2015 adjusted EBIT excludes charges of \u20ac219 million, basically related \u2013 both related to devaluations in Venezuela and Argentina. ", "Moving to APAC on Slide 12. Industry increased by 5% with growth in all major markets except Japan. Group sales declined 16% due to the contraction in demand for imported vehicles in China as competition from local producers continued to intensify as well as the interruption in supply due to the Tianjin port explosion in August. ", "Sales in Australia declined 21% with demand impacted by price increases made to offset the weakness of the Australian dollar. Jeep continues to represent more than half of the Group sales in the region. Inventories at the end of December were down to 84,000 units from 99,000 units at the end of Q3. ", "In November, full production of the Jeep Cherokee began at our joint venture plant in Changsha. ", "Turning to Slide 13, shipments in APAC were down 32% resulting in a 22% decrease in revenues, mainly due to strong competition from local producers and the Tianjin port issue. Adjusted EBIT for the year was \u20ac52 million driven by the lower volumes, negative net pricing due to higher incentives in China and unfavorable FX impacts, partially offset by reduced SG&A.

Adjusted EBIT improved by \u20ac254 million to \u20ac213 million for the year driven by higher volumes and mix, positive pricing actions in non-EU markets and some FX in the UK. ", "Industrial costs were impacted by stronger US dollar for imported vehicles, partially offset by cost efficiencies. SG&A increase was due to the commercial launches of the 500X and the Renegade. ", "Turning to Slide 16 on Maserati, shipments were down 11% or 32.5000 units with China down 28% and North America down 14%.

", "And now move to Slide 19 to review our expectations for full year 2016 market demand by region. For NAFTA, we expect the industry to be flat to slightly higher between 21 million units and 21.5 million units. The LATAM industry is uncertain and we expect it to be flat to down again this year between 3.6 million units to 4.1 million units reflecting a continuation of a challenging trading conditions in Brazil.

", "This guidance is based on expected continued improvement in NAFTA and EMEA margins with LATAM and APAC seeing improved results in the second half as a result of local production of new Jeep products and Maserati also improving in the second half following the launch of the new Levante. CapEx is expected to be inline with 2015 between \u20ac8.5 and \u20ac9 billion.", "Thank you and with that, we will proceed with the presentation of the update to our business plan. ", "Sergio Marchionne", "Thank you, Rich, and I am going to start \u2013 I am going to give you a brief introduction to the plan. And we want to start with the Slide number 3 which includes the quotation of a statement that was published by Mark Twain a number of years ago. This was introduced in the pitch in the last couple of days and it follows the announcement that was made by Max Warburton that he will be leaving this industry after 16 years after spending 16 years trying to understand the car business. ", "And in connection with his departure he has issued the longest dear John letter I have ever seen in my life, 422 pages, what is described or his call for the demise of this industry in a very negative view on the sector going forward.", "Apart from the fact that Max has probably outlived the most automotive CEOs in this business. I think he is the longest serving non-CEO, CEO that I\u2019ve ever seen in the sector. I think, over the last few years, we have had heat of exchanges and diametrically opposed views about how this business will evolve, I think it\u2019s been done, it\u2019s been done well. ", "I think we are going to miss Max certainly out of FCA he has provided a good sparring partner for the development of our strategy. We do wish him the best. But, just as a general remark about the type of literature that is not coming out, not only from analysts, but also in the press about the negative side of this industry. ", "We are not inside FCA of the view that this industry is facing an impending demise and I think that part of this presentation today is designed to provide you with some comfort that we have appropriate or adequate controls over the strategic development of those business that we do feel that we will be able to navigate through these rough waters and that we will come out of this process as better organizations. ", "And I made the comment not just on behalf of FCA but I think on behalf of the industry which I think is unfortunately been the subject of some severe criticisms in some cases justify. ", "But I think that ultimately trying to move the discussion the way from the concept of auto making, trying to re-pitch our future as being involved in the transportation business in the broadest sense of the term we doesn\u2019t do much service to the sort of needs and objectives of the sector that it faces today. ", "I think, even if I were to assume for a moment that this new world that we are describing which is a much wider and much more encompassing world of transportation were effectively to materialize, we need to be able to cross the desert. ", "We need to get it to the other side, I think the purpose of our presentation here is to give you the comfort that you need in understanding how FCA intends to travel to that desert and the fact that at the end of that process we will be in a much better position that we are in today. ", "I think the last \u2013 less than two years since we pitched the plan and if I can just move for a second to Slide number 4 and then I\u2019ll give it back to Richard for comments. But, we have been able to accomplish a lot in less than two years. We talked to you again on the plan back in May of 2014. ", "We took you through a one day marathon of the development of the brands and the development of our businesses across the four regions. But in the interim, we have been able to accomplish a lot we\u2019ve unlocked, finally, we have unlocked the value of Ferrari out of FCA. ", "We have been able to move margins in NAFTA up to levels that we had effectively pitched for 2018. We were able to move EMEA to a profitability in the last quarter of EMEA which made over \u20ac100 million as an indication of the intensity with which that organization is reacting to the challenge. ", "Jeep has had a phenomenal year. We are well in excess of 1,200,000 cars more than 200,000 more than we sold last year and as we deploy the architectures globally, we will see this number increase and Richard will explain to you that we\u2019ve targeted a number in excess of 2 million. ", "The mandatory convertible went a long way in terms of providing comfort on the capital side where we are able to lock in about \u20ac3 billion worth of capital as a result of that issuance in 2014. And I think the thing that people keep on ignoring is the fact that as of today, we started 2016 with a \u20ac5 billion number, which is significantly ahead of any internal expectations that we had for what we would be at the end of 2015. ", "On the negative side, obviously Brazil that\u2019s come out of less fielding left most of us steering at a set of a very uncertain market conditions notwithstanding that we continue to be profitable in the region. I think we are heading now levels and it\u2019s very difficult to call the bottom of this market. But I think 2016 will tell a lot about the speed of recovery of that market. ", "China, again has also come out on a less field for a variety of reasons not only the fire in Tianjin but the significant shift in market conditions as it impacts premium luxury goods has slowed down by necessity and development of both the Maserati and the Alfa Romeo. ", "Branding on the Alfa Romeo side is required a slowdown of the rollout of the development plans for Alfa and Richard will take you through that, but fundamentally, we conform the direction we confirm the development of the architectures and the models that we had in the original plan is going to take us longer to get there because our primary area of focus for the development of Alfa is not going to be NAFTA and EMEA and I think China will play more of a secondary role in the development of that brand. ", "The other thing that\u2019s obviously happened and was absolutely unforeseen was the development of a much greater degree of consciousness when it comes to emissions and the regulatory environment, some of them which were caused by the industry, some of which I think a result of something which is been brewing within the system especially in the EMEA side now for a number of years. ", "With all these things we will require resolution over the next three or four years and it will have cost which we have incorporated in our plan. ", "But, when I look back at the last two years, I feel comfortable that we have been able to create an organization that has got a much more defensive, a much more durable capital structure and as you will see, when we go through the proposed realignment of our manufacturing footprint in the US that we\u2019ve taken some relatively decisive steps in ensuring that we have the right manufacturing framework to deal with expected permanent changes in demand which we have now seen developed over the last two years. ", "So on that note, I\u2019ll pass it on to Richard. Richard will take you through the next set of slides. Slide number 5 and I\u2019ll make on brief comment about the achievement of the 2014 and 2015 plan. Those things are not inconsequential. ", "Our travel to 2018 was a relatively well articulated five-year program that had milestones, tangible milestones of achievement of financial results. Those continue to be the key drivers of this plan and the reformulation of the targets going forward. We\u2019ve upgraded the guidance on all the key metrics. ", "I know that sooner or later, somewhere in this phone call there is going to be somebody who is going to asking the question about where is the 7 million car number that has been \u2013 that was presented back in 2014 and the answer is fundamentally it doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter because, the 7 million number was a number that was substantiating or supporting a view of markets as we saw them back in May 2014, we have readjusted all of our plans to reflect current market conditions. ", "We have seen the Brazilian market which was expected to perform much, much better, lose over 1 million cars in less than 18 to 24 months which has had pretty significant impacts on our volume ambitions. So we have recast all those. We are going to stay away going forward from enunciating goals that relate to volumes because the real key issue for us is the achievement of the financial metrics that you see on page five and on that note, I\u2019ll pass it to Richard. ", "Richard Palmer", "Thank you. So, on the forward-looking part of Page 5, we have basically given you a look in the column which says 2018 May 2014 plan at Ferrari what we look like in terms of our original plan objective for 2018 excluding Ferrari and the impacts of the capital markets transactions at the end of 2014. So you can see that compared to that comparable metric we stated. ", "Now for 2018, we are looking at revenues being up at \u20ac136 billion for the 2018 period. Adjusted EBIT in a range between \u20ac8.7 billion to \u20ac9.8 billion with margins at the same level of those with the plan ex Ferrari. Adjusted net profit of \u20ac4.7 billion to \u20ac5.5 billion, up from the restated number and a net cash number by the end of the plan period at between \u20ac4 billion and \u20ac5 billion. ", "Clearly, we are ahead of our original plan at the end of 2015, our original plan as you remember said that we would be at around \u20ac9.8 billion to \u20ac10.3 billion of net industrial debt in the period through 2016. So we are about \u20ac5 billion better. And so that is reflected. ", "Going forward, \u20ac1 billion of that is performance and we are looking at the end of the plan and bringing in another \u20ac1.5 billion, \u20ac1 billion to \u20ac1.5 billion of better performance. That to bring us up to a \u20ac4 billion to \u20ac5 billion cash number by the end of the plan period. ", "I will talk a little bit about that in the next few pages. So Page 6. Basically it talks about how we have clearly been focused on the de-leveraging of our balance sheet. We\u2019ve undertaken a series of transactions since May 2014 the impact of which have been just under \u20ac4 billion on our net industrial debt number.", "In addition, this has also allowed us to act quickly regarding the repayment of the FCA US senior secured notes in April and December of last year and so, clearly we are moving forward with speed to remove the ring-fencing provisions in our current debt agreements in the FCA US area so that we can move towards a unified financing platform from the second half of 2016.", "Moving on to Slide 7 and in this following slide we are going to talk a little bit about the status of each region and our margin \u2013 our market and margin expectations. Sales have been stronger in NAFTA than our original plan and we are forecasting industry volume levels in 2015 \u2013 in 2016 to remain at what we consider a peak level. But we do see the industry remaining strong throughout the plan period for NAFTA at around 20 million units with US market sales remaining above 16 million through 2018.", "We\u2019ve seen a trend of low fuel prices that we expect to continue and this is part of the reason and that we are seeing also a shift in market demand away from passenger cars towards trucks and UVs. ", "This is obviously been a part of our ability to achieve margin expansion faster than we had envisioned our original plan. And so, in order to continue to capitalize on this market shift, we have made some plans to shift some of our production capacity to be able to \u2013 to address more fully the demand of truck and UV going forward. ", "So, in terms of that, our impact \u2013 that impacts in our margins. Our original plan had adjusted EBIT margin range of 6% to 7% by 2018. We\u2019ve already hit 6.4% in 2015 and we are increasing our margin expectations for the NAFTA region to be around 9% by 2018.", "If we move on to Slide 8, on LATAM, we expect the market uncertainties to continue in Brazil and the industry in the region to reach around 4.5 million units in 2018 with Brazil recovering but not to the levels that we had expected in our original plan to around 3 million units. Despite the challenges in the market, we have been profitable in the last two quarters of 2015 and have been taking pricing actions to offset inflation. ", "Going forward, the key to our strategy remains the Pernambuco plant and our ability to capitalize on the Jeep brand introduction into Latin America. By the end of this year, we will introduce the third vehicle into Pernambuco to add to the very successful launch of the Jeep Renegade and the current launch of the Fiat Toro Pickup from that production plant. ", "We have decided to moderate our margin expectations given the market performance in LATAM. So instead of more than 10% target, we are looking at margins greater than 7% by the end of the plan period, very much sustained by the Pernambuco products and the shift in mix and profitability that the new products from that plant provides. ", "Moving to Slide 9, Asia-Pacific, we have clearly impacted significantly given our import structure at present by the import segments in the Chinese market. And this has significantly slowed down our volumes and we\u2019ve also been hit by competitive pressures obviously from local Chinese brands.", "Outside of China, also Australia has been impacted by a much weaker Aussie dollar which \u2013 for which we have priced but that\u2019s also impacted negatively our volumes. Obviously, the key for us in Asia-Pacific is to quickly localize the Jeep brand which we have been working on. ", "We have started production of the Jeep Cherokee and we are working towards two more jeeps during 2016. And ultimately we will also be launching the Alfa Romeo brand, but we\u2019ve looked to recadence that launch based on the pressures in the premium segment and the import segment of the Chinese market to refocus it principally on EMEA and North America in the short-term. ", "Given all of that, localization is the key to Asia-Pacific and Jeep is the focus. We expect to become a 500,000 unit brand by 2018 from our local production sites and we consider a 10% plus margin target is still a reasonable target to set for the Jeep brand and the localized footprint. ", "Moving to Slide 10, EMEA. The recovery in the region that we have been seeing slowly but surely we forecast to continue through 2018 with a market in the EU to reach around 17 million units by the end of the plan period. From a performance standpoint, our margin improvement is ahead of schedule. Thanks to the strong performance of the new products like the Jeep Renegade, the Fiat 500X. ", "And so, our guidance for EMEA in terms of margins has been revised upwards from 2% to 3% in our original plan to an excess of 4% by 2018 and obviously we are very focused still on continuing to increase the volume of Jeep brand and also to maintain a very tight control on the cost profile of the EMEA business. ", "Moving to Slide 11. Maserati, the key really for the next \u2013 the short-term of Maserati is the launch of the new crossover, the Levante. So that is coming in the second quarter of this year. ", "That vehicle would allow us to address the largest luxury segment worldwide. An important segment in China and in the US, we have the opportunity as we work towards also the Alfa brand launches to strengthen our network presence in these key markets. And so we expect to bring Maserati to 15% margins by the end of the plan as was our original target in May 2014. ", "As regard to components businesses, I think driven primarily by the improvement we are seeing in Marelli margins. We have revised our expectations from a 4% to 5% margin to an excess of 6% driven by continued success of some of the more profitable businesses within Marelli. ", "Moving to Slide 12, we talked a lot about Jeep and clearly Jeep is the bedrock of this business plan. We originally had a target to produce and sell more than 1.9 million units in the May 2014 plan. We are revising our upwards to be in excess of 2 million by 2018. ", "This is on the back of a strong performance since 2009 across all the products we\u2019ve launched under the Jeep brand and in all regions. Brands have grown over 250% to 1.2 million units, significantly outpacing the global UV industry which grew by over 150%. But obviously it\u2019s a growth segment, so this is a very important focus for us. ", "Sales in Jeep\u2019s main NAFTA market grew by nearly 250% between 2009 and 2015. And sales in EMEA and APAC both reached over 100,000 units in 2015. On a product-line basis, each model from the Wrangler the compasses more than double volumes since 2009 and global Cherokee sales reached 233,000 units in 2015. ", "So, I\u2019ll move on to Page 13 for EMEA, the commitment to the overall brand remains in place as does the product strategy. We are looking at \u2013 as I mentioned before, a different cadence to our launches given the tough situation of the Chinese premium and import market and also because of some of the restrictions around imports. We are shifting our focus initially to be primarily on EMEA and NAFTA and retiming some of the product introductions which will also allow us to reduce the CapEx relating to 2018. And obviously the first launch of this brand is coming shortly with the Julia. ", "Now I hand over back to Mr. Marchionne. Thank you.", "Sergio Marchionne", "Maybe trying the \u2013 the next couple of slides. The first one was deals with the assembly plant loading from NAFTA. This is very much a US-centric view. We have seen a significant shift in the product mix of cars being sold. Part of this is been driven as Richard has said by continuing low prices which certainly in terms of our forecast period we do not expect to see fundamentally change directionally. ", "I have said this before and I continue to repeat here that I have always viewed the development of our portfolio in the United States as being already driven by the regulatory environment and this by the need for all of in the market to achieve the 2025 standards and to achieve the greenhouse gas emission targets that we have all signed up to. And so, one of the things that we have seen, although the actual absolute number is obviously from 2009 and 2015 have gone up.", "There has been, in our view, a permanent shift towards UVs and pick up trucks and we have seen, certainly in terms of our ability to meet market demand some severe restriction in terms of the dexterity of our manufacturing system to accomplish that end. ", "And so, one of the things that we have decided to do is to effectively defocus from a manufacturing standpoint in the US to defocus the passenger car market. There are two cars in particular the Dodge Dart and the Chrysler 200 which will run their course. But without creating additional capacity in the United States, we need to re-utilize those plant infrastructure to try and deal with the development of both Jeep and the Ram brands. ", "So there will be a number of things that will be put in place in the next 18 months, things that have been agreed and detailed effectively. We draw the current Chrysler 200 and Dodge Dart from the marketplace over for a long period of time during which we will be continuing discussions with potential partners that will be able to allow us to access that architecture an effectively provide us the product from their facilities that will allow us to continue to cover the market.", "The important thing is that as we transition to these new vehicles, the new Wrangler that\u2019s coming out of Toledo in 2017, the continuation of the Cherokee, which as you well know is essential to the development of the brand especially in NAFTA. ", "These things happen with us \u2013 without us losing any volume in the Jeep or the Ram brands. These are things which are fundamental and I think that they have obviously had some cost in terms of the achievement of the objective, but it is a cost that is managed and certainly justified in terms of the margin generation associated with the shift.", "So we continue to work with our partners, hopefully in the relatively short period of time, we will be able to detail the cooperation plan going forward. I think the important thing for us to reinforce is the fact that the Wrangler in its new home in Toledo will have additional production capacity available to try and meet demand on a global scale. ", "And I think it\u2019s important for us to have found the home for the Grand Wagoneer family both the Grand Wagoneer and the Wagoneer in whatever shape they come and then we find that space without creating additional production capacity. I think we\u2019ve been able to accomplish that as a result of the realignment decision that we\u2019ve made. I think we have taken a one-off charge in 2015 to account for some of the costs associated with that realignment we think that the cost that will justify the view of the significant expansion of margins that we will be able to obtain from the US. ", "Now, I am not going to spend a lot of time on Page 15 which deals with the regulatory compliance plan in terms of greenhouse gas on a global scale. I think we all know that there is directionally a desire to bring down CO2 emissions. ", "I think, as I read some of the reports that have been issued in connection with FCA that appears to be some concern that we do not have adequate technologies to try to deal with this. ", "So I am going to spend a couple of slides trying to reassure you that all the things that are required to try and make the numbers are in fact in place and available and I won\u2019t take you through all these items that are listed on Slide 15, but the introduction of electrification in our world is not avoidable and I think that we are going to be seeing applications on a mile hybrid for the first time in 2018 with the introduction of the Ram pickup truck. ", "You will see, in addition to hybrid vehicles, which were already launched by Chrysler back in 2008 prior to the bankruptcy. ", "A continuation of the development of both hybrid and plug-in hybrids throughout the plan, I think the objective obviously is to optimize and leverage the know how the Group across its regions to ensure that we achieved the least cost to the compliance scheme that we can. And if you look at page 16, there was unfortunately a rather misinformed article that came out a few days ago that dealt with our greenhouse gas compliance. ", "And I think one of the things you can see from the chart is that, as a result of the combination of what I consider to be economically sound acquisitions of credits and the rollout of technologies that were well ahead of the curve in terms of achieving the targets that we have throughout the plan. ", "There is \u2013 I will make the point here that it appears to be sort of a negative view that we\u2019ve accessed purchase credits as a means of making the targets. The reality is that we always run numbers internally about the possibility of avoiding the rollout of technology if we can purchase the credits in a more reasonable price and I think that analysis will continue. Going forward, I think it\u2019s essential that economically base decisions are made in terms that a rollout technology in a marketplace especially when margins are being threatened. ", "And if you look at Page 17, this is only designed to give you an idea of how at least three of the significant vehicles that we have in our plan will make the numbers and you can see those from the chart that these vehicles really have to meet certain targets based on the footprint of the vehicle and therefore the larger the vehicle which is one of the reasons why people keep on favoring these in terms of the development is because there is more latitude involved in terms of achieving the target. ", "But as you can see, both the current Ram 1500 which today is compliant with 2015 standards will and its next incarnation when the truck is launched in 2018 meet both the 2018 and 2022 targets. And that\u2019s same is true of the Wrangler\u2019s two other Town and Country.", "And I think it\u2019s important to keep this in mind. The house has been busy and it continues to be busy on optimized methods to achieve the targets that we\u2019ll continue to do so and it will do this in a most cost-effective way. ", "One word on the European side. I think that after the advent of the diesel gate for a lack of a better term, FCA is undertaking a pretty thorough review and a thorough audit of its compliance schemes and I think we feel comfortable in making the statement that there are no defeat mechanisms or devices present in our vehicles. I think the car has performed in the same way on the road as they do in the lab under the same operating conditions. ", "This is an area of heightened concern and so we\u2019ve put in, we have established now as part of our compliance mechanism training for all emission calibration engineers. We do have a best practice program to ensure that we calibrate and certify properly and I think that we will just to make sure that the system is not going after reservation and we will carry out random checks of our fleet to make sure that we achieve compliance. ", "And on that note, I\u2019ll give it to Richard who is still punching away numbers to trying to reconcile his targets on Page 19. Go ahead Richard. ", "Richard Palmer", "Thanks for the transparency to hold on listeners. So, the key takeaway is on Page 19. We have, basically confirmed our key initiatives as per our plan remain in tact. There are no significant changes in the strategy. ", "I think we\u2019ve made some important progress towards deleveraging and strengthening our balance sheet both through operating performance and through that the transactions we have \u2013 and we have completed regarding the M&G convertible and Ferrari. As a result, I think we feel that our plan is somewhat derisked in that regard. ", "The targets, despite the exit of Ferrari have been revised upwards and in particular, I think we feel confident that going forward we can generate positive cash flow in each of the remaining three years of the plan to get us to the \u20ac4 billion to \u20ac 5 billion net cash target that is obviously front and center for us by the end of 2018. ", "Sergio Marchionne", "Thanks, Richard. Before we turn it over to the question and answer, I just want to point out that, as Ferrari is now a publicly traded company, as Richard mentioned before, they are going to publish and release their results here around February 2 and therefore we would appreciate if you would hold any questions you have on Ferrari in this call in order to allow them to publish their results. And with that I want to turn it back to Rhonda and we will begin the Q&A session. ", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator ", "[Operator Instructions] And we will take the first question from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rod Lache", "Hello everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple of things I wanted to ask. One is just at a very high level. There is a lot of discussion in the industry about spending in preparation for new mobility paradigms and it\u2019s expected by a lot of people to require autonomous driving and investments in transportation platforms and I think you alluded to some of these comments in your prepared remarks. Ford actually mentioned that their investments are \u2013 one of the reasons why their North American margins will be down in 2016. So, if you can just maybe give us your sense of what the house view is on mobility how that\u2019s going to change, whether you need to invest in that and whether that\u2019s contemplated in this plan?", "Sergio Marchionne", "Well, the answer is that it is contemplated in this plan and I think \u2013 I think we need to be very, very careful about describing sort of mobility paradigm is that, sort of an unclear economic context and an unclear economic outcome. I am absolutely convinced that all the things that have been talked about by other industry participants will effectively materialize over a period of time and I am absolutely convinced that the relevance of the automaker in that process is not going to be as key as it has been historically in terms of the development of the automotive sector. We are going to have to rely by necessity in efficient supplier base and there is one which continues to break barriers and continues to provide solutions which are going to be available to us and to others. And so, one of the things and I raise this issue just and I am not sure that it can be debated but, one of the questions that we all have to ask ourselves is what is the value of a brand in the presence of autonomous driving if effectively at the end of the day, it is not the driver that effectively exercises control and the way in which that reflects itself in margins and positioning and the relevance of the brands in the marketplace is an unknown issue. And so we need to be very, very careful that we don\u2019t spend \u2013 we have done, by the way, this industry has done a tremendous amount, if you look at its \u2013 even its recent past, it has always looked for ways to sort of defocus its primary function of making cars and making them relevant in the marketplace by looking for ancillary side solutions and somehow we will change the paradigm. We have done this with rental cars. We have owned rental car companies. We have all owned finance companies, we have all owned a variety of things historically that is tended to defocus the actual objective of making a car and making it relevant in the marketplace. So I accept the challenge and I think we are on the page and I think the capital program that Richard talked about encompasses an adequate amount of spending to explore and make that technology and relevant in the cars that we sell. I do not think that between now and 2018, that technology is going to fundamentally change the paradigm. I do think that the capital that\u2019s required to make us relevant post 2019 is in the plan and I think it will defend the business going forward. ", "Rod Lache", "Okay, thank you and just in terms of the now through 2018 plan, could you give us a little bit more insight into the magnitude of this capacity change. How much additional capacity do you think you can come up with for Jeep and pickups, you are still selling 22% of your business in cars, does that get diminished significantly? And do you subscribe to the view that just generally, margins are going to come under increased pressure within NAFTA. It sounds like you do subscribe to the view that volumes are peaking. ", "Sergio Marchionne", "No, I do subscribe to the motion that we are looking at top-ish volumes today. The rate of adjustment is unknown. I also know that there is a phenomenal amount of allowed amplitude and the isolation of volumes. I mean, if we went to 16 million, it\u2019s not going to be the end of the world in terms of size and I think that we will all adjust to reflect those market conditions. It is my experience at least in the last six years that \u2013 than in the majority of cases there is adequate price discipline in the marketplace that then nobody has done anything which I consider to be irrational and out of bounds in terms of managing their pricing expectations. But, to answer your question Rod, I think it would be improper for us to try and talk about how much more volume we will get out of Ram and how much more we will get out of Jeep as a result of the realignment, because, we have \u2013 we are structurally constrained in both pickup trucks and Wranglers and those are the single largest drivers of the shift in the manufacturing footprints in the US. For purposes of this analysis, the partnered vehicles that will replace \u2013 over time that will replace the passenger cars that are currently in production in the US, we have assumed to have negligible margin contribution to the overall plan. So, even in the absence of those vehicles, we are not going to drastically change our forecast and I think we contain any adjustment associated with that from \u2013 within the numbers that we\u2019ve published. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I would defocus, if I can make a suggestion, I would defocus everybody from focusing on absolute numbers of cars being sold. I am not trying to set up a system to acquire an abnormal amount of share. I just think we need to be physically present and active with proper supply in the key segments that are relevant to FCA which is our pickup trucks and UVs through Jeep. ", "Rod Lache", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator ", "Thank you. We will take the next question from John Murphy of Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "John Murphy ", "Good morning. Can you hear me? ", "Sergio Marchionne", "Yes.", "John Murphy ", "Just if I can follow-up, just first off on Rod\u2019s question, because it\u2019s mix shift in North America, it seems like it\u2019s such a critical swing factor in your plans going forward. Can you just \u2013 if you could sort of tell us what your current capacity utilization is on pickups, Wranglers and UVs in North America? And also, I know you are not going to give an exact number on what percent of your total mix will be trucks and UVs going forward, but I mean, is there any sort of asymptotic limit or is this the kind of thing that could potentially which is going to a 100%? ", "Sergio Marchionne", "No, nothing could ever go to a 100%. I mean, I understand the suggestion. Let me \u2013 in terms of capacity utilization, we have debottlenecked our pickup truck plan to the extent that we can and one of the unfortunate consequences of the prior \u2013 of prior management arrangements is unfortunately a truck plant not been kept after a relevant manufacturing standard and I think it requires as a result of its current state would require a substantial amount of investment. But, I\u2019d give you a couple of data points which I think are \u2013 make our life somewhat uncomfortable. We are running flat out today out of Toledo. We are running effectively nearly seven days a week with almost no shutdown at the Wrangler plant to try and satisfy demand and we got nearly a similar arrangement in our truck plant. So that is unsustainable even if I use a harbor definition, we blown to the 100% mark consistently now, probably the last five or six years and I think that needs to be adjusted. So, the capacity that\u2019s coming on stream to deal with the new Wrangler and with the new pickup truck will avoid the excessive utilization of that capacity. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s unhealthy and I think it\u2019s causing some substantial manufacturing inefficiency because of the speed at which we are driving that bus. Without giving you numbers, I think that, whatever we\u2019ve put in place will deal with demand and unmet demand as we see it today. ", "John Murphy ", "Okay, and then just as a follow-up as we think about the mid-term review on CAF\u00c9 and emission standards in the US in 2017, I mean are you expecting any changes there? I mean when those initially put in place gas was around $4, we are now sub $2, it seems like there is a lot of discussion around potentially easing those standards. Could you get a lot of help from that? And also as you think about that and implementing hybridization whether it be irregular hybrid of plugging in your fleet going forward, what percentage of your fleet do you think it ultimately be hybridized or electrified?", "Sergio Marchionne", "Well, look, in the medium-term I\u2019d say more than half of our fleet in the United States is going to be in some form of hybrid. Calling the right time for the conversion is difficult to tell. I mean, if you include 48 volt systems, Bell Star Generators as a solution that\u2019s going to occupy the majority of the pickup production in the United States anyway. So we are going to be marrying hybridization as a way of life relatively quickly. In terms of the mid-term review of the standards, I think it will be improper for me to express our views on this on this call. There is not a single doubt that a relaxation of the standards will be helpful. But I think that, we are talking about a relaxation of the standards only in terms of timing and not necessarily of direction of quantum. So if it does come, I think you will alleviate some of the concerns that we have in terms of capital. But it will not maybe a sure go away. I think those fix is our structure and they are needed over time. Interventions in terms of time are more than welcome that I don\u2019t think we can change the direction. ", "John Murphy ", "Okay, and then just lastly, as we look at the plan up to 2018 or maybe even beyond, would you contemplate any other asset sales or are there any other actions as part of that business that you think you can monetize going forward?", "Sergio Marchionne", "The answer is yes. There are things that I can monetize. I mean, including my office chair, the question is do I need to do that. And the plan is calling for a \u20ac5 billion cash holding by the end of 2018. I think you guys should be asking for distributions and that point of time is opposed to my \u2013 worrying about monetizing assets. ", "John Murphy ", "And we hope leap along to your seat. Thank you very much.", "Operator ", "Thank you. We will move to the next question from Charles Winston of Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.", "Charles Winston ", "Yes, hi, good afternoon. Charles from Redburn. Couple of quick questions if you don\u2019t mind. Just firstly, I guess, in terms of the revision to the 2018 targets, would you have made the revisions where you reporting in dollars? In other words, when you set the targets in 2014, I think the dollar was about 1.36 to the euro, it\u2019s now about 1.09. You\u2019ve seen about 718 or roughly 700 million of FX gain on translation in 2015 which is actually bigger than the upgrade you\u2019ve made in your EBIT. In other words, is this basically an FX move or is this something more fundamental than that? And I guess the second question is\u2026", "Sergio Marchionne", "Guys are devious. ", "Charles Winston ", "The second question is just in terms of the OCO2 strategy. Purchasing credits is surely a risky strategy, because as others potentially need to start buying credits as well. GMs brings to mind, particularly when the flexible credit system disappears, the danger is the price of credits goes on. So, you all going to have to comply in some shape or form and I just was thinking about the business risk here. Could you comment from that at all and in particular \u2013 in model year 2014 you\u2019ll tailpipe emissions actually went up slightly from 344 to 346 gram miles. So, just really just think about the business risk here in terms of that strategy. Thank you. ", "Sergio Marchionne", "Yes, by the way, I read the same article you read on the tailpipe emissions and I agree, we got a number is as reported. What it doesn\u2019t do is, it doesn\u2019t tell you the percentage by which the number has been coming down over the last three or four years and our starting point. Just as a general remark about your fear about the pricing of credits, and the fact that \u2013 it may become prohibitive in terms \u2013 to acquire them in terms of compliance. I made the comment in my remarks that as long as we find an economically justifiable model, that justifies the price that we pay, we will take it over the rollout of technology in the vehicles. But it\u2019s subject to an economic model supporting the acquisition and we have walked away from at least in the past, not recently, but we have walked away from potential offers what we thought that the request was outside of the boundaries of our economic model. So that\u2019s not the issue. But, and so we won\u2019t buy them, which means that we just rollout technology instead and that\u2019s life and think that will impact all of us across the whole industry as the pricing equation adjusts on credits. That\u2019s the first issue, the second one which, I think it is a devious question. I think that we would still be revising \u2013 we would have still been revising our targets going forward regardless of what our reporting currency was. ", "Charles Winston ", "Okay, even \u2013 forgive me, even though you\u2019ve got about \u20ac700 million of gain so far, just looking at the translation effect in 2015?", "Sergio Marchionne", "Even with those in. ", "Charles Winston ", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator ", "Thank you. We will take the next question from Massimo Becchio of Mediobanca. Please go ahead.", "Massimo Becchio ", "Yes, good afternoon. Couple of questions from my side. I am trying to understand what your 2016 EBIT margin could be in NAFTA. Number of differences with 2015 new label contract and recall provisions on the negative side, minivan, tooling and dealer discount on the positive side. All of those factors were already in play in Q4 2015 and you had a 7.1% margin. So, is the 7.1% a good indication of what could happen in NAFTA in 2016 or are there any other forces?", "Sergio Marchionne", "The number is greater than it was for 2015. ", "Massimo Becchio ", "Okay, but still below the 8%, 9% target for 2017. Sorry, for 2018, so this should be a kind of progression going there.", "Sergio Marchionne", "It\u2019s a transition year to the 2018 target. Yes.", "Massimo Becchio ", "Okay. Second question if I may, what is your capacity utilization in Italy or in Europe right now?", "Sergio Marchionne", "I am going off the top of my head, but on our basis it\u2019s about 72%, 73% on a combined basis across all plants. ", "Massimo Becchio ", "Okay. Last question, there were unions in Italy saying that the Julia production could start in March. Can you give some indication on when we could expect this car coming to the road?", "Sergio Marchionne", "Q1, it will be starting to get produced in Q1. ", "Massimo Becchio ", "Okay. All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator ", "Thank you. We will take the next question from George Galliers of Evercore. Please go ahead. ", "George Galliers ", "Thank you for taking my questions. First one, you made great strides on net debt, and for 2015 you came in significantly ahead of guidance, you now forecast net debt less than \u20ac5 billion this year improving to net cash of \u20ac5 billion in 2018. Can you give some indication on the cadence of the improvement in net debt and how much improvement we will see in 2016 versus 2017 and 2018?", "Richard Palmer", "Yes, George, well, basically, as we\u2019ve guided, we are going to generate cash in 2016. I think it\u2019s a bit early to give you any more precision in that given obviously there are some \u2013 there is some uncertainty about our Latin America position in particular. But I think we are confident it\u2019s going to be a positive number. The cadence of cash is biased towards 2017 and 2018 though, because especially as we go through this realignment of the production capacity in NAFTA, that is going to help us obviously to get a further increase in our NAFTA margins and improved cash flow as a subsequent \u2013 in subsequent to that. So, I don\u2019t want to get into giving you an overly precise numbers that it would be falsely precise. But I think what\u2019s important is that we will cash positive each year, this year we are going to be cash positive which is a continuation of a very positive performance also in 2015 and this is reducing the level of risk that we had an original plan where obviously a lot more of our cash flow was bunched into 2018. ", "George Galliers ", "Thank you. And then, secondly, just on NAFTA where you\u2019ve made similarly big progress on the NAFTA margins. The plan in place to further 2.6 to some margin expansion, given the comment that 2015, 2016 as seen as industry peak years. Could you maybe shed some light on what you assume for pricing at a market level and we\u2019ll say for FCA in NAFTA between today and 2018?", "Richard Palmer", "Well, I think the key for us is, we are not depending \u2013 we are not going to depend on pricing \u2013 price increases across the market. We expect the pricing to remain relatively benign and disciplined as it has been. We think that the saw is going to be strong. We\u2019ve been prudent about expectations around 2018 I think to be as really as to get possible in terms of sales. We don\u2019t expect any significant degradation in pricing. I think our pricing specifically, obviously we have some important vehicle launches in the next three years. The minivan being the first coming now. The new Wrangler which we mentioned earlier the new pickup and those will give us I think some pricing opportunity. But we aren\u2019t basing our performance through 2018 on unrealistic pricing expectations. ", "Sergio Marchionne", "One correction to the question that was asked on capacity utilization in EMEA, it\u2019s 85% in 2015 using harbor.", "George Galliers ", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Richard Palmer", "Thank you.", "Operator ", "Thank you. We will now move to Martino De Ambroggi of Equita. Please go ahead.", "Martino De Ambroggi ", "Thank you. Good afternoon and good morning everybody. The first question is on 2018 targets. Just wondering what are the CapEx implied in the guidance for 2017 and 2019? And, what is a rough indication of the R&D net capitalization effect and if possible so for 2015?", "Richard Palmer", "So, I think the positive thing is that we \u2013 as I said, we are going to be generating cash through the plan period and we don\u2019t expect any significant spikes in CapEx going forward. I think, therefore, we have some benefit of the changing cadence of the launches in Alfa which will help us. And so, I think there is going to be some changes, some increase in CapEx, maybe in 2017, 2018 compared to current runrate but nothing overly significant. I think a number up to \u20ac9.5 billion compared to the \u20ac8.5 billion to \u20ac9 billion, \u20ac9.5 billion to \u20ac10 billion will the maximum level on an annual basis. But we are \u2013 we will be working through this as we complete the plan and we don\u2019t expect to exceed significantly the level of CapEx we are guiding to for 2016. In terms of R&D capitalization, there is nothing significantly different going forward to what we\u2019ve seen in the past. ", "Martino De Ambroggi ", "Okay. If I may, short-term question regarding LATAM. You stated that you expect a positive EBIT this year and you are guiding for market between flat and minus 12%. So, just to understand the resilience of your business, are you able to confirm the positive EBIT maybe slightly positive even in the worst case scenario of market down double-digit and you are performing more or less in line?", "Richard Palmer", "Martino, the key to our performance in Latin America obviously is Brazil and the Pernambuco plant. So, we\u2019ve launched commercially, the Renegade is performing extremely well as we mentioned, we are top of the segment after five months of activity. I think, we are now launching the Toro, the Fiat pickup out of Pernambuco and then at the end of the year, well, in Q3, we will launching the second Jeep. So we\u2019ll have three vehicles in that plant by Q3 and really the key to our ability to make money in a market that could still be down is the success of the Pernambuco installation. The mix of fact of those units both because of that position in the market, the branding and the incentives package we have out of Pernambuco help those be very positive compared to our production out of the team. So, that is our focus and it gives us a reasonable basis for targeting a positive EBIT for the year. ", "Martino De Ambroggi ", "Okay. Thank you and just one more question. and I was anticipating that the EMEA improvement in terms of return on sales above 4% is essentially driven by mix effects, because I remember in Detroit when you presented the business plan, the 1%, 2% return on sale was already considered a very, very difficult target to be achieved.", "Sergio Marchionne", "Yes, when we talked about this in Detroit in May of 2014, we had a much more negative view of Europe and its development that we are currently seeing. So it\u2019s a combination of mix of volume, but volume does play a part. I think we are also encouraged by the results of our utilization of our plant into the production of the Renegade and the 500X and its export functions when the combination of this gives us a much better feel for the absorption rate of fixed cost with the region. ", "Martino De Ambroggi ", "Okay, despite the delay in Alfa Romeo?", "Sergio Marchionne", "Yes, notwithstanding the delay in Alfa Romeo, it doesn\u2019t matter. But it was much more important for us to launch a perfect product, to launch a product early and incomplete and the project is a complicated project. You will see it when the people start driving the car. So we will\u2026.", "Martino De Ambroggi ", "Okay. ", "Sergio Marchionne", "Thanks.", "Martino De Ambroggi ", "Thank you.", "Operator ", "Thank you. We will take the next question from Jose Asumendi of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ", "Jose Asumendi ", "Thanks very much. I just wanted to come back again to this North American margins in 2016 and just confirm, so Richard, you are guiding for a margin expansion in 2016 versus 2015 in North America, is that how we are reading it?", "Richard Palmer", "Yes.", "Jose Asumendi ", "And, Richard, just can you, just help me little bit so, volume obviously positive contribution, mix also positive, meaningful contribution in 2016?", "Richard Palmer", "Yes, marginally. ", "Jose Asumendi ", "Marginally. ", "Richard Palmer", "There is also a positive impact on materials, commodities, particularly in NAFTA and obviously the carryover of our pricing actions and the dealer discount actions we took in 2015 also. ", "Jose Asumendi ", "Right. So on raw material price action offsets the incremental labor costs, is that the original way of looking at it maybe?", "Richard Palmer", "Yes, we are offsetting all those labor costs basically with our material performance. ", "Jose Asumendi ", "Got you. And then, are there any productivity gains that you had planned last year with properly running, you have the ramp of the Pacifica, that\u2019s how meaningful is that in terms of earnings contribution in 2016? ", "Richard Palmer", "Well, I think really it\u2019s the volume impact of the minivan, because obviously we are going to have the plan up for the full year and obviously it depends on the success of the Pacifica, but the initial reactions have been extremely positive to the unveiling at the auto show. ", "Jose Asumendi ", "Okay and then, so we are \u2013 I am trying to \u2013 with this standard how pricing is going to be a meaningful positive contribution in 2016? And are we now in the latest stage of the cycle with no need to increase incentives to sell additional light trucks and SUVs, or I am getting wrong in terms of the cycle? ", "Richard Palmer", "No, as I said before, I don\u2019t think we are looking at any meaningful pricing impact being necessary for us to continue to improve our margins in NAFTA. I mean, we need to work on the mix impact as you said. We need to \u2013 really our product portfolio which we are doing, we need to work on the cost function and the efficiency in the manufacturing footprint as we mentioned earlier, which is also helped by this realignment of our capacity. So, all those aspects will allow us to continue to expand margins. ", "Jose Asumendi ", "And this is all based on IFRS and when are you moving to US GAAP?", "Richard Palmer", "This is based on IFRS is that what we are showing today. So I am not going to get \u2013 make it more complicated and try and tell you what it would look like in a different accounting system.", "Jose Asumendi ", "And when are you moving to US GAAP?", "Richard Palmer", "What we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve looked to that and at the moment we are not \u2013 I am not going to give you an exact date for moving to US GAAP because we are still considering the timing of that implementation.", "Sergio Marchionne", "But, we are going to look at this at the end of 2016, we know we\u2019ll need to go.", "Jose Asumendi ", "Thank you very much.", "Operator ", "Thank you. We will take the next question from Brian Jacoby of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Brian Jacoby ", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one regarding the ring-fencing. Is it accurate to assume that you have to refinance all the first-lien term loans at FCA US in order to get complete removal of the ring-fencing and should we interpret that the aim is to unify and bring all the debt up to the FCA parent company level and do it through that means, if you could clarify that that\u2019d be helpful. Thank you. ", "Sergio Marchionne", "We don\u2019t have to repay all the debt. I think we can get there without and I think you will be economically not advantageous to repay that today and refi. ", "Brian Jacoby ", "Would you need to get some type of concession related to the governance or you think\u2026", "Sergio Marchionne", "That\u2019s right.", "Brian Jacoby ", "Okay. All right. thank you very much. Appreciated. ", "Sergio Marchionne", "You are welcome.", "Richard Palmer", "Thanks, Brian. ", "Operator ", "Thank you. We will now move to Richard Hilgert of Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Richard Hilgert ", "Hi, thanks for taking my question this morning. I wanted to get a little bit more color around some of the guidance. If I take a look at the markets which you are calling for your updated 2018 plan, I look around, I see, relatively peak-ish NAFTA, maybe another slight decline in LATAM, possibly trough APAC, or peak depending on which markets you are looking at, EMEA, a nascent recovery, a richer product mix and kind of little bit confused on why the base guidance for net revenue would be \u20ac110 billion versus \u20ac111 billion excluding Ferrari in 2015. ", "Sergio Marchionne", "Richard, it\u2019s greater than \u20ac111 billion. It\u2019s a type of \u2013 if you said the \u20ac110 billion, the only thing we try to tell you that it\u2019s more than last year. ", "Richard Hilgert ", "Okay, and then is the adjusted EBIT and adjusted net profit guidance there being greater than those numbers that you\u2019ve got, is that a base off of \u20ac111 billion in revenue? Or is that based on a higher amount of revenue greater than \u20ac111 billion. It\u2019s whatever may for the number work and the revenues are in excess of \u20ac111 billion. ", "Sergio Marchionne", "The EBIT is going to be in excess of \u20ac5 billion. Those are the only kind of \u2013 and I made this comment when opened the conference today. But the fact that, it is better for us to give you directional views on the movement of the key metrics that impact this business as opposed to giving you granular targets that we are going to be chasing for the rest of the year. We are going to do better than \u20ac111 billion, we are going to do better \u20ac5 billion in operating profit in EBIT. ", "Richard Hilgert ", "All right. And congratulations on the third year in a row of having the diesel from the Ram in the Wards top 10 best engines list. ", "Sergio Marchionne", "Thank you.", "Richard Hilgert ", "Your plan for achieving the CO2 and the CAF\u00c9 standards, you\u2019ve talked mostly about electrification of the portfolio to get there. Given that you have this quality of an engine in the portfolio, would it be unreasonable to see more diesel in the portfolio or especially in North America or do you think Volkswagen is pretty much poisoned the well for that type of power trade in the United States?", "Sergio Marchionne", "No, actually I don\u2019t think that the well has been poisoned by anybody. But, I do think that there is, just the way in which the regulations worked is a point in time in which diesel and its present configuration becomes offensive to the fleet. And let\u2019s not discuss the timing of that inversion. Right now, diesel got positive to the fleet. I think between now and sometime in the next five years, it will become offensive and because of the changes in regulation and so at that point in time, I think we need to take a very hard look at diesel and find out whether it\u2019s worth keeping it in the structure. ", "Richard Hilgert ", "Okay, great. Thanks again for taking my question. ", "Operator ", "Thank you. We will take the next question from Christophe Boulanger of Barclays. Please go ahead. ", "Christophe Boulanger", "Yes, hi, good afternoon. I will ask a question on balance sheet management and specifically on your target of liquidity of \u20ac15 billion to \u20ac20 billion by the end of the plan. First I want to know whether you confirm this target and then secondly, will you be using the excess liquidity to repay this indebt and if so under what timing?", "Richard Palmer", "We confirm the target, Christophe, and yes, we will obviously, as we move forward here be using some of the cash as and when we think it\u2019s appropriate to reduce our gross debt levels. ", "Christophe Boulanger", "So, basically just to be clear, if we include the \u20ac2.5 billion of additional liquidity, you would get post removal of the ring-fencing, you are standing at \u20ac27 billion of liquidity, is it correct?", "Richard Palmer", "Correct.", "Christophe Boulanger", "And you target \u20ac15 billion to \u20ac20 billion?", "Richard Palmer", "Yes, we have more than enough cash to significantly reduce our debt levels in the next couple of years. ", "Christophe Boulanger", "Okay. Thank you.", "Richard Palmer", "Thank you.", "Operator ", "Thank you. We will take the next question from Monica Bosio of Banca IMI. Please go ahead.", "Monica Bosio", "Good afternoon everyone. I would have a question on the pricing outlook in APAC. As you mentioned at the \u2013 you told that APAC will have a too speed year in 2016. I am just wondering if you are still expecting a positive adjusted EBIT for the APAC contracted countries.", "Richard Palmer", "Yes, we are targeting to make money in APAC in 2016, but as I said there could be a ramp up as we go through the localization process being completed in the first half. ", "Monica Bosio", "Okay, so basically, do you expect a positive adjusted EBIT?", "Sergio Marchionne", "By the end of the year, yes.", "Monica Bosio", "Okay, at the end of the year, okay, thank you. And the second question is, I am just trying to figure out what could be the extraordinary figures for 2016? Do you expect further realignment in the capacity production or further one-off\u2026", "Sergio Marchionne", "Hopefully not. ", "Monica Bosio", "Okay, so we shouldn\u2019t project a similar number. ", "Sergio Marchionne", "I don\u2019t have any notion today of booking any one-offs, any\u2026", "Monica Bosio", "Okay, thank you very much. Thank you.", "Operator ", "Thank you. We will take the last question from Rodolphe Ranouil of RBS. Please go ahead.", "Rodolphe Ranouil", "Yes, good morning to you and thank you for that clear presentation. I just have one question regarding the plan delivery change, liquidity, cash flow generation, all of that is trending up very significantly in the next two to three years. Have you shared all of these with the rating agencies or have you basically given up?", "Sergio Marchionne", "Not that we share with you first and then we go hit them. What do you think?", "Richard Palmer", "I think that\u2019s probably a better course. We work obviously joking apart consistently with the rating agencies and we expect these, as we execute these numbers our rating to improve going forward, so, that\u2019s clearly a big focus for us.", "Rodolphe Ranouil", "Okay, thank you very much. ", "Richard Palmer", "Thank you. ", "Operator ", "Thank you. That will conclude the question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe Veltri for any additional or closing remarks.", "Joseph Veltri", "Thank you, Rhonda and we\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining the call today.

For your information, today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Joe Veltri, Head of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Global Investor Relations. Mr. Veltri, please go ahead, sir.", "Joseph Veltri - Vice President - Global Investor Relations", "Thank you, Hannah, and good day to everyone on today's call and webcast. The earnings release that we issued earlier today, along with the presentation material for this call and webcast are now available on FCA's Investor Relations website.", "As customary, today's call will be hosted by the group's Chief Executive, Sergio Marchionne, and Richard Palmer, the group's Chief Financial Officer. After introductory remarks, they will be available to answer your questions.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that any forward-looking statements we might make during today's call are subject to the risks and uncertainties mentioned in the Safe Harbor statement included on page 2 of today's presentation. As always, the call will be governed by this language.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard Palmer.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Thank you, Joe. Good morning, good afternoon to everybody. I'd like to start on page four of the deck with the highlights of the quarter. I would characterize it as a strong quarter for FCA. We had an adjusted EBIT margin for the quarter of 5.2%, nearly double our quarterly margin from a year ago.", "All our segments were profitable. Our NAFTA margins were up at 7.2%. Our EMEA margins were up four folds to nearly 2% and we had good indications from LATAM of margin improvement, following the continued ramp up of production from our Pernambuco facility. We're making good progress in this transition of Asia-Pacific to the localized production of Jeeps; so I think overall, from a margin point of view and a performance point of view, it was a good quarter.", "We did, during the quarter, a move the final parts of the FCA U.S. ring-fencing from a debt point of view, so by completing the term-loan B amendment and repaying a part of that term-loan B, we've removed all restrictions between the ex-Chrysler entities and the ex-Fiat entities regarding dividend distributions, short-term intercompany borrowing, et cetera.", "Following that, we saw a good indication from the rating agencies with Standard & Poor's giving us a one-notch upgrade to BB stable. And so, I think, on the balance sheet, we're seeing further progress in our simplification of the capital structure.", "During this year, we're looking at the 75th anniversary of the Jeep brand, which was founded in 1941 and which continues as FCA, to be a significant driver of our performance, and we're looking at an expansion to include the India market becoming, I think, the sixth country to be producing locally Jeep product. And finally on this page, given the solid financial performance in Q1, we are confirming the full-year guidance that we gave you last quarter.", "Moving to page five, some comments on some key products in the various regions; the Chrysler Pacifica production started at the end of February in NAFTA. The vehicle is a really innovative new vehicle for what used to be called the minivan segment. We're looking at the Pacifica as a very new reincarnation of that segment offering. It has unsurpassed fuel economy in the petrol engine and it will have a PHEV minivan version in the second half of the year. It's had a strong reception in the marketplace so far with the press and industry commentators and we're looking forward to seeing production ramp up in the second quarter.", "In China, we started production in the Guangzhou plant of our joint venture with GAC of the Jeep Renegade, it is the second locally produced Jeep in China for us through the JV. The commercial launch is scheduled for the second quarter. This Jeep will add to the Jeep Cherokee that we already launched locally. Jeep Cherokee sales reached 9,000 a month and they continue to grow. So, we're seeing a good reception for the first vehicle produced out of the JV with GAC for the Jeep brand. This is the third installation of the Renegade worldwide, the first one being in Italy, in Melfi, and the second one being in the Pernambuco plant in Brazil. So further globalization of the Jeep brand continuing.", "And then on the right hand side of the page, we started production in late February of the Maserati Levante; this is a very important product for the Maserati brand, going into the biggest luxury segment worldwide and will be available commercially in the second quarter.", "And finally, the Fiat Mobi in Brazil, out of our Betim plant in Brazil is an entrance into a part of the market where we haven't had an offering, a city car offering in the A/B segment, so to completing our coverage of that segment and a key vehicle going into the second quarter of the year as well.", "Moving on to page six, the financial summary. So, you can see shipments were in line with Q1 of last year at a group level with increases in EMEA, up 12%, and NAFTA up 3%, offsetting decreases in LATAM due to the continued depressed market conditions and a decrease in Asia-Pacific in terms of consolidated shipments due to the transition to the joint venture of the Jeep production.", "The revenues as a result were up 4%, so slightly better than shipments really driven by mix in NAFTA, lower passenger car mix, more Jeep, more Ram mix; and Latin America with the ramp up of Pernambuco.", "Adjusted EBIT as a result improved to nearly \u20ac1.4 billion, double the last year's level and with margins of 5.2%. This drove our adjusted net profit up to \u20ac528 million with the strong operating performance offsetting a slight increase of the net charges between taxes and financial charges due to the higher NAFTA earnings.", "Net industrial debt was up to \u20ac 6.6 billion from \u20ac5 billion at year-end. There were two important drivers of that, one being FX translation, the details of which you'll see later and also working capital seasonality, which was exacerbated by the shutdown of our Toluca plant, downtime in our Toluca plant in NAFTA for retooling for the new Jeep, which will be produced in the second half of the year out of there.", "Available liquidity, we're still very strong at over \u20ac24 billion, in line with year-end. With the second tranche of our \u20ac5 billion revolver becoming available following the removal of the ring-fencing and also the \u20ac1.25 billion bond issuance we had in the quarter, offsetting the operational seasonality and the $2 billion term-loan B partial prepayment that we made as we amended the term-loan B.", "Moving to page seven, those are segment contribution to the year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBIT. You can see NAFTA, the doubling of NAFTA margins was the key driver of the improvement in our performance, but also positive performance from Latin America with the Pernambuco vehicle volumes ramping up.", "Asia-Pacific showed a negative variance in the quarter, although positive in absolute terms due to the transition of Jeep to the localized productions I mentioned earlier; and our EMEA margins' up to nearly 2% for the quarter from 0.5% last year.", "Moving to page eight, look at the variances in our net industrial debt, the \u20ac1.5 billion increase in the quarter was driven for \u20ac400 million by FX translation, the strengthening of the Brazilian real on our net debt position in Brazil and the weakening of the U.S. dollar with our net cash position in the U.S. driving that translation change. And the second big negative impact was working capital, which is a seasonal effect which was exacerbated by planned downtime in NAFTA for the Toluca plant, which is preparing for the launch of the new Jeep in the second half of the year. It was also impacted by lower volumes of Chrysler 200 as we balance supply and demand for that vehicle coming out of our shut plant.", "On the positive side, we saw \u20ac2.8 billion of EBITDA, up nearly $800 million and showing good growth in the operating cash performance. Also with working capital slightly down year-over-year, driven by reduced investments in Brazil as we complete the Pernambuco installation.", "Moving to page nine, the NAFTA segment. Group sales in the region were up 8% on the back of improved market share from 12.4% to 12.9%. We continue to be the market leader in Canada. Our U.S. share was up 70 basis points, driven by Jeep being up 17%. Our shipments overall were up 3%, driven by Ram and Jeep offsetting lower shipments of Chrysler 200 and Dart and Journey and Fiat 500 because of the Toluca downtime.", "So, if you look at our adjusted EBIT walk at the bottom of the page, you can see all of the levers contributing positively to the improved margin. Mix was an important part of the improved margin, because of the increased Jeep and Ram volumes. And also, we had some good industrial efficiencies on the purchasing area and non-repeat of some campaign costs we did have in Q1 of 2015, driving \u20ac117 million net positive on the industrial costs. So, overall 7.2% margin for the quarter showing a significant improvement from the 3.7% last time.", "Moving to the LATAM performance on the subsequent page; the industry in LATAM was down 18% with Brazil down 28%. Our group sales were down more than that as we continue to protect our margin performance in Brazil, in particular. We continue to be market leader in Brazil, 180 basis points ahead of our nearest competitor with a share of 18.1%. And the Jeep Renegade and the new Fiat Toro pick up out of the Pernambuco installation showed strong performance in their respective segments at 27% and 59% share.", "Shipments overall were 102,000 vehicles, and about 25% of that came out of Pernambuco, which is an important part of the improvement in our profitability. As you can see below, we have positive mix of settings the negative volume and we have some strong performance in the cost area from purchasing and manufacturing efficiencies.", "Our SG&A was down last year in Q1, we were launching the Renegade, there was some timing on sales and marketing expenses helping also in the quarter. But overall, I think, given the market backdrop, positive results in Latin America with the ramp up of Pernambuco underway was a good performance.", "Asia-Pacific on the next page; it's a little complicated to read year-over-year because of the continued transition from the import model to the local production in China of the Jeep, as we mentioned earlier. So, if you look at our sales performance, we were down 10% year-over-year, principally driven by Australia which was down 50% as we take price actions to offset the weakening of the Australian dollar.", "However, sales performance in China was basically flat year-over-year, showing good performance out of the new Cherokee local production, which was running at about 9,000 units of sales per month in March and a 17% year-over-year improvement in Jeep sales overall in the Chinese market.", "If we look at shipments, they're down from 47,000 to 25,000, if we include shipments coming out of the JVs in the two periods; in reality, those shipments would be down from 56,000 to 53,000, so the actual drop is nothing like as significant; as I said, this is the switch to the local production being reflected in the financial statement.", "So, if you look at the adjusted EBIT work below, you can see volume and mix was negative and SG&A was positive, in large part those numbers are influenced by the switch to the local production, as I mentioned earlier in the JV. And you can see the JV performance improving in the other column where we're starting to see an improvement in profitability locally.", "So, overall, I think, we'll continue to see some continued transition in Q2, as we get into the second half of the year with a more stable model based on local production in China. One other impact on the mix was we continued to sell off some of the vehicles damaged in the Tianjin port explosion in Q4, so that also impacted the mix negatively in this quarter. We will have a similar impact in Q2, but then we will have completed the sell-out of those vehicles.", "Moving to EMEA; strong performance by EMEA; in terms of sales, up 10%; with the industry, up 8% for passenger car; and our sales up 16% for passenger car. Market share was up 50 basis points with growth in all major markets except for Germany. LCV volumes were up 9% and our share was slightly down, but shipments continue to be strong also in LCV.", "So if we look at profitability, we went from a 0.5% margin to 1.9% margin, driven by volumes in Renegade, Fiat 500X and the new Fiat Tipo. We also saw strong performance in terms of purchasing efficiencies and manufacturing in the industrial costs, then driving margins' up to nearly \u20ac100 million of EBIT for the quarter.", "Moving to page 13, we have Maserati performance. Maserati showed shipments were down 14%. We continue to complete the rebalancing of stock, particularly in North America and Europe. This will be completed through Q2 to be ready for model year launches in early Q3, and also the higher volume of Levante coming out of the Italian plant, so I think we continue to be positive about Maserati in the second half of the year as we launch the new vehicle commercially.", "Moving on to components on page 14. Overall revenues were down, driven by Comau and Teksid whereas Marelli's volumes were up. The EBIT was up 26% with margins up to 3.7% and Marelli was showing positive commercial performance with orders up 17% year-over-year for the quarter.", "Moving to page 15; our industry outlook. We aren't changing our industry outlook at this stage for the full-year. Obviously, a little bit of color on each region.", "NAFTA, I think we saw a relatively strong Q1 better than last year, for the U.S., 17.5 million SAAR compared to 17.1 million SAAR last time and we're not changing our forecast overall for NAFTA. Asia-Pacific, the industry is in line with our expectations. Latin America, we're not changing our forecast, although the first quarter would indicate the low end of the range here at 3.6 million SAAR driven by Brazil, which was running at about a two million SAAR for the first quarter. Clearly, we need to continue to watch Brazil with the political changes that are underway there and keep an eye on the market for the rest of the year; but for the minute, we're not changing our forecast. EMEA, on the contrary, we saw a SAAR which is at the high end of its range for the first quarter. Again, we're not changing the forecast, but I think European market is showing some good signs for the rest of the year.", "Then moving to the last page in terms of guidance. Our guidance is confirmed with net revenues above \u20ac110 billion; adjusted EBIT above \u20ac5 billion; net profit above \u20ac1.9 billion; and our net industrial debt below \u20ac5 billion. As per our initial guidance, NAFTA and EMEA profitability improvement continues to be key to the numbers we're guiding to.", "Latin America, APAC and Maserati, for various reasons we've already touched upon, will show more profitability in the second-half than in the first. Our net industrial debt we are confirming. Despite the negative translation impact on FX in Q1, I think the working capital seasonality will reverse in the second quarter, and we'll see strong generation through the rest of the year to get to our net industrial debt target.", "I think it's important, over the next couple of years we will have some volatility in working capital beyond normal because of the production realignment that we discussed in the NAFTA facilities, but we only expect that to impact our guidance for the full-year 2016.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Thanks, Richard. I just want to make a couple of comments before we open it up to Q&A. You may have seen from a flurry of announcements that we've made in terms of the start of productions of various cars around the world that the rollout of Jeep on a global basis continues at a pretty rapid pace.", "We were down in China last week opening the second Jeep plant in China in Guangzhou; we'll start production of the Renegade there sometime during the month of May on a full-blast basis. We are now running the plant in Changsha, which makes Fiat, but also makes the Cherokee, and we're running at about well above initial rates. And we expect to sell probably in excess of 100,000 cars there this year.", "Just with that vehicle. The Pernambuco plant in Latin America is gearing up to produce the C-segment Jeep, and we're also tuning up and running first pilots out of our plant in Mexico now to launch the successor for the Compass and the Patriot, which will be in market in the U.S. in the early part of 2017.", "The Maserati plans are beginning to come together. We have seen the start of production of the Maserati Levante, which will make its debut here in the U.S., which is expected to be its largest market probably within Q3 of this year. Equally important has been, finally the launch of the Giulia into production for Alfa, so we're beginning now to get all the powertrain combinations in order throughout the second quarter and the third quarter as we prepare to launch the SUV on the Alfa platform which hopefully will go into production at the end of 2016.", "We have been incredibly busy as we've announced earlier to put in place the realignment of the footprint in NAFTA. We have had, obviously, intense dialogs with our counterparts at UAW about the implications on head count, I confirm now as I have done to them that the realignment of the footprint in NAFTA is actually going to yield an increase in manpower subject to temporary layoffs as we disengage from the local production of the Chrysler 200 and the Dodge Dart.", "We have, as Richard mentioned, other concerns that we have about the continuing political situation in Brazil, which hopefully will get resolved sometime by the summer of this year. We see nothing negative on the horizon, we have \u2013 most of our plans are being actioned as we had forecast, the outlook for the year continues to be strong.", "I think we remain committed as we announced at the beginning of this year to \u2013 the reduction on a yearly basis at the end of 2016, 2017; and hopefully we'll be sitting on cash by 2018. So, we have absolutely no indication of the fact that the 2018 targets are unachievable, I think we continue to execute with a very clear view of making those numbers.", "We find the results of the NAFTA encouraging, we'll see a progressive improvement in margin generation of NAFTA as we de-emphasize the passenger car side and start rebuilding our position and with the American plants in both SUVs and Ram.", "So on that note, I think we'll give it to Joe to take the questions. Thanks.", "Joseph Veltri - Vice President - Global Investor Relations", "Thank you, Sergio and Richard. Hannah, I think we are now ready to start the Q&A session please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly, sir. Thank you. We will take our first question from Adam Jonas, please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. And good afternoon everyone, this is Neel Mehta standing in for Adam Jonas today. Two questions; first we continue to see strong results in your component businesses, particularly Magneti Marelli where the order intake is up 17% year-over-year it looks like, are we at a point yet where these businesses could be sustainable on a standalone basis?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "One, they've always been sustainable on a standalone basis. Secondly, I think that the question as to the relevance of Magneti Marelli in the context of our strategic development is something that we have on the table on a continuous basis, we are and we continue to rely on Marelli now to provide a lot of technical support in terms of the development of our portfolio.", "As I indicated in previous occasions, I think there is a point in time at which, I think Marelli will be sufficiently strong; and I think FCA will be at a point where it no longer needs to rely on \u2013 or an internal supplier or the quality of Marelli, I don't think we're there yet.", "And so we continue to nurture that business. I think it's in good shape, I think Pietro has done a tremendous job of realigning that business in the last six months. I think we expect a significant improvement in margin generation at that point in time, I think we'll be in a position to take a hard look at this to find out whether it makes sense to continue Marelli in the portfolio. But we're far removed from that today.", "Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And secondly, Sergio, you made some clear efforts to engage leadership of some of your OEM peers to address the structural challenges the industry faces and how some of these challenges could be better surmounted through consolidation or collaboration efforts.", "From the outside, at least, it seems like these efforts are not really gathering momentum; but from your perspective, are your invitations into this conversation being dismissed outright, bluntly and without consideration, or and without identifying specific names, have at least some of your efforts helped establish an open dialog or have created on some level an increased awareness or thoughtful and continuing conversation with your peers in any way?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Without telling you anything which I consider to be confidential, notwithstanding the lack of visible progress on that topic, I think it would be unfair to characterize the reactions to the pitch of capital junk as being unproductive. I think there has been some dialog with people who share the view and who are not as concerned about the sort of the downside risk of the exercise. I think we need to give it more time.", "I've been clear on the issue that in the absence of somebody immediately embracing the concept that it would take time to sort of develop our relationship and make people feel comfortable with the notion, I'm not in a position to say whether this thing is going to yield anything of value going forward or not.", "The only thing I can tell you is that, it has been worth the effort. I would do it again. But, I think equally important, in addition to sort of looking and identifying for people who share your view. I think it was important for us to go through that exercise as a means of identifying the issues, which I think are endemic to this industry. I think the catharsis has been a very good exercise for all of us.", "Certainly on the inside of the house, it's made our views relatively clear about what we can and cannot do. I think that this realignment of the NAFTA portfolio, to be perfectly honest, was a direct consequence of the fact that we started focusing on the relevant portion of our activities and sort of abandoned the notion of being able to withstand mediocre performance of some segments, simply because of the fact that it was due to a higher calling of being an auto maker.", "And I think we have all learned, I think, inside the house at senior leadership level and working our way down the structure, as to the importance of capital usage and I think that discipline is going to benefit all of us going forward.", "Having said this, I've remained hopeful that over a relatively reasonable period of time that, this industry will come to risk with this issue and tackle them intelligently. I think we laid out a roadmap for that to happen. I remain hopeful that somebody will pick it up with us and get it done.", "Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Maybe just kind of a follow-up to that question in the context of the changeover in your capacity in North America, more trucks than crossovers. Just wondering, if you can comment where you are in that process? Have you identified all the opportunities? It sounds like the Dart and Chrysler 200 are out of your facilities. What could go in to replace those and if there's more to come down the line?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Look, the realignment of the NAFTA manufacturing footprint was driven by two conditions and so we ran the optimization exercise with a very clear view of not losing one unit of sales in Ram and not losing one unit of sales in Jeep.", "I think it would have been inconceivable and when we ran the numbers to accept a solution that would have accepted a downtime in any of the lines that are involved in the production of other Jeep or a Ram product.", "And so, what is going around now in all the facilities is effectively a tooling up, and I'll give you a perfect example. The Warren Truck Plant, which is probably \u2013 historically one of the oldest plants that we have within the fold of the old Chrysler now FCA, is a plant that would have had to go through incredible surgery in order for it to be able to accept a new Ram truck, which is coming out at the beginning of 2018.", "And we could not have lost any of the production that was associated with Ram out of the plant until the new truck came on, because it would have had disastrous consequences. So, the realignment of the Sterling Heights plant to accept the new Ram and effectively starting looking at Warren as an alternative site to expand production of Jeep products, especially in view of our commitment to the development of Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer going forward has allowed to effectively relay out the whole manufacturing footprint, but not losing one unit and align for the concurrent production of some of the products that are coming in and some of the ones that are coming out.", "So, I feel pretty good about what we've done. It's painful and there's a lot of intense activity going on in the U.S. now, but we will see the whole U.S. manufacturing footprint fully-loaded by the early part of 2018. So, I think the next 18 months are crucial, but I think all the work is underway now.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just to follow-up on that. Would that include a net increase in capacity for you or a change in net increase in sort of the bricks-and-mortar capacity? Just trying to understand...", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I think if you count a truck on an equivalent basis to a Chrysler 200 then I think there's been no increase in capacity.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "(35:02).", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "As a matter of fact, there's a net reduction, if you look at the potential unexpressed volumes of both the Dodge Dart and the Chrysler 200.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Very helpful. Just on CapEx, I mean the run rate in the first quarter seemed a little bit light; you're talking about flat year-over-year, which seems a little bit more restrained than maybe some of your comments in the past. I mean is there a capital efficiency that is coming in here that might be continued as we go out into 2017 and 2018, which might help cash flow a lot more?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I think the comments that I made earlier about the capital efficiency and our desire to keep CapEx under control is going to be visible throughout 2016, 2017 and 2018. I think we have sort of re-dimensioned our expectations. We're beginning to see the benefit of this and I don't think we're in a position to change guidance for 2016 now.", "I think we'll give you a better view of 2017 next year, but we'll have to wait until the end of the year. I do think that because of what we have done, we have re-dimensioned capital. I think we'll have to see what happens going forward, but we do have lower ambitions than we've had when we started the plant back in 2014.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just lastly, on ad spending, I mean, that was cited as a positive in the quarter. I mean, how much is that per vehicle? Is that \u2013 could be as much as a couple of hundred bucks easily per vehicle if you get more constraint there? And then also, is this pull back just a recognition that the brands are becoming better recognized and you don't need to push them quite as hard or kind of what's going on there?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I think we're being incredibly selective about where we're pumping our money on the advertising side. I think we went through an inordinate effort in the first seven years of our lives to try and get credibility back into the marketplace. And I think advertising was a tool that was used extensively and effectively I think between 2009 and now. I don't think we need to over-commit as we have done in the past, but I think you'll see more discipline coming through.", "I also think it's a question of effectiveness and product launches. We haven't put a lot of money behind the Pacific, although it's gone into production. It will receive a lot of attention in May and June as the minivan season starts. And I think we'll see it, sort of, the advertising spend will match product introduction which is pretty intense over the next 2.5 years, but we are going to become more parsimonious when it comes to their saying \u2013 we don't need to be spraying the world with advertising. I think we've made enough noise out there. People know who we are.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And really, just the last question here. I mean, retail sales in NAFTA, up 8% in the quarter, very impressive and there's a lot of concern out there amongst dealers and a lot of industry partners that retail sales are slowing and fleet is being pumped. I mean, what's your take on your ability to keep this retail sales number up and what do you think is going on in general competitive environment on retail sales?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Yeah. Just to be clear, I think the people pumping fleet sales, I think one of the opportunities that we have in managing our production cycle is to effectively choose when we deliver fleet vehicles to our customers. And I think we choose it based on what we make, what we expect the retail market to yield in a particular month and everybody knows that January and February are historically not exceptional months in the U.S. market, so I don't look at sort of the relevance of fleet as being an anomalous condition. In the early part of this year, it's been normal.", "The question about whether we think that the market is getting sticky, there's no doubt in my mind that the market has gotten tougher 2015 to 2016. I mean it is getting much more competitive than it's been. But as Richard mentioned in his comments about the forecast for the year, we don't expect the market to collapse or to go a substantial shrink, but it is competitive. It is relatively healthy in the areas in which we function well.", "So Jeep and Ram, I think, have done relatively well, it's gotten a lot stickier. On the passenger car side, I think, the call that we made to exit those business as a producer in the United States in hindsight was probably one of the best calls we've made.", "Unfortunately, that evidence was not available to us back in 2009 and 2010. Had we known this, I think, we would have refrained from the investment cycle that we went through, but I also think that that has been now has become a permanent change in the landscape in the United States. I think you'll see a lot more UVs of a variety of calibers occupying what has historically been a passenger car market. And so in that part of the market it's gotten stickier. As we exit, I think, we'll notice that less, but it is a price-sensitive market, and we need to watch it.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Martino De Ambroggi from Equita. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Thank you. Good morning. Good afternoon, everybody. One more question on the NAFTA region. Actually, a, if the 8% and 9% rate of margins(40:31) for the current year is approachable by year-end just based on the positive results in Q1? And b, since the U.S. market trend remains one of the major concern, what's the sensitivity, just a rule of thumb in case of volume decline maybe not this year, but next year when you will be maybe not 100% the production realignment will be finalized. But just to have an idea what could be the sensitivity to volumes, taking into account all the possible actions you may take?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "In terms of margin for NAFTA for the year, I think the first quarter, there's been a very positive performance. I don't want to give you a target for the full-year. I think last year, we came out at 7% as we had forecast. I think we're going to continue to push very hard, and I think a 7.2% margin in Q1 is a good start to the year, we'll keep you updated as to where we think we'll finish the year I think in the next couple of quarters.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Yeah. Just to help Richard on the analysis is, as the relevance of passenger car decreases in the U.S., so does profitability. I mean they're totally connected.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "And to that point in 2017, I think as Mr. Marchionne said, the whole purpose of the realignment is to not lose any production of Jeeps and Rams. So, in 2017, I don't think we're going to have a significant impact in terms of profitability as a result of the realignment of the production footprint.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "The thing that you've got to keep in mind, I'm acting as an assistant here to Richard, but one of the things that we've always faced in the United States in the production of Jeeps is to make this unfortunate Sophie's Choice about whether we sell in the U.S. or whether we sell overseas.", "And I think when you look at Wrangler, you look at Grand Cherokee production, even in the case of the Compass and the Patriot, we have always been faced, and certainly in the last probably three or four years, especially we've been forced to make choices about which markets get allocated product. Even if there were to be a contraction of the U.S. market is, in our view that there's unexplored potential in terms of outside U.S. markets, especially where we have not established local production.", "So, anything which relates to either a Cherokee or a Grand Cherokee and eventually a Wagoneer or a Wrangler will have additional means of expression in international market, and all the work that we're doing now in terms of establishing networks both in Europe and in Latin America, now with the introduction of the Renegade following the launch of the Cherokee in China.", "All of these will become relevant markets for U.S. based production. So, I am relatively confident, even if there were to be a contraction of volumes in NAFTA, that we'll be able to compensate for that loss by continuing to fuel the international expansion of Jeep at the upper end of the spectrum.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay. Thank you. So, maybe one more question on EMEA. After many quarters in a row of positive price effect in Q1, it was slightly negative, is this compromising the achievement of what I believe is up 3%, the rate of line sales (44:22) or is it just business as usual?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "It's business as usual, I think, we're not compromising our targets from there. I think the 2% margin \u2013 1.9% margin is testament to the fact that business is being managed with those margin targets in mind.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay. Thank you.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Thomas Besson from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, sir.", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux SA", "Thank you very much. It's Thomas from Kepler Cheuvreux. I have a few questions please. Firstly, can we come back on the U.S. passenger car off-take strategy and on the potential partnership you have been eluding to. And can you as well mention whether potential compensation to your suppliers of your passenger car range have been addressed in your Q4 production provisions, or whether these are still negotiated? That is the first question.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Yeah. So, we've basically booked most of the impact of any issues we see going forward. Obviously, we have a significant amount of product change in NAFTA. So, I think, we envisage being able to mitigate most of any potential claims we may be getting from the supply base. In terms of \u2013 sorry the other part of your question...", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux SA", "Was on the off-take strategy.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Sorry, the what?", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux SA", "Off-take strategy. Having other automakers build from the passenger cars you're no longer making?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Yeah. As we said before, I think we're open to looking at that with other OEMs. I'm not in a position to comment on anything specific at this stage, but clearly that is an area where we would see benefits that could accrue to any parties who were interested in having some collaboration in that segment of the market.", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux SA", "Okay. Coming back to the net debt walk. You've mentioned in your comments that a large portion of the working capital would reverse in the second quarter, would this indicate that you believe we should be closer to \u20ac5 billion net debt at the interim stage or are you looking too match for the second quarter?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I think we're going to be below \u20ac5 billion by the end of the year.", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux SA", "Okay. But again \u2013 at the interim stage you're not willing to indicate anything about the working capital development?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "No, other than the fact that it should be lower than it is now.", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux SA", "Okay. Great. Last question for me, please. The year-on-year margins at this year have clearly increased, you seem to be happy with 3% potential upside, if you want (47:31) to get higher months for you when we look at some of your competitors, namely some of the French it seems that margins have improved a lot more than that, given your vehicle mix improvement. Could you overshoot in the region or is that not something we could look for?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Listen, I'm willing to learn with humility and I've been watching the results of our French competitors with attention and admiration and I will try to do my best to emulate them and beat them.", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux SA", "That's wonderful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Massimo Vecchio from Mediobanca. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Massimo Vecchio - Mediobanca Banca di Credito Finanziario SpA (Broker)", "Good afternoon. I would like to have an update on the regulatory risk in view of the increasing provision that you took last year in the third quarter. We heard about the (48:28) the Daimler issue, and the German transformation. Can you give an update on what you think is the current scenario in the context of your provisions? That's my first question.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Well, I was looking over at Richard just to make sure that you and I could sleep nights, but I think we're adequately provisioned notwithstanding what you see.", "A couple of general comments about the regulatory environment and then we're not getting into details. I think we have been incredibly clear over the last number of quarters about the fact that the regulatory environment has become a lot more stringent and I think that the requirements in positions that are being made and I think reasonably so on auto makers are going to increase the cost of doing business for all of us.", "And it's something that we need to understand. I think we need to understand even in terms of the accrual rates with which we are provisioning for eventual remediation cost, whether it be warranty or recalls or otherwise on any unit that we sell.", "I think it is clear that we understand the U.S. environment relatively well, now having lived through for a number of quarters, through the type of expectations and having achieved, I think, a meeting of the minds with the administrator and then staff and it's about what is expected going forward. And I think we're beginning to tool ourselves and tool the organization to deal with that environment and adequately answer any safety concerns that a regulator of the marketplace might have.", "On the European side, I had a chance to go through the report that was issued last Friday by the Commission that was presented by the Ministry of Transport in Germany. It is available now in English for anybody who's interested in it.", "I think it makes for a very interesting reading. I cannot disagree with the Minister, because I think he has pointed out, there is a result of the work that was carried out by the Commission, by the KBA and the Ministry itself. Given the way, in which European rules are set up and the way in which homologation authority is subject to devolution under the European arrangement that it is \u2013 there needs to be much better coordination across the national bodies about what it is that has effectively allowed as relevant technology in order to meet an emission standard.", "There's a phenomenal level of confusion out there about the degrees of freedom that are associated in the interpretation of that rule, what constitutes effectively a sound technical reason for the application or the suspension of emission controls in a particular vehicle, because of the fact that there are very strong technical arguments that would suggest for the protection of the engine a number of \u2013 a variety of responses are capable of being introduced as part of the software solution that runs these vehicles. I understand all this.", "But in the absence of very clear rules about what those requirements are and how exceptions to those rules as we have in the United States, where there's a continuous dialog with both EPA and CARB about what is allowed as an exception to the general, zero exception application of the rules.", "Until those European rules are crafted and agreed amongst the homologation bodies, I think it's going to be very, very difficult. And I think a lot of people are looking for sensational answers coming out of this environment, and unfortunately that is not the case. I think that we set up a set of rules that required compliance given a particular cycle. People, I think, have done their best; that we have done our best to meet those standards over time, fully understanding that there were technical limitations associated with our powertrains that we use, and that because of those technical limitations that the rule itself allowed for relief.", "By the way, as changes the philosophy or changes in terms of expectations, it's something that needs to be tabled, and I think the industry, I, for one, would be more than willing to work with the KBA, the Ministry of Transport or any other homologator to try and get this issue off the table, and get a proper response we find socially satisfactory to everybody.", "And so, we have started \u2013 now it's been a while \u2013 we continue to \u2013 we have started having a dialog with the homologating body in Italy, which is fundamentally the one with which we interface. There's meetings even going on today between us and the Ministry in Rome that are dealing with this issue.", "All these matters are matters that need to be tabled around, which Europe needs to find consensus because the rules are poorly structured. They may have been directionally correct, I think, from an implementation standpoint they were weak..", "And so, we're willing to work with the KBA; we're willing to work with the Ministry, not only Italian Ministry, but the German Ministry, to try and find a solution to all this going forward. But it is an area which is influx, it's in transition and I think we need to play our role in providing clarity, I'm more than willing to offer FCA as a willing partner to get that done, but there's no doubt that a solution is required.", "Massimo Vecchio - Mediobanca Banca di Credito Finanziario SpA (Broker)", "Generally speaking, out of 100 recalls in how many cases you can charge back your suppliers? And how many cases, it's a matter that you deal by yourself. Is it a reasonable way to look at this issue or it's only on the carmaker?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "No, it is a mixed bag and I don't have a percentage, because it depends on two things; one, whether there's been sort of fault or a quality issue in providing the part and it did not meet standard that we expect, whether it was their design and effectively they provided a solution which proved out to be unsatisfactory; whether it was our design, they complied and then we found that our own design was effective.", "So, the answer is on a case-by-case basis, we continue to work with our suppliers, I think there's a good understanding in a majority of cases \u2013 the great majority of cases, as to whose responsibility it is, but I don't have a hard and fast rule to help you with.", "Massimo Vecchio - Mediobanca Banca di Credito Finanziario SpA (Broker)", "Okay. Last question if I may on the ring-fencing, you have \u20ac18 billion of cash and cash equivalent on the balance sheet, which speed can we expect this to decline over the course of 2016?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Richard will give you a rate. Richard and I debate this topic at length, he's going too slow, I want him to drop the cash number as fast as he can, it's the most unproductive use of cash I've seen in my life.", "Unless you were the ECB but \u2013 for FCA, I think it's a staggering amount of cash that's lying around I think we need to take advantage at the speed of light, but I think he's already given indications as to what that number will be by the end of the year, you know.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Yeah. I think we have some bond maturities, and I think we're more than likely to reimburse those with cash from the balance sheet. On the other side, obviously we're going to generate cash through the rest of the year, but I think a number from the \u20ac18.4 billion we have on the balance sheet at the end of March, a number of around \u20ac17 billion would be a reasonable number at the end of the year.", "As we've talked about before going forward, our target is to get down to around \u20ac15 billion of cash, \u20ac5 billion rollover towards the end of our planned period, so that's where we're headed. But at the moment, I think around \u20ac17 million of cash on the balance sheet \u2013 \u20ac17 billion sorry of cash on the balance sheet here makes sense.", "Massimo Vecchio - Mediobanca Banca di Credito Finanziario SpA (Broker)", "Thank you very much.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Monica Bosio from Intesa Sanpaolo-Banca IMI. Please go ahead.", "Monica Bosio - Banca IMI Intesa Sanpaolo", "Good afternoon, everyone and good morning. I will just ask three questions. The first is on LATAM. I remember, but maybe I'm wrong, I remember that during the previous conference call, LATAM was expected to come back to be profitable by the end of the year. Now it seems that in the first quarter, it's already a little bit profitable, so are you more optimistic, can you give us a guidance on what you're expecting for the next quarter for LATAM?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Ms. Bosio, let me give you an answer for the Latin American issue, I think all of us would love to have a better answer on Brazil; a lot of it depends on the political resolution of the impasse that Brazil is experiencing right now. I think until the question of leadership gets resolved, I think it would be very improper for us to try and make prognostications about the Brazilian market. I think we will know, hopefully by the end of the third quarter.", "Monica Bosio - Banca IMI Intesa Sanpaolo", "Okay. Thank you very much. And the second question is, you have partially answered to this question, is about the competitive environment in NAFTA for Jeep and Ram, how are you feeling on the pricing discipline?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "As competitive as the market is I think we have noticed a relatively decent amount of price discipline on both the pickups and the UV side. I think they're the ones that are the least prone to competitive pricing, or excessive competitive pricing.", "I think we have seen a lot of competitive pricing on the passenger car side. I mean that's the one that to me is \u2013 I hate to say that we were right in predicting the shrinkage, but there's no doubt that there's an oversupply of nameplates and of willing players into that marketplace, which is driving pricing to levels that we would have found unacceptable in the medium-term to long-term.", "Monica Bosio - Banca IMI Intesa Sanpaolo", "Okay. And the very last question. First comeback on the issue of recalling cars, yesterday there was the news of 1.1 million recalled cars to modify the parking brake system. I know it's very difficult, but is there a way to quantify a potential impact only for this?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I think that I'm going to give you the answer but \u2013 hopefully, Mr. Palmer will give you, these things have been provisioned as part of a broader view as to where these costs will be.", "Just to clear up the issue on this 1.1 million recall, we're talking about a software re-flash of vehicles, we're not doing any physical changes to the vehicle, we're doing a software re-flash to allow for particular conditions. If you open the door of the vehicle for the car to go automatically in park.", "I grew up in North America and I get perfectly honest, I tell you I don't ever remember a planetary transmission that automatically switch into park if you open the door. And as a matter of fact when I was much, much younger \u2013 one of the things that I used to have to do is to open the door to back up the car, because I couldn't see anything from a very cheap car that I used to drive when I was a young man. So, I find it almost unbelievable that we're now forcing this transmission to go into park when the door is opened. I mean it's...", "Monica Bosio - Banca IMI Intesa Sanpaolo", "Okay.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "...the rules of engagement, we will comply and life will go on.", "Monica Bosio - Banca IMI Intesa Sanpaolo", "Okay. Thank you very much. Very clear.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Alberto Villa from Intermonte. Please go ahead.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Hi. Good afternoon and good morning. The first one is on Alfa Romeo, given the different view you have gotten on the NAFTA market demand skew towards SUV and so on...", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "No, but it doesn't impact on premium vehicles, and Alfa has always intended...", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Right.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "...to go into the U.S. as a premium vehicle. And by the way just to give you some encouragement, my having spent a few days in China in the last couple of weeks has made me a lot more confident about the introduction of Alfa into that market, I think we will do well, I think it will happen certainly within the planned period that we're talking about.", "And I think a lot of the concerns that existed about the depth of the Chinese market have been overplayed. I think that Alfa does have a place in that market; I think we will be building cars for that market at the beginning of 2017 and I think it will do well. I am not concerned about the competitiveness of the U.S. market as it applies to Alfa, that's a different animal altogether.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Okay. Thank you. That's very clear. Second one on Jeep; is it possible to have an order of magnitude of the impact of Jeep to your revenues and operating profit in the first quarter?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "No.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "And you will never give indications specifically for a brand in the future, right?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "You've answered your own question. You're very good at it.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Okay. The third one is back on consolidation. Apart from the traditional mass market and carmakers, there is a lot of discussion about tech players entering the market and potential discussions with you and other players, can you give us a view on that from your side and what is your potential visibility on that?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Look, our view has historically been, that we need to keep a very open mind. We cannot be selective in terms of or exclusive in terms of the arrangements that we make with some of these potential partners. And I think dialog continues with people who are interested in exploring their relevance in the automotive world and we will continue to help them try and find the way out and time will tell. I think that we need time to find out whether some of these arrangements are commercially relevant to FCA; but hopefully, we'll have something to say within 2016 on that matter publicly. I can't say anything up to now. I mean, it's just whatever is going on is confidential in nature.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Right. But not even, in terms of understanding what's the sense of an agreement?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I think we'll have to wait.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "All right. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Patrick Hummel from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Hummel - UBS AG (Broker)", "Yeah. Thanks, good afternoon, everyone, good morning. Two questions left for me please. First one is regarding your EBIT guidance for the full-year, you've left it unchanged at least \u20ac5 billion. Looking at the Q1 run rate, it seems you are more than just well on track to achieve that target. And I would assume that in Europe and in Asia, we should see some positive momentum throughout the year, so is it just conservatism that you haven't adjusted the full-year guidance for EBIT or is there anything...?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "We have historically never adjusted guidance until the third quarter.", "Patrick Hummel - UBS AG (Broker)", "Okay. Right there. And the second question is related to Maserati. Can you talk a bit about the order book for the Levante? You introduced it in Geneva a month and a half ago. How is the order book looking like?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Quite strong. That's all I'll tell you right now. I mean, the vehicle is a wonderful \u2013 maybe I am trying to sell your car on the phone, I don't know, but it's a phenomenal vehicle. I think it's something that was desperately needed in the range. I think the expectations especially in the United States are quite high for how well that vehicle will do.", "So right now, our objective is to make sure that we get production right and we get it at the right quality levels before we start shipping cars oversees. We'll see some U.S. model at the end \u2013 some of the models in the U.S. at the end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter. Hopefully, we'll be there for the fall and winter season. And I think the car will do well. There's no doubt in my mind that there's zero unused capacity out of the Levante today in our plant.", "Patrick Hummel - UBS AG (Broker)", "And does it mean that by the end of this year we should see Maserati already at target profitability?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I have no idea what target you have in mind, but the answer is that we're not going to comment until we get to the third quarter of this year and see what the brand looks like after we get it rolled out.", "Patrick Hummel - UBS AG (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Charles Winston from Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.", "Charles A. Winston - Redburn Partners LLP", "Yeah. Hi. Charles from Redburn. Two question for me, if possible. Firstly, just your current truck, SUV penetration in the States, I think it's about 83%, 84% according to your data.", "As you get your new production footprint sorted out, I mean is it possible that FCA U.S. becomes a 90% plus truck SUV company? In other words, to all intents and purposes the proportion of passenger cars really will have withered to something pretty minimal? Or is there a figure in your...", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "No, no, no, no. And I think...", "Charles A. Winston - Redburn Partners LLP", "Okay.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "...you're totally underestimating the relevance of minivans. I don't know where you got your number at 83%. I can't reconcile it with anything I know, especially to you \u2013 unless you...", "Charles A. Winston - Redburn Partners LLP", "Something from your monthly data.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Yeah. Unless you consider the minivan a truck.", "Charles A. Winston - Redburn Partners LLP", "I'm just quoting back to you the numbers you guys publish on your website every month, and you split it between passenger cars and trucks.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "Right. And trucks includes minivans. And that's a completely different application on the concept. So, we may be abusing the concept on our website, and for that I apologize, but a minivan is a passenger vehicle. It is not a UV in the traditional sense of the word. But anyway, it's possible when we finish all this that the true passenger car side will represent the lesser portion of our portfolio than it does today.", "Charles A. Winston - Redburn Partners LLP", "Okay.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "It's possible.", "Charles A. Winston - Redburn Partners LLP", "But I mean in terms of significant further shifts from here possible? Or have we seen a lot of that shift happen in terms of that mix change?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "I think you've seen a lot of the shift \u2013 of the implications of a shift away from traditional passenger cars happen already. I would not be underestimating the impact of the continuance of Dodge as a rear-wheel drive architecture environment in the fact that we will continue to grow our position in that segment. But when you look at overall volume is coming out of NAFTA, it will not represent a large portion of our mix, and certainly not in terms of local production, it won't.", "Charles A. Winston - Redburn Partners LLP", "Okay. Clear. Second question is just in terms of, if I was to look at your regional bridges and aggregate them and just sort of look at the headings across the piece, what I found interesting is that costs, in other words the reduction in SG&A and the industrial savings, \u20ac275 million, is the aggregate gain across that block. That's actually the single biggest block of the \u20ac679 million, it's slightly bigger than price mix across the group. Is that a pace of cost gain that we can expect to see across the year? I mean, I recognize it's coming from a number of geographies, I recognize there's an SG&A element in there, but is that rough figure of sort of \u20ac200 million, \u20ac250 million per quarter a meaningful figure to continue going forward or were there some perhaps slightly one-time elements are in there? Thank you.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "I think it's safe to say that we are seeing more traction from the stability in the industrial footprint worldwide and the consolidation of platforms and vehicles that is helping us to perform better in terms of vehicle purchasing \u2013 direct material purchasing costs and efficiencies. So, I think, in the past, we've seen the industrial cost number being heavily negative, particularly in NAFTA. I think we're starting to see an inversion in that trend, Charles. I wouldn't want to say that it's going to be \u20ac250 million times 4. I think it's early in the year to talk about those sort of...", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "If it's \u20ac250 million times 4, we're increasing guidance on this call right now, Richard. Over to you, buddy.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Like I said, it's early to make any such prediction. I think what is safe to say is that we're seeing the cost equation becoming a more significant contributor to overall profitability, especially industrial. And then on the SG&A side, as we mentioned, there's some timing differences on launches, which obviously drives timing of the sales and marketing investment.", "Charles A. Winston - Redburn Partners LLP", "Clear. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jos\u00e9 Asumendi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Jos\u00e9 Asumendi - JPMorgan Securities Plc", "Thanks very much. Two items. The first one on pricing. If you can comment please, the drivers for gross positive pricing in North America. And in EMEA, you mentioned also higher incentives on your business. Is this related to the product cycle, your specific product cycle or is it more related to the market? And then the second one on CapEx. I'll take it after your answer, please.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Well, I think in NAFTA, we saw a positive overall impact on pricing. So, I think we did have the benefit of discounts year-over-year, because last year we changed that structure in second quarter, so it's still like carryover of that.", "We've been continuing to price where possible in the marketplace and despite some negative headwinds on exchange, in particular on Canadian dollar, the number was positive for the quarter. So, I think as we mentioned earlier, there is some more price pressure in the market, as a whole; but on truck and on SUV we're seeing a fair amount of discipline still, so we're looking at that type of behavior going forward, we're not predicting anything more aggressive in the rest of the year.", "In terms of EMEA, it's really just a market, Jos\u00e9. I mean we're acting to be competitive where necessary, I think there is some impact there year-over-year of some extra price pressure, particularly in the UK due to some competitive moves and exchange impact, but we moved on in the second half of last year, so we're seeing that carry forward, but nothing significant to consider as a trend moving into the rest of the year.", "Jos\u00e9 Asumendi - JPMorgan Securities Plc", "Okay. And then on net cash, just want to come back to the comments from Mr. Marchionne on hitting net cash of \u20ac18 billion, I mean there are two drivers, you make more money or you spend less. And I mean for me, it's basically spending less and I just don't understand which special projects are you running right now in the books that you're not going to have in 2017, 2018 that's basically going to allow you to unleash the cash machine over the next 18 months. Can you give us any color on that? I mean we've seen starting in this first quarter CapEx is declining, but what kind of rate can we expect now over 18 months?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "As I said at the beginning, our CapEx guidance for the year is unchanged from Q4 and basically substantially in line with last year. And then we'll guide 2017 when we get there, but I think as we mentioned earlier, compared to our initial plan we have rationalized the overall spending, but capital obviously is something we're very focused on, Jos\u00e9, we want to get to the net cash position that's our target.", "Jos\u00e9 Asumendi - JPMorgan Securities Plc", "Fair enough. Thank you.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "That will now conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Joe Veltri for any additional or closing remarks.", "Joseph Veltri - Vice President - Global Investor Relations", "Thank you, Hannah.

And as always, the call will be governed by this language.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard Palmer.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "So, good morning and good afternoon to everybody. So moving to page four, we have a summary of the second quarter. I would say overall, we had a strong operating quarter. Our adjusted EBIT margin reached 5.8%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. NAFTA margins reached 7.9% and EMEA margin more than doubled to 2.5%.", "Our net industrial debt was reduced by \u20ac1.1 billion to \u20ac5.5 billion despite some negative FX translation. So overall we had a good quarter. We did take a charge in the quarter for Takata airbag, the May expansion of the population in NAFTA of about \u20ac400 million, which was excluded from adjusted EBIT.", "Moving down the page, FCA entered into an important collaboration, the first of its kind for an auto manufacturer with Google, regarding the integration of Google's self-driving technology into the Chrysler Pacifica, which is an important move I think for FCA showing our being evolved upfront in this type of technology application.", "Our NAFTA capacity realignment, we've spoken about before, regarding reorganization of some of our manufacturing footprint in the U.S. is proceeding on schedule. And will result in us having increased capacity allocated to Jeep and Ram from the middle of next year. And we proceeded with the commercial launches of the Alfa Romeo Giulia and Maserati Levante in Europe. This is an important milestone showing our continued progress in the premium brand strategies. And the U.S. launches are planned for the second half of the year.", "During the quarter, Moody's upgraded our corporate credit rating from B1 to Ba3, following S&Ps upgrade in March. So this is also a positive reflection of the progress we're making on the balance sheet.", "And as a result of the first half results, we are revising upwards our full year guidance to increase the adjusted EBIT to more than \u20ac5.5 billion from more than \u20ac5 billion, increasing net profit to over \u20ac2 billion from \u20ac1.9 billion. And confirming our net industrial debt target, at current exchange rates notwithstanding, the fact that compared to our initial guidance, the strengthening in the real has contributed to a negative impact on translation of nearly \u20ac800 million.", "So moving onto page five, we can see some of the important product news in the second quarter. We continue to rollout the Fiat Tipo family, adding the new hatchback version to go along with the sedan and station wagon models already launched. And continuing to increase our presence in the C-segment in the European market, which is the second-largest segment there, historically not a segment, the Fiat brand has been particularly successful and we are seeing very good progress with this new product family. We sold 23,000 units in the first half. And as I said, adding this new version, the hatchback, will continue to grow into the second half of the year.", "We also launched the Fiat Fullback, which is a one metric ton midsize pickup, which will be selling in Europe initially and also in Latin America. That just launched in the quarter. And so we are looking at the volumes increasing through Q3. And then for Maserati, we started to deliver the model year 2017 Quattroporte, which has a restart exterior, some interior refinements, some more safety features and electronic content. And so that further improves our product line up on the Maserati to go with the launch of the Levante, which is ongoing.", "So moving to page six, talking about the quarter in a bit more detail. You can see that our shipments were down year-over-year by 1%. If we adjust for the change in our shipments in China, due to the localization of Jeep through the JV, our combined shipments including the JV shipments would have been up 1%, to 1.2 million units, driven by an increase in EMEA of 14% offsetting Latin America, which was down 19%.", "Net revenues were down \u2013 but reported revenues were down, but they were up 1% at constant exchange with contributions and positive mix in NAFTA, LATAM and EMEA.", "Our adjusted EBIT, as I mentioned, was up 16%, with margins of 5.8% from 4.9% last year. And year-to-date, adjusted EBIT is just over \u20ac3 billion, up 43% compared to last year.", "Moving to adjusted net profit on the top right hand side, we were up to \u20ac709 million, nearly double last year's number of \u20ac372 million. Net financial charges were down as we continue to reduce our overall gross debt and refinance at lower rates. And taxes were more or less flat at an adjusted net profit level.", "We already mentioned the industrial debt improvement of \u20ac1.1 billion. And we will look at a bit more the detail on the following pages. And our liquidity was basically around flat at \u20ac24.7 billion. Our gross industrial debt closed at just over \u20ac24 billion. Sequentially, down \u20ac1.2 billion from March, despite negative FX and due to a repayment of a bond in the quarter. And so that takes our gross debt reduction compared to June 2015, with various actions including obviously the spin of Ferrari to over \u20ac6 billion.", "Moving to page seven, here you can see the contribution of the various segments to the improvement in our adjusted EBIT of \u20ac227 million in the quarter. NAFTA margins, as I mentioned before, were up to 7.9%, up from 7.7% last year and from 7.2% in Q1. LATAM achieved a breakeven in the quarter, up \u20ac79 million compared to last year and EMEA more than doubled, contributing an improvement of \u20ac86 million through the second quarter. All segments were up versus the first quarter, except for LATAM where investments in marketing of the launch cost of the new Fiat Toro impacted the EBIT.", "Then moving on to page eight show the Group adjusted EBIT improvement again, but this time looking at the operational drivers across all the regions. So you can see that the main improvement was basically volume and mix, but clearly as I mentioned, our volumes were pretty flat, so in actual fact principally mix, which was driven by NAFTA and EMEA, but also some positive mix in LATAM as we continue with the launches of the vehicle from Pernambuco.", "The increase in industrial costs was driven by some product content in NAFTA, the cost of the Pacifica being higher than the predecessor vehicle. We had some efficiencies which offset in Latin America due to the non-repeat of launch costs that we had in Pernambuco last year.", "And the SG&A increase is basically marketing costs as we continue with the launches of the Pacifica, the Tipo family, the Fullback and the Levante as well as others in the quarter.", "We move to page nine; can see the net industrial debt walk from March to June. So as you remember in Q1, on the industrial debt increased by \u20ac1.5 billion due to working capital absorption and negative FX translation. We had mentioned at the time we expected the working capital to reverse and that's what it did. So the seasonality in Q2 together with production resuming in Toluca for the Journey and the Fiat 500 in May brought our working capital up, and a positive contribution to cash of \u20ac1.2 billion in the quarter. And so basically flat through the first six months of the year. The EBITDA in the quarter was \u20ac3.1 billion, 11.3% margins, compared to last year which was under 10%. So some good improvement in margins and EBITDA, obviously because we're also covering higher D&A for the new product launches.", "And so, you can see also that our adjusted industrial EBITDA was also over \u20ac1 billion higher than the CapEx number at just over \u20ac2 billion. We did have a negative translation again in the quarter, basically because of the real of about \u20ac0.5 billion, which you can see in the column on the right-hand side. So overall, I think a good quarter in terms of the industrial debt.", "Moving to the regions, on page 10, we can see the NAFTA performance. The sales metrics here do reflect the new methodology that we described in our press release yesterday. So the industry sales were down 1% in the U.S. And our NAFTA sales and the U.S. sales were up 2% overall; Jeep and Ram, driving the increase with double-digit increases year-over-year.", "Our days supply was down compared to Q1. Obviously a lot of that due to the seasonality of the market with building inventory in Q1 to meet demand of the higher seasonality of sales in Q2. So we closed with 75 days supply, very similar to last year's 74 days.", "Our U.S. fleet mix was up slightly from 21% last year to 24% this year, although positively our Rent-A-Car volume within the fleet mix was down 5% year-over-year and obviously that's something we need to continue to work on to improve our overall channel mix within the fleet business.", "In Canada, we maintained our market leadership with share of 15.2%. Our shipments in the quarter were down 2% basically due to reductions in 200, Dart and Journey, as I mentioned where Toluca was down for the month of April. And those reductions in shipments were partly offset by more shipments of Ram, Jeep and Minivans but not entirely. And obviously that mix impact was the main driver not of the \u20ac250 million you can see in the EBIT walk on the bottom left. The improved mix is the main driver of the improvement in our profitability. We did have some positive pricing in the marketplace, but that was offset by negative impacts of exchange mainly on the Canadian dollar.", "And in terms of industrial cost, as I mentioned earlier, we have purchasing efficiencies in the quarter. But they were offset by higher DNA and higher cost of principally, the Pacifica launched with more content than its predecessor vehicle. But overall, 98% margins and continuing the improvement we have been seeing in the last few quarters in our NAFTA performance.", "Moving to page 11, Latin America, the industry was down 12%. Our sales were actually down 22%, as we continue to focus very much on profitability here. We shipped 112 units in the quarter. And about a quarter of that was Pernambuco volume, so about 25,000 to 26,000 vehicles there, of which half were Renegade and half were the Fiat Toro new launch.", "Our revenues were down 9% at constant exchange with the lower volumes being partially offset by the better product mix from Pernambuco.", "In terms of the adjusted EBIT walk on the left, you can see the main driver of the improvement year-over-year was the reduction in industrial costs, better efficiencies in the plants and also non-repeat of the launch cost we had in Pernambuco last year, in part because of the actual physical industrial launch in the plant. And also because we have now reached the sort of our target level of local content in those vehicles whereas last year, we were still shipping in parts as we completed the localization process.", "Moving to APAC, on page 12, you can see that these numbers continue to reflect the transition to the joint venture of our Jeep production. So our sales were flat at 55,000 units. And of those, you can see that we had 30,000 units sold through the JV, up 200% from the 10,000 we had last year. So that transition continuing.", "Our sales in China were up 17% and in Japan, we were up 21%. We were down in Australia as we continue to price to try and cover the exchange impact we were having there.", "Jeep, Ram represented 73% of the region's sales and obviously driven strongly by the locally produced Jeep Cherokee in China.", "Moving to the adjusted EBIT walk, I think the most important thing here. You can see the volume mix impact which is basically the move to the JV volumes and so not consolidated and not producing volume mix through our income statement and then offset with costs industrially and SG&A was going into the JV.", "In the other column we have the improvement in the JV result and so that's important as we start to see the effects of the Cherokee and the Renegade volumes ramping up in Q2 and which will continue through Q3 in a joint venture. We will also be launching in September a third product in the joint-venture which is the all-new Jeep C-SUV which is basically the Compass Patriot replacement, the first launch of that car is in China, then we'll be subsequently launching in other regions.", "Moving to EMEA, on the next page, you can see that the industry was up 10%, with Italy being up 17%. Our sales in the EU were up 17% so our market share was up 40 basis points. So you can see that was driven by positive performance in all of the major markets on passenger car.", "If we move to LCVs, the industry was up 14% and we were basically up flat with that just under 13%.Our shipments were up 16% to 75,000 units, positive performance on LCV. And you can see in the bottom left the adjusted EBIT walk. We had both positive volume and positive mix, driven by the 500 family, the Tipo vehicles, I mentioned earlier, and LCV. And you can see that partially offset with more SG&A to fund the marketing of these new product launches.", "Moving to Maserati on page 14, our shipments were down 17%. I think we're getting to the end of the process of cleansing, which we've talked about in the last few quarters. Our inventory levels in North America and in Europe were high. I think we're getting to the end of that. That's reflected in the shipments being down in America by 26% and in Europe by 17%. We did have improved shipments in China, up 20% and that together with some higher mix on Quattroporte helped us to improve our margins sequentially.", "Last quarter in Q1, we were at 3.1%, this quarter we are at 6.2%. So we are starting to see a recovery sequentially in the Maserati margins. And I think what will be important is to see how the Levante continues to perform. We have had a very good reception for that product in the marketplace. Orders are strong. And we will see production and shipments ramping up in Q3.", "Moving to components on page 15, our revenues were up reflecting an improvement in revenues in Marelli and also margins were up from 3.8% to 4.6% driven basically, entirely by 90 basis points improvement in our Magneti Marelli margins. Order intake in Marelli was also good, up \u2013 flat year-over-year with \u20ac603 million of orders with non-captive at nearly 60%. And the Comau order backlog was also up from March by nearly \u20ac200 million.", "Moving to page 16, our outlook for the year, no real changes in terms of our views on the industries. NAFTA continues to be strong. U.S. SAAR was still at 17.5 million in the second quarter consistent with the first quarter trend. And so we are still positive around the outlook for the NAFTA markets. Asia-Pacific continues unchanged in our forecasted numbers. LATAM is clearly still struggling. We are hoping that the political uncertainty will resolve in Q3. And maybe we will start to see some improvement in confidence going into Q4. But we're looking at a number at the bottom end of the range of 3.6 million for the year.", "And then EMEA, the last forecast is unchanged but we believe we will be at the high end of this range. Some of the noise around Brexit seems to be diminishing and the European market continues to perform well.", "So moving to the last page in the presentation pack, our guidance again, we raised revenues slightly on the back of good performance in EMEA and NAFTA. Our EBIT is up to over \u20ac5.5 billion and net profit up to above \u20ac2 billion. And as I mentioned before, net industrial debt we are holding it at less than \u20ac5 billion with the improved performance on the economic side offsetting the negative translation we've seen in the first half.", "So with that, I will hand it back to Joe. Thank you.", "Joseph Veltri - Vice President - Global Investor Relations", "Thank you, Richard. Jillian, I am going to now turn the call over to you to please begin the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now take our first question from John Murphy from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, guys. Just a first question on North American margins, obviously, there was a little bit of an improvement here. But when you look at what was just printed by one of your large cross town rivals, 12.1%, you are still significantly behind here. I'm just curious, what you ultimately think your margins can get to \u2013 if they can get to that range. And if this changeover of Sterling Heights to the Ram might help, just sort of, the idea of getting to those levels from where you are right now. Is that possible and how do you get there?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "We announced the reindustrialization of the U.S. manufacturing footprint, probably a couple of quarters ago. I think the last announcement that was made in connection with Sterling Heights was out a couple of days ago. By the time we're finished with this, hopefully, all of our production assets in the United States, if we exclude Canada and Mexico from the fold, all those U.S. plants will be producing either Jeeps or Rams. There will be no passenger cars that will be produced in the U.S. And therefore our expectation is that that concentration will give us a possibility to get to very close to those numbers that you mentioned earlier.", "I think they were exceptional results. I think they should be complimented for an outstanding delivery into Q2. And I think that we have every expectation that after this realignment that we should be getting very close, if not dead-on those numbers.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just a follow-on to that. Have you made any progress in finding a car manufacturing partner? And is that required to get to these levels? Or is that something where you think you can produce in Mexico, and can go it alone on car production?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "I think we have made progress. We're not in a position to announce anything. Although, I think that any progress on that front would be actually margin dilutive. They may not be in absolute terms, but it will be margin dilutive.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then if we think about the guidance range you guys are talking about, \u20ac5.5 billion plus, for the full year you've done \u20ac3 billion year-to-date in the first half, is this an indication that we might see a fade in EBIT through the second half of the year, or is this a level of conservatism and there's kind of a big range around that plus sign after \u20ac5.5 billion.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "My view is that I think there's a big plus sign. And Richard has historically been conservative. I'm not going to change him now. He's too old. So we'll leave him be as it is. We'll wait for Q3 and we'll take stock of how far we've gone.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And then, lastly, just the last question for me. On CapEx, it's running just over \u20ac2 billion year-to-date. So if you could just remind us of your full year guidance on CapEx, or expectation there. And why is it so back half loaded or appears to be so back half loaded?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Yeah. Our full year number as we have already indicated at the beginning of the year is \u20ac8.5 billion to \u20ac9 billion. And I think as we go through Q2, we'll get a bit more precise around where we think that's trending up. But the numbers of projects we've been talking about are coming online in the second half. So we think that's still a good estimate.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "Yeah. Although, at the upper end of what's likely to be spent. There's a physical limitation on the ability to cut checks between now and December 31.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. It seems a little bit tight. Will that impact your net debt guidance? It just seems like if you hit those numbers, it's going to be hard to hit your net debt guidance as well.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "It's going to be hard to \u2013 you mean we're going to be much lower to the \u20ac5 billion, or much higher?", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Well, I mean, if you hit the \u20ac8.5 billion to \u20ac9 billion on CapEx, it seems like it's going to be hard to achieve your target on net debt of \u20ac5 billion or lower. I mean, it seems like it would be tough to produce enough cash to get to that level.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Well, I think, in the second half, John, I think we're going to see some positive working capital, as well in the second half we are in the process of launching the Giulia. We're in the process of launching the Levante. We're in the process of ramping up the Pacifica. I think in the second half, within that range of CapEx, we can make the less than \u20ac5 billion of net industrial debt.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, everybody. First question is just, can you give us a little color on your discussions with your financial partners, the Italian bank sponsors, et cetera, following Brexit, just give us a tone for how your discussions have been for the strength there?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Well, I think our exposure in the U.K. is fairly limited, on the balance sheet very limited. In terms of volumes, we sell about 100,000 cars and LTVs in the UK, obviously the 8% I think weakening, something like that, sort of stabilize that, sterling to euro, we'll have an impact if it sits there through next year. This year we do have some hedges in place et cetera. So I think that the impact for this year is going to be minimal. So in terms of the localized impact related to the UK, not that significant. In terms of the wider relationship with our Italian banks, it is very good. We don't have any issues with the financial community. As you have seen, our ratings have improved and I think going forward we continue to execute on our plan to deleverage the group through 2018, so.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "And I'm not sure I understood the question about the relationship with the Italian bank?", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "No, I just think some investors here are not familiar with the strong history between Fiat Chrysler and your banking relationships, may underestimate how durable these relationships are and how important they are?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "No, they are important. I think that one of the things that we have done in the last 13 years, and I think your institution has been a beneficiary of that too is that we have internationalized our banking relationships beyond the Italian boundaries. And I think that we have been able to establish a sound rapport with a number of large global international firms which have provided a lot of support to the financing transactions that FCA has carried out in the last 13 years. Certainly they've been very, very active in the disintermediation of some of the assets out of Fiat Chrysler, the creation of CNH Industrial and Ferrari. All those things have been accomplished with the help and the assistance of large international financial houses.", "So I don't think that the issue for us is one of resilience or credibility with the financial community at all. I think that if you go back to the question that was made earlier, I think our biggest task now is to close the operating margin gap with our competitors. It remains a permanent fixation that we have inside the house that we need to get off of our butts and get that done.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you. One more question on financing. Richard, can you give us an update on the factored trade receivable activity, maybe a total balance or any deltas in the quarter. I couldn't tease that out of the results.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "I don't have the exact number. There is no significant change quarter-over-quarter in that level of that activity.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Okay. And then maybe \u2013 that's fine. And then last one for Sergio. You mentioned no passenger \u2013 you are kind of getting to a position where you're not producing any passenger cars in the U.S. It's Jeep and Ram only when this is done. At what point do you think you are at that level? Is that at 18 month, 24 month or?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "I think we will be de-car-ed the U.S. by probably the end of Q1 of 2017.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And I'm just curious....", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "And the problem that we got, as you know well know Adam, as we move through transition we'll have to go through downtimes in some of our plants in order to allow for conversion.", "Having said this, I think that we face this in such a way as to not impact our profit forecast and the maintenance of the 2018 objective, which is still \u20ac9 billion in operating profit. So that number has not been moved. I think the question is how much over \u20ac9 billion do we get to and how quick can we get there.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you. So just a final on that to extend on that last question is, could you share with us perhaps kind of the tenor of what you are hearing, the tone from the UAW? And Dennis how supportive are they of this transition? Can you explain to the audience, the level of awareness at the UAW and the UAW leadership of the challenges that face this industry on a secular basis? And the need to kind of really utilize those North American assets, those higher cost assets to the fullest extent with as little risk as possible. I'm just curious if you're able to share that?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "Yeah, Adam, I don't want to speak on behalf of Dennis. I think Dennis can be probably even more articulate than I will be on the topic. But I can only give you my understanding of discussions that I have had with Dennis now over the last couple of years about the manufacturing asset base in the U.S.", "And it was a relevant issue when we were discussing the renewal of the contract. And I fully understand, I think, the pressures that he had to deal with from within the UAW, to try and accomplish as favorable a compensation package for the membership as he got in September of last year. I think the real issue for us is that, when you look at the economics of car manufacturing, I'm talking about traditional cars as opposed to SUVs or pickups, the margins that we were getting from our experience with both the Dart and the Chrysler 200, as well intentioned as those programs were and as technologically relevant as they were for the marketplace, yielded returns that were not on a comparative basis, match even anything close or remotely close to what we could derive from the utilization of those assets in the Jeep or Ram world.", "And so we have made that shift, I think it was a painful shift. It took us a long time to analyze and reanalyze the cost and the alternatives. I think we feel comfortable now that we've positioned the U.S. assets in the right place. And that it will guarantee fuller levels of employment and a higher opportunity for the UAW membership to benefit from that growth.", "The residual issue which has to do how does the UAW and the membership deal with their relevance and the participation in cars, is unresolved, because it is not just a question of wages, although that's important. But it will certainly require different operating environment than we currently have at the UAW, which extends beyond wages.", "And so we would have to rethink the model completely. I've opened the discussion with Dennis. I think we need to sit down and have a heart-to-heart on this and see whether we can find a solution going forward. But as it stands today, economically, it will be very, very difficult for us to justify an investment in car on a U.S. manufacturing basis. It's just not there.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "That's clear. So, thank you. Thanks team.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Massimo Vecchio from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.", "Massimo Vecchio - Mediobanca Banca di Credito Finanziario SpA (Broker)", "Good afternoon, everybody. My first question is on the agreement with Google. Clearly, you are following a different strategy from your industry peers, which are developing every single one of them, their own solution. Now, I know your view on the industry's tendency to overspend in CapEx. But strategically, what is your strategy with this agreement? And will you differ with your competitors what you are seeing that the others are not seeing?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "By the way, I will plead ignorance and I will tell you that I'm mono-fanatic in my vision and not blame anybody else for seeing something else. I can only give you my views and I think it's up to you and the markets to judge as to what is the wiser course. But I've stated this publicly and I'll repeat it here again, that I think that it's a world that is rapidly changing, and where preferences which are being expressed by existing or potential intruders into the auto space, keep on changing at the speed of light.", "And I think that one of the worst things we could do is to commit capital in a very certain unequivocal fashion to a particular technology choice, or a particular strategic platform without exploring potentials for development with a variety of actors. And I think we remain open as we have been, as we stated in private discussions with some of these so-called intruders and even in public assertions that the group has made. But the fact that we are willing to explore alternatives without expending a phenomenal amount of capital for us to try and understand what the ultimate economic model looks like. Because it is not just a question of exploration and capital permits when it's a question of understanding what the economics look like after we finish.", "We are and have been historically manufacturers of cars out of a very traditional industry. This is a completely different way in which the market is going to be potentially developing. And I think we need to be open and not prejudicial in making choices. And so the Google experience hopefully will not be the last experience with a so-called intruder.", "We have open discussions with others. Hopefully, it will give us a chance to learn and on the base of that knowledge, I think we will make a final determination as to what the strategic stance is. I think it's way too early to call today and it's way too early to make large capital commitments for something which we have limited knowledge of and we understand little of in terms of future development.", "Massimo Vecchio - Mediobanca Banca di Credito Finanziario SpA (Broker)", "Okay. So you haven't take already the decision if you want to be a supplier of your partners or if you want to develop your own solution, you are exploring and trying to understand?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "Yes. The transition, whatever that is, is not going to be a painless transition. I think that we all need to understand this. It looks quite rosy sitting behind a desk. I think the transition is not going to be that obvious and it is not going to be that easy. And I think we need to be ready to handle this to make sure that we reap the highest possible economic benefit to FCA as the transition happens. One will happen of some caliber, I think we need to remain open on choices.", "Massimo Vecchio - Mediobanca Banca di Credito Finanziario SpA (Broker)", "My second question is on Maserati. It seems from your wording that the reason for the fall in volumes here, is related to mostly to the Ghibli. So first question is, if it is correct?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "No. I think the reduction in volumes is due to the fact that we have got through a destocking exercise where we overstuffed distribution channel, that happened in 2015. And which has taken a while to digest through the system. And I think that we're seeing the benefits now of a reestablished supply/demand condition. I think that the introduction of the Levante will effectively reinvigorate the relevance of that portfolio going forward. I think we need to see, I don't think there is anything that the numbers say about Ghibli as being particularly wounded. It has been an incredibly successful car. We were fully aware that given its price positioning, that it will be eroding some of the values that are associated with the Quattroporte.", "And that was built into the case at the time in which we originally approved the investment. I think as we keep on rejuvenating both the QP and Ghibli, you will see \u2013 and together with the Levante, I think you will see Maserati play a more significant role in the markets. And volumes and margins should follow.", "So, I think, we need to give it the rest of the year to see what the impact of the Levante is on the marketplace and certainly the whole of 2017 to see the full benefits from this range of products, including stuff that is now being worked on. One of the things that we decided in the last three or four days is a series of relatively small investments, so we'll keep the GranTurismo and the GranCabrio alive until the end of 2017, possibly going into 2018.", "So I think the portfolio is sound. I think we just need to execute. I think Reid in his new function now has been sort of commissioned with the task, I expect much better results going forward in the remainder of 2016 and in the next couple of years.", "Massimo Vecchio - Mediobanca Banca di Credito Finanziario SpA (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Joseph Veltri - Vice President - Global Investor Relations", "Jillian, are you there?", "Monica Bosio - Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (Broker)", "Hello?", "Joseph Veltri - Vice President - Global Investor Relations", "Go ahead, Monica.", "Monica Bosio - Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (Broker)", "Hello?", "Joseph Veltri - Vice President - Global Investor Relations", "Monica?", "Monica Bosio - Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (Broker)", "Hi.", "Joseph Veltri - Vice President - Global Investor Relations", "Go ahead, please.", "Monica Bosio - Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (Broker)", "Hi, everyone. I'd some questions. The first one is \u2013 how do you \u2013 okay, fine, 2016 is fine. But I was wondering what about 2017, also on the back of the Brexit, I'm just trying to figure out what could happen for Maserati and Giulia in case of the slowdown of the demand in U.K. for a high, top of the range car. And also, what do you expect for the European car market in 2017?", "And my second question is on the target for 2016, could you please better explain to me the upside revision in revenues? Is it because of the price mix? Is it because of mix?", "And the second \u2013 and the last question is on the adjustments between adjusted EBIT and the reported EBIT. My estimates accounted for the full year roughly \u20ac500 million. And now we are at more than \u20ac600 million. So I'm just trying to figure out if you can give us some roughly indication about the final number for this year. Thank you very much.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "If I can just give you an answer on Maserati, I think Maserati, one of the values of Maserati is the fact that it is a global brand. I've just asked our guys here to give me the exact numbers on Maserati sales in 2015. I think there were 1,500 cars that were sold in the U.K.", "And I can also tell you from my experience on the Ferrari side, we have not seen a decrease in the level of interest in these premium brands. I think that they will continue and they will occupy a particular space in the spectrum of cars. These are not volume cars.", "I think Richard made reference to the fact that we have sold about 100,000 cars in the U.K. A large portion of those I think are also commercial vehicles, which have been at the heart of our presence in the UK now, at least until the introduction of the new portfolio.", "I don't think that Brexit is painful as it's been from a political standpoint. It's going to have very negative implications on volumes or on our profitability in Europe going forward. What is unclear to me, to be honest, is what happens to U.K. produced assets. The UK produced cars that will eventually find their way into the rest of Europe. And how stable is the euro \u2013 this euro/sterling relationship going forward. These are things that we'll only be able to assess going forward. Having said all this, whatever the possible outcomes of all those factors, I don't think they are going to be negatively impacted by Brexit. The second point, while we were looking for this number, Monica, I think we unfortunately lost track of your question. And I'm looking at Richard, who looks as puzzled as I am. Can you give us a short version of your second question?", "Monica Bosio - Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (Broker)", "My second question is about if you can give us more color on the revision of the revenues, because I believe that it could be the mix. Just if you can confirm me this. Because if I look at the number for the first half and if I compare to my estimates, I'm fine with a upside in the guidance with adjusted EBIT. But it seems to me that the revision in revenues might be a bit aggressive, but maybe I'm wrong. And if I may, another follow-up on the political situation. Okay, Brexit might not have an impact on the European car market. But what do you think about Turkey? Is it a temporary situation or it could be something that in the long-term might be a impact?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "No, I actually think that whatever the duration of Brexit is, and I would expect it to be permanent in nature, whatever the ramifications are, they ultimately will not impact the portfolio choices or economic performance of the group going forward. Unless this Brexit situation deteriorates and another set of conditions that I'm not aware of. But based on what I know today, I think our views on profitability of the group and earnings generation is unimpacted by the consequences of Brexit.", "Vis-\u00e0-vis your question on revenue, you may be right. I think this is best \u2013 I don't think you are, but I think you may be right. And if you are, I don't think it's going to change materially our view of the world going forward, if we don't hit the \u20ac112 billion. Our best estimate is that, it is in excess of \u20ac112 billion. We will see as the numbers come in for the third quarter as to whether we have to revise those numbers and tell you that you're right. I don't think so. But we will see.", "Monica Bosio - Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (Broker)", "Okay. And the last was about the adjustment between the adjusted EBIT and the EBIT, if you can give us a rough indication for the full year? Thank you very much.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Monica, given that these are charges we take on a sort of unusual basis, to be frank, the best estimate really is the year-to-date number. We don't anticipate having today any unusual charges in the second half of the year.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "Yes, if we knew them, we would have booked them.", "Monica Bosio - Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Martino De Ambroggi from Equita. Please go ahead.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Three questions. The first is on EMEA region, 2.5% return on sales is the peak over quite a long period. But I suppose that it was impacted by launch cost because SG&A was the only negative variable in the quarter. So could you elaborate on what is the operating leverage, considering the environment we can discuss a long time on Brexit impact? But volumes growing like they are growing today, we've never seen this kind of trend in the recent past. So 2.5% can be considered sort of a cap rate for Europe?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "I would say, no, it's not a cap. Obviously we just saw one of our competitors reporting significantly higher margins. So as we mentioned earlier, our goal is to improve our profitability to the top end of where our car competitors compete with in NAFTA and in EMEA. I think, we've seen some good traction in the last six months from EMEA. There are a number of products, which are still being launched, in particular the Tipo family of vehicles. We just launched a Spider. We are pushing very hard to improve the brand position of Fiat with that vehicle. I think going into the second half, we will continue to work to improve our margin performance in the European market. So it is not a cap.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Yes. I was trying to have a \u2013 I'm not talking about a target but something more specific in terms of potential, because high-single digit is quite difficult to imagine at least in the short term?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "I agree. And I don't want to give you a target because we've given you a plan out for 2018, and we're starting to get to those sorts of levels already. So I think we need to continue to improve the margins in EMEA. And to be frank, the 2.5% isn't good enough, given where some of our competition is performing.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay. And the second question is on the free cash flow of the net debt. Richard, if you could help us in understanding what are the non-recurring items impacting on your guidance for debt. I am referring to cash-out for non-recurring costs that you booked and forex effect or any other impact in order to have a better understanding of the clean free cash flow?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Well, in the first half, the biggest impact is exchange. So, as I mentioned, there were \u20ac1 billion of negative exchange impact in the first half principally because of the Brazilian real and the debt we have there with the strengthening of the real. So that's the biggest change. So if exchange had not moved as much as it did there, we would have been a \u20ac1 billion better at this stage.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay. And what's the underlying assumption in your full-year guidance?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "We're basically assuming the rates stay substantially where they are today.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay. And in terms of cash-out referring to non-recurring items?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "There's nothing else significant. Apart from exchange, everything else is \u2013 for example, the campaign costs I mentioned before on Takata are going to be spread out over time and they're not significant enough in this year and also because in large part, the campaign process is delayed as the industry works through the parts availability, as you're aware, with the supplier. So those sorts of liabilities have a very long tails on them, so they're not going to impact this year significantly.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay. Very last on net pricing, which was negative in NAFTA region for the first time since Q1 2014. What should we expect going forward on these items?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "The biggest impact really is that last year we had the hedges in position on the Canadian dollar. And so now you're seeing a delta on exchange, which isn't reflective of the actual exchange rate difference spot to spot, because we had a hedge position last year. Those aren't on anymore. So I would expect now as we get comps at normalized rates, having reflected the weakening in the Canadian dollar in the last 12 months, we should start to see positive pricing in NAFTA or not negative pricing anyway. That's our target, especially as we launch Pacifica and...", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "You will see positive pricing going forward.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "...continue work on that.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay, perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Thomas Besson from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux SA", "Hi. Thank you very much. I had just a few follow-up questions please. Can you give us some qualitative or quantitative elements on the Giulia and Levante reception so far in Europe? I understand it's not been launched globally and give us an idea of what you would anticipate to be the approximate volumes of the vehicle in 2017?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "In 2013, it's kind of late, because the year has passed.", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux SA", "I said 2017, sir.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "Yes, down worry about it. I skipped four years already in my head. But we have not given volume indications for the vehicle, either at launch or now, and I think we'll have to wait until the end of the year to give you better guidance on volumes on global distribution of the Giulia as opposed to European numbers. I can only tell you, when I was talking to our operating people in Europe, now we're producing over 100 Levantes a day. Now I think we're at about 130 Levantes, 140 Levantes a day. So the car is picking up steam. We've begun our production of the model for the U.S., which was a huge portion of the market to be covered by the Levante.", "So the reception initially from both dealers and from the customer base has been quite good. We remain confident of the fact that both of these cars will perform well and effectively our forecast expects, at least today, that we would have a significant improvement in margins at Maserati in the second half of this year based on Levante traction. And the introduction of the models, as Richard mentioned, the facelifts on the cars that we introduced for the 2017 model year. We will give you a better update on Giulia as the car gets fully operational and we start shipping into the U.S., which hopefully will happen in Q4 of this year.", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux SA", "Okay. Second question, please, on your debt, you've mentioned the big currency impact. Can you give us a rough idea of the exposure by currency or at least of the real of your current gross debt please?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Our exposure to real is about R$17 billion.", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux SA", "R$ 17 billion.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Yes.", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux SA", "Okay. Thank you very much. And last quick question for me. Could you give us an indication of the net pension deficit at the end of Q2? Is it still up around \u20ac10.5 billion or has it moved significantly?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Well, it will have moved a bit, but I don't have a precise recap. We don't do that on a quarterly basis. But obviously discount rates are down a bit. So I would anticipate that the net liability is up. We'll see how discount rates perform in the second half.", "Thomas Besson - Kepler Cheuvreux SA", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Stephen Reitman from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Please go ahead.", "Stephen M. Reitman - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)", "Yes. Good day. I've got some questions on North America, specifically on slide 10. My first question, you mentioned that the fleet mix, 24%, there have been some improvement within the channels. Historically I understand that rental has been roughly about 75% of the fleet mix. So has that changed? Has that declined in the second quarter?", "My second question is about the adjusted EBIT walk down, and you say obviously that the EBIT excludes \u20ac519 million related to Takata and incremental cost of the NAFTA capacity realignment plan. Could you give some indication of how much of that relates to NAFTA capacity realignment plan? And are such change of plans normally also \u2013 at least is this the standard way of accounting also for your U.S. peers?", "And third question, just in terms of R&D capitalization, traditionally, I think the impact on the Chrysler result was equivalents to about 90 basis points if you bring us to sort of a U.S. GAAP equivalent type figure. Does that still hold for the second quarter? Thank you.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "In terms of the Takata impact and the NAFTA capacity, the NAFTA capacity was about \u20ac100 million of the \u20ac519 million. And given it's related to restructuring plan of the footprint, I think it'd be normal for that to be classified as it is. So I don't think we're unusual compared to our peers in that regard. In terms of R&D capitalization, I need to get you the precise number to be frank. I don't want to give you an incorrect number. It's not material on NAFTA, but it is definitely lower than the number you're saying because we've been investing over the last five years. And so the impact between amortization and capitalization is negligible. And sorry, the first question, I missed it.", "Stephen M. Reitman - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)", "The...", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Fleet mix, we were down about 5% in terms of rent-a-car mix year-over-year.", "Stephen M. Reitman - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)", "So that means that the proportion of the 24% would have been...", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Yes, I think we were about 80% last year. We're at 75% this year, quarter-over-quarter.", "Stephen M. Reitman - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)", "Thank you very much.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "And we continue obviously to work on that because it's an important driver of overall mix in the profitability and fleet.", "Stephen M. Reitman - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)", "Understood. Thank you.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Thank you, Stephen.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Michael Tyndall from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Mike Tyndall - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.", "Yes, hi, there. It's Mike Tyndall from Citi. Just two questions, if I may. The first relates to the U.S., again. Just around recalls. In Q3 of last year, you added quite a significant amount to your forward assumption on recalls. I'm wondering how we're looking in terms of the cadence. Let's put Takata to one side. Are you seeing recalls pretty much in line with what you're expecting? Or are you seeing potentially a pickup? Because if we look at some of the numbers for your recalls, it does feel like the cadence is perhaps a little bit higher than it is for your industry peers?", "The second question relates to the EBIT walk for Europe. And specifically, just the contribution from other, if I'm not wrong, that includes financial services and Tofas and presumably the Spider. So at plus 4% I'm wondering is it just simply too early to see the benefits of those coming through? Or is this something else that's driving that where we're not seeing the benefit of those JVs coming through in terms of what you're seeing in growth in Europe? Thanks.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "I'll give you an answer to both. I think that the question that you've asked about the recalls, I don't have a better view today than what has already been booked as the potential recall obligations that FCA has in the United States. I think we have booked and are booking everything that we think requires intervention. I did mention that and started probably a couple of years ago that as a result of I think the heightened level of concern that we together with the regulators have now developed vis-\u00e0-vis the safety of our cars that we would see an adjustment process that it really reflects past practices and which reflects a zero acceptance of risk in relation to products that we sell or at least to the best of our abilities.", "I think we're done with that adjustment process. We will continue to look at these populations for early signs of deterioration in performance in the event that somethings were missed. But I have no better information today, the numbers that are reflected and the numbers year-to-date as to what the recall population is. I just know that our efforts, the ones that are going on inside the house today, are such that we've heightened the level of scrutiny of our activities. We have devoted significant resources, both in manpower and skills to this task. I think it's the best that we know of today. And I don't really have a way of judging as to whether future activities will yield additional recall requirements.", "I can only tell you that if we knew them, we would have booked them. But I think this is as good as it gets for now. The whole house is tuned to a different level now, not just in terms of products that are currently in the marketplace, but also products in development. So hopefully, this activity should diminish. And I think it will be a return to normalization for the industry, which I think is long overdue.", "Mike Tyndall - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.", "Okay. Thank you. And on the European contribution?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "Too early to tell.", "Mike Tyndall - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.", "Yes, that's fair.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "We'll know more by December.", "Mike Tyndall - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.", "Brilliant. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Alberto Villa from Intermonte. Please go ahead.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Hi couple of questions. The first one is on the liquidity level that remained stable during the period. I wonder if we can expect a reduction in the available liquidity in the future. And how you think it will be phased in the next quarters? And the second one is related to the noise about emission in Germany and so on and so forth. We have heard about in the last few months. Now it's quiet period in terms of news flowing on that side? Can you update us on what are your expectations in terms of this issue, which remains pretty difficult to understand from the outside?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "We probably have slightly better knowledge than you do. But let me deal with \u2013 Richard will come back to you on the first issue. But I'll give you my views on this emission story. I think that the reason why most of us, including the general public is somewhat either confused or not sufficiently knowledgeable on this is because the way in which the European structure works. The rule or the rules, which impact this matter, are effectively established at the European level and delegation is given to the member states to apply them.", "Lack of clarity at European level has left for a \u2013 has left a variety of possible interpretations available to the homologating jurisdictions of cars. And therefore, a view that is expressed from country X doesn't necessarily have to coincide with the view that is expressed from country Y.", "Historically FCA has homologated nearly all of its cars through the Italian homologation system, which are \u2013 is reflective of its history in the country. And I think that the reason why this issue acquired this, as much prominence as it did is because a non-homologating authority in Germany decided to express an opinion on the homologation process which was outside of its jurisdiction.", "I think the assumption or responsibility by the Italian authorities on this I think is reflective of the way in which the European structure was designed to work. And I think, we will continue to work with the entity to which we're responsible for our homologation activities to ensure compliance with the rules. There's a broader question that underlies all this, which has to do with the level of specificity of the European rule and the way in which it is being applied across the country.", "And I think, it is up to Brussels to be able to provide the specificity. It is not up to us as carmakers to try and interpret what that is. I think it is only reasonable that carmakers interpret that rule in the absence of specific indications about content in the manner which produces the optimal results for the house.", "And I think we've done so and a number of automakers have interpreted European rules in such a way. I think, it is absolutely improper for some people to express a moral opinion about compliance, when the thing does meet the requirements of the legal system in Europe.", "And I think it's an issue that Brussels needs to wrestle to the ground with the help of the member states. But I think, we have done all we can, and I would expect that this issue at least for the time being will stop until Europe and the member countries try and find a resolution going forward which meets the requirements of all member countries.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Thank you.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "And Alberto on the \u2013 on liquidity, I would expect this to be around \u20ac23 billion compared to the \u20ac24.7 billion we have at June, basically we'll be repaying some maturities from now to year-end. We have \u20ac1 billion bond in October.", "We have a CHF400 million bond in November. We have some maturities in Brazil, so we'll be taking it down to about \u20ac23 billion and taking down the gross debt accordingly.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Okay. But in the mid-term what is the liquidity we can expect as a target range?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Well, we've been talking about holding a cash balance compared to today of around \u20ac15 billion, so we're working through that. Obviously, we have maturities in 2017 and 2018. We need to continue to improve our EBITDA performance, generate cash flow, but obviously our target is to get our total liquidity to between \u20ac15 billion, \u20ac20 billion.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Okay. Thank you.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "The \u20ac20 billion was a slip. He really meant \u20ac15 billion.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "You're right.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Okay.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Patrick Hummel from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Hummel - UBS AG (Broker)", "Yes, good afternoon. Three questions left please. First as far as the EMEA performance is concerned, the 2.5% you indicated you're still not happy with that and talked about the product side and volume and mix effect coming from that. I was just curious as far as the cost side and efficiency side of things is concern, is there any acceleration of your effort to be expected? Because I guess the 2.5% is not what you can remotely be happy about given the peer results we see in the region. Should I just ask all three questions in a row? And then you can answer all three of them right away?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "Well, I can give you the answer to the acceleration question. The answer is, yes. I mean, obviously, whenever these numbers come out and as much as I am appreciative of the performance of others. And I'm respectful of our competitors' earnings generation, the simple question that we asked ourselves is why can't we not do that, or be better than them?", "And I think that that message has now been driven through the organization. We've seen this happen both in NAFTA and we've seen it happen in EMEA. EMEA has come a long way given its earnings profile over the last three years or four years. I think it needs to go the next yard and really try and claim best-in-class margins in EMEA.", "I think it's a process that's undergoing. I think we'll see some improvement as the casino plan comes to full fruition with the introduction of the cars for Alfa Romeo and I think the benefit of the full ramp up of Levante will go a long way in terms of absorbing part of the industrial cost structure. But I think, we understand the task and I think we're working on it. (1:10:21)", "Patrick Hummel - UBS AG (Broker)", "Okay. And my second question. In the U.S. pickup segment, we saw \u2013 one of your competitors being quite aggressive with incentives as of late, namely the Chevy Silverado. I was just wondering if you could give us an updated view on how you see the Ram family doing in that environment and what your expectations are for the next couple of quarters.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "I will not pass \u2013 I will not give you an opinion as to what you suggested from our competitors as being the case. We did see this activity in the marketplace. It was a relatively short-lived flash, less than two weeks. And so we \u2013 I can only tell you that we did not follow our competitor down that path. We've maintained our pricing discipline. And I think that \u2013 and I'm not taking that as an indication of things going forward. I think that the sector continues to provide opportunity for all market players to try and achieve decent results. And I do not see any deterioration in the underlying economics of this business.", "Patrick Hummel - UBS AG (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you. And the last question, regarding the car production. I appreciate you're still in progress, in terms of looking for a partner. For the case, that this partner is not going to be found, is it an option to actually discontinue some of the models? And could that imply further financial charges not just write-downs, but also cash out?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "No. I think that we have made \u2013 even in that event which is in my view, unlikely, I think, we have taken all relevant charges to the best of our knowledge on the discontinuation of our involvement in car manufacturing in the continental United States. And so there will be no additional charges. I don't see this as having a negative impact on our activities in the U.S. Although I think it would \u2013 it may impact on a marginal relevance of some of our brands not being present \u2013 even though it's a decreasing market for passenger cars, it continues to be large. And so the ability to play is important to us. I think we're making every effort to replace both the Dodge Dart and the Chrysler 200 with equivalent products on a basis which is much more economical to us than yesterday. But I don't expect any drastic or draconian charges to happen in the event that a partner were not to be found. There aren't any.", "Patrick Hummel - UBS AG (Broker)", "Okay. Very good. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Gabriele Gambarova from Banca Akros. Please go ahead.", "Gabriele Gambarova - Banca Akros SpA", "Yes, good afternoon to everybody. I was wondering if you could give me some more color on the Jeep market acceptance in China, Richard Palmer said that you're going to introduce the new C-SUV already in September. It seems to me if there is a stronger solution (1:13:41).", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "I think, Mr. Richard \u2013 Mr. Palmer was carried away by enthusiasm, he was actually thinking of Latin America.", "Gabriele Gambarova - Banca Akros SpA", "Okay.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "So as hardworking as we are, I think, it would have been almost impossible for us to launch the C-SUV in China by September, since we just launched the Renegade in March.", "Gabriele Gambarova - Banca Akros SpA", "Okay.", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "But having said that and putting that issue aside, the Jeep C-SUV will come to China, it's coming to China in 2017. The first launch of the SUV is out of Pernambuco in Brazil that will be launched in September, which will be followed by the launch of the vehicle in Toluca for North American use. And then it will go to China immediately thereafter. But the reaction \u2013 the \u2013 a broader answer to your question is, I think the acceptance of both the Cherokee and the Renegade in China so far has been quite good.", "And I think it is confirming our expectations, that the Jeep brand has phenomenal traction in that country. We now having achieved local production, I think we are in a position to be fully competitive with \u2013 in the Chinese market. I think, we need to wait. I think that our ambitions to sell 500,000 jeeps in China by 2018 remains unchanged. And so that's the target.", "Gabriele Gambarova - Banca Akros SpA", "And if I can, just a brief follow-up on Brazil. The local association said that 2017 maybe, let's say, a flat year in terms of registrations? Do you share this view? What do you see \u2013 what you can see there?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "I think, a lot of it depends on the resolution of the political impasse in Brazil in the next two months or three months. There is a view which I think we at least partially subscribe to that says that the second half of 2016 will indicate the beginning of a recovery in the Brazilian market.", "I think we're comforted by the fact that the Argentinian market continues to perform well, which has been a historical problem for us because of uncertainty associated with the governance in that jurisdiction.", "I think if the issue in Brazil clears from a government standpoint, I think that we're much more hopeful than the forecast that you mentioned about recovery in 2017. It will not be stellar.", "But we're now sitting on volumes that I don't think I have seen since I've been involved in FCA. I mean, I have to go back and look at 2004 levels. But we expect the numbers to be between 1.8 million and 1.9 million cars in 2016. And that's a number, that's about half of what the original forecast was for that market in 2016.", "So a 50% reduction in volumes is as bad as it gets. I think, it's highly unlikely that we'll continue to see a deterioration in that number. At least a flattening out of that number for a prolonged period of time. There has to be a bounce. When that bounce happens is unclear to me. But I'm hopeful that it will happen in 2017.", "Gabriele Gambarova - Banca Akros SpA", "Okay. Crystal clear. Many thanks.", "Operator", "We will now take our last question from Jos\u00e9 Asumendi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Jos\u00e9 Asumendi - JPMorgan Securities Plc", "Thank you. Jos\u00e9, JPMorgan. Just one item please. So you're running CapEx about \u20ac0.5 billion lower in the first half year-on-year. And I was just hoping you could revisit the theme of hitting the net cash position in 2018 and give us an update on two items. Number one, your CapEx target for 2017 possibly declining year-on-year? And second, what is going to be the net impact of producing less sedans in the U.S. versus increasing the CapEx a bit on SUVs and pickup trucks? Thank you.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Chief Financial Officer, COO-Systems & Casting", "Jos\u00e9, to be frank, I think we'll gives you guidance on 2017 CapEx when we get there. I don't think it's going to be substantially different from the sorts of numbers we've been running at. We do have some significant investments going through in the U.S. as we renew the light-duty truck in shop and the Wrangler. So we'll work through it and give you a better idea of that as we get towards 2017.", "Jos\u00e9 Asumendi - JPMorgan Securities Plc", "(1:18:12) of higher CapEx 2017 versus 2016?", "Sergio Marchionne - Chief Executive Officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC.", "That's unlikely. But let's finish 2016, let's see where we are. And I think we'll give you \u2013 I think that the interesting thing is that vis-\u00e0-vis the 2018 plan, at the end of 2016, we will have an incredibly granular view of what we intend to spend in the next 24 months. And that's going to make our life a lot easier in terms of helping you \u2013 in helping \u2013 in guiding you toward a number for the end of 2018.", "The only thing I know is that, as of now, based on the numbers that we've seen and the expected performance from the launches that we have planned between now and 2018, that the \u2013 I can give you confirmation of the fact that this leadership team believes that the numbers for 2018 are achievable.", "And the level of comfort with those targets has increased substantially from when we launched the plan back in 2014. So just bear with us as we work our way through the details.

Our adjusted EBIT margins were up at 5.6%, up 130 basis points over last year.", "All our segments contributed positively to the improvement in the result year-over-year, excluding LATAM, which continues to suffer the market situation in Brazil. But that area was still around breakeven. Maserati had a very strong quarter on the heels of the launch of the Maserati Levante and showed double-digit margins for the quarter.", "On the balance sheet side, our net industrial debt increased by \u20ac1 billion as was expected with our normal Q3 seasonality, in both NAFTA and EMEA, as we have the model year changeover in NAFTA and some shutdown in EMEA. So those two regions had a negative impact on our working capital. We expected it to be around \u20ac1 billion, and that's what it came out at. So we are still confirming our net industrial debt guidance for the year on the back of the Q3 number.", "Other items in the quarter, the all-new Jeep Compass was launched in Brazil. It's the third vehicle in the Pernambuco plant there and that vehicle will then subsequently also be launched shortly in both China and Mexico production plants. We signed the new labor agreement with Unifor in Canada, which was rectified on October 16, and so we now have a four-year agreement with Unifor to work through with them.", "And lastly, but importantly, we have increased our full-year guidance for the year on the back of the strong results for the quarter and year-to-date. We are confirming our net revenue guidance at over \u20ac112 billion. We are increasing our adjusted EBIT guidance to more than \u20ac5.8 billion from the more than \u20ac4.5 billion previously and we are increasing our adjusted net profit guidance to more than \u20ac2.3 billion from more than \u20ac2 billion prior. And as I said before, we're confirming our net industrial debt guidance at less than \u20ac5 billion, notwithstanding, as we discussed in the last quarter, the significant negative impact year-to-date of the real strengthening on our debt position of about \u20ac800 million year-to-date.", "So moving on to page five, talk about some of the product news in the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, the Maserati Levante is being launched. It's the first SUV that the Maserati brand has offered. We have been launching it in Europe and in NAFTA and also started in Asia-Pacific. We have over 18,000 orders worldwide year-to-date, and really this vehicle and its initial reception in the market, I think, is reaffirming our commitment to the strategy to build our premium presence in the marketplace and confirms our intentions regarding the business plan for the Maserati brand. In the quarter, we shipped 5,000 Levantes and the sales rate as of September was about 2,000 in the month of September, so picking up very well, and starting to launch now.", "We also launched the 124 Spider Abarth version. I think the 124 Spider and the Abarth version are important for the Fiat brand image. They are doing good work in the marketplace showing new product under the Fiat brand. This car is available in Europe and in North America and has been very well received in the marketplace. We shipped about 4,000 in the third quarter.", "And then, lastly but not least, importantly, we have launched a new engine family for small gas engines, called the Firefly, the first installation starting production is in Latin America and the first vehicle is the refreshed model year 2017 Fiat Uno. This engine is modular in designs so the initial versions are 1.0 liter three-cylinder and a 1.3 liter four-cylinder and future versions will also incorporate direct injection and turbo-charging as it gets rolled out across our small and medium size vehicles.", "Moving on to page six, get into a bit more detail on the numbers. So our shipments worldwide on a combined basis including JVs were in line with prior year, notwithstanding as we've been talking about regularly that we have taken out production of Dart and the 200 in North America, and including the switch of volume from imported units into China to our joint venture which was up 30,000 units in the quarter.", "In terms of consolidated shipments, therefore we were down about 4%, driven by the 200-Dart impact in NAFTA which was slightly offset by Jeep and Ram improvements and driven by Latin America due to the market, with an offset in EMEA up 18%, driven by new products in particular the Tipo family launch.", "So in terms of revenues, we were flat year-over-year. There was no significant exchange impact in there and basically the reduction in our consolidated shipments was offset by the increased revenues in Maserati and positive mix particularly in NAFTA but also in EMEA. So that revenue performance produced the adjusted EBIT at \u20ac1.5 billion, up 38% with margins of 5.6%, as I mentioned earlier. So, year-to-date, we're \u20ac4.5 billion with a 5.5% margin up from 4.0% last year year-to-date.", "That drove adjusted net profit in the quarter at \u20ac740 million and year-to-date just shy of \u20ac2 billion. The adjusted net profit also included beyond the improvement in the operating results at EBIT also reduced financial charges and some positive impacts on the tax rate because of some higher tax credit utilizations in Q3, which helped us get to the \u20ac740 million in the quarter.", "The net profit was \u20ac606 million compared to a loss in the prior year. As you'll remember, last year, we had an unusual item for adjustment to our results for recall costs and also for Tianjin port issue in Asia Pacific. This year, we have taken a charge for a litigation we have in progress with a component supplier and that is contributing to basically the primary driver of a net charge of \u20ac149 million unusuals in this quarter.", "Our net industrial debt, as I mentioned, went from \u20ac5.5 billion at the end of June to \u20ac6.5 billion at the end of September due to seasonality and working capital as we will see later on. And our available liquidity for the same reason, we came down from \u20ac24.7 billion to \u20ac23.2 billion, but still very strong available liquidity. And as we go forward, we will continue to pay down some of the maturities that are coming due in Q4.", "Moving to page seven, we can see the adjusted EBIT walk by segment. As I mentioned before, ex-LATAM, everybody else contributing positively to the improved adjusted EBIT performance. And NAFTA margins were up to 7.6% from 6.7% last year, in line with our 7.5% year-to-date number. LATAM was down due to the continued market contraction. EMEA was up to 2.1% from 0.4% last year, continuing the positive trend we've had thus far. Asia Pacific was up mainly due to improved profitability in the joint venture as we go through the launch process of the Jeep vehicles we've been launching there. And Maserati, as I mentioned, showing the positive impacts of the start of the Levante volumes, up to 11.8% margins in the quarter.", "Moving to page eight, you can see the same improvement in adjusted EBIT looked up by operational driver. You can see that basically all the areas of the business contributing positively, in particular, I think, we are seeing positive impact from industrial costs as we work on that part of the business, the volume and mix is positive driven by Ram, Jeep, and Fiat Toro and Tipo. Our net price, we're still working hard to improve our price positions and in particular offset some exchange impact in Canada, in Australia, and so, overall, positive performance getting us to the \u20ac1.5 billion adjusted EBIT.", "Page nine shows our net industrial debt walk. So as I said, it increased by \u20ac1 billion, the balance, the seasonal working capital absorption was \u20ac1.2 billion due to model year changeover and summer shutdown in NAFTA and in EMEA. And basically that meant we were down 40,000 units to 70,000 units respectively, which we expect to recover in Q4. The working capital impact is very similar to the prior-year impact in line with our expectations.", "So EBITDA generation was nearly \u20ac3 billion with margins of 11.2% on EBITDA, up 180 basis points year-over-year. And the CapEx spend was \u20ac2 billion, which is consistent with the low-end of our guidance at \u20ac8.5 billion to \u20ac9 billion for the full year.", "I would like to move on to the operating segments, if we look at NAFTA, the U.S. market was 4.5 million vehicles in the quarter with SAAR just shy of 18 million units and the Canadian SAAR 1.9 million, so, industry sales were down 1% and 2% in Canada. And our group sales are down 2% in the region. U.S. sales were up 1% to 570,000 vehicles with share up 30 basis points as Jeep and Ram sales offset the impact of the Dart and the 200 reduction. Our U.S. dealers' data supply was slightly down at the end of Q2, 2016 to 72 days. Our U.S. fleet mix was higher than last year, mainly due to timing of deliveries that were a little late in 2015. And so this is a more normal cadence seasonally.", "And Canada sales were down 18%, and I think we're seeing some impact of some of the price increases that we have been taking over the last 18 months to protect our margins in Canada from the FX impact of the weakening Canadian dollar. So shipments overall for NAFTA were down 58,000 units, of which 44,000 were driven by the Dart and the 200. And so our net revenues were basically flat with those reductions in volumes offset by mix and some pricing.", "So if we look at the adjusted EBIT walk, you can see the negative volume impact of the Chrysler 200 and Dodge Dart offset by some favorable vehicle mix. The industrial costs improved due to purchasing efficiencies and some lower warranty costs, partly offset by some product cost for the new Pacifica and overall getting us to the 7.6% margins for the quarter.", "Moving to Latin America on page 11. There's nothing particularly new here. The market continues to be tough in Brazil, down 8% for the quarter, that's LATAM and 17% in Brazil with some offset in Argentina which was up 12%. We continue to be the market leader in Brazil for the quarter with share of 18.6%. The Jeep Renegade and the all-new Fiat Toro pickup continued their strong performance and lead their segments with share of nearly 25% and 75% respectively.", "Our net revenues were down 7% with some of the volume impact offset with positive mix from the Toro, in particular. So if we look at the EBIT performance, we lost \u20ac16 million in the quarter. We were down principally because we are struggling to offset the impact of input cost inflation and some exchange differences in the pricing area.", "September was a particularly difficult month and that is the reason why you can see the inventory days up to 48 from 39. We're seeing some improvement in sales in the month of October. Obviously, we're watching this very closely and continue to take out cost as you can see by the SG&A line continuing to contribute positively.", "We do have a new vehicle in Q4, the Compass. The Jeep Compass production was started in September and will start to contribute in terms of shipments and sales in Q4. So that should help us to continue to improve and get back to a breakeven result and, well, if the market is remaining tough through the end of the year.", "Moving on to page 12, Asia Pacific, the industry was strong, up 18%. Our combined sales including the JV were up 27% with China up 52%. Australia down 50%, as we continue to price to try and cover the Australian dollar weakness and maintain profitability. The Jeep brand was 81% of our regional sales in Asia Pacific and was up strongly year-over-year driven by the localized Cherokee and Renegade.", "So if you look at the EBIT walk across, we lost \u20ac83 million last year. This year, we made \u20ac21 million. The biggest driver of this is the joint venture result, which is within the other line and also the SG&A coming down, as that marketing activity is principally performed within the joint venture. So the joint venture numbers starting to show positive trend. And as we go into launching the third Jeep with the Compass at the beginning of next year, we expect to continue to see incremental improvements.", "Last year, as you remember, we had the Tianjin issue in the port explosion. We're getting through the process of selling down all the vehicles that were involved in and damaged in that issue. And we did take some incentives on closing out both the \u2013 all the imported vehicles that are now transitioned over to localized production and the Tianjin vehicles. And we're down to less than 2,000 units at this stage. So that issue should be rectified going forward.", "Moving on to EMEA on page 13. Sales were up in a positive industry, with the market up 5% with growth in all the major markets. Our sales were up 11% in passenger car, and so share was up 40 basis points. In light commercial vehicles, the industry was up 14% and we were up 17%.", "Overall, you can see that our EBIT improved from \u20ac20 million to \u20ac104 million on the back of stronger volumes with the Fiat Tipo family and also LCV performance being improved. Industrial costs were slightly higher due to R&D and manufacturing on those new vehicle launches and also SG&A for marketing expenses related to those launches. But overall, 2.1% margins as we continue to launch a number of vehicles was a good performance for the quarter.", "Moving to Maserati on page 14. As we mentioned in the last call, we are starting to see now in Q3 the impact of Levante. Shipments, as I said, were 5,000 units in the quarter taking us to 10,600 units for Maserati in the quarter. As a result, our revenues were up nearly 70%, adjusted EBIT was up to \u20ac103 million with margins of 11.8%. We still have very strong order backlog for Levante, so we expect to continue to see the positive trend going forward into Q4. The Ghibli shipments were slightly down as we transition to the model year 2017 but overall all three of the Maserati vehicles are well-positioned going into Q4.", "On page 15, the components businesses, revenues were in line with prior year, showing some improved mix of Magneti Marelli. Our EBIT increased due mainly to growth in automotive lighting in Magneti Marelli and non-captive revenues were nearly 70%, in line with prior year.", "And then moving to page 16, show our industry outlook for the remainder of the year, in terms of NAFTA, we are not changing our industry outlook. We see the U.S. industry as stable at around 18 million units as borne out by the third quarter numbers and the story really is LATAM where we obviously continue to see softness in the Brazilian market. And so, we were at 3.6 million to 4.1 million prior, now we have reduced our range basically to around 3.6 million for this year. We are seeing some level of improvement in October in the sales trend but obviously this is something to watch very closely going forward.", "Asia Pacific, no change in our guidance, we expect to be at the high end of the range there and in EMEA, we have increased our guidance by 0.5 million units and we still expect to be on the high end of this range as well as the momentum in the European markets continues positively.", "So moving to page 17, as I mentioned earlier, we have improved our guidance for the year both on adjusted EBIT and adjusted net profit. We are holding revenues and net industrial debt. And with that, I will hand the call back to Joe. Thank you.", "Joseph Veltri - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Thank you, Richard. Elaine, I am going to turn the call over to you now as I think we are ready to start the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now take our first question from John Murphy from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, guys. Just a first question on net debt. Obviously, well, at least to us the year-end target looks a little bit optimistic. I'm just curious if you are considering or contemplating any asset sales in that number and also, Richard, you sort of highlighted the \u20ac800 million headwinds seen from the real, so I'm curious if maybe \u20ac5.8 billion is an adjusted number for that forex and I'm just trying to understand the sort of relatively optimistic number for year-end.", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "This is Sergio. The number is \u2013 does not foresee any asset disposal. It's fundamentally due to performance or working capital reversals in Q4. Now if you look at our seasonality and you'll see the number is realistic given our history. So...", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "...we should be well below \u20ac5 billion.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just a second question, you highlighted net pricing is a positive in North America. Obviously, there are some conflicting views on this, the data is showing or corroborating what you're talking about, but we're also hearing about gross pressure at the dealer level. So, dealers are taking sort of \u2013 appear to be taking some of the first wave of hits on pricing. I'm just curious what you're hearing from your dealers and if you think this positive net pricing environment can really be maintained for the foreseeable future?", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "I'm not sure I do understand the term gross that you used.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "The new vehicle gross profit per dealer is coming under pressure.", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "All right, yeah, yeah. I thought you talked about just their experience being gross. It may very well be. I'm being facetious. I think that there's no doubt that the market has probably increased in competitiveness at retail level. I think we are \u2013 I think it's also a function of the way in which we have been driving performance out of our dealers. We are very much interested in sort of growing volumes and growing share.", "But I have not heard and I have met with the dealers about two weeks ago, I've met with counsel, I have not heard any alarming signs over disintegration of the profit structure at the dealer level. I think it's reflective of normal, healthy trading conditions. I would not read too much into this as Richard said. We maintain our forecast of 18 million for the year for U.S. and I don't think anything is going to disturb the margin performance of our dealers between now and December.", "The more problematic area for us, as Richard mentioned, is Canada, because I think that with the devaluation of the Canadian dollars, a lot of the U.S.-based products have become unnaturally expensive. And I think every attempt that we have made at maintaining margins in the region has come at a cost in terms of share and you've seen volumes drop in Q3. We were market leader at least up to the first half of this year, the position that we've now seated to another Detroit competitor. But we're not going to chase volumes just for the sake of getting numbers into the fold here, so we've protected margins in Canada, I think, we need to see how the year ends up.", "We've also been capacity constrained on truck which has limited our ability to properly service the Canadian market, but it's something hopefully will be rectified in Q4 of this year.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Then that just kind of leads me just to the next question, I mean, the drag on the 200 and Dart, I think, on slide 10 you are looking at \u20ac204 million on mix and volume there and that sounded like at least all of that, if not more, is from the 200 and Dart winding down. I mean, if you look at Belvidere changing over to the Cherokee, could we see that completely reversed and then some by the third quarter of next year? How fast you think this reversal and changeover will occur and you'll get the benefit from that Cherokee as opposed to those two sort of fading vehicles, if you will?", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "By Q3 of next year, certainly, Cherokee has gone in and I think we will be in the process of industrializing to try and get the Ram up. You may not see the full margin impact of this. I think the completion of this transformation of the industrial footprint in the U. S. will require the startup of both the Wrangler and Toledo, the startup of the Ram 1500 of the new one and the reintroduction of the Cherokee and Belvidere.", "That will not be completed until Q1 of 2018. And so, I think the full benefit will be visible. Then it's my sincere expectation that we'll be able to achieve double-digit margins of NAFTA once we get that number. I can see from the side of my eye that Richard is having apoplectic reactions to my assertions. But I think that the transformation should allow us to effectively yield the best-in-class margins out of NAFTA, and that remains a key objective.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That's actually very helpful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Patrick Hummel from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Hummel - UBS AG (Broker)", "Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions, please. The first one, can you give us an update on where we are and in terms of potential disposal of your supplier businesses? There was obviously some news from Samsung that negotiations are being delayed due to their Galaxy Note 7 issue. And then there was some additional news on Comau, some interest from Shanghai Electric. I was just wondering if you can comment on where we are with those two assets, or in general, whether we should expect a closure of a deal in the fourth quarter for any of those businesses.", "And my second question is regarding the capacity utilization in pickup trucks. Obviously, you're still running at full capacity. We heard on the other hand from Ford that they are idling some plants also for the F-150 production. I was just wondering if you can give us your latest views on how your utilization is going to look like in the fourth quarter and how you would explain the differences between the three Detroit players and in terms of utilization and production in the fourth quarter. Thank you.", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Just to put your mind at rest, I'm not going to comment on plant utilization out of our Detroit three. If you have any questions about with the impact of that is, I suggest you go back and read the Capital Junkie presentation that was made in May of last year.", "I can only give you my views about what the utilization of our asset is in NAFTA, both the Mexican plant in Saltillo and the plant in Warren that we have in Detroit. Both of them are running flat out. I have no indications that will suggest that we're going to take production down in Q4. I think our work continues making sure that we introduce the new 1500 properly in the early part of 2018. But certainly our forecast is not to reduce capacity utilization. So you can use whatever definition of capacity you like, but we're over 100% of that number.", "In terms of your opening remarks about asset disposal, just to be clear, I have never, to the best of my knowledge, ever indicated that either one of the assets that you made reference to are for sale. I've never made reference to a particular deal with Samsung, nor would I be courageous enough to suggest that Samsung is having issues with batteries as it connects to the 7 series. I think those are internal issues of Samsung and I'm sure they'll resolve them.", "From our standpoint, I can only tell you that as it is true for most businesses, there are a continuous number of approaches that are made into the house from a variety of sources that are potential interest in other sales or combinations of some of our assets. Those discussions do continue from time to time. Based on what I know today, there is nearly 100% certainty that no deal will happen in Q4 of this year.", "Patrick Hummel - UBS AG (Broker)", "Okay. Very clear. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will now move to Monica Bosio from Banca IMI. Please go ahead.", "Monica Bosio - Banca IMI", "Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I'm wrong but I believe that aside from 2016 the market is focusing on what could happen in 2017. And we know that the NAFTA market is top-ish, is at the top. If I have understood well the pricing is still quite disciplined.", "I'm just trying to figure out and to try to model the room for further improvement in NAFTA in margins, not on the long-term but in 2017. And I would also like to ask your feelings on Europe. What kind of growth are you expecting for the automotive market in Europe in 2017? I've spoken with some players and they are telling me 2% or 3%, is it right?", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Yeah. By the way, and to the extent that it's a forecast for next year by definition wrong, but I think our estimate will not be consistent and is significantly different from the 2% to 3% that you've heard from our competitors. So I think there's broad agreement that the market will be marginally up in 2016. I think if you use 3% as a guide, you will not be off.", "In terms of your 2017 numbers I was \u2013 my suggestion, and I think Richard would concur, is that we would wait until the January call when we give you the full rendition of 2016 for us to give you a more intelligent view on how 2017 is shaping up. I don't see any sort of drastic or draconian movements other than sort of range shifting at the top end of the NAFTA market. I think I have always had the view that this market is capable of ranging between 16.5 million and 18 million SAARs. I think we need to wait for the conclusion of 2016 to make a more intelligent assessment as to where that market will be next year. But we don't expect it to be off so materially that it would change our views about portfolio shifts or our market share ambitions for next year.", "Monica Bosio - Banca IMI", "Does margins in NAFTA will continue to go higher 2017, thanks to the mix?", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Well, we have made it an absolute case here inside this house to make sure that we effectively shore up the margin shortfall in NAFTA that we've had against our competitors. It is \u2013 it continues to be the single largest shortcoming that this Group has against the competitor class and it needs to be cured and I think 2018 is a good year to get it done.", "Monica Bosio - Banca IMI", "Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. We will now move to Martino De Ambroggi from Equita. Please go ahead.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Good afternoon, everybody. One more question on net debt, because we did the second time, you are improving the operating guidance confirming a net debt guidance. I understand it's just below \u20ac5 billion, so it's not a precise indication and I know you are able to reverse the net working capital in Q4. But the improving EBIT confirming net debt is mainly due to non-recurring cash-outs that you had during the year due to the forex translation effect or what else?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "The main reason, Martino, as you mentioned, is the Brazilian real. Because compared to our initial guidance that translation impact, as I mentioned before, is about \u20ac800 million. So as we've improved our operating performance we're offsetting that impact and maintaining the cash flow guidance.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay. So the non-recurring cost and well costs you're recording during the year or last year had no impact, significant impact?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "No, we have no significant impact because they're basically related to liabilities that have a pretty long tail on them. And so we don't expect any significant \u2013 we don't recognize any significant impact on our guidance for the year.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay. And on NAFTA region on that EBIT bridge, industrial costs during the last quarter were the most important driver for Q3 performance. I understand the efficiencies and the lower warranties, but could you elaborate on it in order to understand to what extent this can be considered recurring may be to see maybe not the same amount but a similar impact going forward.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Yeah. I think as we're aware, clearly, as we've been talking about working very diligently on the cost equation, our purchasing savings year-to-date in NAFTA touching 3% of our buy which is a much better performance than we've had historically. I think as we continue to focus on product costs we'll continue to see a positive impact also through 2017.", "On the warranty side, we've had a number of issues on some product launches in the past as you're aware that have cost us a lot of money in terms of warranty spending. I think we're starting to see more stability in our vehicle park vis-\u00e0-vis warranty and so that is another area of focus which can help to improve our margins going forward as well.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay. Then on Alfa, I didn't see any update on Alfa Romeo.", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "It's going well. The fact that we have not \u2013 that we haven't isolated it doesn't \u2013 there's nothing nefarious about this. We're in the process now of rolling out the Giulia on a global basis. It's not happened in the U.S. yet. It will come to the U.S. in Q4 of this year. As you know, or you may know the car has received a number of awards it's been recognized as one of the best technical launches that have \u2013 that this group has ever carried out in its history. So I think you need \u2013 it will get traction of the market and starts getting distribution, it will be in China hopefully in Q1 of next year, Q1 or Q2. And so it's an ongoing story. We have a big launch coming up in Q4 of this year with the first UV off the same architecture being launched. Hopefully, we'll see it in Los Angeles. And then it will be available for rollout in Q1 of next year. So the plans are going as expected. I am incredibly pleased. I am telling you honestly, apart from the fact that I think the cars that we have launched are bar none probably the best vehicles we've built in a long time.", "But I'm encouraged by the versatility of the architecture that was planned at the time in which the Giulia was launched. I think it's proved out to be all and more than we expected and I think its utilization across a wide range of applications within the group is probably the most beneficial thing we've done from a technical development here in a long time and I think its ramifications are yet to be seen. But I think we now have the basis on which we can build a phenomenal rear-wheel, all-wheel-drive environment which may spill over in some forms even as far as Jeeps. So I am delighted. But other than that, I have really nothing to add. Let's watch and let's see what happens at the end of the year.", "Martino De Ambroggi - Equita SIM SpA", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Alberto Villa from Intermonte. Please go ahead.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Yes. Good morning. Good afternoon. Some question from my side as well. The first one is on the debt expiring in the fourth quarter of this year, are you planning to issue new debt or you are considering to lower the overall gross debt and that would probably reflect in lower...", "Richard Keith Palmer - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Yeah. We have already repaid the euro bond on the 17th of October with \u2013 out of cash. We have another Swiss franc bond of about 400 million that we would also pay with cash and then we have the MCS coupon that we'll pay with cash too in Q4, so about \u20ac1.6 billion of reduction in gross debt from cash in Q4.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Okay, thanks. Second question is on the passenger car agreement, you are planning to have in the U.S. market, is there any update on that and did you change any plan considering maybe a different view on the market development going forward for passenger cars in North America or is still on the (43:09) agenda?", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "No, look, it's still on the agenda. I have nothing to announce because we haven't finalized anything. But I remain \u2013 I mean, the only reason why we have looked at the passenger car market with some degree of skepticism is because of the pricing power associated with our position and I think we find a cost-effective solution to our objectives, then I think we will execute it. And I think our distribution network is quite capable of turning that into a successful venture.", "But this is a market which is now \u2013 and I'd have to go back and look at quarterly performance, but I think it's been coming down now in terms of relevance in the U.S. market for a number of sequential quarters and I think we need to recognize that this is not a fashion shift from passenger cars into utility vehicles and pickup trucks. I think there is a structural change and I think we've adapted our industrial footprint to reflect what we consider to be a permanent change and I think we need to rely on the economies of scale and capital deployed and invested by others to give us the desired objective. But it's a matter of time we will find somebody.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Okay. But put another way, if you don't reach an agreement, is that changing your targets in any fashion or not materially?", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "To be perfectly honest in the scheme of things given our objective of making \u20ac9 billion by 2018, I think, it would be a rounding error if we found that. That's not really the big issue. I think the important thing for us was to preserve the uniqueness of the rear-wheel-drive offering that we have across fundamentally four brands which are Alfa, Maserati, Dodge and potentially Jeep. And I think that that solution has been nailed down internally by focusing on the (45:13) architecture which underpins the development of Alfa. And as long as that's been secured and I think it continues to deliver as we expected and I think our search for a front-wheel-drive passenger car solution to deal with very much of American problem has got limited impact on our ambitions.", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Okay. Just another very trivial final one. On the cover of your presentation there is a car that I can't recall, is the second on the left from the top-line, which model is it?", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "That's a Toro from...", "Alberto Villa - Intermonte Sim SpA", "Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, everybody. A couple questions. Just, first, I was hoping you can talk a little bit about your strategy for NAFTA trucks, and more specifically J.D. Power reported that incentives on Ram rose to around 16% of average transaction prices in September and October, which obviously is up quite a bit from the 12%-ish that we saw in this timeframe last year. So it would seem on the surface that achieving this capacity utilization requires quite a bit more pricing, and if you can comment on whether that's correct?", "And related to that, can you \u2013 could you remind us...", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Rod, if I can just give you an answer on the incentives. I think you are a follower of this marketing, and you know that our main competitors in this area have put on a variety of initiatives to try and incentivize dealers to sell trucks. We have been absent from those strategies and we were absent until the last 60 days, 90 days, if you include October as a four month.", "But certainly in the last three months, we have been active and have in part replicated some of the strategies that our competitors have used to focus on particular section of the inventory on hand that dealers to try and \u2013 motivate the network to try and deal with trucks, because we have taken a very hard look at our level of penetration in some of the key truck areas in the U.S. and we have been deficient, and I think a lot of this has been because of the fact that we had not emulated people who have had a longer history and better success that we've had in the sector. So I think we try to emulate and I think in some cases we may have been insufficiently accurate in terms of the target area that we're going after, which may have caused some distortions. We spent a lot of time with the management team yesterday before \u2013 so they're focusing on the quarter end to try and understand exactly how to pitch the position for the next 90 days.", "We feel relatively comfortable that the system, broadly speaking, that we've put in place is something ought to be preserved. I think we need to sharpen the focus of the intervention. I think the numbers that you've mentioned in terms of the 60% thing is reflective of \u2013 and I can't comment on the J.D. Power number in and by itself, I just don't know. But it's reflective of the impact on a particular piece of the inventory on the ground and not necessarily hopefully.", "I think we need to be very careful about reading too much into those numbers, because they do not impact 100% of the population of trucks that will be disposed off, but they are used as instigators of increased activity in truck. We have seen no negative impact as a result of all this in our overall performance, and the forecast that we have in place for the remainder of the year does rely on the continuation of a focused structure that was started about 90 days ago.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And I was hoping you can also remind us of the magnitude of what you're looking to achieve, it's Sterling Heights and Toledo, it looks like at least while they're making passenger cars, Sterling was 330,000-unit plant and Toledo North might have been capable of about 200,000, so when you flip over from car to truck, do you have roughly the same magnitude of capacity available?", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "The answer is yes. On trucks, it is different. On Toledo, Toledo will go \u2013 will potentially go as high as 280,000 on nominal capacity.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, that's very helpful. And just lastly, any comments or color on the financial impact of the Unifor agreement?", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "The only thing I can tell you is that obviously on the economics we were followers because we were bound by the GM deal. I think that when you look at the impact on overall cost as a result of the deal and you combine it with the devaluation of the Canadian dollars, both Canadian plants in Canada remain competitive.", "So I think I feel relatively satisfied that we reached a satisfactory objective and advises piece on the funnel for the next four years, which are pretty important years as you well know. So I think the cost impact is manageable and certainly falls within our plan expectations for FCA.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Stephen Reitman from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Please go ahead.", "Stephen M. Reitman - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions, please. On fleet we saw that the average of fleet in Q3, 21%, was less than the nine month rate, which I think is running about 24%. What is actually happening within the fleet mix? I think you said at the Q2 stage that rental was down from 85% to 75% of the mix. As you run down and stop production of the Dart and the Chrysler 200, can we expect that proportion to fall further in the coming quarters?", "And secondly, question on Alfa Romeo. Just again if you could talk a little bit about the ramp-up. From what I can see it still seems to be running at relatively low levels from its own plants and I can understand that you haven't done the U.S. launch yet.", "But it seems to me that \u2013 it looks to me the production of the Levante is actually higher on a monthly basis at the moment. And of course the \u2013 but I guess the volume aspirations on the Giulia are significantly greater than they are for the Levante. So when can we expect to see Giulia production getting to sort of like a cruising rate consistent with your targets for Alfa Romeo's volumes? Thank you.", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Yeah. I mean the cruising rate for the sedan without station wagon is probably between 75,000 and 100,000 a year. I can tell you right now the Levante is an ambition, even a full capacity utilization is over 40% of that number.", "Stephen M. Reitman - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)", "Yeah.", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "So \u2013 and I mean I wish you're right that I was producing Levante at a faster clip. But I made better money on the Levante than I do on Giulia. But I think Giulia is going through a different process. You understand that Maserati has an established distribution network and something that we've built up between 2010 and now is the reason why both the Quattroporte and the Ghibli have been historically successful.", "I think that it's walking into sort of established hands in terms of distribution and I think the \u2013 Richard made reference to the fact that we got 18,000 orders in-house. We probably got as many for the Giulia, I just don't know enough today given the fact that most of the attention is focused on the U.S. and the introduction of the vehicle for the U.S. market which remains its key main markets for distribution. And so, I think the best thing we can do is give you a better update when we get together for Q4. The answer to your three questions, I don't have an answer, but maybe Richard does.", "Nobody can hear him. Can you hear him?", "Stephen M. Reitman - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)", "Well, I missed that. But it's now \u2013 I can hear you now.", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Okay.", "Joseph Veltri - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "When you lost?", "Stephen M. Reitman - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)", "I didn't hear it when you turned, when Sergio turned to Richard, we didn't hear anything from whatever he said.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Okay. Sorry. Must be my mic. So we've gone down from 80% to about 75% on rent-a-car, so slightly down. I think obviously bringing the mix of commercial and government up as a total compared to our fleet volume is a target we talked about.", "And we're focused on I think the two key items there for us to continue now are to \u2013 basically we've completed our van lineup. So the van gives us a complete product lineup for commercial customers. And going into 2018 as we've mentioned having more pickup capacity would allow us also to satisfy the fleet customer's demand on pickup which we struggle to do today, because we favor retail in the U.S. and also Canadian volume which have higher margin. So I think as we realign our capacity we're going to be able to continue to work on improving the fleet mix.", "Stephen M. Reitman - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)", "And do you have any estimate? When you mentioned \u2013 obviously you mentioned \u2013 you've spoken earlier about the differential about trying to close the gap between your U.S. operation of those of Ford and General Motors. What do you think, do you have any kind of guess for the margin impact is of the reliance on the rental versus your peers closing that?", "Richard Keith Palmer - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "No, I don't \u2013 it's very much dependent on individual customers and individual mix in the sales mix. So I don't really want to give you a number, because I think it would be a little bit too much of an estimate frankly.", "Stephen M. Reitman - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "But clearly, our ability to sell more truck and more vans to commercial customers would be a positive impact on profitability compared to our current mix.", "Stephen M. Reitman - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Yeah. I'm going to hazard a guess, and Richard is going to cringe when I give you this, but based on what I've seen and I'm going to get crucified by our commercial people. So I warn you before. But I think there's probably \u2013 the difference could be as high as probably 80% more margin out of a other commercial fleet account and it would be out of rent-a-car and it is purely volume based, it's simply the size of the purchasing power that the rental car companies have on OEMs.", "And so, as much as I \u2013 and by the way before we sort of ignore their relevance to us, they were a crucial element and continue to be a crucial element of our of operations and we're thankful for them sticking around and sticking with us back as \u2013 as far as back as 2009 and 2010 where we didn't necessarily, it looks like the best possible OEM in town but they were loyal and supportive of the transition that we were making, so we owe them a lot but they are very tough on margins and I think anytime that we can supplement their volume with commercial fleet volume, we do phenomenally better. And so nobody is suggesting that we should do \u2013 we should replace them but I think we should certainly reduce the reliance on the overall portfolio by focusing more on the commercial accounts.", "Stephen M. Reitman - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Philippe Houchois from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Yes, good morning. Thank you. Two questions for me, please. The first one is we waited for a long, long time (58:19) the gross cash position to come down and the cost of care to come down as a result. I think we're looking about \u20ac18 billion, \u20ac20 billion a while back and we are now \u20ac23 billion, \u20ac24 billion.", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "We are going to use \u20ac1.5 billion in the fourth quarter to be happy. We are going to use \u20ac1.5 billion to pay debt.", "Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Okay.", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Let them pay it off as soon as it comes due, it gets \u2013 somebody cut a check and send them merrily on their way.", "Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies International Ltd.", "But you refinance it again. So what you are looking at in a model for and the 2017...", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "I haven't \u2013 excuse me, excuse me. I don't think we have issued anything in a while. I am looking at Richard, Richard, you get out of the Street raising bonds without telling me. We haven't raised any money in the last 12 months to the best of my knowledge.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Philippe, you are getting me into trouble, right?", "Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies International Ltd.", "I know there is a slight point of contention between you two so that's why I am asking. Okay. The other question is more generally if you can give us a view on the industry in general, at what point do you think this industry is going to start to write down its investment in combustion engine as a result of the loss of value-add as we downsize engines and a growing electrification of powertrain.", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "That is by the way a phenomenally difficult question to answer for two reasons. One, I think that the transition from the current state to a future state is not going to \u2013 and I am talking about the next decade and anything \u2013 famous last words, but the ability to call transition in the next decade. We are going to go through a phase where I think combustion will not lose its relevance in its entirety but where I think electrification will combined with combustion to provide solutions to the OEMs. And so I do not think that combustion engines will lose their appeal, they will lose their relevance, but they will not lose the usefulness in terms of the portfolio.", "I think whoever thinks that electrification will actually replace the bulk of the automotive market, I think, is probably being overly optimistic. It will take time to transition and the transition will include combustion. And I think that given our runway, the write-down will happen naturally as a result of normal write-down processes. I mean, now these assets have got long lives on our books and I think they will just come off through natural depreciation.", "Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies International Ltd.", "At the same time if you look at it differently, in terms of value added or if you shrink the size of your engine and you end up buying more and more of the value-adds from suppliers to meet CO2 and other emission regulation, your value-add goes to zero and that normally if you do an asset impairment that should lead you to write down your asset base. Am I wrong in thinking that way?", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "You're probably not. But I think you are doing two things, one, you are overestimating the speed of change and secondly, you are overestimating the size of the asset build that's happening here, and we are not talking about numbers that are that large.", "The problem that you raised, by the way, is a more \u2013 is truly significant from a strategic standpoint because what's buried in your question, I hope, is the fact that the real essence of an OEM, it is the definition of what we do for a living is on the table because if you're right, and I think you are in the mid to long-term, then I think we need to be able to redefine our core skills to reflect a much higher level of disintermediation and production than we have had so far. Because the only thing that's really left in our hands and that we've managed in a very proprietary way is combustion.", "And so the issue is a much deeper question and it only reinforces the debate of being \u2013 that I started, that's probably being going on even before I started on utilization of capital in an industry which is going through a phenomenal set of transformations. And I think we need to think about that long and hard as we work through the next phase of development for the business because the relevance of brands is on the table. It is undisputed in my mind for brands like Ram, Jeep, the premium brands. It is a much more difficult analysis to carry out on the long-term for what I would call more generic brands, which I think are prone to being commoditized and I think that that is a much bigger question that we need to deal with.", "And I don't have an answer at the end of this quarter for you on that question. I'll just try to focus on making as much money as I could and warning to make sure that we execute on our plan. But your question is well taken and maybe we can have a discussion over a beer on that issue anytime you like.", "Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Charles Winston from Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.", "Charles A. Winston - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.", "Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. Charles from Redburn here. Just two left from me. We talk quite a bit about pricing in the NAFTA region and in the U.S. and obviously it is quite clear that that small \u20ac40 million entry into your walk is a net figure. Could you perhaps break that down a little bit and talk about what the underlying pricing impact would have been perhaps in the U.S. only. I other words, (64:24) try to strip out that adverse FX impact if that's in any way possible.", "And the second question is just in the LATAM region. Industrial costs, big step-up again, again as we started seeing the currency move, if the BRL remains at these levels, are you going to be able to get back into profit in that region?", "In other words, these \u2013 are the new models in Pernambuco going to be enough to offset what still looks to be at least at current exchange rates quite a vicious FX impact on the input cost side? Thank you.", "Richard Keith Palmer - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "So, Charles, on the pricing question, the U.S. number I estimate will be about \u20ac100 million positive and then we're offsetting a piece of that with the impact on the Canadian dollar negativity on the other side.", "So the U.S. is in part subsidizing the impact of exchange on the Canadian dollar and on the Mexican peso. Both markets are trying to offset that impact with their own actions as we discussed and Canada has been very active in that regard in the last 18 months but it's a big devaluation, so that is eating into some of the positivity we have on the U.S. side.", "Your second question on Brazil, I think we're building a product portfolio for Jeep in Brazil localized there to be able to be competitive notwithstanding the impacts of exchange and clearly in normal market circumstances I think we would be making strong margins as we have in the past out of the installation that we put into Pernambuco. The real impact of the real obviously is as the volumes in Brazil go down, our ability to export into the rest of Latin America is tougher than obviously it would have been. So that is clearly a negative impact in the scheme of things on our profitability in Latin America given that we would have volume in Latin America outside of Brazil. But I think to answer your question, we can make money at these levels of exchange. Our focus is clearly to launch the third Jeep in Pernambuco and continue to run that installation to basically help us to return to breakeven and positive in the beginning of next year.", "So that is a feasible target obviously for us to start to make the sort of margins we have historically made in Latin America we need to see some improvement in the Brazilian market conditions which we've seen fast turnarounds in Brazil in the past of double-digit CAGRs off lows. And so I think we're optimistic that we can see a recovery in the Brazilian market in the beginning of 2017.", "Charles A. Winston - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.", "Yeah. Thank you.", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Just to shed some light on this. I mean I've been listening to Richard explain this. You need to understand in the absence of a startup in Pernambuco, our South American operations would've been in a loss. But I think the more worrisome part of about being in a loss is that we would have deprived consistent with what most other people are doing, we would have deprived South America of any new product launches during the time of the crisis.", "And I think the Pernambuco solution allowed us to do two things. One is to modernize the architecture, secondly to introduce Jeep in the market. And I think as we have seen in Argentina, which has recovered at an incredible rate from several years of crisis certainly based on my last interface with the authorities in Brazil which was no older than a month ago. My indications that I think we've hit rock bottom, months of presidential issues has been resolved that I think that there is \u2013 there appears to be consensus, at least the political level about moving the agenda forward, and I would not be surprised if we saw the beginnings of a \u2013 the slight recovery in Q4 this year, hopefully better performance in 2017.", "Having said this, I think we are \u2013 we, as a group, are better off having done what we've done, because of the benefit on the rest of the region as a result of the startup of the plant.", "Charles A. Winston - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from Richard Hilgert from Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Richard Hilgert - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Thanks for taking my questions this morning and good morning to everyone, and good afternoon. Just to follow on a little bit on the electrification question posed earlier. My question was more centered around given the company's current spending situation and capital investments that it's intending, and given the industry's seeming to now be accelerating more towards that electrification, I wonder if there's been any plans or thoughts put into changing over to an additional electrified powertrain approach. I understand that hybrid is one way to go, but it seems like with Daimler, making a commitment to battery capacity now just announced this week, Volkswagen's announcements earlier about its commitment into battery electrification, things are accelerating on the full electrification side?", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "I'm not sure that it's fully accelerating on the full electrification, it certainly is accelerating on the electrification side, and I think that based on our assessment, we strongly have the resources and have worked on projects that will make these a reality certainly within the same timeframe that both of our German competitors have announced.", "The great thing about \u2013 the great thing \u2013 the bad thing and a great thing about electrification is that most of it will rely on components being provided by suppliers to the industry and not by us. The single largest drawback to electrification to us as OEMs is that we're no longer in control of the components side; all batteries will be made by others.", "And so it's really a question of capacity and access to that capacity, everything else including the technology associated with providing electrical powertrain is within our reach and certainly supplemental by the relevant Tier 1 supplier. So I am not concerned about that becoming a disadvantage to FCA, I think we are going to have a long debate about the rate of change associated with what's happening here. I think we need to be very careful about not being \u2013 not being overly optimistic about the rate of change. Having said this, I think we need to be prepared and the reality is that we have the first \u2013 the only minivan in the marketplace that is fully hybrid. So I have \u2013 I think we need to be careful about sort of believing the headline. The real substance of this market at least for this year and next year is going to be to remember something else and resources are being devoted to the development of alternative powertrains at a rate which is comparable to some of the other OEMs.", "Richard Hilgert - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Okay. Very good. My second question has to deal with the quality of the product coming out it seems like the last three years there's been some personnel changes and recognizing the consumer reports what they call a quality issue might not necessarily be from an engineering perspective a quality issue. But just curious what's the managerial approach to now locking in a better way of improving what's coming out in the product portfolio. You talked a little bit about the launches of the Giulia and how well that's been. Is there some implementation of an approach that this will transfer from Giulia to other model launches going forward?", "Sergio Marchionne - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Without getting involved into our intimate entrails of the way in which we run the business, I can only tell you there is a selection of the leader that we put in place that was carefully thought through. I think the \u2013 he has been well-trained and running both purchasing on a global scale and North America manufacturing over the last seven years. So he understands the problem from both implementation side in terms of manufacturing and the acquisition side in terms of supplier choices for the group. The more important thing to me I think we've \u2013 we have now externalized the benchmark evaluation process to other people. I think this was very much of an inside exercise. It was a \u2013 it was always done using internal parameters.", "I think we've learned the hard way that external valuations are perhaps more relevant to the way in which we look at quality from an internal standpoint. That's been put in place. They governed the launch of the Alfa Giulia, but more importantly governed the launch of the minivan. And I think they were very instrumental. These third-party agencies were very instrumental in bringing about suggestions and changes to the way even in which the product was configured and initially to make sure that we met customer expectations. And I do expect that that benefit will work its way through the rankings.", "I think we have had to learn the hard way that perhaps having engineers although not necessarily associated with either designer or manufacturing, assess the quality of the work of other engineers may not have been necessary the best way out. We've learned the hard way. We've moved away from this. I think we're in a much better place now than we've been in a long time.", "Richard Hilgert - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Okay. Thanks again.", "Operator", "That will conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Joe Veltri for any additional or closing remarks.", "Joseph Veltri - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "Thank you, Elaine.
