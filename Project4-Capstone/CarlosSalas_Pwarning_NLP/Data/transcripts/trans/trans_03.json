As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.", "Todd Ernst - Vice President-Investor Relations", "All right, thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of the website.", "With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby, and then we'll move on to questions.", "Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Todd. Good morning everyone. A little over a year ago, we laid out a strategy to return the company to growth by evolving our approach to international markets and increasing investments in key technologies to better position the company for the future. Our strong growth during the third quarter reflects the traction that we are gaining from this strategy. In the quarter, our revenue increased by 6% driven primarily by missiles and IDS, as well as from an increased contribution from Raytheon|Websense.", "International revenue, which grew by 13% over last year's third quarter, rose to 32% of the company's total revenue. This is a record level for the company and was driven by customers across various regions turning to Raytheon's advanced technology to address the rapidly-evolving threats. I would also note that our growth was backed by strong cash flow generation reinforcing our strong financial foundation. Domestic revenue also increased in the quarter and was up a solid 3% driven in part by classified.", "Turning now to bookings. In the third quarter, international drove 26% of our total bookings. Key international awards included the second phase of the Air Defense Operations Center for Qatar, plus missiles, training and radars for a number of other international customers. Domestically, bookings included training, classified, as well as various missile programs including AIM-9X, the Joint Standoff Weapon, and SM-3.", "Given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectation for a strong finish to the year, we are now raising our full-year 2015 bookings outlook to $25.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million, which translates into a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1 for the year. This is $1 billion increase to the prior bookings range that we gave you last quarter, driven by strong demand from our global customers. Further, it sets the stage for solid top line growth in 2016 which Toby will talk about in a moment.", "In the quarter, IIS received good news on two key awards, one from the U.S. Air Force, and the other from the Department of Homeland Security. For the U.S. Air Force contract, which is often referred to as NISSC, Raytheon will be providing products and sustainment services that support NORAD and its mission to provide air, missile and space threat warnings, as well as critical command and control capabilities. NISSC has a $700 million ceiling value over five years.", "This competitive win was initially awarded to Raytheon in April of this year, but was protested. The protest was resolved in our favor late in the third quarter. I would add that this award follows a series of recent programs wins at IIS for high value-added services. These wins reflect our modernization through sustainment strategy.", "As for the Department of Homeland Security award, Raytheon was selected to be the prime contractor for the development and sustainment of the National Cyber Security Protection System, a system providing the vital infrastructure that assists more than 100 federal, civilian and government agencies with the protection of their networks against advanced cyber threats. This award has a ceiling value in excess of $1 billion over a seven year period. While this too has been protested, the customer recognized our compelling cyber strength when making the award, another strong validation of our cyber strategy and capabilities.", "In addition, we have been supporting our long term growth strategy by increasing investments in our business and advanced technologies. Consistent with our discussions on prior calls, IR&D is being directed to areas that we believe will be future growth markets, including directed energy and hypersonics and undersea to name just a few. Investments in these technologies will position us well for the future, as our customers look for capabilities to counter increasingly sophisticated threats that are developing on the horizon.", "I'd like to shift gears and take a minute to touch on our capital deployment strategy. We continue forward with a balanced approach and we are on track to achieve our $1 billion share buyback target for 2015 that we outlined back in July. After the close of the quarter, we did announce a small acquisition that fills a cyber security technology gap and enhances our position in high value managed security services, one of the fastest growing areas in the cyber security market. This is consistent with our go-forward strategy of pursuing smaller targeted bolt-on acquisitions.", "Before concluding, I would like to note that the Websense integration is on track. As you will recall, we are currently in the process of combining our legacy Raytheon Cyber Products business with the Websense acquisition that we completed in May. The business segment had solid margin performance in the quarter and we continue to work to integrate Raytheon Cyber Products technology into the Websense architecture.", "To close, I want to say how proud I am of the Raytheon team and their hard work and dedication that has allowed us to deliver growth despite sequestration and I want to thank them for their focus on performance which benefits our customers, our company and our shareholders.", "With that, let me turn it over to Toby.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks starting with the third quarter highlights and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would please turn to page three. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the third quarter with sales, EPS and operating cash flow all at or better than our expectations. We had solid bookings in the third quarter of $5.3 billion. Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 6% led by our IDS, missiles and Raytheon|Websense businesses. EPS from continuing operations was $1.47, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes.", "And operating cash flow of $1.1 billion was better than our prior guidance driven by the timing of collections. Third quarter 2015 operating cash flow was significantly higher than last year's third quarter primarily due to the improvement in working capital and the timing of cash taxes paid in the quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for $250 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 7 million shares for $750 million.", "Turning now to page four. Let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. Company bookings for the third quarter were $5.3 billion. On a year-to-date basis, bookings were $17.4 billion, an increase of approximately $425 million over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing four-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.06, and as Tom just mentioned, given the strength of our overall bookings year-to-date, we now expect full year 2015 bookings to be approximately $25.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million, an increase of over $1 billion from the outlook on the last call in July. This provide a solid foundation for sales growth in 2016.", "For the quarter, international was 26% of our total company bookings and on a year-to-date basis was 37%. For the year, we expect international to be approximately 35% of total bookings. Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $33.6 billion compared to $33.2 billion at the end of the third quarter of last year. And on a funded basis, backlog was $24.4 billion, an increase of almost $1.5 billion compared to last year's third quarter. We expect 2015 year-end total backlog to be up between 4% and 8% from year-end 2014.", "If you now move to page five. Sales in the third quarter of 2015 were strong primarily due to the performance at IDS and missiles. Looking now at sales by business, IDS had third quarter 2015 net sales of $1.5 billion, an increase of approximately 7% compared to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to two recent international Patriot awards.", "Missiles had net sales of $1.6 billion in the third quarter 2015, an increase of approximately 11%. This increase was driven by higher sales spread across various production programs including the TOW missile program and certain missile defense programs.", "In the third quarter 2015, IIS had net sales of $1.4 billion, down slightly when compared with the same quarter last year. SAS had net sales of $1.4 billion. The change versus last year was driven by volume on international tactical radar programs.", "And for Raytheon|Websense, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, third quarter 2014 included the results for only Raytheon Cyber Products.", "Moving ahead to page six, overall the company continues perform well. Our operating margin was 12.1% for the total company and 12.3% on a business segment basis. Year-to-date operating margin was 12.9% at both the total company and business segment level.", "As we discussed on the last few earnings calls. Compared to 2014, our margins for 2015 have been impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher investments. We continue to invest in ourselves with the objective of positioning the company for future growth.", "So, looking now at the business margins. The change in margins at IDS was primarily driven by a change in program mix on international Patriot programs nearing completion, which is similar to what we've experienced in the past when we've completed certain programs and ramped up on others. We expect IDS margins to be strong in the fourth quarter driven by strong performance as well as from an expected contractual modification.", "The change in margins at IIS was primarily driven by a change in program mix and acquisition related cost. Missiles margins increased 40 basis points in the third quarter 2015, primarily due to a change in program mix. SAS margins were down in the quarter as expected, compared with the same period last year primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies in the third quarter of 2014.", "And at Raytheon|Websense, the third quarter 2015 operating margin was driven by strong operating performance as well as the timing of restructuring expenses in the quarter. We expect restructuring cost to increase in the fourth quarter, reducing margins sequentially but still on track to meet the full year 2015 margin outlook.", "Turning now to page seven, third quarter 2015 EPS was $1.47, better than expected driven by improved margin primarily at missiles and SAS. As you look at the EPS walk, operations is being impacted by the investments we are making in the business and program mix. These are largely offset by our reduced share count. The timing of tax related items and non-cash expenses related to the Raytheon|Websense acquisition make up the difference.", "On page eight, we've tightened the full range for full year 2015 net sales, increasing the high end by $100 million. We now expect net sales to be between $23 billion and $23.3 billion. As we have done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of this update, the FAS/CAS adjustment for the year decreased by $12 million from $197 million to $185 million, or an unfavorable impact of $0.03 per share. We're reaffirming our full year 2015 EPS outlook of $6.47 to $6.62. While this outlook is unchanged from our prior guidance, I would note that we were able to absorb the impact of the unfavorable $0.03 FAS/CAS adjustment.", "And as a reminder, we have not included in our 2015 guidance the potential extension of the R&D tax credit. If the legislation passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 130 basis points and our EPS by about $0.11 per share. As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for $250 million in the quarter and now see our diluted share count to be approximately 305 million shares for 2015.", "Operating cash flow in the third quarter was strong primarily due to the timing of collections. We continue to see our full year 2015 operating cash flow outlook coming in between $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. And as you can see on page nine, we've included guidance by business.", "We've increased and tightened the full year sales outlook at both IDS and missiles. At IDS, this is driven by the program mix and performance to date that I discussed earlier. Missiles has also experienced better than expected year to date growth. In addition, we tightened the full year sales range for IIS and SAS.", "Now turning to margins. We've increased the range and expect higher full year operating margin performance for missiles and SAS. The strong year to date results exceeded our prior estimates. We lowered the range of our full year operating margin guidance for IDS driven by the change in program mix and performance to date.", "Now turning to next year. As we have done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2016 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. However, as we sit here today, we currently see strong sales growth for 2016 at 3% to 4% over the midpoint of our 2015 outlook driven in part by some new development awards we are expecting.", "We expect segment margins to be flat to up for 2016 compared to 2015 excluding the eBorders settlement in 2015, and depending upon the mix from higher volume in 2016. This positions us well going forward with further margin expansion over time as new development wins lead to production. I would also add that we currently expect FAS/CAS to improve in 2016 over 2015, which I'll talk about in a moment.", "In addition, we expect operating cash flow from continuing operations to be higher in 2016 versus 2015 after adjusting for the eBorder settlement. Of course, I want to caveat all this by saying our assumptions are based on a defense budget being approved in Washington before year end, thereby avoiding an extended CR or a government shutdown.", "So if you could please move to page 10. We have provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2016 as we've done in prior years. As I just mentioned, we expect to see improvement to the FAS/CAS adjustment in 2016 compared to 2015 given the current interest rate environment and asset returns. That said, and just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset returns won't be known until we close out 2015. We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our January year-end call.", "Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans, as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making smaller, targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs, and from time to time making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.", "And as a reminder, as we said on the second quarter earnings call in July, we increased our share buyback by $250 million from our original expectation, bringing the full year 2015 buyback to approximately $1 billion.", "In summary, we saw solid performance in the third quarter. Bookings were strong, our sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all at or above our expectations. And our strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow us to continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2016.", "With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please proceed.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Good morning, Tom, Toby.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Good morning.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I wondered if we might just kind of get a little bit more color on IDS. Obviously, it seems like the top line is quite strong. That has implications for the mix I think relative to your commentary about 2016 that you've sort of been hinting at recently. Should we think that you've got a little bit more top line with a little bit less favorable mix next year than what you were talking about before or is this sort of in line with where you were before?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Well look, Carter, let me talk about this year for a little minute because I think it's kind of a precursor heading into 2016. So for IDS, as I mentioned, we still expect margins in Q4 to be strong. We did however adjust our guidance. It does reflect, as you just suggested, an update in mix and our performance to date. Specifically, we are seeing more development work on programs like AMDR, and we have had some increase in our content on AWD.", "Combine that with the fact that we're still ramping up on some of our other large recent awards, which we've talked about in the past. They start out at lower margins. They expand their margins over time as they progress to this cycle and retire risk. So we're still seeing that mix issue impact us as we go through the balance of this year, okay. But that bodes well for the future, as those development programs move into production. And that thought is contemplated in the initial outlook that we gave you for 2016.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah, so there's no material change in the performance expectation of the EACs, it's more just the mix of the work you're saying.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "That is correct.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say it's development program driven growth that exceeded our expectations at IDS this year. And what that does lead us into opportunities in 2016, 2017 and 2018 as we transition those programs into production, on top of all of the Patriot production work that we are starting up on now, for example, Qatar program. So we have a very positive outlook for IDS. Just a reminder, both Toby and myself ran that business so we know all the levers in driving margin in the business. And we see clear signs and opportunities based on the mix that they have today moving into 2016 and 2017 and 2018.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. And then a quick follow up. I don't know if you can tell from a pro forma basis on the Raytheon|Websense top line, what it would have been like had you owned it or maybe break out what Raytheon Cyber Products maybe did in growth terms year over year? Do you have any color in that?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Well, the growth that we show obviously because we only had Cyber Products in last year's third quarter, is essentially all from the acquisition of Websense. And the way to think about it, it would have, to answer your question, it would have been flat year over year.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks for the color, guys.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much and good morning.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Good morning.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I wanted to ask \u2013 morning \u2013 to ask about missiles and this was sort of the second quarter in a row that you've increased the sales guidance there. And you were up I guess about 5% or 6% from where you were at the start of the year. And talk about really what's driving that. How much of it is coming from the Middle East? Kind of how sustainable that is and put some ties around that.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, I'll start and then obviously Tom can jump in here if he wants to add some color. So to your point, missile sales were up in the third quarter from prior year, double digits around 11%, and that's sequential growth as well. We do expect the missiles sales cadence to continue to improve into Q4, really driven by volume from our production programs. And it's really not one individual program as I mentioned in my opening comments. It's across multiple production programs, TOW, and some of the standard missile family of programs as well. For the total year, we see sales growth in the mid single digits. Obviously as you said, we have updated our guidance to reflect the favorable performance year to date in our outlook for Q4. But there's not one individual program and/or country if you will that's driving that. It's just a very strong portfolio of programs that's pushing the growth up in the missiles business.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Can I just jump on that? I mean, you did see there was a successful SM-3 launch this past week with our European coalition partners. And so we see a significant demand signal pull for missile defense missiles relative to our European partners outside of the US itself. And then if you go across the regions, you do know that there's significant turmoil in the Eastern Europe area, so we see demand signals there, obviously in the Middle East. But we're also starting to see demand signals in the Asia-Pacific region. We saw it initially in South Korea with Patriot orders, but we were also seeing it in the areas relative to replenishing the weapons that they have. So it's not just in one region, it's essentially across the globe that we're seeing these demand signal pulls.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. And I just -", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "And I think, just Seth, another thing that reinforces that, the bookings for the quarter, AIM-9X, Paveway, JSOW, spares, et cetera, right, SM-3. It's again, it's across that portfolio that we have in our missiles business.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great, okay thanks. Just as a real quick follow-up on a totally different topic, we heard a little earlier in the week about some delays from the government in executing undefinitized contract actions. Just wondering if you've seen anything similar.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I mean, these are \u2013 are you talking about UCAs?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "UCAs, yeah.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah, yeah and if those are having any impact on your platform.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I'll tell you, it is an area that we track in the business. It is something that is necessary especially relative to FMS contracts to shorten the period of getting on contract and starting to work the programs. We do track and try to drive the definitization of those UCAs as soon as possible. I mean, that's something we work with directly with the Department of Defense. And I can tell you I have my, I review those on a periodic basis to make sure that they're not getting out of control. I can tell you, the department wants to definitize them as soon as possible also, but it is a lot of work. And we just got to make sure that we work hand and glove together with the government to drive those to closure as soon as possible.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great, thanks. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please proceed.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thank you very much and good quarter, guys.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Cai.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "So your guidance on international of 35% orders kind of works out, looks like it's $2.6 billion in orders in the fourth quarter. That looks like a pretty big number. Could you give us some color on what's in there, any particular single large awards?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah. So, I'll give you at a high level, Cai. Unlike prior years, we don't have any binary $1 billion-plus type of awards whether it be international or domestic in the fourth quarter. So there is not one particular program or award that's driving it. We do have several programs in the $500 million range, plus or minus. And Tom, I don t know if you want to comment any more detail on.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean there's several Patriot related awards. We're also looking at the several C5I awards also. And this is not international, but the domestic air, some air traffic work. And then we already mentioned the missile company in terms of their portfolio of missiles being in demand on the international marketplace.", "I do want to mention something, go back to something that Toby said about the binaries. And in the past, we've always had one of these big $1 billion or multi-billion dollar binaries we were waiting on. One of the elements of our international strategy was to not just have one but to have three or four binaries, so that we were never relying on any given one. And that's actually the position, the great position we're in today. We don't just have one order we're waiting for to be able to achieve several billion dollars worth of international bookings. And it's kind of a different \u2013 it's a totally different feel here. It's a great feel, by the way, that we don't have to hang our hat on one big binary in any quarter. But the bottom line is the international strategy we put in place is paying off relative to that.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Terrific. Your R&D was up 100 basis points as a percent of sales. Maybe give us some color what you're spending on, where it should be for the year, and how much of that is recoverable under IR&D?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's all IR&D, so it's all recoverable depending on whether it's a cost plus contract in our rates or a firm fixed-price contract. So that's the answer to your first one. The areas that we've been concentrating on and we've been talking about this on the calls is high energy lasers. It's been a big area for us. We do see that as a new up and coming area. There's a lot of demand signal from multiple services.", "Also, the other big area is hypersonics. As the threat gets more and more sophisticated, it requires more, I would call it speed and agility to be able to get to the threat and hypersonics are becoming a big part of that. So we are investing in that. We've had some great successes in terms of wins on some advanced technology contracts with DARPA in the hypersonics area over the last four months.", "And then also, we're really engaging in the undersea area and really looking as that starts to expand and becoming an area of interest, especially relative to anti-access/area denial. We continue to invest in advanced EW, again driven by the need for a systems to counter the evolving threat. And we also see a demand, especially across the Middle East region for our C5ISR solutions. So we're continuing to invest in that product line.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "And Cai, I think your question about recoverability, think of it this way. About a quarter of that increase, at least in dollars, so about $15 million of that relates to Websense. So that obviously on the commercial side, not recoverable on US government contracts. But the balance of the increase is recoverable on our contracts.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please proceed.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "I wanted to go back to Carter's question on IDS, because I just wanted to make sure we understand what happened sort of Q3 to Q4. Is the change, the fact that the margins are lower in Q3, and you expect them to then increase in Q4, does that have to do more with timing on specific programs, particularly international ones or is it more increased spending in the quarter for things like AMDR? What changed from what you thought was going to happen a quarter ago?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "From Q3 to Q4, Doug?", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Well, no. In Q2, when you laid out your guidance, clearly, you had thought you would have higher margins earlier, and that's been pushed out. What changed there?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, so I think that a couple of things that \u2013 and I'll try not to be repetitive to Carter's question here. So the mix is changing, right, so we're seeing higher volume. But because of the higher levels of development work and some increases on AWD that are at lower margins, we're seeing that which is new compared to what we had expected before. The other thing too, we, as I mentioned in my comments, we do expect, which is not atypical, to have a contract modification that will result in income that we recognize in the fourth quarter, and the magnitude of that is a little less than what we had previously expected. So from a Q4 point of view and therefore a total year perspective, that those are the two major things that are driving the change.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And then when you look at international, it's a lot of focus on things that the binaries, as you were referring to them, and those often are Patriot systems, things like that. If you look beyond it, I'm trying to get a sense of what other areas, such as early warning radars, potential Hawk replacements, when you look at some of the other systems out there that may be in pretty good demand, can you characterize how important those are relative to some of these big systems that make the big headlines?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well I would say for example, the TPY-2 radar that's part of THAAD, but it's also now being looked at as essentially an early warning radar. It's kind of standing on its own and we're getting \u2013 there's been a lot of interest on that system within THAAD obviously, but also outside of THAAD. So that's, I would call that, that's been a development that's been occurring here over the last couple of years. So we see that in the future as a major international system that we provide.", "Obviously, we have the Patriot System itself. We have a big award in 2016. It's the Qatar early warning radar. So it's on the order of $1 billion potential for that system. That's getting ready to go through congressional notification. And earlier had a congressional notification but the customer wanted to increase the size of the radar, so we have to go back. And that looks like that'll complete this year with CN and with an award in 2016.", "We also, we talked quite a bit about a lot of our missile products which are big. And you are correct, we are getting traction in integrated air and missile defense, especially relative to our NASAM system. That's starting to get traction especially as a replacement to the Hawk System. So outside of Patriot, we see multiple other areas that are allowing us to essentially get out of this pure Patriot binary that we're waiting on.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please proceed.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey good morning. Hey, Toby, a couple of quick clarification questions for you. Can you give us a sense of how much that contract mod might we worth so that we can get a truer sense of what sustainable margins are in the fourth quarter?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, so as far as the amount, we're still in negotiations and working through this with our customer. So unfortunately, Jason, I won't give you specifics. But what I can tell you to maybe try to help you size it, if you remember, we did have a similar type of item at IDS in last year's fourth quarter. But I would tell you that was of higher value or higher magnitude than the one we're looking at here. Our run rate for the quarter, even if you exclude this item, I would tell you our run rate for the quarter would still be better than our year to date performance. So even without that item, the Q4 margin would be better than year to date.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Another clarification question, the flat to up margins that you suggested for next year, ex the eBorder settlement, is that at the segment level or total company-wide operating margins?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "That's a fair question. That's at the segment level.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay great. And then lastly from me, your bookings that you're expecting for this year, does the resolution of the continuing resolution have any impact on that outcome?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "No, Jason. We feel good about the outlook for this year regardless of what happens with the shutdown.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So on our domestic, none of them are new starts, and there's also a significant amount of international which is obviously independent of the CR.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay great. Thank you, gentlemen.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "And hey, Jason, just a little bit of a follow up to your question about the margin rate for next year, as I said, it is at the segment level. And as a reminder, obviously we'll update it in January, but we do expect our FAS/CAS to be improved next year from this year as well, if you're thinking about it from a total company point of view.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Right, and then at that segment level guidance then, are you willing at this point to give us a first look at whether any of those segments will be up more than others? Are there any big movements in any of the segments? Are you saying that total segments are going to be flat to up? Is there any movement up or down that we should be aware of?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, no I mean our goal today was to give everyone a high look at where we are headed for next year. We're in the middle of our process for locking down 2016. So we're not going to go any deeper than we did, but certainly in January, we'll give you all the details and the color around each of the businesses.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Fair enough. Thank you very much, guys.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Good morning, Sam. How are you doing?", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. How are you?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're doing great.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "When you're growing, it feels good.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Can you ask you a question? I know you have thousands of programs, but to just ask about a couple. Any update in terms of 3DELRR, in terms of the protest, when that might get re-awarded? And then any comments in terms of the long range discrimination radar and what happened with that one.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, let me hit the 3DELRR first. For those who don't know, we essentially were awarded the 3DELRR. There was a protest. And through the protest process, the U.S. Air Force has decided to essentially recompete the 3DELRR. So that's right now in a competition. At the same time, we are in an appeal process to see if we can undo that and have the award sustained. So that's where we're at on that. I can't really say much more about that one.", "You are correct on the long range discrimination radar. There was an announcement last night that didn't go in our favor. We are obviously disappointed in that. We feel we had a good solution for the Missile Defense Agency. And we are awaiting our debrief because we really don't have any more information than essentially you have based on the release out of the DoD.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And so if I can follow up, if I look at that grid on page 10, can you kind of talk about where you would be right now if we ended the year? And then secondly, have you given any thought or would you consider voluntary contributions this year to help move that a little bit as well?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, so our return year to date is around 1%, okay, on our assets to the first part of your question. I'll just add a little bit more color there. And if we were even to remain flat for the remainder of the year, as I mentioned earlier when, to Jason's question, we would still see our FAS/CAS income for 2016 to be better than 2015, as I mentioned earlier. As far as the discretionary contribution, that is an element of our balanced capital deployment. We will look from time to time to make that. Right now, we don't have a plan to do that, but it's certainly something depending upon how things shape up over the next couple of months that we'll be evaluating, and certainly we'll obviously let everyone know if we choose to do something there.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please proceed.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yes. Good morning.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, George.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "At the Analyst Meeting in September, you'd commented that the big increases in margins on these international contracts usually occur three or four years out. Now there's a change in the guidance this quarter. Any change changed that at all or are we still probably look for maybe some margin improvement next year, but the bigger increase is in 2017 and 2018?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, George, it's Toby. I mean what we said for next year, early look right, was flat to slightly up on margins. But related to those major production programs, it would really be 2017 and 2018 when we'd be in the sweet spot from driving the productivity and the efficiencies on those programs.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "And then, Toby, just one further clarification. The segment margin, it's probably pretty trivial. But does that include Websense or does that just relating to the defense pieces?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "No, it includes Websense, but it does not include the amortization of the intangibles or the deferred revenue. So it includes their operating results, if you will.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay, and those margins should get better next year, I mean even though you commented the fourth quarter will be much weaker than the 17.5% you just reported.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, we would see on an operating basis excluding the accounting in acquisition related adjustments, we would see margins next year in the high teens, okay. And what's happening here, this year, Q2 had low margins for Websense because of the restructuring related activities. And it's just a timing issue. We didn't have much going on relative to how those costs we incurred in Q3. We expect them to pick back up, if you will, as we work towards completing the integration activities, which is going to drive the margins down in Q4. But again, all within the outlook we've given for the year for Websense.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "And then last quick one. You mentioned I thought in an earlier question that Websense on a pro forma basis was relatively flat with last year. So what starts the growth next year that you've been looking for?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, so what's happening at Websense, we're seeing growth in their TRITON platform and their TRITON product and related services in around the 10% range. And as we've talked about before, they have a legacy web filtering business that has been declining. It continues to decline and the two of those are kind of a push that get us to that flat. So what would drive the growth in the future is both the combination of the expansion of TRITON but also the integration of the Raytheon Cyber Products into the TRITON platform and the synergies of cross-selling across both customer sets that Websense bring to the table and RCP bring to the table.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, George.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Good morning.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Robert.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "So, Tom, just going back to IDS and thinking about the 3% to 4% top line growth in the context of all the business you've won, and moving past the fourth quarter dynamics which sounds at least on the margin side somewhat one time, how do we think about the ramp at IDS with all this new business particularly in international Patriot over the next couple of years? And how significant a part of the 3% to 4% is that next year? Meaning is that primarily driven by IDS or you're getting some help from missile systems there as well?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well on IDS, let's talk about IDS first. So the new awards, especially the big Patriot awards are normally about a five-year period to essentially get through those programs. So on these new ones, for example Qatar, we're just in the first inning, essentially the first year of that contract. So we're in the, I would call it the ramping up element. And Toby addressed this on a prior question here. So we see the sweet spots, especially relative to the Patriot orders occurring in the 2017 and 2018 timeframe relative to the margin expansion as we ramp up.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "So does that mean, Tom, that the segments are going to all be somewhat similar? Or the growth segments, I'm looking at missiles systems and IDS, and that essentially the other two primary segments are a partial offset there?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, Rob, I think again, we were just trying to give everybody a high level look at next year. We're not prepared to go into the details by business because some things are probably going to move around between now and January when we do that for you guys. As I mentioned, we're still in the middle of our process of walking this all down.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. And then just on services itself, there's a lot of activity in the market, some people buying, others selling. You've gotten deeper into commercial cyber. Is there any kind of portfolio shaping that's left at IIS just to streamline services going forward in a market that seems a little bit volatile, if I may?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah so, Robert, we continually look at that in terms of our portfolio shaping, essentially quarterly in terms of all of our programs. And then we mentioned this on prior calls, we never got into the fed IT business. We had good vision and I guess we had the right crystal ball at the time not to get into that particular business area. So most of our services are what we call the value-added type services in terms of servicing our products and our solutions. We're getting us into areas where we can do maintenance and sustainment and also upgrades to systems that are out there which essentially fits better into our overall portfolio of other systems.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "And I think, Rob, in general, we're always looking at that across the company.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Right.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Including if there are certain programs or products that are better suited even internally in one business or another. So, it's something we constantly look at.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "All right. It sounds like you're pretty happy with the portfolio. And then just a quick one. I don't know what you can say on this. You were asked about it last quarter, but I'm going to ask it differently. I know you can't talk about what you'll do for bomber, but can you tell us which team you're more significantly positioned on?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I wish I could tell you anything on the bomber, but I'm not going to be able to tell \u2013 go there on that answer.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sorry about that.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "All right.

O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Hi, Rob.", "Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Just quickly on the cash front, Tom, both of you actually, Tom and Toby. You both mentioned that your appetite for acquisitions going forward would be pretty small. I was wondering what sort of free cash flow return to shareholders we might anticipate looking forward. We're looking at sort of 90% or something like that. And then as a follow up, what do you think the split would be of that return between buybacks and dividends? Thank you.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I'll give you kind of the top line here, and we keep readdressing this at all our calls to make sure that you understand how consistent we are on it. And we do drive a balanced capital deployment strategy. And so we look at all avenues and try to make sure we do the right thing for the shareholder in terms of total shareholder return. So from that perspective, I'll give it over to Toby here to go through the, I guess the exact numbers as we move forward.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, so I think, Rob, as you know we've been in the range of 80% to 90% the last few years. Be similar this year, depending on how things shake out a little bit. As far as going forward, I think generally speaking, I think of it at the same way in the context of the broad balanced capital deployment strategy that Tom just referred to. Again, we think it's served us well historically.", "As far as the mix, I won't comment specifically on a mix of how that return would split between dividend and/or buyback. But what I would tell you, that both elements would be part of our return to shareholders going forward. Obviously, we're subject to board approval on these things. But from a dividend perspective, obviously we want to make sure it's competitive and sustainable at the same time.", "And we'll give you all an update early next year as to our thinking on that, and I think it's usually our March timeframe when we get the board to vote on the dividend, and we'll provide you that detailed information. But you're absolutely right, too, about the aspect of acquisitions, and just to be very clear, we don't have sitting here today any $1 billion-plus deals that we're contemplating for any part of the portfolio including our commercial cyber venture. It would be the more niche targeted type of acquisitions that fill technology gaps or product gaps or customer gaps as we've talked about.", "Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay.

Please proceed.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "On the strong cash flow this quarter, I think you mentioned cash tax timing. Can you tell us what were cash taxes in the quarter and then what's the full year expectation? And then is there any opportunity to outperform your cash flow guidance?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "So, let me start with the last one first. I mean we feel pretty comfortable. Obviously we've got a range of a couple hundred million dollars on the cash flow outlook for the year of the $2.5 billion to the $2.7 billion. As far as Q3 of 2015 versus 2014, the cash taxes were favorable by about $130 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis there. Let me just check on the absolute amount of the cash taxes here for you. So the cash taxes paid this year were about $300 million.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "That's year to date or for the full year?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "No, that was in the quarter, okay. For full year it's about $1.2 billion.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Okay, got you, got you. And then just one follow-up guys. It's some of the wins you had, I think LISC and NORAD that came off, I thought they were in the IIS segment. And I think you made some comments at the beginning, but are those in IIS? And if so, I was surprised, I mean we didn't get a guidance increase in that segment.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "They were both in IIS, that's correct. Just remember, one of them, the DOMino is being protested. So it was not \u2013 I mean it was awarded, but then protested.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Okay. Okay.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The NISSC was protested, and then the protest went in our favor. So that one's done. But DOMino award was protested and it's still in protest.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, and obviously where there wasn't a guidance increase, Pete, those were contemplated in the outlook we had previously given.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, good morning. Thank you.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Hunter.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Good morning.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Just a follow-up to Rob's question about the capital deployment. I understand you guys want to give yourselves some flexibility. But just if we just go through just some of the moving parts in terms of sort of higher operating cash flow next year net of eBorders. Given the 80% to 90% return policy, which has been how you guys have thought about it historically, would you say at a baseline, it's probably fair to assume that the repo continues at this $250 million s quarter, $1 billion annual run rate at a baseline barring a major change in sort of the funding environment? Is it fair to think about it that way?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, I wouldn't think of it that way necessarily. I mean we bumped it up this year, right. We were at $750 million. We went up to $1 billion, based upon how we felt about where the stock was valued and the growth opportunities that we had in front of us to improve the valuation in the stock, which we've talked about today relative to the strong bookings to date, the backlog, the growth we see for next year. We obviously still think that there's upside in the valuation from Websense. We know we're in a kind of a wait and see period here. But over time, and again not to beat a dead horse, right, we just wanted to give you all a high level view of things and we'll certainly provide more color and specificity on the detailed components of our overall capital plan in the January call as well.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right, I think the other message we wanted to send is that the growth in 2015 is not limited to 2015, based obviously on our backlog but also what we see in the demand signal pulls, we will be growing in 2016. That was really the message.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. All right, thanks guys. And then as we think about international a little bit more, sort of parsing that out a little bit. Maybe this is an incorrect conclusion, but does the orientation towards some of the smaller size awards dovetail into maybe more of a direct commercial mix versus FMS, or is that just a line that shouldn't be drawn? And if you could give me at a higher level sort of how foreign direct has trended as a percentage of the international bookings and backlog over the last couple years and how you sort of expect that to trend moving forward into next year?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me give you kind of our strategy relative to FMS versus direct commercial sale. So number one is, we always work with the customer. And if a customer prefers to go FMS, we obviously support that customer and go on FMS. If there is a choice to be made between FMS and direct commercial sale, we do look at in terms of what is the overall risk in taking a direct commercial sale. So we're pretty prudent in terms of how we make the decisions relative to pushing FMS versus DCS. Now that being said, we do have significant DCS opportunities. We have the direct commercial sale work in-house today that we're doing quite well on. And Toby can give you the exact breakout.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, so at the end of Q3, about 40% of our international backlog was FMS with the balance being direct commercial, so the 40-60 split. That's changed a little bit. It's come, the FMS content percentage-wise has come down a little bit by maybe about 5 points. So that had been a little bit higher, around 45%. Going forward, I don't know that I'd necessarily expect any major change. I'm thinking we'd probably continue to be in that 40% to 45% range at any given point depending upon the mix of programs. And as Tom said, some of them we have to have FMS. Some of them we'll try to drive to DCS. But I wouldn't expect any significant change in that mix.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay.

Tom?", "Tom Kennedy", "Thank you, Todd. Good morning everyone. I am very pleased with both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, and I'd like to begin by touching on a few highlights.", "Our total book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.09. This reflects strong global demand for our Advanced Solutions, and positions us well going into 2016. We finished the full year with top line growth of 2%, driven by our growth in our international business, which more than offset a slight decline in domestic.", "Company segment margins in 2015 were as expected, at 13.1%, as the team delivered solid operating performance. Cash flow was also solid, providing us the opportunity to return the majority of our cash flow to shareholders, while also funding our pension plans and investing in our future growth. So all in all, the company is performing very well, and we are confident in our future.", "As you can see from our 2015 results and the 2016 outlook, the global threat environment continues to drive demand for Raytheon solutions. I would also add that, in my conversations with our global customers, it is clear that short term shifts in economic growth factors have taken a back seat to ensuring the sovereignty and security of the nations that face these security threats.", "In particular, let me highlight what we are seeing in three regions. In the Middle East, demand signals increased last year, despite the decline in oil prices. Tensions within the region are driving demand for missile defense, long range radars, modernized command and control systems, sensors, cyber security and precision munitions; areas that align with our core strengths.", "I have been asked many times if oil prices have impacted demand. From our viewpoint, we have not seen a negative impact, and here is one of many examples why. Over the past year alone, Patriot has intercepted more than a dozen ballistic missiles fired in the region. Missiles that otherwise could have caused significant casualties and damage to critical infrastructure and defense sites.", "In the Asia-Pacific region, customers are also updating their missile defense systems, sensors and other capabilities in light of recent developments there. Increased tensions related to territorial disputes and evolving economic interests are motivating allies in this region, to invest more heavily in deterrent capabilities, to protect their national interest. As you may recall, South Korea awarded us a significant upgrade to its Patriot systems in 2015.", "Looking forward in 2016, we see opportunities across the region in tactical radars, ship-based radars, missiles, force protection systems and precision munitions.", "And in Europe, we are seeing renewed and increased interest from a number of countries, in acquiring integrated air and missile defense solutions, providing additional opportunities for Patriot and NASAMs.", "Domestically, we were pleased to see the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act, which adjusted the defense budget caps higher for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017, including a 15% increased in modernization funding in fiscal year 2016. These changes provided much needed funding for our armed forces, while also improving visibility and predictability for the defense industry. This will yield a positive impact on our results beginning in 2016, and then continuing into 2017. Even as we emerge from several years of declining U.S. Defense budgets are now beginning to see growth, the environment remains competitive.", "To ensure Raytheon's long term competitive advantage, we have increased our independent research and development, capital expenditures, and other investments to fund the development of the advanced game changing technologies of the future. Ranging from hypersonics and cyber security to directed energy. As expected, IR&D reached 3% of our sales in 2015, a similar level is expected in 2016. ", "Now let me give you some more details about our 2015 results; strong demand from global customers drove bookings of $25.2 billion for the full year; a 5% increase over 2014. Domestic bookings were strong, with a full year book-to-bill ratio of 1.04. This sets up a better than originally expected domestic revenue growth outlook for 2016, which I will discuss more in a moment. International comprised 34% of our total bookings in 2015, and our international book-to-bill ratio was a very robust 1.19 for the year. ", "Total backlog at the end of 2015 was $34.7 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion over 2014. Again, providing a solid foundation, as we move into 2016. International ended the year at 43% of total backlog, compared to 40% at year end 2014. Successful execution of our growth strategy and increasing demand from our global customers resulted in return of growth in 2015, a year earlier than we had originally expected.", "Our full year 2015 international sales increased 9% over 2014, reaching 21% of our total annual sales, a new company record. In addition, for the second consecutive year, we saw good growth in classified sales, which increased about 6% in the year. In this environment, we are also continuously looking for more ways to lower our costs, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers.", "A few examples include, executing our strategic sourcing strategy to reduce costs in our supply chain; leveraging our centralized global business services organization to more efficiently provide back office support to their businesses, and reducing our footprint, taking out a gross total of 1.9 million square feet in 2015. In addition, we have kicked off a new complexity reduction initiative to reduce costs and simplify business processes across the company.", "Looking forward to 2016, we expect to see continued strong demand, that should ultimately drive our bookings to the $25 billion to $26 billion range for the year. This would translate into a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.05. Key bookings for the year include Qatar early warning radar, the EMD phase as a next generation jammer, and SM3. More than ever before, demand from our global customers is broad-based and diversified.", "Along with the strong bookings we experienced in 2015, this continued strength should position us well to deliver revenue growth of between 3% to 5% in 2016, which is better than what we had mentioned when we provided our initial outlook during the Q3 earnings call.", "I would add that this includes an expectation of 2% to 4% growth from domestic customers. This would be the first time we have seen growth in our domestic business since 2009. Further, cash flow from operations is expected to increase significantly in 2016, from solid 2015 levels.", "The strong fundamental performance provides a foundation for the continuation of our balanced capital deployment strategy, with the objective of creating shareholder value. Our number one priority remains executing our growth strategy and investing it ourselves. Beyond this, we remain committed to providing a competitive dividend. We also continue to see value in our stock and expect to continue the share buyback at the 2015s robust levels.", "Part of our growth strategy is bringing our advanced cyber security capabilities to government and commercial customers around the world. In 2015, in support of this strategy, we increased our presence in the commercial cyber security market in a meaningful way, with the formation of Raytheon Websense. And earlier this month, we changed its name to Forcepoint to more effectively brand and position our broad cyber security capabilities in the market.", "We further strengthened Forcepoint by completing the acquisition of Stonesoft at the close of the fourth quarter. The small acquisition, which is consistent with our M&A strategy that we have articulated over the past several calls, provides next generation firewall technology that fills an important technology gap and broadens our cyber security capabilities. The Stonesoft acquisition will become part of the Forcepoint business segment. We are excited about the breadth and depth of the product offerings at Forcepoint, that places us in a strong competitive position.", "I'd like to close by thanking the Raytheon team for a great year, and for the dedication and all the efforts that went into returning the company to growth ahead of schedule, while continuing to deliver for our global customers.", "With that, let me turn it over to Toby.", "Anthony O'Brien", "Okay. Thanks Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results. Then I will discuss our outlook for 2016. After that, we will open up the call for questions. During my remarks, I will be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our web site.", "Okay, would everyone please move to page 3? We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in both the fourth quarter and the full year, with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all consistent with or better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the fourth quarter, at $7.9 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.24, and for the year, we had bookings of $25.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.09. This sets the stage for continued growth in 2016, which I will discuss in more detail in just a few minutes.", "Sales were $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our missiles, IDS and Forcepoint businesses. International sales grew 16% in the fourth quarter, and for the year, sales were up 2%, ending at $23.2 billion. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.85 for the quarter, and $6.75 for the full year, which I will give a little more color on, in a few minutes.", "We also generated strong operating cash flow of $813 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion for the year, after a $200 million pre-tax discretionary pension contribution, which was not in our prior guidance. Additionally, during the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares of common stock for $250 million, bringing the full year 2015 repurchases to 9 million shares for about $1 billion. As we have previously disclosed in the fourth quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. The company ended the year with a solid balance sheet and net debt of approximately $2.1 billion.", "Turning now to page 4, let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. As I mentioned earlier, we had strong bookings of $7.9 billion in the quarter and $25.2 billion for the full year, resulting in a year end backlog of $34.7 billion. The company ended 2015 with a funded backlog of $25.1 billion, an increase of $2 billion from year end 2014. Its worth noting that both IDS and Missile Systems had outstanding bookings performance for the full year 2015.", "For the quarter, international orders represented 27% of our total company bookings, and for the full year was 34% of total bookings. And as Tom mentioned earlier, at the end of 2015, approximately 43% of our total backlog was international.", "Turning now to page 5; we had fourth quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 3% over the same period in 2014. This was at the high end of the guidance range we had set in October.", "So looking now at the businesses; IDS had net sales of $1.7 billion in the quarter, and they were up 5% from the same period last year. Primarily due to higher sales on certain international Patriot programs and on the Air Warfare Destroyer program. Net sales at IIS were $1.4 billion in the quarter, down from the same period last year, primarily due to lower sales on an international classified program.", "Missile Systems had fourth quarter 2015 net sales of $1.9 billion, up 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on Paveway. SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion in Q4, the change was spread across numerous programs, with no one significant driver. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2014 included the results for Raytheon cyber products only.", "For the full year, sales were $23.2 billion, up approximately 2% over full year 2014 consistent with expectations. International sales growth more than offset the slight decline in domestic sales.", "Moving ahead to page 6; we delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and the full year. Looking at business margins in the quarter, as expected, in the fourth quarter of 2015, IDS received a contract modification to restructure the AWD program, essentially separating our incentive fees from the shipyard's performance. This resulted in a favorable $53 million adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2015 for IDS. Missile Systems and SAS margins both exceeded the guidance range that we provided back in October, while both IIS and Forcepoint met our guidance.", "Turning to page 7, we had solid operating margin performance for the year. Segment margins were 13.1%, which was consistent with our expectations, and as a reminder, this included $181 million for the eBorder settlement earlier in the year at IIS, worth about 80 basis points.", "On page 8, you will see both the fourth quarter and full year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2015, our EPS was $1.85 and for the full year was $6.75. EPS for the quarter was strong and above the guidance we provided you in October; even after accounting for the extension of the R&D tax credit. As a reminder, the R&D tax credit was worth about $0.11 and was not in our prior guidance.", "Moving on to our 2016 guidance on page 9; we see sales in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. Our 2016 outlook for the deferred revenue adjustment is $67 million, and for the amortization of acquired intangibles is $121 million.", "Its important to note, that effective January 1, 2016, we reclassify amortization of acquired intangibles and the deferred revenue adjustment. This change affects all businesses other than Forcepoint, which had already been reporting that way. These non-cash items will no longer be reported within the business segments. Instead, these will be reported in separate deferred revenue adjustment and amortization of acquired intangibles lines, that we have provided for you here. A reconciliation that walks you from the prior method to the current one is in Attachment G to the press release.", "As for pension, we see the 2016 FAS/CAS adjustment at a positive $428 million, which I will discuss in just a minute. We expect net interest expense to be between $220 million and $230 million. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between $296 million and $298 million on a full year basis, a reduction of approximately 2% to 3%, driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program, which we expect at levels comparable to 2015.", "We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. Our 2016 tax rate is higher than 2015, primarily due to the $0.29 per share favorable tax settlement we received in 2015. Its important to note that our 2016 tax rate includes the R&D tax credit, which was permanently extended at the end of 2015.", "In 2016, we see our EPS to be in the range of $6.80 to $7. Our operating cash flow for continuing operations for 2016 is expected to be between $2.7 billion and $3 billion, compared to $2.3 billion in 2015.", "As we sit here today, we do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution to our pension plans in 2016. As we previously mentioned, we did make a $200 million discretionary contribution in 2015. ", "Before moving on to page 10, I want to mention that we expect our 2016 bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion, driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers, and we expect stronger bookings in the second half of the year, similar to the last several years.", "Continuing on to page 10, before I cover the 2016 guidance by business, its important to note that effective January 1, 2016, we reorganized the IDS and IIS business segments to move certain air traffic systems, border and critical infrastructure protection, and highway tolling programs from IDS to IIS. We did this to more efficiently leverage our capabilities within the businesses. To assist you with your modeling, you will find the recast segment data in the attachments provided at the end of the earnings release.", "Now moving to our initial 2016 guidance by business; at the midpoint of the sales range, we expect to see growth in all of our businesses in 2016. With respect to segment margins, consistent with our prior comments, we expect 2016 margins to continue to be solid in the 12.4% to 12.6% range, which is in line to slightly up when you compare to 2015 excluding the eBorders settlement.", "And similar to 2015, our 2016 segment margin outlook assumes that IR&D is approximately 3% of sales. I would also like to point out, that when it makes sense, we have and will continue to make opportunistic investments in specific next generation U.S. programs to better position the company for longer term organic growth. Investments which we believe will create value for our shareholders.", "At IDS, we see margins in the 15.9% to 16.1% range. I want to point out, that our full year 2016 guidance includes operating income at IDS related to an expected exit from certain business ventures later in 2016, which you can think of in the $100 million to $125 million range. Excluding this, the change from 2015 is driven by mix, most notably, we are continuing to ramp up on several new programs, including on a couple of Patriot awards that we received in early 2015 from South Korea and Saudi Arabia.", "As you know, we typically see lower margins at the inception of longer duration programs, which can increase over time, as we retire risk and drive operational efficiencies.", "We expect IIS margins of 7.4% to 7.6%. This is in line year-over-year when you adjust for the 2015 eBorders settlement. We see missiles margins in the 13% to 13.2% range, consistent with 2015. SAS margins are expected to be in the 12.9% to 13.1% range, down from 2015, driven by mix as a result of completing some international programs, as well as from higher business investments in 2016. And at Forcepoint, we expect margins to be in the 11.5% to 12.5% range, this includes the impact from the Stonesoft acquisition that Tom discussed earlier. Without this impact, margins would be approximately 15%.", "If you now turn to page 11, we have provided you with our 2016 outlook by quarter. You notice that sales ramp up throughout the year, and on page 12, as we have done in the past, we have provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2015, as well as the projected impact for 2016 through 2018, holding all assumptions constant.", "As I mentioned earlier, we see the FAS/CAS adjustment in 2016 at a positive $428 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2015 on our U.S. pension assets, which were flat, and the December 31 discount rate of 4.5%. The discount rate is up 40 basis points from last year. Looking beyond 2016, keep in mind, each 25 basis point change in the discount rate drives a $70 million to $80 million change in FAS/CAS. ", "And finally on page 13, we have provided an updated three-year outlook of the acquisition accounting adjustments, to help you with your long term modeling. Please note that you will see a significant decline in the deferred revenue adjustment over the period, and the amortization of acquired intangible assets will begin to decline more significantly, after 2018.", "Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earning calls, with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans, as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making smaller targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs, and from time-to-time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.", "Let me conclude by saying that in 2015, Raytheon again delivered solid operating performance, with bookings, sales, earnings and operating cash flow, on or ahead of expectations. Book-to-bill was strong, and our international business grew significantly. We have a strong balance sheet, which gives us flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value, and we are well positioned to grow in 2016 and beyond, both in our international and domestic business.", "So with that, we will open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please proceed, sir.", "Jason Gursky", "Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the call here. I was wondering if you could just walk through the cadence for the year in a little bit more detail. Perhaps talking a little bit about opportunities and risks through the cadence for the year, what would cause things to come in a little earlier? What would cause things to get pushed out, and just kind of how you generally view the risks and opportunities for the cadence for the year, that would be great?", "Anthony O'Brien", "Hey Jason, it's Toby. So I think if we step back from this and look at a high level on the cadence, what you see from the revenue profile, it's not too dramatically different than last year. It's influenced by, as you would expect, the timing of awards, especially in 2015 and we had a strong back half to the year. So we see an influence to the ramp-up in the second half of the year, in part, driven by the growth and the timing of the awards we saw in late 2015. That flows through obviously to the EPS cadence, and the other thing I would add, the exit of business ventures at IDS that I talked, that's planned to be in the second half in Q3, which has an influence on the back half cadence from an EPS point of view as well.", "Jason Gursky", "And are you willing to offer a little bit more granularity on the businesses that you're exiting?", "Anthony O'Brien", "I think I'd put it this way; we constantly look at our portfolio. We talked on the call here about a couple of things, one which is just moving up some of the businesses from IDS to IIS, because we think its going to drive some more efficiencies, given how those products have matured, they are more of a service-support model. Where in the past, IIS had actually performed a lot of work on it. So we think we will get more efficiencies out of that.", "I can't get into too much detail right now, beyond what I said, for the exit of the business ventures at IDS, just because of the confidentiality around it. But we certainly can talk more about that, once that is concluded -- as we said here, we expect by the third quarter.", "Jason Gursky", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Anthony O'Brien", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please proceed.", "Doug Harned", "Yes, good morning.", "Tom Kennedy", "Good morning Doug.", "Doug Harned", "I am interested in IDS, because if we go back a year ago, when you were looking forward, you were expecting some margin expansion that you would see operating margins up in the 15% range. And it seemed, as the year went on, you looked at new awards coming in, that pushed out in time, that margin expansion. But now, as you look at 2016 and if you make adjustment for the exit from those businesses, it seems like you are still at a lower margin level than one might think and one might have expected. Can you talk about how you look at that IDS trajectory now? I know you mentioned a couple of the new programs, which may put some pressure on margins in the near term. But I am trying to understand, when we can expect to get, kind of the full margin advantage one might expect from a mature set of international programs?", "Anthony O'Brien", "Sure Doug. Let me kind of walk through that, and try to give you some more color on that. So as I mentioned and you alluded to, we do have $100 million to $125 million in the 2016 forecast for IDS related to the exit of a business venture. I will note at IDS in any given year, in part because of the nature of their programs and the size of them, we have had favorable profit adjustments, that were significant. Maybe about the half of the size of this, if you look back over time. So this pickup is a bit larger, but it does help to offset, 2016, some of the mix that we have been talking about that you just referred to, with the ramp up of these programs that are in the early stages.", "Further, as we have talked about at both IDS and across the company, we are investing more, particularly in strategic areas, where we do see significant growth opportunities. We also continue to execute on some lower margin programs at IDS, such as AMDR, the Qatar ADOC, the classified radar program that we won last year, and all this taken together is a key component of our growth story. But in the near term, it is impacting our IDS margins as well.", "At the end of the day, even with the IDS margin, we have been able to maintain a solid company margin position and deliver top line growth due to the strength of the portfolio, and we continue to be focused on driving down our costs, over head and other costs for the last several years, and as you know, we have seen significant improvements from a number of different initiatives there around facilities, reductions, factory automation, strategic sourcing, expanding our shared services, working on our organization structure when we have collapsed from six to four businesses, and as we have talked about, internationally, we changed our model on how we approach international business, and that is clearly paying off from a growth perspective overall and internationally. As we now are resuming growth, we will continue to drive costs down with an objective to improve and grow earnings through both top line and margin improvement.", "As far as the cadence of IDS margins going forward, I would think of it this way, as you said, if you were to adjust for the exit of the business venture, I think as we said in the past, we would expect year-over-year and continue to see IDS margins improve incrementally. Again, adjusting for the impact of the business venture, as these larger production programs that run five years, kind of get into the sweet spot into 2017 and 2018, which would drive that improved margin at IDS.", "Doug Harned", "So if I have this right, then you are saying that you still expect with these attractive international contracts that you can get up to the margins, the sort of high 16s maybe margins we have seen in the past. But if this has just taken longer than you probably would have expected, six to 12 months ago.", "Anthony O'Brien", "So I am not going to give you beyond what we have put out there for 2016, margin expectation for IDS other than directional indication or cadence. But yes, we really haven't changed our thinking around this. You got to keep in mind, as we said; in the case of Patriot, these awards generally run five years, and a couple big ones that I mentioned in the prepared comments, those are -- we are only a year into those, and its usually into plus or minus the third year of those programs which will be starting in 2017, when we normally see the opportunity to retire risk, drive efficiencies. We also had, if you recall, at the end of 2014, a major award for Qatar. Again, that will kind of be hitting the sweet spot when we get into 2017. So I won't put a specific margin bogey out there, but we definitely would see improvement in 2017 and improvement over that in 2018, driven by these large programs.", "Doug Harned", "Okay, very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please proceed.", "George Shapiro", "Yes. Toby, the cash flow, even if you add it back to $200 million, came kind of at the low end of your guidance, and then you have a bigger increase in 2016. Was some of that -- something was missing [indiscernible] or you just explained kind of the walk [ph] from the 2015 number of say 2.5, to get to the 2.7 to 3?", "Anthony O'Brien", "Yeah so, the way to think of it, George, you're right, we came in towards the low end, when you adjust for the discretionary pension contribution. When I look at the change year-over-year, its primarily driven by a combination of our net pension funding and lower cash taxes. From an operational or program level, we see things kind of in line with the cadence that we saw in 2015.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. Then one quick one, what was the organic growth if we looked at Forcepoint and put it in the acquisition, so what would it have been year-over-year?", "Anthony O'Brien", "For the company?", "George Shapiro", "For Forcepoint? I mean, if we put in the acquisition you made and we put in Websense for last year?", "Anthony O'Brien", "So if you'd normalize -- on a normalized basis for the full year, the topline would have been roughly flat, which is what we have been expecting. You are talking 2015, right?", "George Shapiro", "I am talking 2015, then I was going to ask the 2016 comparison?", "Anthony O'Brien", "Sure. For 2015, for Forcepoint normalized on a full year basis, the revenue growth would have been flat. That would have been, higher sales of the new products, the Trident platform, offset by a decline in the legacy products on the web filtering, which is consistent with what we have been expecting.", "If you roll it forward to 2016, and exclude the acquisition that Tom talked about for the next-gen firewall, we'd be looking at high single digit growth on a normalized basis.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Anthony O'Brien", "Okay, George.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.", "Robert Stallard", "Thanks so much. Good morning.", "Tom Kennedy", "Good morning Rob.", "Robert Stallard", "Tom, you mentioned you're getting quite a few questions about the potential impact of the oil price on your defense export sales. I was wondering if you could size the proportion of either your backlog or your sales of going into the Middle East? And whether you have seen any signs from those customers of any changing priorities or deferrals of orders or deliveries or anything in particular? And then secondly, do you think this is the peak as a percentage of exports in your backlog? Thank you.", "Tom Kennedy", "That's an excellent question. Number one is, I just did come back from the Middle East visiting our key customers in multiple countries. So my statement in the script was really based on communications that I had directly with the leaders of these countries. And what I am seeing -- at least what I am hearing from these leaders is, their number one priority is to protect the sovereignty of their nation. And then words they use, I have mentioned this before and I heard it again just several weeks ago, is that a strong defense is a strong deterrence. And in fact, during my trip, we uncovered or told about several other opportunities in the region. So if anything, we are seeing a stronger demand than a slowdown, and that's my words were, that we are not seeing an impact relative to the price of oil at this time.", "I hope that gives you a complete answer, but that's what I am seeing directly from the leaders of these countries.", "Robert Stallard", "And just to follow-up on the backlog percentage, do you think this is about as high as you are going to get, at 43%?", "Tom Kennedy", "Not based on any opportunities we are seeing out there. There is always opportunity to grow, and its just a matter of bringing those opportunities across the goal line.", "Anthony O'Brien", "Hey Rob, so I'd maybe just add a little bit on that, just to put a little context. We expect strong bookings internationally to continue into 2016, roughly 35% plus or minus of the bookings that we -- that the range that we gave you. We expect it would be international. Keep in mind, we are projecting 2% to 4% growth domestically, as a subset of the three to five at the company level. And would expect international sales to be roughly at the same level in 2016 as 2015. So we continue to see, as Tom said, momentum in that area.", "Robert Stallard", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed, sir.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Good morning.", "Tom Kennedy", "Good morning Sam.", "Sam Pearlstein", "I was wondering if you could talk just philosophically about the decision you made to pull the amortization of intangibles or deferred revenue out of the segment? I am just wondering, when it comes to acquisition opportunities, doesn't that make the segments willing to pay a little higher price than they would have otherwise? How do you make sure that, now you have got the pricing right and the hurdle rates?", "Anthony O'Brien", "I will give you the answer, my view here in two parts, right. First of all, why we did it; if you recall back, April-May of last year, when we announced the Websense deal for that acquisition, we started with that convention, but only limited to that acquisition. And at the time, we contemplated doing it completely across the portfolio, but we didn't want to mess with the pure nature of the numbers around Websense. So we purposely deferred that to the end of the year, to have kind of a clean break going into 2016, and it obviously puts both of those elements on the same basis consistently across the company. So that's part one, why we did it.", "As far as the second part of your question, are we concerned about the businesses running or willing to pay more, even if that were to be the case, we have got a pretty disciplined process here at the company. We have got a core team and an acquisition review team, that all acquisitions have to go through. I am on that, Tom's on that, as you would imagine, a few others, and through that, we spend a lot of time around valuation, looking at it two three different ways. And I won't get into any stats, but I would tell you, there are plenty of deals in the past that we lost, because we wouldn't get higher. We lost on price, for a lack of a better way to say it. So I think we got the right controls and process in place within the company, to make sure that we continue to only bid and pay what is a fair value for any property.", "Tom Kennedy", "And just to follow-up, the decisions on acquisitions are done at the corporate level, not at the business level.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay. Thanks. And if I could just follow-up Toby, if I just look at the first quarter, you have got the most working days, but clearly the lowest earnings. And I know you mentioned one of it was from the exit of those businesses later in the year. But how is it that earnings are so low that early in the year?", "Anthony O'Brien", "So you're right. There are more days, calendar days in Q1. That said, we still show growth in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. I think as you know, in any given quarter, some of our revenue depends upon, not just the number of days, but the timing of material, which is a significant portion of our cost base. We are guiding to 3% to 4% growth over last year's first quarter, and that puts our 2015 sales per day, roughly in line for the quarter.", "So we don't see anything abnormal about it, and part of it again, I think back to Jason's comment around the cadence, with the strong bookings we saw in the second half of the year, especially domestically, we'd see more of a ramp on that towards the back half of the year on our programs.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you very much. I want to talk maybe philosophically for a second also. I think I heard you or Tom say that you are willing to make some strategic investments in programs. And if I look at one of your competitors that has reported, they acknowledge taking a charge in LR/DR, and I also am aware that you have been challenged a little bit in a classified program at IIS. So could you talk a little bit about, what you are doing in terms of balancing growth opportunities, versus making sure you build a -- call it a wall of strategic advantage in your businesses, Tom?", "Tom Kennedy", "So I think, number one is, we do invest inside the company relative to ensuring that we have the right discriminators and differentiators to compete across all our businesses, and not only just to compete, but obviously to win. So those investments come through the avenue of IRAD, some capital investments, also people bringing on the right talent, so that we can go and win those major competitions, because they are the future franchises for the company.", "And that has been our overall strategy over the years. We look at programs that are going to have runs for decades. You know, what's the next Patriot, one of the examples is Air and Missile Defense Radar, that's going to be our next major franchise coming to fruition here in the next several years, next generation jammer win, the [indiscernible] win, these are all franchise programs, and we made sure over the years, that we have been investing in the right IRAD and the right capital to support those projects, and then also in having the right talent onboard. And that's just something that we do as part of the company moving forward.", "And the good news is, we are seeing the results of those investments. And again, the results for these franchises that we won over the last couple of years, and that we intend to continue to win, as we move forward, and we see a lot of opportunity here in 2016, 2017 to 2018 already in terms of new franchise opportunities.", "And so Howard, I think the bottom line is, we are making the right investments and we are seeing the right results relative to these new franchises.", "Howard Rubel", "Maybe just to follow-up, I want to make sure that you are not seeing the business becoming so competitive or changed the costs to -- I will call it to sustain your growth or to improve your position is becoming more costly, or more risky?", "Tom Kennedy", "I am not seeing it any different in the past. What I am seeing, which is nice, is I am seeing more opportunities in the last couple of years, than I saw in the prior years. So the bottom line is, there is a lot of opportunities out there, and we -- I would say, had a pretty good crystal ball, in making sure we made the right investments to be prepared to win those opportunities.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you, Tom.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.", "Hunter Keay", "Hi. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.", "Tom Kennedy", "Good morning Hunter.", "Hunter Keay", "Good morning. Maybe a little bit of a follow-up sort of contextually to Howard's question. But we saw the German [indiscernible] obviously over Patriot last year, and it sort of baked the question about your expectations for patriot over the next few years? And I was wondering if you could talk about that, maybe in the context of how much you have invested into things like facilities and R&D and headcount, in anticipation of Patriot win? And would it require you to maybe get a little more aggressive on price, in the event that you sort of need the volume to cover some of those investments that you have made, in anticipation of the awards, on Patriot specifically?", "Tom Kennedy", "Well, I think on Patriot, I think the investments have come through contracts, and then the other capital investments that we have made, the normal investments we make to, essentially being able to operate our factory in a lean and efficient manner. So that's -- I'll put that in context, and let me put together, the opportunities for Patriot in context. There was just a recent announcement by the new Minister of Defense, Macierewicz in Poland, relative to his support of pursuing the Patriot program with the U.S. government. In fact he even kind of did a joint announcement with the U.S. Ambassador to Poland on that subject, with an objective to be able to get something going here this year. So that's a really good news for us, that's a very large potential program for Poland there.", "And just as I mentioned earlier, I just returned from the Middle East and there is strong demand for additional Patriot assets there. I mentioned in my script, a number of -- over 10 intercepts by Patriot against ballistic region, just in that region of the Middle East. So there is a strong demand across Eastern Europe and also the Middle East for additional Patriot assets, but also for upgrade. For example, there is -- just in the upgrade area alone, there is an opportunity to upgrade 72 fire units, just to configuration of 3+. So there is upgrade potentials, and then there is also the new potentials for countries like Poland, and adding additional fire units to other countries in the Middle East region.", "And I am sure you are reading the newspapers, the information that I am getting, especially of all the Asia-Pacific activities that are going on. In fact today, there was an article relative to Fed in Korea, where we also have just gotten an award on Patriot there too.", "So the bottom line is, there seems to be a significant demand out there across multiple areas, Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East for Missile Defense, and Patriot is the System that's proven, and is the system of choice for these nations. That's where it stands.", "Hunter Keay", "And maybe Tom if you could, since you mentioned, can you maybe help us size the market opportunity for some of the retrofit work, maybe for 360 degree radar. Any context you can give us to sort of help think about it?", "Tom Kennedy", "Well you just [indiscernible] what I didn't mention, so that's part of the upgrade activities also. But there is definitely over $5 billion just on upgrades to configuration of 3 plus. There is opportunities on the radars that are -- its in the billions of dollars there, in terms of adding these 360 radars. By the way, that was one of the requests that I had in several of my meetings with key leaders in the Middle East. It was a desire to have our new lease, a 360 system added to their configurations. So I think that's getting out there. That capability is available, and we are hearing -- getting demand signals from customers on that.", "So the bottom line is, is Patriot is a franchise. We continue to evolve it, we continue to upgrade it and increase it's capabilities, add new technologies, and its -- we are seeing increased demand across those three major areas of the world. Again Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific, and also the Middle East.", "Hunter Keay", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen and Company. Please proceed.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Yes. Thank you very much. So Tom, I think you guys said you expect international to be 35% of bookings in 2016. That suggests that really if you do 25.5, you do about $9 billion up from what looks like 8.7. You have the Qatar award, but other than that, you don't seem to have as many identified large individual awards, as you did in 2015. Could you give us some more color of what would be driving that number that high?", "Tom Kennedy", "Well, you mentioned one of them, which was the Qatar EWR. We also have international Patriot greater than $1 billion worth of bookings that are in play. We have other activities in Qatar which we are pursuing, and we believe are accessible this year. There is a whole FMS in the area of AEGIS, supporting Aegis Ashore, and also upgrades on some ships in the international marketplace. For those who don't know, we do the Aegis radar and all the components and the subsystems for that radar. That alone is, for example, over $300 million. And then in the whole area of missiles, both air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, a significant demand of greater than $3 billion, across multiple missiles, so there are multiple contracts. There is no one contract and missiles that's going to do it, but that's our portfolio. We have a very diverse portfolio that allows us to add these systems.", "International ISRO is over $700 million; and then we have our normal airborne radars and ISR, EO/IR systems, that's probably pretty close to $1 billion. So I think what's different this year than others is, we are seeing demand signals across our whole portfolio on the international side, and you'd say, why is that? While we mentioned before, that we are changing our strategy. About two years ago, we went from a regional strategy, to a country strategy and into that country strategy, we focused not on the one or two customers we have had in the past 30 years, but we expanded that, and now we are seeing that. But these other customers are buying that in the order of $500 million to $1 billion programs, not just $2 billion program.", "So bottom line is, our portfolio which is diverse, is now the first in international marketplace, and that's -- these opportunities are coming across multiple of our products.", "Cai von Rumohr", "So Tom, you have said that it takes three years to hit the margin sweet spot on five year Patriot contracts. The turn time, I would assume is going to be shorter missile programs, and some of these other programs. So should we start to see this later in 2016, in your margins or 2017? The non-Patriot programs?", "Anthony O'Brien", "Cai, it's Toby. I will jump in on this one. I think you'd really want to think about that out in 2017, and the other thing to keep in mind, with our international missile programs, they are essentially FMS and not direct commercial sales. So while they -- relatively speaking, have some incremental margin compared to our domestic business, it is different than if it were a DCS type of sale.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Tom Kennedy", "Sure.", "Anthony O'Brien", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne Agee. Please proceed.", "Peter Arment", "Yes. Good morning Tom and Toby.", "Tom Kennedy", "Good morning Peter.", "Peter Arment", "Tom, I guess I have a question, kind of an up tempo. Its good to see your return to growth domestically in 2016, but we are also seeing a step-up in the op tempo in the Middle East, and Raytheon's position is good as any, in terms of a lot of the air-to-surface missiles, and the ground support missiles that are being utilized. I mean, how does that impact Raytheon in terms of a bookings perspective? Do you see, is it a big long lag effect, or do you actually start to have those conversations?", "Tom Kennedy", "No. We just went through that, and the bottom line is, we expect a range next year, an increase in our international bookings. Its going to be $8.5 billion to $9 billion range next year, which is up from 2015. So we are seeing that increased demand, and its coming, again, across our whole portfolio, not just Patriot.", "Peter Arment", "I guess, I was referring to the domestic activity, in terms of the Army and Air Force, spending a lot of, what is the activity in ISIS, etcetera?", "Tom Kennedy", "You will start to see. That's part of the range growth we talked about on the domestic, 2% to 4%. Which is interesting, we mentioned, as we haven't grown domestically since 2009. In 2016, we will see 2% to 4% growth, and that's significant for us, and its coming because of the op tempo internationally, but also in the pent-up demand that the department has in refreshing a lot of their systems. Including, some new starts in the area of radars and other systems.", "Peter Arment", "Okay. Thank you for the clarity on that. Thanks.", "Anthony O'Brien", "And Peter, I think the way you can see that translate through, if you look at the -- our missiles business, right, they had pretty good growth in 2015, as we started to see the effect of that, and even better growth that we are guiding to for 2016. So that's the start of the flowthrough, from a revenue point of view, of what Tom just talked about from a demand perspective.", "Tom Kennedy", "Bottom line, growing internationally, we are growing domestically. And that's pretty good.", "Peter Arment", "Good to hear.", "Todd Ernst", "Okay. I think we are going to have to leave it there. Thank you for joining us this morning.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.", "Todd Ernst - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our first quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then we'll move on to questions.", "Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon has had a good start out of the gates in 2016. Total company bookings increased 39% in the first quarter and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.08, driven in part by a large year-over-year increase in demand in the Middle East/North Africa region as well as strong domestic bookings. Our first quarter sales were well above our expectation, with strong growth in our Missiles business. Cash flow and EPS were also better than expected. This good start gives us continued confidence in our full year outlook. Toby will cover the financial details with you in a few moments.", "Across our global markets, demand for precision munitions, command and control, including C5I solutions, force protection, integrated air and missile defense and missionized ISR platforms continues to be strong. As we've seen in prior quarters, our Middle East and North Africa customers are continuing to look past near-term volatility in oil prices and are investing in high priority solutions to address an immediate and rapidly evolving threat environment.", "I visited the region earlier this month to celebrate our 50th anniversary in Saudi Arabia and met with customers. While there, I received first-hand feedback about the successful performance of our products and how they are helping protect citizens and critical infrastructure every day. I can tell you from these discussions that the interest level across the entire MENA region remains high for the types of advanced solutions we offer.", "One of the more significant upcoming MENA opportunities includes an early-warning radar system for Qatar at IDS which we expect to be awarded later this year. This program, which will significantly increase the air and missile defense sensing capabilities for Qatar has a value approaching $1 billion and has already been through the congressional notification process.", "As I mentioned earlier, our bookings in the quarter were strong. When looking across the businesses, a key driver was Space and Airborne Systems, which had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7 in the quarter, driven by domestic space-based sensor solutions in both domestic and international classified. This was the second consecutive quarter of strong bookings at SAS. And building on this, after the close of the first quarter, we announced that SAS had received a $1 billion booking for the engineering and manufacturing development phase for the next-generation Jammer franchise. These awards provide a solid foundation from which SAS will ramp sales growth into the second half of this year.", "In addition to SAS, we also saw a strong year-over-year increase in bookings in Missile Systems, driven by a number of products, including AMRAAM and SM-6. Before moving on, I would also like to point out that our overall domestic classified business, which experienced a significant increase in full year 2015 bookings, continued to see strong demand into the first quarter of 2016. Book-to-bill for the total company domestic classified was 1.3 in the quarter.", "First quarter sales for the company increased 9% year-over-year. Our international revenue was up 17% and represented 30% of total sales. Domestic sales were up 6%, with domestic classified sales increasing 12%. As I mentioned earlier, one of the key drivers of the company's first quarter sales was Missile Systems. Let me take a few moments to talk a little bit more about what is driving activity in missiles.", "As many of you know, our Missile business includes a number of franchise programs. Our global customers look to us to ensure that these programs continue to offer the most advanced capabilities so that they can stay ahead of evolving threats. A great example of this in the quarter was solid growth from AMRAAM, where we are ramping up production on the latest most advanced version of the missile, the AIM-120D. While this missile shares the AMRAAM name with earlier versions, it is vastly more capable. Across our program portfolio at Missiles, there are many other examples where we create value by upgrading the system's technology, including programs such as the Evolved Seasparrow Missile, a premier ship defense missile for our global customers.", "Also, we are seeing opportunities to adapt existing technology to new missions, such as in the case of SM-6 in Tomahawk which are now expanding into the anti-ship domain. Finally, we are developing new capabilities that are on the cutting edge of innovation including hypersonic and directed energy. In addition to this, another growth driver in Missile Systems has been the increase in operating tempo of our U.S. and international customers. As we sit here today, we see this continuing to be a revenue tailwind for the company at least through next year.", "But taking a step back, when you look at Raytheon over the past several quarters, it reinforces the value of our diverse portfolio of advanced solutions for our global customers. The recent bookings strength at SAS and Missile Systems, the significant bookings in longer cycle programs at IDS over the past couple of years as well as upcoming opportunities and the competitive position of IIS and Forcepoint in global cybersecurity markets provide a strong foundation for future growth and margin expansion.", "We were encouraged by the U.S. fiscal year 2017 defense budget and fight up (7:16) request which was released in February. The overall top line for the fiscal year 2017 budget is consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, with key focus areas including electronic warfare, ISR, missile defense, cyber and long-range strike, all areas that play to our strengths. The Department of Defense is focused on high end capabilities through its Third Offset Strategy aligns well with the high end capabilities Raytheon is known for. And we are actively working with the DoD in this area. We continue to see broad-based support for funding a robust national defense.", "Turning now to Forcepoint. We have made considerable progress toward completing the integration of recent acquisitions. Operating performance in the quarter was solid and above our expectations. Further, the business remains on track to meet the growth objectives we've outlined for you on prior calls. With much of the integration behind us, yesterday we announced a change in leadership at Forcepoint. Matthew Moynahan, who was previously at Arbor Networks, will take over as Forcepoint's CEO on May 9.", "This change is designed to build on the growth capabilities of the integrated businesses. Matt has a deep background of managing technology companies and has a proven track record of driving growth. John McCormack, who did an outstanding job managing Forcepoint, both when it was private and during the integration with Raytheon, is staying on through the end of the year as an advisor. We thank John for all his hard work and help in positioning Forcepoint to move to the next level. Forcepoint remains well-positioned for the future.", "During the first quarter, we continued to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy. In March, we raised our dividend by 9.3%. This is the 12th consecutive annual increase to our dividend and reflects our view that a sustainable competitive dividend is a key capital deployment priority. We also repurchased $400 million of stock through our share repurchase program. And as we said on the call in January, we expect the full year 2016 share buyback to approximately 2015 levels, market conditions permitting.", "Before concluding, I'd like to touch on a topic that we don't often talk about on earnings calls, which is of the utmost importance to our shareholders, and that is corporate governance. The company is committed to being a leader in contemporary corporate governance and we believe that good governance enhances shareholder value. In recent years, we have adopted a number of policies, processes and practices to ensure effective governance.", "To this end, in March, the Board of Directors voted to amend the company's bylaws to implement proxy access, providing shareholders with a process by which they can include nominees in the company's annual meeting proxy materials. The implementation of proxy access follows on our previous adoption of shareholder action by written consent in 2014 and a special meeting measure in 2010 and further demonstrates Raytheon's commitment to world-class governance practices.", "In summary, we had a good overall quarter of solid bookings, revenue growth and EPS performance. We continue to execute our growth strategy while at the same time placing a high priority on driving shareholder value. So thank you to the entire Raytheon team for the good start to 2016. Together, we have built on the momentum generated by our 2015 return to growth by delivering a strong quarter for our company, customers and shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Toby.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, if everyone would turn to page three.", "We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the first quarter with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. It's a good start to the year and we're positioned well for achieving our full year outlook. We had solid bookings in the first quarter of $6.2 billion resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.08. Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 9% led by our Missiles, SAS and Forcepoint businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.43, which I'll give a little more color on in just a moment. We generated strong operating cash flow of $325 million in the first quarter primarily due to the timing of collections and tax payments.", "During the quarter, the company bought back 3.2 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program for $400 million. And we announced last month that we increased our dividend by 9.3%. We have now raised our annual dividend every year for the past 12 years. I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS guidance that we provided in January. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.", "Turning now to page four. Let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Company bookings for the first quarter were $6.2 billion, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion over the same period last year. International awards represented 27% of the total bookings, and on a trailing four-quarter basis, the book-to-bill ratio was 1.14.", "A few key bookings in the first quarter included $646 million on AMRAAM at Missiles, and at SAS, over $650 million on an international classified contract and a $553 million award on the Joint Polar Satellite System program. And shortly after the close of the quarter, the U.S. Navy awarded SAS a $1 billion contract on the next-generation jammer program for engineering and manufacturing development.", "Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $34.8 billion and on a funded basis was $26.2 billion, an increase of approximately $2.4 billion in funded backlog compared to the first quarter 2015. It's worth noting that we ended the first quarter of 2016 with approximately 42% of our backlog comprised of international programs.", "If you now move to page five. As I just mentioned, for the first quarter 2016, sales were higher than the guidance we set in January. Sales were particularly strong at both Missiles and at SAS. We still expect sales for the company to ramp up throughout the year, with the strong second half driven by our bookings over the past several quarters and the duration of our programs.", "Looking now at sales by business. IDS had first quarter 2016 net sales of $1.3 billion. The increase from Q1 2015 was primarily driven by higher sales on certain international Patriot programs. We expect IDS sales to increase as we move through the year as some of our international Patriot programs continue to ramp up. In the first quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, the increase was primarily due to our cyber security and special mission programs.", "Missile Systems had first quarter 2016 net sales of $1.7 billion. The 17% increase from the first quarter 2015 was primarily due to both the Paveway and AMRAAM programs. SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Higher sales on classified programs, including an international program, contributed to the 7% increase versus last year. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015 and Stonesoft, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2016. As a reminder, first quarter 2015 included the results for only Raytheon Cyber Products.", "Moving ahead to page six. Let me spend a few minutes talking about our margins. Our operating margin was 10.6% for the total company and 10.2% on a business segment basis. We did have two programs with some unique circumstances that impacted our margins in the quarter. One at IDS for $36 million that because it's in a joint venture, about half was offset through the non-controlling interest line on the income statement. And one at Missiles for $22 million. We don't see any significant remaining financial exposure on these programs. If you exclude the two adjustments I just mentioned, our segment margins would be about 100 basis points higher than reported.", "In addition, as we talked about on last year's first quarter call, it's also important to note that in the first quarter of 2015, Missiles recorded a $25 million, or approximately 170-basis point, favorable resolution of a contractual issue related to a supplier settlement. As expected, IIS and SAS margins were both down compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by a change in program mix.", "Also, IIS first quarter 2015 margin included the favorable eBorders settlement worth about 340 basis points or $0.42 per share on a total company basis. And at Forcepoint, the first quarter 2016 operating margin was slightly above our expectations for the quarter, driven by strong operating performance. We remain focused on margin improvement going forward and see our base business segment margins in the 12.4% to 12.6% range for the full year, consistent with the guidance we laid out in January.", "We also see our margin cadence improving as we move throughout the year. As we have discussed on past calls, we are continuously looking for more ways to lower our costs, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. A few examples include executing our strategic sourcing strategy to reduce cost in our supply chain, factory automation, complexity reduction initiatives and reducing our footprint. Given these efforts, our strong backlog and as we progress through the life cycle of some of our production programs, we continue to see opportunities for margin expansion.", "Turning now to page seven. First quarter 2016 EPS of $1.43 was better than expected, driven largely by higher volume and the recognized tax benefit associated with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation worth about $0.05.", "On page eight, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016. We still expect our full year 2016 net sales to be in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. We have increased the full year deferred revenue adjustment by $10 million to $77 million to reflect the updated estimate of purchase accounting related to the Stonesoft acquisition we completed earlier in the year.", "We have lowered our effective tax rate to reflect the tax benefit associated with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation that I just discussed which, in total, is worth about $0.13 for the full year, with the additional $0.08 expected in the second quarter. We now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28.5%, and we have raised our full year 2016 EPS to reflect the tax benefit I just mentioned. We now expect our EPS to be in a range of between $6.93 and $7.13. As I discussed earlier, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $400 million in the quarter and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 296 and 298 million shares for 2016, a 3% reduction at the midpoint of the range.", "Operating cash flow in the first quarter was strong and we continue to see our full year 2016 operating cash flow outlook between $2.7 billion and $3 billion. And as you can see on page nine, we've included guidance by business, which is unchanged from our prior outlook. I want to reiterate that at IDS, we still see margins in the 15.9% to 16.1% range. As I said on the January call, our full year 2016 guidance includes positive operating income at IDS related to an expected exit from certain business ventures later in 2016, which you can now think of in the $125 million to $150 million range. This is subject to the finalization of the transaction, which we expect to close in the second half of the year.", "And as a reminder, when thinking about our 2017 company margin, we see opportunity for upside from 2016 levels, excluding the impact of this gain at IDS that I just discussed, which is expected to be worth about 50 to 60 basis points at the company level in 2016. Before moving on to page 10, as I mentioned on the January call, we still see our 2016 bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion, driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. The first quarter was a good step to meeting this target.", "On page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and operating cash flow for the balance of 2016. Here, you can see the ramp we have been referring to in the second half of the year. I want to point out that we now expect the second quarter sales to be in the range of just under $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of volume that occurred in Q1 that I talked about earlier. And EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.51 to $1.56, slightly higher than our prior guidance due to the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation, worth about $0.08 in the second quarter.", "Before concluding, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about our balanced capital deployment strategy. We repurchased $400 million of stock in the quarter, and as we said on the January call, we expect the full year 2016 share buyback to approximate 2015's levels. We raised the dividend by 9.3%, our 12th consecutive annual increase. We continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and target returning 80% to 90% of free cash flow to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet.", "In summary, we saw good performance in the first quarter. Our bookings were ahead of last year's first quarter and sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than the guidance we set in January. We remain well-positioned for the year with our domestic customers' priority areas and continue to be aligned with the evolving priorities of our international customers. Our objective is to drive the business to maximize value for our customers and shareholders.", "With that, Tom and I will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Good morning. Thank you.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Good morning, Howard.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Howard.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Tom, Toby. The \u2013 you've \u2013 how shall I call it? I used to not have to footnote odd items, and of late there's been a couple of adjustments in some of the periods, and they've been a little bit more adverse than one would have expected out of Raytheon. Tom, what are you doing, or Toby, to sort of eliminate some of these variabilities with respect to operational challenges?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "First of all, there was two programs I think you're alluding to that did impact us on the Q1 results. They do have unique circumstances. One of them was a program, essentially complete and we are having some, I would call it warranty issues on some shelters from a supplier. We are working through that with the supplier. We did take a charge this quarter due to that. However, we are working with that supplier to essentially recover those costs. Very similar to, if you look at last year at Missiles, we had an issue with a supplier and we recovered the cost from that supplier last year. This is unfortunately in some cases part of the business when a supplier doesn't perform or has issues, we have to take the charge, but then we go back and recover those costs, and that's where we're at on that one.", "The other one was a little bit of a stranger deal with a customer relative to some changes in scope and defining whose responsibility the scope was and also some other issues relative to the structure of the contract. So it's more of a \u2013 to us it's kind of a one-time type of an issue. We don't see that as systemic across the business. And so I am looking at these two as one-off and we are disappointed in the fact that they are one-offs, that they even exist, but we don't see them as being systemic across the business. I hope that helps.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "And I think the other thing Howard, on these two, as I mentioned, I'll reiterate, we don't see any significant financial exposure going forward on either one of these two programs. We think this captures it and bounds it. And I'd also just augment a little bit; we do have a lot of programs as we talk about historically across our portfolio. We feel very confident in the processes that \u2013 by which we use to manage those programs and monitor their progress, and as we said, unfortunately, here there were just some unique circumstances on these two that did impact us here in the quarter and we're going to work to try to at least on the first one at IDS, as Tom said, get some of the impact that we sustained during the quarter recovered through the supplier.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "No \u2013 thank you. That makes a lot of sense. And just as a follow-up, the R&D's up again and what we're seeing is \u2013 I'll call it a change or an evolution in the threat. Tom, could you address a little bit some of the opportunities that you see incrementally in air defense? I think, again, going back to the HASC, there's clearly more need for the U.S. to work on some improvements and I know you are positioning Patriot to take advantage of some of that.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So I think one of the areas that we're \u2013 besides the demand for the Patriot upgrade to configuration 3+ on the existing systems, there also has been a demand for new fire units from several countries that are facing significant issues. As I mentioned, I just came back \u2013 I've actually been in the Middle East twice in the \u2013 since the beginning of the year already. The last one was to celebrate our 50th anniversary in Saudi. And I got first-hand information from the folks that are using the Patriot systems in both \u2013 over that period of time from both the UAE and from Saudi, and I can tell you that the success has been just tremendous relative to them preventing damages due to tactical ballistic missiles landing in their cities and villages. So there's a strong \u2013 they're seeing the success of that system which is \u2013 I would say kind of unleashing a lot of other demand within the region to have the capability. So that's the basic element.", "What we're seeing beyond that is a demand on the Patriot system for an advanced AESA radar with 360 capability, and that demand is essentially \u2013 the primary part of that demand is coming from international. We also are seeing it from the U.S. Army. That's their roadmap to add a 360-degree AESA capability to the Patriot system. So we have invested in that technology. I mean it goes all the way back to the GaN work that we'd done almost going 15, 20 years ago, but leading up to how we won the AMDR program using that technology, but now it's transitioning into the Patriot system.", "We're also seeing high demand for, I would call it, Third Offset Strategy concepts, and in there is obviously hypersonics, undersea, you saw Secretary Ash Carter talk about something called distributed lethality and he referenced the work that's being done on Tomahawk and the SM-6 relative to that anti-ship capability. So we're seeing quite a bit of opportunities for either enhancements to our existing systems or new systems that \u2013 to ensure that we're positioned to go win those. We are doing IRAT (30:14) activities to support those. I don't know if that answers your question?", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "No. Thank you. That's great.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "And Howard, just from a numbers point of view, so the increase in the first quarter were about 3.5% of sales there's, call it, just under $60 million in absolute dollars of increase and that delta is split roughly 50/50, half being related to Forcepoint, right, which because of the timing of the acquisitions, wasn't in the first quarter of last year, and the other half primarily driven by our Missiles business for a lot of the reasons Tom just talked about. And as a reminder, for the full year, we're looking at about 3.2% of sales across the business. That's up from last year; but 80%-plus of that increase again is related to Forcepoint and the balance to the spending across the rest of the defense business.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "I appreciate the color. Thank you very much.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Howard.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks so much. Good morning.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Rob.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Good morning.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "In Missiles, you noted you had a very strong quarter for revenues but you didn't raise the revenue guidance for the full year. Does that suggest this is a relatively short-term demand and you don't expect it to be sustained through the full year?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I think we \u2013 on my discussions I did talk about the fact that we believe that this volume is sustainable through this year and into next, so we feel fairly solid about the 2016 and 2017 in terms of growth, and Toby'll take you into some of the details.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, I think Rob \u2013 some of what you saw in the first quarter at Missiles was timing within the year, not just for Missiles, but for the total company. As I mentioned, we do have a ramp through the year, especially into the back half. So we still see Missiles, to your point in the high single digits from a growth point of view with the cadence improving through the second half of the year as we ramp up on some of our recent international production and development programs. So we feel we still have it pegged with the current guidance, and really, Q1 was more timing than anything else.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And Rob, one thing we're seeing is a little different this year at Missiles is we're seeing the demand across the entire portfolio of Missiles, all of our franchises, the Paveways, the TOWs, AMRAAMs, the 89Xs the CRAMs, the Griffins, and even a resurgence on our Gen T missiles for Patriot. So it's not like it's in one area. It's across the whole portfolio.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then maybe a second one. On Forcepoint, I wondering if you could give us an idea of how the older legacy firewall business did in the quarter relative to the more modern products in that division? Thank you.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So the legacy filtering business from the legacy Websense was down in the quarter by about a third. Okay? That said, excluding the acquisition of Stonesoft that we had in the first quarter \u2013 even taking that into account Forcepoint sales on a normalized basis did grow 9%, so the TRITON product and the Federal business that came over from RCP more than offset the decrease in the legacy web filtering business.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "That's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Hi, Sam.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I guess, Toby, can you talk as to whether the \u2013 since the margins are unchanged, especially IDS and MS, were these charges anticipated when you provided the guidance, or is it something that I guess when you're unwinding this joint venture now it looks like that amount at least is higher than the $90 million it was in the 10-K, so did that change? I'm just trying to think about what the offset to these unfavorable changes are.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah. No, that's a fair question Sam. So no, we did not consider these in the guidance that we gave; either the one at IDS or the one at Missiles. Now just remember the $90 million in the K that you're referring to would be the cost to us to exit the venture, not necessarily the P&L impact but the cash impact. But as far as how we expect to see things improving or recovering this, we do expect to see margins get better or expand in Q2 and beyond that into the second half of 2016. And as I mentioned before, even looking out into 2017, we still see opportunity for margin expansion. And again, as a reminder, that's excluding the $125 million to $150 million impact from the business venture exit in 2016.", "That said, if you think about Q2 for a minute, we do expect it to be in line with Q1 when you adjust Q1 for the impact of the two programs that I talked about, that I mentioned had about a 100 basis point impact. If you look over the last couple years, from a total company point of view, we typically see our higher margins in the back half and even more towards Q4. We still see it playing out the same this year, and it was set up that way in the initial guidance we gave even before these charges. We also have the gain in Q3 from the venture exit that we talked about, and then we do expect the improved performance in Q4 as we ramp up on some of our production programs, both through the retirement of risk and benefit from the combination of strong volume and driving efficiencies.", "So there is a ramp, Sam. The increase in the gain on the venture accounts for part of the way that this is offset, combined with generally speaking, driving more efficiencies through the business in the back half of the year. And again, other than those adjustments in the first quarter, not much has really changed relative to the cadence as to how we see things ramping up through the year.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about the Mid East, just in terms of the pace of activity? I know you don't have any big binary orders, other than the Qatar, but are customers making decisions at the pace you expect them? Or are you seeing the timing of them stretch out?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think number one is, as you know, we've been in the Middle East a long time. And I just mentioned on earlier the 50-year celebration in Saudi. So we've been working a lot of these projects for many years already, so there's several that are coming to fruition. You mentioned one, which is the early warning radaring in Qatar. And we also have other activities that we're seeing, I want to say strength in, and that is the area of C5ISR across the region. And one of the big areas is integrating all of these missile defense capabilities that a nation has and tying them together and providing a common operating picture for those, tying that together with an interoperating center and then providing an overall joint operating center for the entire country. So we're seeing a demand signal for that kind of capability across the region. And then outside of the radar I mentioned, there's just a replenishment of \u2013 essentially of effectors that have been either used or are now kind of off the shelf, the expiration dates that they need to replenish. And that's just happening, so we're not seeing anything that's slipping to the right in those elements in the Middle East right now.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much, and good morning.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Good morning Seth.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I wanted to ask another question about Missiles, and for, let's say, for the four years ended 2015, and this was fairly consistently a $6.5 billion business. Now we're going to $7 billion and then maybe a bit higher than that, and I heard what you said about the sustainability of demand through 2017 and also the fact that OPTEMPO is a factor, is a driver of the growth that we're seeing. So just when you think \u2013 I don't know if it's possible, but when you think about what's driven the growth in 2016 and maybe some additional growth in 2017, if you could sort of in maybe a couple of large buckets quantify what the drivers are in terms how much is OPTEMPO versus how much is anti-ship versus any other categories?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think there's really three \u2013 I'll hit it in three kind of big buckets. One is \u2013 you're obviously correct, is the OPTEMPO. I would say the other one is just the \u2013 actually call it the Third Offset Strategy type efforts that we're seeing in terms of enhancing missile capabilities. And I think I already talked about \u2013 I did talk about the SM-6 and the Tomahawk and adding in the anti-ship capabilities. And we're also seeing on the \u2013 essentially in the missile defense area, our whole SM-3 product line and the enhancements there relative to missile defense. And if you marry those to what you're seeing out in the world today, relative to the tempo efforts that are going on in the Middle East, the stuff from North Korea relative to the missile defense required for that, it ties in. And then the overall Third Offset Strategy bringing in the improvements in our Missiles across the board, including looking at hypersonics. I think those three things are driving it. So as I mentioned before, we're not seeing just one of the franchises, or a couple of the programs increasing in volume and increasing demand, it's across the whole portfolio. I think that's what's different.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. And if you \u2013 would you say that in those three buckets, are they roughly equal contributors to the overall growth of the business over the 2016, 2017 timeframe? Or is it much more weighted toward one or the other?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say, and I don't have the details in front of me, but the tempo is driving up at a faster rate than the other two. But the other two, the rates on those are increasing over prior years. How's that?", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Very good. Very good. Appreciate it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please proceed.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Carter.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Morning, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I wanted to ask quickly about Forcepoint and the leadership change there and just if that signals anything about the company's direction or strategy or opportunities, challenges. I know that clearly the growth was pretty impressive on the ex-Stonesoft and ex-the legacy filtering stuff. So just wondered if you could speak to that and what you're seeing and what it means in terms of the change there?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, Carter, I'll just give you a quick, from a financial perspective, and then let Tom weigh in on it from a balance of the question there. But we didn't change the outlook for the year. So things are on track financially, both from a growth and a margin point of view. And we've been talking beyond this year that we would expect to see beyond the high single-digit growth rate this year, moving into the teens with some margin expansion. So all that still remains on track, and Tom can add to that as well.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So let me step back because we're going on one year since we acquired the Websense company and then integrated it in with our Raytheon Cyber Products group. And then with the recent acquisition of Stonesoft created a, I would call it a commercial cyber security products company that has about a $600 million revenue, which puts it right up there in terms of the largest cyber security commercial software companies in the world. And what we're seeing is the demand for those products across, essentially across each one of their major areas, the TRITON product, the Stonesoft next-generation firewalls, and the SureView product line that came out of RCP. And we're really looking at how do we go to the next level relative to the growth of that business. And one of the areas that we see as a big opportunity is in the large enterprises. The Websense company came across as a very strong, solid foundation in the SME area, small to medium-sized enterprises, with some large enterprises. But we see significant opportunity in expanding into the large enterprise area.", "And Matt Moynahan has significant experience in that area, his work all the way back in Symantec, Veracode and also at Arbor Networks. And so we needed to bring in a leader with that kind of experience to go drive the expansion and the market segmentation into those two groups. That's really the \u2013 he's the right guy to now come in and then take the steed. (44:19) J-Mac, John McCormack did an excellent job for us in the integration and making sure that we had a solid foundation, but we believe now it's time to bring in somebody who can take us into the next markets, especially in the large enterprises.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. And then just two quick follow-ups for Toby. One, on the adjustment in IDS, have you assumed any recovery whatsoever, a partial recovery of those costs? Or would that all be a reversal on upside? And then if you could remind us what the pension funding requirement stands at for 2017 and 2018?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Sure. On the IDS question, we've not assumed any additional recovery in our outlook beyond the charge we took, but as I mentioned and Tom mentioned, we are going to work to pursue that from our subcontractors going forward.", "On the pension requirement, next year \u2013 this year we're looking at about $165 million. Next year it's about $933 million, and as a reminder, that increase is due to the fact that the plan comes out of full funding from a PPA point of view. We now have to fund the annual service cost and obviously, given the market performance last year, we would be needing to recover and fund the \u2013 or amortize over a few years the shortfall that we had. When you look out beyond, in 2017 and beyond, I think the best way to think of it is from a net cash perspective, a net funding perspective. While it's not as much as this year, right, which is around a positive $1.3 billion, think of it as about $700 million based upon current assumptions per year in 2017 and beyond as a run rate going forward.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "So it kind of flattens out from that 2017 level?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah. 2016 is a little bit of an anomaly given how CAF harmonization kicks in. We're still in full funding from a PPA point of view. So we have the spike up to the $1.3 billion. Last year, as a reminder, we were about $800 million, but the $700 million plus or minus would \u2013 based upon our current assumptions, would be a run rate.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Hunter.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "So, you guys mentioned the term evolving priorities of your international customers in your prepared remarks and presumably, and you touched on this a little bit earlier, but presumably you're talking about the dynamics of an evolving battlefield. But is it also a comment embedded in there on an increasing focus on price or value for the money that they're spending as their needs evolve?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well I think there's always a concern on their part that they're getting value for their money. And I think that's one of the areas is does the system work. Can they operate the system? And I think my last trip in, seeing the fact that they are operating the systems that we provide and that they are seeing success is ensuring them at least the value that they're getting from our solution set that we offer. So I didn't see any issues relative to any of my visits in country, relative to any concerns in terms of value for what they're getting from us. Because they're getting the results.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Yep. And then you guys mentioned long-range strike as a funding priority, so I'll just bring it up. Is there any color you guys can provide us on your potential role on B-21 either whether it's radar or something else. I think a lot of people assumed you were part of the Boeing Lockheed team. Do you see yourselves possessing a role on that program going forward? Really anything you would be willing to provide on that would be great. Thanks for the time.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, unfortunately, we can't talk about it. So...", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah. Okay. Thought I'd ask. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Richard Safran from Buckingham Research. Please proceed.", "Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Good morning, Rich.", "Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Tom, I wanted to ask you a question. You had a release about an ATACMS replacement that you're offering a new missile design, long-range for a precision fire. So I had a bit of a multi-part question on that. So you've been talking about the demand for your current missile products. What's the interest level at the Pentagon right now for a new missile program? Has the Army decided to move ahead with a new missile program rather than just extend ATACMS? And I was wondering if you could give us any sense about the size and timing of the program, about any opportunity?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well it's definitely at its infancy right now. We are working with the Army, also with some of our competitors, to help them define what this program is moving forward. Obviously we feel that a new missile can provide the best capability with the best cost and being able to integrate as much of the new technology that's out there as possible. So that's really our position moving forward on it. It's at its infancy. And as we get more information relative to the Army, we'll be glad to share that with you over time.", "Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And then also on another program you were talking about, the next-generation Jammer and the $1 billion dollar award and the 15 engineering development pods. Could you discuss a little bit about how that contract will play out, period of performance there for the $1 billion reward? And if the Navy moves to the next phase, how big of an award could that be?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well again, this is \u2013 this award is to go complete the engineering, manufacturing and development phase of the program. And so the assets or the pods, 15 pods that are going to be developed are essentially EEMS assets, (50:23) assets that'll be used for qualification in terms of flight tests and also environmental tests that will be done on the pods to ensure that they meet the overall requirement needs of the United States Navy. So that's what that program is. Following that program, there'll be a transition to production, LRIP and then a full-on \u2013 you asked about a period of performance. It's approximately four years for that $1 billion-dollar program.", "Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks very much for that. Appreciate it.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Strauss of UBS. Please proceed.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Good morning, David.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Just a quick housekeeping. Toby, on the IDS gain that you're expecting, is that \u2013 I think you said $125 million to $150 million before. I think you were talking about $100 million to $125 million. Is that correct?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "That's correct.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Going back to margins, obviously, moving around a fair amount at this point. I guess maybe Tom or Toby, could you maybe talk about what \u2013 by business, what you kind of see as a normalized margin level? I know margins are supposed to pick up in the back half of the year and into 2017. But you've got IDS looking like it's running below normal, SAS below, but Missiles may be a little bit above. So any color you could give around kind of what we should expect for normalized margins by business? Thanks.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "So I \u2013 David, I think that's a little tough to do, to really define normalized given the mix of development and production programs and the timing of completions and starts move around and it's not consistent business-by-business. What I can maybe give you a little bit of color on, I'll just go real quick by the businesses is maybe give you an indication on how we see things playing out through the balance of this year, right. So we talked about IDS and what happened in the quarter with the $36 million impact. But we do see the margin improving through the year, partly driven by improvement in business mix as some of our larger international programs move through the production cycle. And then you mentioned it a minute ago, we do have in the second half, in the third quarter, the gain from the exit of the venture, which is $125 million to $150 million, and that's about 210 to 250 basis points at the IDS level.", "For IIS we're expecting total year 7.4 to 7.6 (53:16). That would be roughly in line with 2015 after adjusting for the Q1 eBorders. What we see happening, compared to Q1 there, is improved mix moving going forward within IIS. Some improved productivity as we move through the year, and also some improvement coming from expected award fees for IIS. From a Missiles point of view, we talked about the impact in the first quarter with the $22 million adjustment, but if we look forward for the balance of the year, we still see Missiles getting to the 13% to 13.2% range with margins starting to improve or expand in Q2 and in the second half of the year. Really driven by mix and the timing and the ramp up of programs and some expected efficiencies that we would see at Missiles.", "At SAS, they were down year over year in Q1 as we expected really, driven by some mix, but they were a little bit ahead of our expectations for the quarter. And then, when we think about SAS moving forward, again we're still in the 12.9% to 13.1% range and we do expect the margin to improve throughout the year driven by more favorable mix and therefore the timing of some program improvements.", "At Forcepoint, real quick, margin improved in the quarter because of the addition of Websense the acquisition last year. It's still on track for the total year of 11.5% to 12.5% range. Really with a little bit more of a ramp or expansion in the second half of the year driven by two things, the completion of integration activities related to the Stonesoft acquisition and also as the sales ramp up in the back half of the year. So overall, we do see the cadence improving in Q2 as well as the second half, primarily as we progress through program lifecycles on some of our more recent awards and due to the timing of expected program improvements as well.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks for the color.", "Todd Ernst - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Sure. And Mark, we have time for one more call or one more question.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. I wanted to ask on SAS, it does look like the backlog trends there are turning around pretty good after a few years of in decline. The 1Q is good and then the Jammer drops through. I'm not sure of the duration of the ones you booked in the quarter and then obviously the Jammer is a bit of a longer duration, but is SAS going vie for \u2013 start to vie for growing at or above company trends in 2017 and 2018 given the book of business you're getting?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean so the \u2013 you're absolutely correct on the Jammer. That's about a four-year period of performance. The other big contract, the classified one, is another four-year period of performance. So I would say it's going to have sustainable growth definitely over the next two years, just based on the bookings that they've received here in the last quarter, and obviously last year in 2015.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And Toby, just a quick one. As you look at this tax rate impact for this year, is this something that would be recurring as you have the three-year vest? So now we're building into the model for 2017 and 2018, 100 basis points lower tax rates.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "So there's the potential for it to be recurring, Myles. We have our shares that vest, some of them vest in Q1, and some of them vest in Q2. And the determination as to whether there'd be an impact is driven by where the market price of the stock is on the date they vest compared to the price at issuance, the strike price at issuance. So there could be volatility, but it could be negative volatility as well if our stock price were to go down. So we're going to have to assess that on an annual basis based upon the market and what's happening out there. So I wouldn't necessarily jump to the conclusion that the 100 basis point adjustment is the right thing. It will be really something that we'll have to look at on a year to year basis.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. All right. Thanks so much.", "Anthony F.

My name is Tawanda and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed sir.", "Todd Ernst", "Thank you, Tawanda. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and a slide that will reference, are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then we'll move on to questions.", "Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are non-historical facts, particularly comments regarding the Company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discuss in detail in our SEC filings.", "With that I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?", "Tom Kennedy", "Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with Raytheon's strong second quarter performance. Our global growth strategy continues to drive our results, with second quarter revenue up 3%. Our operating performance in the quarter was solid with a strong increase in sequential margins and cash flow generation in the second quarter was well above our expectations.", "Given our performance in 2016 to date and how we're seeing the balance of the year playing out, we're raising our EPS and cash flow guidance for the year. Further, based on strong demand that we're seeing from our global customers, we also have raised our outlook for bookings. Toby will walk you through the details in a few minutes.", "During the second quarter, I visited a number of country leaders in the Asia-Pacific region. And earlier this month we hosted several hundred customer meetings at the Farnborough Airshow. There was a remarkable level of consistency among these conversations. That is customers are interested in capabilities to address two key missions, one, support global counterterrorism campaigns and two, maintain deterrence in a charged geopolitical environment. More specifically we continue to see strong demand for integrated air missile defense solutions, precision munitions and C5 ISR capability. This demand has been broad-based across the European, MENA and Asia-Pacific regions.", "Further, this year there's been an added sense of urgency. I can't think of a time when our international pipeline of opportunities was more robust than it is today. Our international model which looks at countries as markets, is paying off. Let me just give you a few examples. One of our larger international opportunities over the next several months is the Qatar upgraded early warning radar. This radar will significantly improve Qatar's long-range situational awareness capabilities and represents a $1 billion opportunity for the Company. This follows on the country's previous order for ten PATRIOT fire units and an air defense operating center.", "We also see further opportunity in-country for TPY-2 radars as part of a THAAD system later in 2017 or 2018. This is consistent with how we've been thinking about the progression of opportunities in the country for some time. Another large upcoming opportunity for the Company is Poland Patriot which is also progressing well. Government to government negotiations are ongoing and we've achieved key milestones with Polish industry on work share, including signing a letter of intent to work with Poland's largest defense contractor, PGC. We anticipate that this multi-billion dollar opportunity will be awarded sometime in 2017. We also see additional opportunities in Poland, including short-range air defense systems related to our NASAMS product line.", "Looking at second quarter, our bookings were strong with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18. Strength in the quarter was driven by the billion-dollar next generation jammer booking at the beginning of the quarter, a nearly $500 million upgrade to Kuwait's six PATRIOT fire units, as well as several notable missile bookings for AIM-9X, Paveway and SM-3. You may recall that we also had a strong bookings in the first which together with our 2Q results drove a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.13. This strength in bookings lays the foundation for future growth and bolsters our confidence in our outlook.", "In the second quarter international represented 31% of total Company bookings. I'd also point out that with the Kuwait Patriot booking, this is the second consecutive quarter where we have had a significant award, from the MENA region. At the end of the second quarter, 42% of our total backlog was from international customers. Our sales growth in the second quarter was ahead of our expectations. Domestic sales increased slightly, while international increased approximately 8% in the quarter, showing that our global growth strategy remains on track. Overall, international represented 32% of total sales in the quarter.", "As we look at future growth drivers for the Company, I would like to take a minute to highlight a couple of our many examples. In the second quarter, we delivered the first air and missile defense radar to the U.S. Navy's Pacific missile range facility ahead of schedule. AMDR is the next-generation integrated air and ballistic missile defense radar for the U.S. Navy's DDT 51 Flight III destroyers and fills a critical capability gap for the surface fleet. This delivery is the latest in a series of milestones achieved for AMDR as it advances through the engineering and manufacturing development phase which is now close to 80% complete. AMDR will soon transition to low rate initial production and remains on track for initial delivery in 2019.", "Another example of a future growth driver for the Company is Small Diameter Bomb II which we continue to test with the U.S. Air Force. Small Diameter Bomb II features a highly advanced tri-mode seeker which includes infrared imaging, millimeter wave radar and laser guidance to find and attack targets from rages that can exceed 40 Miles.", "Testing will continue the summer as the program moves through low rate initial production. Small Diameter Bomb II represents a $4 billion opportunity over the lifetime of this franchise program. Before closing, I'd like to take a moment to briefly touch on the FY '17's defense budget. As most of you know, both the House and Senate have marked up their respective bills and there are significant differences between them. these differences will need to be reconciled before the budget is finalized. Given this and the fact that it is election year, we're anticipating that there will be another continuing resolution which will probably extend beyond the election in November. This assumption is considered within our financial guidance range.", "Overall, I'm very pleased with the team's performance in the second quarter. Simply put we had an outstanding results, a solid growth and strong execution. I want to thank the team for all its efforts which continue to deliver for our Company and global customers.", "With that, let me turn it over to Toby.", "Toby O'Brian", "Okay, thanks Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the second quarter highlights and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would please turn to page 3.", "We're pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the second quarter, with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the second quarter of $7.1 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18. Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our space and airborne systems and missiles businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $2.38 which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. We generated strong operating cash flow of $746 million in the second quarter which was better than our prior guidance, primarily driven by the timing of collections. Second quarter 2016 operating cash flow was higher than last year's second quarter, primarily due to the timing of payments and cash taxes, as well as lower required pension contributions.", "During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock for $202 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.8 million shares for $602 million. I want to spend a minute talking about the recent ThalesRaytheonSystems transaction that was concluded at the end of June. Raytheon Thalas concluded an agreement to transition the stakeholder positions each Company held in the TRS joint venture structure. With Raytheon acquiring 100% of the TRS U.S. operations and Thalas acquired 100% of the French operations. As a result of the transaction, Raytheon made a net cash payment to Thalas in the amount of $90 million and recorded a tax-free gain of $158 million at IDS or $0.53 per diluted share in our second quarter financial results.", "Important to note that we had previously forecast this to occur in the third quarter of this year at about $150 million. I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS and operating cash flow guidance that we provided in April, reflecting our strong performance to date. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.", "Turning now to page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Company bookings for the second quarter were $7.1 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $13.3 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing four quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.11. For the quarter, international was 31% of our total Company bookings and on a year-to-date basis was 29%. For the year, we expect international to be about 35% of total bookings.", "As Tom just mentioned, we booked several significant awards in the second quarter, including about $1 billion for the next generation jammer program for the U.S. Navy, $574 million on domestic and foreign training programs in support of war fighter focus activities, $487 million to provide advanced Patriot air and missile defense capabilities for Kuwait and approximately $300 million a piece on both AIM-9X, Sidewinder, short range air-to-air missiles and Paveway. Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $35.3 billion and on a funded basis was $26.1 billion, both up approximately $800 million compared to last year's second quarter.", "We now move to page 5. As I mentioned earlier, for the second quarter 2016, sales exceeded the high end of guidance we set in April, primarily due to timing within the year and better-than-expected performance across several of the businesses. For the second quarter, our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales.", "Looking now at sales by business. IDS had second quarter 2016 net sales of $1.4 billion. As expected the change in net sales for the quarter was primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred pre-contract cost on an international Patriot program in the second quarter 2015. In the second quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.6 billion, up 3% compared with the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to our cyber security and special mission programs. Missile systems had second quarter 2016 net sales of $1.7 billion. The 6% increase from the second quarter 2015 was primarily due to the Paveway program.", "SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion. The 9% increase versus last year was driven by higher sales on classified programs. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense which we completed at the end of May 2015.", "Moving ahead to page 6. Overall the Company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 15.9% for the total Company and 14.8% on a business segment basis. It's worth noting that the impact of the TRS gain that I discussed earlier was essentially in-line with our prior expectation and was worth $158 million or about 260 basis points at the Company level for the second quarter of 2016.", "So looking now at the business margins. The increase in margin at IDS included the results of the TRS transaction. Without the transaction, the IDS margin in the second quarter would've been 15.5%, reflecting their strong operating performance. IIS operating margin was in-line with last year's second quarter. Missiles margin was up 170 basis points in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies and a favorable change in program mix in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease in margin at SAS in the quarter, compared with the same period last year, was primarily driven by a change in program mix.", "And at Forcepoint the second quarter 2016 operating margin was higher than last year's comparable quarter, primarily due to the acquisition of Websense. Forcepoint's Q2 margin improved from Q2 2015 and as expected, was impacted by integration and transition costs. As we discussed on past calls we remain focused on margin improvement going forward. We're continuously looking for ways to lower our cost, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. In the second quarter one of the key drivers of our margin improvement was the payoff from our investment in factory automation and equipment upgrades and we also saw productivity gains from increased operating leverage.", "Turning now to page 7, second quarter 2016 EPS was $2.38, better than expected, primarily driven by higher sales and productivity as well as from the timing of the TRS transaction which as mentioned earlier, was previously forecast to occur in the third quarter. As expected, second quarter 2016 also included the tax benefit associated with the new accounting standard for stock compensation which we previously adopted in the first quarter, worth about $0.10. Of note, the second quarter 2015 included a favorable $0.29 non-cash tax settlement.", "On page 8, as I mentioned earlier, we're updating the Company's financial outlook for 2016 to reflect our improved operating performance to date compared to our prior guidance. We still expect our full-year 2016 net sales to be in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business.", "We've increased our full-year 2016 EPS by $0.20 from our prior guidance and now expect it to be in the range of $7.13 to $7.33. The increase is driven by our improved performance in the first half of the year, as well as a slight improvement to the effective tax rate and slightly lower interest expense.", "Turning to our share repurchase, for the end of the second quarter we repurchased 4.8 million shares of common stock for just over $600 million and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 296 million and 298 million shares for 2016, a 3% reduction at the midpoint of the range. Also, based on our strong performance to date, we've increased the range for our 2016 operating cash flow guidance by $100 million and now see it between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion.", "And as you can see on page 9, we've included guidance by business. We left the sales unchanged from prior outlook. Looking at margins, we've increased the margin guidance range for the Company and now see operating margin to be in a range of 13.2% to 13.4% for the full-year, up 20 basis points from our prior guidance. At the business segment level, we now see the operating margin in a range of 12.6% to 12.8% for the full-year, driven by higher expected operating margin at IDS and SAS. Before moving on to page 10, given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectation for a strong back half of the year, we're now raising our full-year 2016 bookings outlook to $26 billion, plus or minus $500 million. This $500 million increase to the prior range is driven by strong demand from our global customers.", "On page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the third quarter for sales, earnings-per-share and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We still expect third quarter sales to be in a range of just under $6 billion to $6.1 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.57 to $1.62, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of the TRS transaction which we had previously forecast in the third quarter. Some of this impact has been offset by the timing of performance improvements previously expected in the fourth quarter.", "Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls, with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a solid balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans and productivity improvements, as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Making small targeted acquisitions benefit our technology and global growth needs these and from time to time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.", "In summary, if you stand back and look at the quarter, we had strong performance. Our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than expected. Based on this performance and our near term expectations, we increased our 2016 guidance for EPS, operating margin and operating cash flow.", "With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Given the strength in the quarter really across-the-board and the good cash flow, how come you cut back on your share repurchase from the first quarter and what's your thinking going forward regarding cash deployment?", "Toby O'Brian", "Let me address that one. So we had planned and we front loaded the share repurchase based upon the timing of our cash flows, okay? And we always had Q1 in excess of the balance of the year, where more than halfway through what we had targeted at the beginning of the year. That said related to the repurchase, we still continue to see value in our stock.", "At our last call we indicated a target of 80% to 90% of free cash flow going back to shareholders. Right now we probably see it maybe at the bottom of that range pending market conditions and if we continue to see strong movement in the stock, we're not going to chase the stock price. Share repurchase will still continue to be a core part of our capital deployment strategy, you know, with the stated goal of reducing the diluted share count over time and that hasn't changed. But we will continue to be disciplined when it comes to the allocation of our capital.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.", "Carter Copeland", "Just a quick clarification for you Toby and a question, Tom. Toby, on the TRS transaction, is there equity income to consider that will be missing going forward? I just was unsure of the accounting implications there but wanted to make sure we all got it modeled correctly. And then for Tom, just on the Forcepoint competitive landscape, I know that during the quarter obviously the purchase of Blue Coat by Symantec. I wondered if you could talk to what implications that has for that marketplace and how you think about the landscape post that announcement?", "Toby O'Brian", "Yes, sure. I'll address, Carter, the TRS one. There are a few moving pieces with the remaining venture going forward that impact both IDS operating income and at the Raytheon level net income, but they essentially offset each other and are not significant to our results so we shouldn't see an impact one way the other going forward.", "Tom Kennedy", "And on the Forcepoint, you're absolutely correct, Carter. You know, commercial cyber is a dynamic and rapidly evolving environment and you did mention competitive landscape and it's going to continue to shift, Raytheon continues to invest in R&D to ensure that we have the best products and capabilities for customers and that's where we're getting the feedback from our customers on.", "I would add one thing is that you probably saw that the multiples and valuations for Blue Coat acquisition do reflect the premium value and growth potential that this commercial cyber market currently has. Just a quick status on Forcepoint, we have integrated Websense in with our Raytheon cyber products group. It's substantially complete. It was a seamless transition to the new organization and now we're working to complete the transition of the Stonesoft acquisition into the overall Company and we see considerable upside potential as we move forward based on this business we have put together.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed. ", "Jason Gursky", "Tom and Toby, I was just wondering if you could just walk us through what you think these bookings that you've been getting here over the last year or so tell us about the cadence of revenue. So over the next several years, it's going to be linear growth? Do you have some visibility on when all of these bookings are going to actually convert into some revenue streams?", "Toby O'Brian", "Jason, you know the nature of our business. The majority of these big awards have about a three-year or five-year cycle, in that range. So traditionally, I mean, we lighten up the first year. If it's three year, we lighten up the first year little bit, lighten up the last year and the middle year is the main. But normally it's about a three-year duration in terms of revenue generation out of the majority of the bookings. IIS does have some quick term, one-year type turn business, but majority of the business and a majority of these major awards that we brought in, are three- to five-year type revenue generators.", "Tom Kennedy", "And I would just add, you know, obviously we're not giving guidance for 2017, but from when you convert that strong pipeline to a financial perspective, the backlog we had entering the year on the heels of a 1.09% book-to-bill, strong book-to-bill through the first six months, strong four quarter trailing book-to-bill, as Tom mentioned in his comment, a pipeline that we haven't seen of this magnitude for quite some time. We expect to continue to grow that top line, taking all that into account into 2017 and drive margin expansion as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed.", "Doug Harned", "I'm interested in on the same topic in missiles. Now missiles you've had really nice growth in backlogs, margins have been quite good. Can you comment on the both what it is in the trends in the U.S.-international mix and do you see the growth trajectory in missiles as a secular one or are we seeing kind of a temporary jump up on things like Paveway that we may not see continued growth there in the same way we have?", "Tom Kennedy", "Let me hit that, Doug, real quick. It breaks into three buckets. The first bucket and I actually mentioned in my prior comments, was the counter-terrorism and that's driving the sales on the precision weapons across-the-board at missiles. The other bucket is deterrence and that's essentially driving a lot of the work relative to our Patriot missiles and our Patriot systems and then the last large bucket is, I would call it and these were the third offset strategy or the future in terms of upgrades to new missiles and capabilities. In the middle bucket on the deterrence, there is a large -- when you saw that in terms of awards on our standard missile product line. The bottom line is, is that missile company is getting significant uptick in each of those three major areas and we should see that going out for a sustained period of time, at least over the next five years.", "Toby O'Brian", "And Doug, I would just a little bit more nearer term, if I take that op tempo bucket around our consumables and then the rest of the business that the other two buckets that Tom described, think of it this way, for the growth this year is split roughly half-and-half between, you know, driven by the op tempo and consumables and the other half through the rest of the business and as Tom said, based upon the demand we're seeing across the board there, we would expect all aspects of the missiles' business to contribute to growth over the next 12 to 18 months.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. ", "Sam Pearlstein", "I was wondering if you could talk about the $500 million increase you had in the bookings. Is that any one program or is that across-the-board? And I guess somewhat related is I know there's been an RFI out for the new increment of the next jammer, next-generation jammer, I'm wondering if winning on the first one positions you well for the next one or if it's kind of starting over from the drawing board", "Toby O'Brian", "Let me address the $500 million. The $500 million is multiple opportunities for bookings for the rest of the year. So we're not just hanging our hat on one big award to be able to bring that on board. Relative to next-generation jammer, that program is moving ahead excellently, it's on schedule and we're very happy about the performance of that program.", "Obviously our customer, the Navy, is also very happy with the performance. We're working with the Navy in terms of the next, I call it next-generation jammer II or another implementation of a next-generation jammer. And we're well on our track I believe to have a solid offering for the Navy on that program.", "Tom Kennedy", "I think just to add to Tom's point about the $500 million increase, Sam, you know across multiple programs as Tom said, a lot of the, you know, bookings, the favorable bookings we've seen so far is timing, but within SAS is where we see a lot of those opportunities playing out. They've had a real strong first half of the year between the international classified booking in Q1, JPSS and next-gen jammer that we mentioned, so across multiple opportunities. But the growth would mostly be in the SAS business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.", "George Shapiro", "Yes, I was wondering, Toby, if you could kind of give us what the discount rate impact would be on CAS as if we drew a line today like we've heard from other companies?", "Tom Kennedy", "Yes George, so at this point it is too soon to predict where we think things will go between now and the end of the year. You know, we will give everyone an updated outlook as we typically do on the third quarter call. That said, let me give you a little bit of insight to a few things. Year-to-date our asset return is about 4 1/2% and due to asset smoothing any type of actual return would have to be significantly different than expected at year end in order to have a meaningful impact on 2017 THAAD CAS and/or net cash.", "That said, assuming all other assumptions remain the same, every 25 basis points change in our discount rate has about an $80 million impact on 2017 THAAD CAS and net cash would be unchanged because it continues to be based upon a 25-year average discount rate. So a few variables there that you all can use and model but again, with half the year left to go, a little too early to predict what exactly next year may look like and we'll update you hear at the end of October on our third quarter call.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. ", "Hunter Keay", "Tom, you talked about the $4 billion opportunity for SDB II. I'd kind of like to talk about that program for a minute. I think there's still I believe some unknowns around which planes and maybe specifically which variants of planes will be equipped with that in the future and maybe to that extent which countries have interest depending on cost and other things like test results.", "So can you share with us some of the assumptions that are behind maybe the install base and adoption that got you to this $4 billion number and would you categories that as either conservative or aggressive as we sit here or is there may be upside to that and when you'll hit it?", "Tom Kennedy", "So first of all, Small Diameter Bomb II, it's definitely going on the F-35s. So that's going to -- all the F-35s, both the domestic and international, have an opportunity to be able to use that very sophisticated precision weapon. So I think that's the main aircraft now. It also goes on F-15s and F-16s and it's up pretty simple system to integrate on to an aircraft, so we will be working to put that on any aircraft that we're allowed to go put it on. But the bottom line is, is that forecast assumes just the F-35, F-16s and F-15s. A majority of it being domestic, so we have still significant upside from that number on the international marketplace", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed. ", "Howard Rubel", "I just want talk maybe a little bit about either risk reduction or margin, however you want to define it, but IDS numbers were pretty good, IIS numbers both had very strong revenues and margins and maybe you could talk about where you are on terms of improving some of the risk management and achieving some of the milestones. Because it looks like those were factors in the results. If you could be a little program-specific that would be helpful.", "Toby O'Brian", "Yes, so let me take that and then if Tom wants to add any color he can and I'll start, Howard, with IDS, right? So we've been talking about IDS for a while, but we obviously continue to see opportunities to expand margin further in the second half of the year. You know we did raise our margin guidance based upon the results through the first half of the year, up by about 40 basis points, half of that was because of a little bit higher of gain on the TRS transaction and the other half was from productivity we're seeing because of the leverage of the volume going through our factory, the investments in factory automation equipment upgrades, as we mentioned before.", "And, you know, I talk about our third quarter guidance and how it was from a timing point of view impacted by TRS moving into Q2, but we did offset -- that was worth about $0.50 -- we did offset about $0.12 of that, primarily driven by further opportunities for net program efficiencies to drive more margin. Those are moving in from Q4 to Q3, not just at IDS but at other businesses. So we feel real good about where we're headed going forward from a margin perspective. We would expect to continue as we've been saying both at the Company level and specifically at IDS, to continue to expand margins going forward beyond 2016 into 2017 as well.", "From an IIS perspective on the sales, they had a good quarter. Their sales were up to 3%, driven by cyber security and special-mission programs. For the second half, we see their sales in line with last year's second half despite having four fewer workdays and we still expect growth for the year at IIS in the low single digits.", "Tom Kennedy", "I'll just cap that off, Howard, with the fact that both our Andover plant and IDS and also our Tucson plant, there is -- and on the Tucson plant we tripled production on several of the missiles there without having a significant need to [indiscernible] capital expenditures to be able to do that and also at the IDS plant, because I know you've been at before, the parking lot is overflowing which means there's -- and that's not just a one shift, that's on multiple shifts. So both of those factories are chugging along at very high capacity rates that obviously gives a strong signal and strong support for high margins moving forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Please proceed. ", "Richard Safran", "You know I heard the comments at the outset of the call on international in the quarter. I also know you're not giving out a 2017 guide, but I wanted to know if you could talk on maybe expectations or maybe comment directionally on international demand for next year, given the strong bookings you're seeing. And as the second part, earlier this year there were concerns about oil prices, Brexit, things like that, that might do to international demand for defense equipment. Could you maybe comment about those concerns and tell us [indiscernible] systems?", "Tom Kennedy", "Let me hit on the international side right off the bat here, is that we have 2017, I did mention the Pit Bull and Patriot opportunity and we also have the THAAD TPY-II radar opportunity in 2017 also, 2017/2018. But that's kind of two big ones for 2017, but there are a also significant number of orders for precision munitions that will be coming in, in 2017 and some other areas in terms of missionized aircraft that we believe will be coming in 2017 also. So we believe at bottom line that a strong pipeline of international awards in the 2017 timeframes.", "Toby O'Brian", "And I think, you know, you mentioned Brexit and I'll make more of a general comment rather than specific to your question about international. You know, we don't see any significant impact at all from Brexit. Just to put it in perspective, the British pound is the functional currency for only about 2% of our sales, so not a major impact at all to the Company and to the business. And I think on the Middle East, you know we mentioned the order for Kuwait Patriot upgrade for about $0.5 billion here in the quarter.", "I think Tom also mentioned in one of his prior comments back in Q1 we had another significant order for about $650 million for an international classified customer and we've been pretty consistent over the last couple years, you know, with our customers, our nations that produce oil, that they have a demand for our products because they're looking to protect their citizens and their sovereignty and we're seen no change to that sitting here today.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. ", "Noah Poponak", "I wondered if you could dive a little deeper into what's driving the booking strength at SAS. It looks like that's been actually the strongest book-to-bill in the first half and I know there's' some nice exposures in their between space and Intel and unmanned and some other growth areas, but if you could get a little more specific there and then related, it looks like the guidance for revenue for the segment implies revenue would decline a little bit in the second half, despite those very good bookings and the trend you're on in the first half, if you could sort of explain that, that would be helpful.", "Tom Kennedy", "Noah, we'll split the question here. As we talked about earlier, we had a major award in the first quarter and that was at SAS for an international product which set them up for a good year in terms of conversion of that revenue in essentially 2016, 2017 and 2018. They've also done quite well in the classified domain in terms of new awards and of converting those new awards into revenue.", "They also are working in completing up on the next-generation jammer P&D program which is in full swing, another significant revenue generator for the overall business. And I can tell you they're operating on all cylinders relative to all the other programs that they have in there and it's a good healthy mix. I would call it new programs coming onboard, programs that are I would call it in their mature stage and then programs that are starting to fall off. So they have a very good, I would call it a very healthy mix of programs that should be good revenue generators here for the next five years.", "Toby O'Brian", "And as far as your question on the, you know, the sales in back half of the year, so sales were up 9% in the quarter and 8% year to date, driven by classified programs at SAS. The second half will be driven by both domestic and international classified programs. Obviously they're off to a good start and we see ourselves ending the year closer to the higher end of their sales range. What may be distorting it a little bit here for you is, you know, we give it to you in one of the attachments, our workdays are a little different this year where the back half of the year in Q4 in particular has four fewer workdays than we saw in 2015. If you normalize for that, they would be showing some growth in the low single digits in the second half.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed. ", "David Strauss", "Question on cash. Toby, maybe if you could touch on the major components, specifically contracts in process continues to bill. When does that growth slow or level off and then cash taxes, whether there's been any improvement there in terms of what you're looking for and then the potential to maybe smooth the pension cashette that you've talked about in 2017. Thanks", "Toby O'Brian", "Sure. So let me start with the CIP. You're right, we have seen a build up in our CIP balance. This increase was in line with what we're expecting. It was primarily driven by our sales growth, along with the timing of program milestones and collections, including the ramp-up on some of the more recent awards that we've had last year and into the early part of this year. It's also, you know, important and I would note that our expected cadence is similar this year to prior years, with the buildup of CIP in the first half and then a decrease in the second half, really driven primarily by the timing of certain milestones and collections.", "If you look forward to the end of the year and I think we talked about this back in Q1, we would expect our CIP balance to be up compared to 2015 but more in line with what our balance was at the end of Q1 of 2016 and this is in-line with our growth profile and again driven by the timing of program milestones. As we move to the back half of 2016 and into 2017, we will continue to focus on driving working capital improvements and cash flow generation across the business. You know, we obviously saw strong cash flow here in the quarter. Some of it was timing, David, right? But some of it was permanent improvement for the year which is why we raised the outlook for the year by $100 million to the new range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion.", "As far as cash taxes go, I think that was your second question, no change from a total year point of view from what we were previously expecting there. We still think cash taxes will be paid a little bit over $900 million for the year. The net of refunds, a little over $750 million for the year as well. I think your third question was around the cash impact in 2017 from the required funding of the pension, you know, so look as we've said previously there, when we hold all the assumptions constant, we see our CAS increasing, going from 2016 to 2017 as we transition fully to harmonization and then remaining relatively flat beyond that.", "In 2016, the pension cash flow is a bit of an anomaly. It's up from 2015, but then again after 2016, the cash flow from pension, it's still expected to be positive but more as we've said at a normalized rate, plus or minus $700 million, net positive. We do see improved cash flow in our business as programs continue to progress through their life cycles and achieve significant program milestones that will improve the cash position and our continued focus on working capital including cycle time and payment term reductions with our customers will also drive some cash flow which could and will offset part of that increase.", "You know, as reminder that increase is really driven by the plans coming out of full funding from a PPA point of view and again primarily having to fund the annual-service cost. As we always do, kind of last point here, you know we'll continue to monitor all aspects of the pension and you know, we will consider making it, if it makes economic sense to the Company, to the shareholders, we'll consider making discretionary contributions, you know, before the year's over that could potentially have a further impact on the cash flow profile in 2017 and beyond.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. ", "Robert Spingarn", "I guess I missed it the first time but was on another call. I wanted to ask for a clarification or on polling, Tom and then another question, but is it still this Polish competition, is this for a full-up system or is it a shorter range smaller system?", "Tom Kennedy", "There's actually two pursuits or two programs that polling is pursuing. One is a system that the Patriot system satisfies and as you probably have seen in the press, the minister of defense is moving forward with the Poland acquisition. And so it's working government-to-government and also Raytheon is heavily involved in that procurement.", "And then there's another program which is being competed and it's a shorter range system that ties directly in with the capabilities of our NASAM system, the system that protects our nation's capital. It's also the system that we sold to Oman and about four other countries outside the United States. So that's the two. We're obviously positioned on Poland Patriot and we're working to make sure that we're in a good position on the short-range system, too.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed. ", "Joseph DeNardi", "Just on a the IDS guidance, seems like the revenue's ramping up in the back half of the year but margins are coming down a little bit, so can you just talk about some of the puts and takes there and whether the exit rate on the revenue side is a good way to think about IDS growth in 2017?", "Tom Kennedy", "Yes, so from a revenue point of view, for the total year, we see IDS sales, you know, roughly in line with 2015, with as you said the cadence improving as we move through Q3 and Q4. And that's due primarily to the start up of some new awards this year, as well as the continued ramp-up on some of our international Patriot programs as they move through their normal lifecycle. You know, from a margin point of view, as I said earlier, we still see opportunities for margin expansion. We were pleased with the results in the second quarter. The 15.5% margin that IDS delivered, excluding the TRS gain.", "As I mentioned, part of that was from accelerating net program efficiencies, profit improvements, from the back half of the year into the second quarter. We see a little bit more of that in the third quarter. We upped the margin guidance by the 40 basis points, half of which was attributable to operating performance, the other half to the gain. And we would expect to continue to see margin improvement at IDS beyond 2016's rate normalized for the TRS gain, we'd expect to see improvement continuing into 2017.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed. ", "George Shapiro", "Yes, Toby, I just want some clarification. The $0.20 increase in earnings, the way I look at it, maybe $0.03 from the little higher gain in IDS, a $0.05 from taxes. So $0.12 from operations, even though operations you said were $0.20 better in the quarter, so just looking for some reconciliation", "Toby O'Brian", "Yes, so the $0.20 and maybe it's just the definition of the buckets here, so you got the $0.03, right? On the gain, right? That's about $0.03 higher, a $0.05 on tax, about $0.09 from the business operating margins, okay? And then there was, I mentioned interest was a little better, that's about $0.01 and then we had some corporate operating items that was another $0.02. So you can bucket it a lot of ways, but around $0.12 out of that $0.20 from operations and about $0.08 from non-operating items.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. ", "Myles Walton", "I was wondering if you could touch on a couple competitions. One is the T-X and your T-100 offering there with Alenia. And kind of the progress you're seeing and the type of relationship you're having where it seems like a relatively low investment but a good way to kind of enter adjacent markets and then the GBSD program, as that kind of gets into gear over the next few years, how your go-to-market strategy is in the context of that as well. Thanks.", "Toby O'Brian", "Miles, what was the second program you were asking about?", "Myles Walton", "Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent.", "Tom Kennedy", "Okay, let me hit the first one here on T-X competition and a little bit about our approach to the competition. We're treating the program as more than just an airplane, flying an airplane. It's really about preparing the pilots for the mission success in advance and we're looking at for their ability to deal with multi-faceted and increasingly complex battle space and so what we're bringing to the table is our industry-leading capabilities in training and also next-generation mission systems and believe we're well-positioned to provide the Air Force a comprehensive solution to their training needs here.", "Our offering is the Alenia M-346 in any configuration and it's already training fourth- and fifth-generation pilots from Israel, Singapore, Italy and Poland. It is a complete system and the classroom to simulators to the aircraft, it is operationally proven. It does provide high degrees of confidence in both schedules cost and performance based on its proven capability. Our T-100 solution incorporates also our team's expertise in live virtual constructive training and again that's to drive efficiency and enhance affordability.", "In terms of timing, it is our understanding that the Air Force does plan to release an RFP by the end of this year and to award a contract by the end of next year. So we're working this very heavily. It's an important program to Raytheon. It's also an important program to the Air Force and we believe we have the best solution on that.", "Todd Ernst", "Okay, we're going that leave it there for the day.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.", "Thank you, Tracy. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then move on to questions.", "Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.", "Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that the company has strong operating performance in the third quarter, and our growth strategy remains on track. Revenue increased by over 4% and our operational execution was solid across the businesses with overall operating margins above our expectations. As a result, our earnings per share was well ahead of our prior guidance for the quarter.", "Based on the company's performance, we have updated our guidance for the year, Toby will provide more color on this as well as high level outlook for 2017 in a few moments. We continue to see strong demand from our global customers for our advanced technologies. This demand drove a third quarter book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 and our year-to-date book-to-bill ratio currently stands at a healthy 1.14. I would note that our year-to-date classified bookings have already surpassed our record annual level.", "Given our booking strength and our expectations for a solid fourth quarter, we have raised our bookings outlook range again for the year by another $500 million to a range of $26 billion to $27 billion. As you know, bookings ultimately drive revenue, so this positions us well for continued solid top-line growth in 2017.", "I'd like to point out that our domestic bookings were particularly strong in the third quarter, driven by classified, training, the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System, Standard Missile-3, Phalanx, and several additional missile programs. Classified bookings were very strong, representing 22% of total company bookings in the quarter. For our overall domestic business, it is worth noting that bookings have exceeded revenue in each quarter this year.", "One key area of focus for our team is capturing and renewing franchise programs. These are large, long duration programs that last decades and have both domestic and international potential. In the third quarter, we received a key new franchise booking in our Naval radar area for the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar or EASR. This competitive award is for the initial engineering, manufacturing and development phase of the program that will ultimately equip U.S. Navy ships and carriers with a new radar based on our gallium nitride or GaN technology.", "You'll recall, we developed GaN as a big bet technology over a decade ago and leveraged it for previous franchise wins on the Air and Missile Defense Radar and Next Generation Jammer, both for the U.S. Navy. Altogether, these programs put us in a strong position to support our U.S. Navy and international customers with advanced capabilities to counter emerging threats. The EASR win represents an opportunity over $1 billion for the company.", "We see additional opportunities to leverage GaN technology on our ground-based radar franchises as well. The Missile Defense Agency recently awarded us the contract to develop a process to incorporate GaN components into existing and future TPY-2 radars. These are long range radars used to detect and track ballistic missiles.", "And earlier this year, we began showcasing a new GaN-based AESA radar for a Patriot Integrated Air and Missile Defense System at key industry events such AUSA and the Farnborough International Airshow. Customer feedback and interest from these events is strong, and we are actively pursuing new opportunities for this radar with key customers.", "I'm pleased with the progress we're making on these multiple franchise pursuits, and with the clear success of our GaN investments, which has positioned us well across both radar and electronic warfare market segments. As we look to potential future bookings, there are a number of large upcoming opportunities for the company, including an early warning radar system for Qatar as well as Patriot, Standard Missile-2 and radar upgrades across Japan and Taiwan, which combined represents a multi-billion dollar opportunity.", "Further, we continue to make progress on the Patriot opportunity in Poland. You may have seen that Poland signed a letter of request for an integrated air and missile defense system with the U.S. in September based on the Patriot system. We believe Poland will sign a foreign military sales agreement with the U.S. government sometime later this year or early next. On this timeline, we would expect in turn a signed contract with the U.S. government and book an award later in 2017 for initial Patriot capability. I would add that in addition to Poland, we see other emerging Patriot opportunities in the European region.", "Turning to sales. Our third quarter increased by a solid 4.3%, as a result of the continued execution of our growth strategy. As we've discussed on past earnings calls, the company is aligned with the needs of our global customers and continues to invest in what we expect to be future growth areas.", "Internationally, sales were up 7% in the quarter and represented 32% of our total sales. Domestic sales increased by 3% and included classified growth of 5%. Forcepoint, our cybersecurity product business, saw sales increase 31% in the third quarter, of which 18% was organic.", "I'd like to take a minute to update you further on Forcepoint. The business is performing well and on track to meet its 2016 objectives. The integration of all acquisitions is essentially complete. Forcepoint's new CEO, Matt Moynahan, has been on board for five months now and is making very good progress.", "We have put in place an updated strategic plan that addresses areas of the cybersecurity market where we believe we have an opportunity for leadership. One of these areas is advanced insider threat, where we are providing an integrated system by combing our SureView and data loss prevention capabilities with policy and analytics to capitalize on this rapidly expanding market area. We believe this approach will align well with our strategy to further penetrate in the enterprise and very large enterprise customer markets and support Forcepoint's long-term growth.", "Turning to capital deployment; we continue to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy. Our number one priority remains investing in organic growth. Beyond that, we remain focused on prudently returning capital to shareholders via competitive sustainable dividend and share repurchases, market conditions permitting. We continue to use smaller targeted M&A to fill technology or market gaps to augment both our defense business and commercial cybersecurity capabilities.", "So bottom line, we had a great quarter with strong sales and margins as well as solid bookings, which sets a stage for continued top-line growth. For that, I'd like to thank the entire Raytheon team. Our employees are proud of what they do every day for our customers, company and shareholders.", "With that, let me turn it over to Toby.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the third quarter highlights and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would please turn to page 3.", "We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the third quarter, with bookings, sales and EPS all at or better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the third quarter of $6.9 billion resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15.", "Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, up 4%, led by missiles, SAS and Forcepoint. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.79, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. We generated solid operating cash flow of $640 million in the third quarter. Third quarter 2016 operating cash flow was lower than last year's third quarter as expected, primarily due to the timing of collections and payments. And on a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow of $1.7 billion was ahead of last year's year-to-date operating cash flow by approximately $200 million.", "During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $198 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 6.2 million shares for $801 million. I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS guidance that we provided in July, reflecting our strong performance to-date. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.", "Turning now to page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. Company bookings continue to be strong. For the third quarter, bookings were $6.9 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $20.3 billion, an increase of approximately $2.9 billion over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing four quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.16. For the quarter, international was 21% of our total company bookings and on a year-to-date basis, was 26%.", "We booked several significant awards in the third quarter, including $538 million on Standard Missile-3, $376 million for Phalanx Weapon Systems, $286 million on domestic and foreign training programs in support of Warfighter FOCUS activities, $265 million to provide advanced Patriot Air and Missile Defense capabilities for an international customer, and $255 million on the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System program, an all-weather landing system for land-based and sea-based aircraft for the U.S. Navy.", "Total backlog at the end of the third quarter was $35.8 billion, an increase of approximately $2.2 billion compared to the end of the third quarter 2015. And funded backlog was $25.7 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion compared to the end of the third quarter 2015.", "If you now move to page 5, for the third quarter, 2016 sales were in line with the guidance we set in July. Our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales.", "Looking now at sales by business. IDS had third quarter 2016 net sales of $1.3 billion. As expected, the change in net sales for the quarter was primarily driven by lower net sales on certain radar production programs and on an international communications program. In the third quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion, up slightly compared with the same quarter last year. Missile Systems had third quarter 2016 net sales of $1.8 billion. The 9% increase from the third quarter 2015 was primarily due to the Paveway and AMRAAM programs. SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion. The 10% increase versus last year was driven by higher sales on an international classified program. And for Forcepoint, the 31% increase was primarily driven by higher sales in federal products and services, and the acquisition of Stonesoft, which was completed in the first quarter of 2016.", "Moving ahead to page 6, overall the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 13.4% for the total company and 12.5% on a business segment basis.", "So looking now at the business margins, all performed at or above our expectations. The increase in margin at IDS in the third quarter compared to the comparable quarter last year reflects improved program performance. Both IIS and Missile's operating margins were in line with last year's third quarter. As expected, SAS margin decreased in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by a change in program mix. And at Forcepoint, the third quarter 2016 operating margin was, as expected, lower than last year's comparable quarter, primarily due to an increase in professional services and hardware sales relative to total sales and an increase in commissions due to higher bookings.", "Turning now to page 7. Third quarter 2016 EPS was $1.79, better than expected, driven by timing of program improvements from the fourth quarter, as well as from non-operating items.", "On page 8 as I mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016 to reflect our improved operating performance to-date and our expectations for the fourth quarter compared to our prior guidance. We have tightened the range for full year 2016 net sales, increasing the low end by $200 million. We now expect net sales to be between $24.2 billion and $24.5 billion, up 4% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business.", "As we have done in prior years, during the quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of this update, the FAS/CAS adjustment for the year increased by $5 million from $428 million to $433 million or a favorable impact of approximately $0.01 per share.", "We have increased our full year 2016 EPS, raising the low end by $0.15 and the high end by $0.05 from our prior guidance, and now expect it to be in the range of $7.28 to $7.38. The increase is primarily driven by our improved performance to-date as well as slightly higher pension income and lower interest expense.", "Turning to our share repurchase. Through the end of the third quarter, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock for just over $800 million and now see our diluted share count at approximately 297 million shares for 2016, a 3% year-over-year reduction. As a percent of free cash flow, we expect to return approximately 80% of free cash flow to shareholders this year, depending on market conditions.", "And as you can see on page 9, we've included guidance by business. We've increased and tightened the full year sales outlook at both missiles and SAS. In addition, we've tightened the full year sales range for IDS and IIS.", "Looking at margins, we've narrowed the margin guidance range for the company, raising the low end by 10 basis points from our prior guidance and now see operating margin to be in the range of 13.3% to 13.4% for the full year. At the business segment level, we now see the operating margin in a range of 12.7% to 12.8% for the full year.", "Before moving on to page 10, as Tom mentioned earlier, given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectation for a solid fourth quarter, we are now raising our full year 2016 bookings outlook to $26.5 billion plus or minus $500 million. This $500 million increase to the prior range is driven by strong demand from our global customers and positions us well for 2017. This marks our second consecutive $500 million quarterly increase to our bookings outlook. We expect international to be about a third of total bookings for the year.", "On page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the fourth quarter for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We still expect fourth quarter sales to be in a range of $6.4 billion to $6.7 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. It's important to note that the fourth quarter of 2016 has four fewer work days than the comparable period last year, which has an impact to sales of approximately $100 million per day. EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.68 to $1.78, reflecting the timing of performance improvements we achieved earlier than previously expected.", "Now turning to next year. As we've done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2017 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. As we sit here today, we currently see strong sales growth for 2017 of 3% to 5% over the midpoint of our 2016 outlook. We expect segment margins to be up for 2017 compared to 2016, excluding the TRS transaction in 2016, which contributes about 70 basis points. We are well positioned going forward, with further margin expansion over time, both on the domestic side, as new development franchise wins transition to production, and on the international side as large production programs move through their life cycle.", "We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30% in 2017. In addition, we expect solid operating cash flow in 2017, slightly lower than 2016, as improvement from the businesses as expected is offset by higher cash taxes and required pension contributions. Of course, I want to caveat all this by saying our assumptions are based on the defense budget being approved in Washington before year-end, thereby avoiding an extended CR or a government shutdown.", "Before moving on, I want to point out, consistent with our public filings, that we plan to early adopt the new revenue recognition standard in the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect the impact of adopting the new standard to be material to our results.", "So if you could please move to page 11. We have provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2017, as we've done in prior years. As a reminder, the range of outcomes shown are estimates. Actual results will be based on factors that are not determined until year end, in particular, the final discount rate, the actual asset returns and the long-term return on asset assumption, all of which could impact the estimates on this matrix.", "As we sit here today, the discount rate is approximately 75 basis points lower than it was at the end of 2015, and would be roughly 3.75%, and our return on assets through October 25 is a little above 5%. In addition, we have been seeing downward pressure on our long-term return on asset assumption, driven by the most recent capital market expectations. Based on this, we currently see a potential reduction from 8% to a range of 7.25% to 7.5%. I would note that for each 25 basis points change in the assumption, down to 7.25%, we'd expect an additional $55 million reduction to the FAS/CAS adjustment for 2017 compared to what you see on the chart.", "On page 12, we have provided an updated net cash from pension outlook as well as the prior outlook that we provided to you in January, using the same discount rate and return assumptions. It's worth noting that the net cash from pension in 2017 is now expected to be better compared to our prior outlook. And given our CAS prepayment balance of nearly $7 billion, we continue to expect CAS recovery to exceed contributions well into the next decade. Said another way, we expect pension to be a net positive contributor to cash flow over the next 10 plus years under current assumptions.", "Please note that all of these assumptions exclude us making any potential discretionary pension contributions. And just to be clear, the final discount rate, the actual asset returns and the long-term return on asset assumptions won't be known until we close out 2016. We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our January year-end call.", "In summary, we saw a solid performance in the third quarter. Bookings were strong. Our sales and EPS were at or above our expectations. And our strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow us to continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2017.", "With that, Tom and I will open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, gentlemen.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.", "Good morning, Carter.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "Good morning.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Tom, I was thinking \u2013 or hoping you could kind of decompose the Forcepoint results and outlook, and kind of help us here since it's a bit different from what we're normally looking at. I noted in Toby's comments that the strength ex-Stonesoft was federal products and services. And you noted in the strategic review the emphasis on very large enterprises; assuming those are commercial. I know the web filtering business is now down to a pretty low level. But I'm just wondering if you could kind of explain to us the sub-components there in terms of what's growing in sales and how that fits in with the strategy. And then clearly the implied guidance for Q4 suggests a pretty big margin step up back up there for the unit. So just wondered if you could give us some color on the moving pieces and help us with...", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.", "Yes, Carter, let me do that. And actually we're very excited about Forcepoint because we are starting to see some significant moves in the marketplace. I mean yeah, the solid foundation they have, you mentioned it already. They probably have one of the largest federal groups of any of the competitors out there. In fact, I think a lot of the competitors I wish they had as much federal access as we do into the cybersecurity market. And we sell in that federal group as a commercial company. That's one. We also did mention the next generation firewall that they have that is off and running, getting a lot of traction on that. And you can see the sales on that is up. And then also in the core business, the TRITON Cloud work is \u2013 we're also starting to see significant movement in that.", "The area that I was trying to point out in my discussion is one of the other areas where we've taken \u2013 I would call it our defense grade capabilities into the commercial cybersecurity marketplace and that's really on the insider threat. And so we took essentially our product which was, we call it the SureView product. We're tying that together, integrating that with the data loss prevention capability that Websense brought along, and some analytics on top of that and providing an unbelievable capability to the marketplace relative to the advanced insider threat.", "And as you've probably been reading in the press, there is quite a bit of insider threat issues that are going on across the commercial industry and along different verticals. So we're extremely happy with the performance. And Toby is here, he's got the details and he can just run you through what we saw here in the third quarter and what we're seeing in the future.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "Yeah, Carter, so on the numbers side for Q3 and Q4, even though I did mention the federal and some of the services, when you peel this back and decompose it, the legacy TRITON business also saw significant growth of about 18% in the quarter as well. So we really saw growth across the entire portfolio, with the exception as we expected, we've been talking about the legacy web filtering business, which did continue to decline.", "Along those lines, I do want to take a second, and as Tom talked about, and as we are evolving our strategic position to align with the cybersecurity market where we see the greatest opportunities, the legacy delineation, when we've talked in the past about TRITON and the web filtering, even though I just kind of gave you some color on it, it is becoming less meaningful to us given our changes in the organization and our go-to-market approach around that.", "But again, growth across the entire portfolio where we're focused strategically. If you roll that forward to Q4, from a top-line perspective, we'd expect growth rates similar to Q3 on a year-over-year basis and margin that is higher. To your question, we'd be looking at margins in the 16%-plus range for the fourth quarter. Obviously, we didn't change the outlook for the year, so we feel good that the team has a path forward there.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for the color, guys.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.", "Thank you.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yeah. Good morning.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.", "Good morning, George.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "Hi.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Question I got is really an explanation. Is it, if I look at the book-to-bill at like you said, it was 1.15, but bookings were $900 million above sales. But if I look sequentially, funded backlog was actually down by around $400 million and total backlog was only up by $500 million. So a big discrepancy. I mean I imagine some of it reflects the mark-to-market from the weaker currencies, but is there anything else going on? Or just kind of explain how they all went together.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "Yeah. I mean on the funded backlog, that can obviously be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, right, depending upon what's happening there. So, I don't think there's anything different than we may see in any given quarter. From an overall backlog point of view though, you are right, we do have every quarter backlog adjustments for various reasons, including the currency. In the third quarter of this year it was about $400 million that we had as backlog adjustments.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. And if I just follow up, IDS sales were much less than I was looking for and I know probably less than you, because you lowered the top end of the guidance by $100 million. Is that reflecting slower startup of the new programs and the high margin reflecting margin pickup because some of the older ones are ending?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "Yeah. So you kind of have it right there, George. As I said in my comments, we knew about some certain radar programs and one international communications program that was winding down. So that was what we'd assume going back to the beginning of the year, but we are seeing a little bit of timing impact on a couple international programs. We now expect either late Q4 or early Q1. So that's what's driving primarily the change, what happened in the quarter relative to the revenue, the sales and then also for the total year.", "From a margin point of view, I think what you're seeing is consistent with what we've been saying, that IDS towards the back half of the year has some of the \u2013 and I wouldn't say they are completing. I would say some of the major production programs that we've booked over the last couple years are from an execution point of view moving through their life cycles. They're at points where we obviously feel comfortable in increasing the booking rates there.", "You saw a strong margins from IDS back in Q2, excluding the TRS gain. We see it again here in Q3. So I think things from our perspective, things are playing out on the margin line at IDS pretty much as we would have expected and if anything a little bit more favorable timing. I think some of the improvements we saw in Q2 and 3, if we go back three or six months, we would have said, would have been in Q4 and 3. So things have maybe even accelerated within the year by about 90 days. But all good news from our perspective.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much, Toby.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "All right. Thanks.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.", "Thanks, George.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

(Broker)", "Toby, just a quick clarification question for you, Toby. Can you talk a little bit about the cash flow dynamics in the fourth quarter, and what allows you to have that steep ramp? And then Tom for you, can you just talk a little bit about the contracting environment, generally speaking? And kind of the puts and takes you're seeing there from a pricing perspective, contract terms, anything that's changing either here domestically or on the international front that we should be aware of that would impact how the business is going to perform a few years down the road. Thanks.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "Yeah, Jason, I'll hit the cash flow real quick here in the fourth quarter. For us nothing's really changed there. If anything we're a little bit ahead from a cadence point of view on a cumulative basis on the overall cash flow compared to when we started the year. So if anything, that ramp up in Q4 is a little less than it was going back to January. I think you all know, we traditionally have a cash profile that's more back-end weighted. There is nothing different this year. And the underlying driver is not one individual thing, but it's primarily some significant milestone collections, really across pretty much the entire portfolio of programs. So nothing unusual from our perspective.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.", "Yeah. And Jason, I'll break it in, your question into two parts. I'll take the domestic. In terms of terms and conditions, we're really not seeing any changes in our contracting with the department or with the U.S. government. The department, as you know, is pushing more towards a fixed price incentive fee construct on I would call production type programs than they have in the past, something we were used to many years back. It's kind of rotated back in. So I think going through the initial iterations and making sure everybody understands that kind of a construct and sets it up in a way that provides the contractors an incentive to do well. I think we're going through a little bit of transient on that but it seems like it's settling out pretty quick.", "On the international side, we again on the FMS contracts, we're not seeing much difference there relative to terms and conditions. Again, there is some issues relative to fixed price incentive fee on production contracts that's actually being debated in the halls of Congress. And right now, the NDAA has some language in it about the international production type contracts at being firm fixed price versus fixed price incentive fee. And that's the only area that I see that's different. And our direct commercial sales, no difference there than we've had in the past.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

LLC", "Good morning.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "Good morning.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.", "Good morning, Doug.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "I wanted to see if you could give us a perspective on the discussions you're having and I would say internationally and that's in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Asia. When you look at priorities in those areas and you try and parse out say long-term priorities. For instance, we saw Saudi earlier this year back away from littoral combat ship. It's expensive and longer term. And you look at the near-term things, which certainly precision guide and munitions would fall into that category. Can you talk a little bit about how you see these customers making trade-offs, when they sometimes have fairly constrained budget these days?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.", "Yeah. Let me attack that, Doug. And I think what I want to do is go back to this concept of buckets, and we're seeing these three demand areas. One is counter-terrorism, counter insurgency. The other bucket is deterrence, deterring a threat from taking action. And then there's a third bucket out there, which I'm going to say it's third offset strategy type stuff, worrying about near-peer nation threats with advanced technologies.", "In Europe, I think the big one there is deterrence. We're seeing Eastern Europe very concerned in that area, and so they're looking for systems that will provide in that kind of a deterrence capability. And so we're seeing a lot of action on things like the Patriot System and then also our NASAMS system that we have at the nation's capital and we had a sale in Oman and several other countries out there. So we're seeing significant pull for those deterrence type systems in Europe.", "As we move to the Middle East, you're correct. I would say it's a little different in Middle East. It's demand from both the counter insurgency, counter terrorism bucket, and then also the deterrence bucket. And on the counter insurgency, I think you can understand that. That's some of the demand, OPTEMPO pull here, for precision weapons and some other ground systems that we have.", "On the deterrence side, I mean there is a concern, there is neighbor of the GCC that the GCC is concerned about and so you're getting into deterrence there and therefore you see the demand for systems like Patriot across the whole region, and so that's the deterrence bucket. And if we go over to the Asia-Pacific region, it's clear that it's most of the effort there, demands signals is again coming from this deterrence bucket, looking for solutions like Patriot advanced weapons, radars to be able to see things, ballistic missiles before they hit them and so the Asia-Pacific region is in big demand on the deterrence.", "The third bucket is really coming directly from the Department of Defense, obviously for all regions in the global area to be able to essentially come up from 20 years of fighting wars of insurgency to now dealing with near-peer threats that potentially have capabilities that are at or potentially in some cases maybe better or perceived to be better than what the U.S. has, and so it's a big catch up area there. I mentioned, we did mention on the call about a significant increase in classified work. I think that's really addressing that bucket and to help the Department of Defense regain in some cases its superior capabilities over near-peer threats. And that's it.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "So when you look at, when you look at -", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.", "Does that help?", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Yeah, that's a lot obviously, so.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.", "Well I'm thinking about it every day, so.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Yeah, I know, I know. But what I am getting at is, when you look at certain things that may have greater urgency, if you turn this all into what does it mean for your outlook, are you seeing over the next few years a greater urgency in some of the areas you just said and perhaps less in some long-term programs? Has it changed the way you've looked at these markets?", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.", "I think what's different here in my entire career is each of those buckets is overflowing, and so the demand signals have never been as strong in each of the three buckets and across those three regions. And you're seeing that in our book-to-bill, the 1.15 for the third quarter, 1.14 year-to-date and then over the trailing four quarters, 1.16. We wouldn't be having those book-to-bills if the demand signals isn't as high as it is and across three regions and across three buckets.", "So, I have a very favorable outlook in terms of where we're going. We did mention on the call, we believe in 2017, just based on the book-to-bills we have, we'll clearly be in the 3% to 5% sales growth in 2017. And you can look to the future, but what I always go back is I look at our book-to-bills and our backlog and base our future outlook on that plus the demand signals we're getting. And I'm personally getting demand signals to go visit those regions from leaders in those countries. So this is real and so we're very, very bullish and positive in the future.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thank you very much. So, the midpoint of your new bookings target would imply fourth quarter book-to-bill a little bit under 1. That would be the first time in about seven years. And you've just talked about how terrific the demand signals are. Is that a conservative number? And maybe give us some color on, could we have any surprises so we go above the upper end of your guide? Thanks.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "Look, let me start, and maybe more with the numbers part of it and everything. And obviously we give a range, right, as you know of sales and bookings, right. So if you look and if you go to the high end of that range, the book-to-bill would be over 1. It would be about 1.05 give or take. To you point, the midpoint of the range is a little bit under 1. It's not a signal one way or the other from my perspective. We're very pleased. The fact that we've been able to for two quarters in a row effectively cumulatively add $1 billion to the outlook for the year further strengthens the bookings and the demand that Tom was talking about. And I think as we all know the bookings \u2013 in any given quarter, we can have some ups and downs or, not my favorite word, but some lumpiness there. So we're very pleased with what we've seen through the first nine months and the outlook for the total year and how it positions us going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you very much. I'm not a fan of talking about pension, but Toby, you sort of set us up a little bit here. If we go through the math, from a cash flow perspective, it would appear year-on-year you're going to do just fine in 2017 and beyond. But from a reported EPS basis, based on sort of where we were a year ago and now, where we look at sort of the midpoint in the chart, it looks like you have a little bit of headwind to earnings. Can you elaborate on that? And is there anything that you can do to address that?", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "Yeah, no, so again, I'll repeat a little bit here, Howard. The estimates that we gave you were to try to provide sensitivity around the variables that affect both the P&L side and the cash flow side of the equation. As a reminder, we will update all of this at year end based upon how the year plays out, and things could be different compared to what we outlined today. But we did want to be transparent and let everybody know what we were seeing, both between the discount rate, where the current year return is and based upon forward looking, relative to capital markets, where the longer-term ROA would be. And I don't know that I can really add anything beyond the sensitivity that I gave in my prepared comments.", "You're right. The cash flow is going to continue to be positive from pension. There were a lot of questions earlier this year and concerns about overall cash flow, because of the higher required contributions in 2017. That's gotten better based upon our current estimates by close to $200 million. Our overall cash flow for the company next year, as I mentioned earlier, may be slightly lower than where we're looking at for this year, but still very, very strong.", "And I think if you look out over time, while near term we may have some headwind on pensions from a P&L point of view, for an EPS point of view in 2017, we'd expect that over time even under those lower rates that I talked about, that we would see improvement in that profile, a pattern that would be similar to what we were seeing in the past, where year-over-year the EPS would improve all else equal based upon even revised assumptions in 2017, 2018 \u2013 beyond 2017 into 2018 and 2019.

Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I wonder \u2013 good morning \u2013 if we could talk a little bit about IDS, and in the fourth quarter, we've got some elevated sales implied by the guidance and we saw somewhat higher sales last year as well. But can you talk about sort of how much that reflects timing versus how much that reflects sort of a new run rate? And then similarly, it looks like the guidance implies for the fourth quarter sort of a lower margin. But if we just look back over the past couple years, seasonally the fourth quarter seems to be fairly strong, so maybe some of the dynamics around sales and profitability in IDS in Q4.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "Yeah sure, Seth. So when George asked, I told him what kind of happened in Q3 and why we lowered a little bit the range of sales for the year, driven by the timing of some new awards that now we're expecting later in Q4 or early next year. But for Q4 from a sales point of view, even with that narrow guidance, we do expect solid growth in Q4. We have some other awards that we are anticipating we'll be starting up, which are contributing to that growth, as well as some continued ramp on some international Patriot programs that are already in our backlog as they move through their life cycle there. So we have a path forward relative to the growth in IDS on the top line.", "From a margin perspective, I'll reiterate, we are really pleased with the margin at IDS both in Q2 and in Q3 here. As we had talked about before, we were expecting an improvement in the margin at IDS more in the back half of the year. We've accelerated some of that into Q2 and here again in Q3, we did raise our margin guidance by 20 basis points on the high end at IDS to reflect our solid performance to date.", "And we continue to expect solid operational performance in Q4, about in line where we are year-to-date, okay. If you want to think of it this way, when you adjust for the TRS transaction, the improvements we're seeing, they can be lumpy as well, right, because they're specifically tied to programs, the execution of those programs, and the timing of those events which in some cases, if not a lot of cases aren't \u2013 out of our control. And what we feel that we've done is, we've d-risked that fourth quarter in the ramp that if you go back 90 days, 180 days, the ramp that we would have had in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein.

I know you talk about having a balanced deployment out there, but you've also in the past talked about not necessarily wanting to chase the stock. And I don't expect you to talk about individual M&A, but certainly you've been talked about out there with regards to something in the order of $1 billion size in the Forcepoint area. And so just want to know how you're thinking about deploying capital in today's world.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "Yeah, Sam, from my perspective, nothing around our thought process here has really changed. As we've talked about in the past, a balanced approach has worked well for us. We're continuing to use that here today and going forward. The underpinning to being able to do that is obviously strong cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet, both of which we have and we're focused on.", "And then, so specifically from a kind of a priority perspective, we're always looking to invest in ourselves, in the business to drive growth where it make sense. That's not going to change. We'll pursue targeted acquisitions. I think Tom mentioned in his opening comments, ones that fill technology, market access, market channel type of gaps. I won't comment on rumors out there in the marketplace. But what I will say generically, we don't have as part of our plan to go after big deals, okay, that would be something strategic and opportunistic.", "We want to provide the right level of return to our shareholders, somewhere as we target 80% to 90% of current year cash flow that includes a competitive and sustainable dividend and a buyback, obviously to continue to reduce the diluted share count over time, and we do as you know make from time to time discretionary pension contributions. That said, let me reiterate, because it has come up in the past relative to the thought about any large acquisitions, whether it be on the defense side, and/or the commercial cyber side, that is not in our plan.

But I'm wondering if you can talk about maybe the dynamic as much as you can about how Forcepoint might be able to play in classified. And specifically I'm wondering what the mix is now of classified if any, and if that's a growth market.

Thanks a lot.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.", "I'll hit it in two ways. One is I'll talk about Forcepoint and then I'll talk about the rest of the company. So on Forcepoint, it does have a federal group or a federal division. So the folks in the federal division do have the clearances so that they can go work with the different departments in the government and agencies and they can actually go into their facilities and help install the capabilities. And so that's I would call it a very special capability that Raytheon has relative to taking I would call it these commercial products into the U.S. government.", "On the Raytheon side, we do a significant amount of I would call it government related cybersecurity work with the different departments in the Department of Defense and then also with the different three-letter agencies.

Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Tom, Toby, I had a bit of the strategic question for you here. In addition to the bomber program, there is a lot of new starts out there like the trainer. We talked about J-STARS recap before. There were also though a number of new sensors like Air Missile Defense Radar, Next Generation Jammer, et cetera. I wanted to get your perspectives on this. Number one, from where you sit right now, do you see the Pentagon getting sufficient funding so that we can actually have a major recapitalization of military platforms and sensors?", "And also as with the trainer, should we be expecting Raytheon to becoming more of a platform prime, or is that more of an exception and you're thinking about being a major system prime on sensors and weapons? If we're on a long-term trend towards increased defense spending, I'm just trying to get a sense of how you guys are thinking about positioning Raytheon in that area.", "Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.", "So let me hit the first question and that is does the government have enough money for all these things. I think that was the first question. And a lot of this hinges on the election and what's going to move forward. And right off the bat, both candidates, both parties are pushing for a strong defense. So that's obviously a good sign, both parties and positions are that they want to remove the Budget Control Act caps and so which will be required to be able to fund this, you called it a recapitalization. But it's also some new capability needs as part of this third offset strategy.", "We are seeing funding going into that area, We did see in 2016 the BCA was lifted and also in 2017 is looking good in terms of its budget moving forward. The question was what will happen in 2018, 2019 and beyond, and if that's really going to be the output of this election, again both parties are significantly supporting a strong defense moving forward. So as long as the funds are there and we have the Congress supporting it, I see that we'll be able to support most of this recapitalization. It will have to be timed out, so that they have enough money to cover it over the multiple years that these new systems take to come on board.", "Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.", "Tracy, we have time for one more question please.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks for squeezing me in. Hey Toby, I was hoping you could add a little bit more color to the margin commentary for 2017. You said I think adjusted for the 70 basis point one-time gain, margins would be up, but maybe you can give us a little bit more clarity on an unadjusted basis, how much would they be down. Or if you don't want to go that far, is the run rate of IDS you're seeing here ex the charge in the first quarter and ex the gain a good run rate to be using for next year? Forcepoint's got some structural benefits in the next year. Just more color because that 70 basis points, just squaring it out to expectations might help.", "Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.", "Yeah, Myles. I'll address margin, but let me maybe give you and everybody a few comments on 2017 a little bit beyond what I mentioned earlier. And if I start at the front end of the business, we do continue to expect to see a solid book-to-bill ratio next year over 1, even on the higher sales volume as I mentioned, which we see growing in the 3% to 5% range. I will say that this growth is more heavily weighted towards our missiles and SAS business, then followed by IDS and IIS, and we also see growth again both domestically and internationally next year.", "On the margin comment, I'm kind of going to stick to where I mentioned earlier that in 2017, when you adjust for the TRS transaction this year at the segment level, we see segment level margins improving. That said, obviously we're not giving details by business at this point, but since you asked about IDS and historically, there has been a lot of focus there. What I will tell you is, we do see meaningful improvement in the IDS margin next year, again excluding the 2016 impact of TRS. Although I will say that for IDS, if you're thinking of 16% or above next year, that's probably too aggressive and I'll just kind of leave it at that.", "I mentioned cash flow is going to continue to be strong. We do expect higher cash from the businesses partially offsetting pension and higher cash taxes. On our tax rate, if you recall in 2016, our effective tax rate is impacted by the TRS transaction, and the gain on that of just under $160 million was tax free. So when I look at the tax rate for 2017 right now, think of it around 30%, which is more in line where 2016 would be excluding TRS. And then you mentioned Forcepoint. I think what I'll say on Forcepoint, we still expect double digit growth and double digit margins from them next year.

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.", "I will now turn the call over to Jay Roueche, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.", "John E. Roueche - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you participating in Flowserve's 2015 third quarter earnings call.", "Joining me on the call this morning are Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Pajonas, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Karyn Ovelmen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open this call up to your questions. And as a reminder, this event is being webcast and an audio replay will be available.", "Additionally, please be aware our earnings materials do, in this call will, include certain non-GAAP measures. Please review the reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to our reported results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which can be found both in our press release and our earnings presentation.", "Please also note that this call and our associated earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, which are based upon forecasts, expectations, and other information available to management as of October 30, 2015. These statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including many that are beyond the company's control. And except to the extent required by applicable law, Flowserve undertakes no obligation and disclaims any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements.", "We encourage you to fully review our Safe Harbor disclosures contained in yesterday's third quarter materials, as well as our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are all available on our website at flowserve.com in the Investor Relations' section.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark Blinn, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Jay. And good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, Flowserve delivered solid operating performance. This came in the midst of the persistent macroeconomic and industry-wide challenges we've faced all year. The continued weakness in many of our end markets has substantially impacted the timing of customer spending across the industry. As a result, there is increased uncertainty in the marketplace and a tighter pricing environment on the projects that do proceed.", "Further, most emerging regions, particularly Latin America, remained stagnant. And with our global revenue base, the stronger U.S. dollar continues to weigh on reported earnings. Given this uncertainty, we're taking aggressive action to reduce our cost structure and offset near-term market weakness. But more broadly, this current market downturn also provides us the opportunity to accelerate efforts to drive permanent efficiency improvements across our business to better position closer for the long term. Against this backdrop, Flowserve continues to perform well operationally. Our employees remain focused on serving our customers with excellence. This dedication is evidenced by solid execution on our existing backlog and our ability to deliver on our commitments the way our customers expect.", "While opportunity always remains to improve on-time delivery, I am pleased with our consistent 90% plus on-time delivery performance, our approximate 5% in past-due backlog, and our operational performance. Simply put, the Flowserve operating platform continues to operate at a high level. For example, our aftermarket franchise demonstrated the relative resiliency that we expect, despite continued maintenance deferrals in some of our markets and lower parts and spares activity tied to new units. Organic aftermarket bookings and sales were only down modestly constant currency. We expect much of our customers' delayed and deferred activity to return as maintenance budgets stabilize. As we have demonstrated over the years, we will continue to enhance our aftermarket capabilities through the cycle to increase our installed base capture and market share.", "Given the cyclical nature of our markets, we remain focused on controlling what we can. Disciplined cost control is embedded in our culture, as is our strategic approach to optimize our business and simplify the organization. We have made significant progress on our previously-announced cost efficiency efforts. And we are pleased that the expected return from our previously-announced $100 million realignment investment has increased. We're also pursuing at least $25 million of additional investment to further improve our platform. Together, we now expect these actions to generate approximately $125 million of annual structural cost savings for the one-time cost of approximately $125 million.", "Karyn will cover more on the timing of our restructuring actions as well as our third quarter financial results. But I'll note that I was pleased with the resilient margin performance this quarter, even in a declining revenue environment. When we look back at the second quarter, crude oil had seemingly found a home during that period in the $55 per barrel to $60 per barrel range. As you're aware, however, after July 4, and continuing through much of the quarter, crude prices suffered another round of declines, even falling below $40 per barrel in late August. This volatility increased uncertainty further within our industry. In turn, this impacted both the timing of bookings and customers' willingness to accept shipments. This climate is reflected when reviewing our regional markets.", "Looking at our geographies, excluding SIHI, and on a constant currency basis for consistency, bookings were down in all regions with the exception of Asia-Pacific, which was up modestly. North America represented the largest bookings decline in dollar terms versus a tough 2014 compare period.", "Last year, oil and gas activity was strong in our mid and downstream markets, and chemical orders were enhanced by the new cracker facilities in the region. In this region's current market, we see increased opportunities in the power industry, and are beginning to work on a number of chemical feed projects.", "For the second consecutive quarter, European bookings declined, approximately 18.5% this period, while the regions revenue increased, representing the only geography that grew year-over-year sales this quarter. Russia continues to struggle with the current oil price levels, and the general European recovery has proven slow, and the economy remains fragile.", "Asia-Pacific went the other direction, as it increased bookings year-over-year, but also saw the largest revenue decline on a percentage basis this quarter. The slowing economy in China is certainly having an impact on the region, although power opportunities remain. Our opportunity in the region remains increasing our presence and building our installed base.", "And Latin American bookings were by far the most impacted on a percentage basis, down nearly 30% year-over-year. This resulted from challenges faced by certain customers in the oil-driven economies of Brazil and Venezuela.", "We expect the petro economies to remain challenged while oil prices are this depressed. But we do see pockets of opportunity in some countries in the region, such as Mexico and Argentina. While bookings during the quarter were down in the Middle East, we do see near-term prospects in the region, as many of our clients here are investing through the cycle, particularly in Kingdom, Qatar and Kuwait. Some of the opportunities on the horizon include refining projects as well as power and desal plants.", "While the current business environment remains uncertain, and near-term visibility is limited, we do continue to believe that the long-term secular growth trends in all our end-markets remain very much intact based on end-user demand. Infrastructure in developed regions require service for replacement activities and emerging markets need to build more.", "The Flowserve platform is operating well, and we have opportunities to enhance it. Current delays and deferrals will create a recovery cycle in the future. We are positioning the company now for long-term growth, and we have the experience navigating difficult markets. And as evidenced by our current initiatives, cost control is embedded in our culture. This culture is coupled with our highly disciplined approach to capital allocation. Flowserve has been a consistent cash generator even in periods of cyclical slowdowns. We are committed to maintaining flexibility through the cycle, which enables us to pursue organic and acquisitive growth, pursue realignment and restructuring initiatives, and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "I'm confident that the internal actions we implemented since the last down cycle, combined with our current efforts and our proven operational performance, will position Flowserve well for both the current market and for when markets recover. Flowserve is a leader in our industry and our commitment remains to deliver long-term value for our customers and shareholders.", "Let me now turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas L. Pajonas - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Mark. And good morning, everyone. I'm also pleased that we are expecting to generate a stronger return on our original investment dollars than originally expected on our cost efficiency measures. As part of this effort, we are driving towards reducing our manufacturing cost base and achieving higher absorption within our facilities. Our overall plan should position Flowserve to better serve our customers and will include product transfers, facility closures, and certain head count reductions.", "In addition, the integration of SIHI is also progressing well, including facility rationalization and transfer some of Flowserve's activities into SIHI sites. SIHI's bookings for the year have held up well as the run rate nature of much of its business help ensure only a mid single-digit year-over-year decline in constant currency bookings. While executing our SIHI's integration and the strategic realignment actions across Flowserve, our employees have remained motivated and focused on the customer.", "Turning to our end markets, there are many challenges currently across our diverse geographical and industry exposures, but opportunities exist as well, as evidenced by $1.06 billion of bookings, including SIHI. To break it down, oil and gas represents roughly 34%, with chemical at 25%, power at 14%, and general industries at roughly 23%.", "We have seen significant year-over-year declines in our project bookings as we continue to expect customers will remain deliberate and lengthen the bidding process and the time span before reaching the final investment decision.", "Additionally, project pricing levels have intensified. While we have remained disciplined, we expect part of our planned cost savings will help reduce the effect of lower market activity and the impact on margin. We also continue to actively pursue enterprise frame agreements, product bundling opportunities, and value-creating initiatives such as reliability models with our customers in order to drive bookings.", "Looking at our served industries. In the oil and gas, the market remains challenged. European and Latin America oil and gas markets face headwinds that are not expected to cease in the near term. We also see maintenance deferrals occurring, as refiners continue to operate at high levels. However, some opportunities exist in this challenged market. There are pockets of oil and gas proposal activity, such as the Middle East and selected Asian regions, and refineries in Malaysia and refining in Saudi Arabia.", "North America LNG plants, midstream oil and gas, and oil storage, however, represent opportunities. In Mexico, its liberalization of the oil industry should also be positive in the future. The ongoing activity for LNG export out of the U.S. is another example of a new developing market where we participate.", "Chemical bookings were roughly flat in the third quarter on an organic constant currency basis. And we continue to see opportunities on the horizon from the derivative chemical facilities related to the first wave of ethylene crackers in North America. Additionally, we also expect to see the second wave of ethylene crackers in the future based upon recent E&C awards, with the process potentially starting sometime next year.", "Power bookings were up 2% in the third quarter on an organic constant currency basis, where we see combined cycle power activity moving forward, particularly in North America, Asia-Pacific, and Eastern Europe. With increased environmental regulation and the related closure of coal-powered facilities, this trend towards combined cycle should continue to drive opportunity for us. And we also expect increased activity related to environmental-driven upgrades on the coal capacity that remains.", "Flowserve is also active in most nuclear markets. China continues to pursue ambitious nuclear capacity goals where we regularly participate. And Japan has restarted some of its idle nuclear plants, which provides us opportunity for maintenance and upgrade activity.", "Finally, desalination markets have improved recently and concentrated solar power projects are emerging in Africa and North America. We have escalated our focus on new product development over the last several months in areas such as materials and coatings, multiphase flow, fugitive emission, and growing areas of diagnostics and its impact on reliability. These initiatives have resulted in new wireless control valves, water pumps with improved efficiency designed to reduce the total cost of ownership, and cryogenic valve applications to name a few.", "In summary, although we expect a tough market for the near term, we have built a solid base, a rigorous plan, and the ability to pursue opportunities where they exist.", "With that overview, let me now turn it over to Karyn.", "Karyn F. Ovelmen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Tom. And good morning, everyone. Let me now focus the call on our financial highlights from the 2015 third quarter and our near-term outlook.", "As Mark and Tom indicated, the challenging market conditions from the first half of the year continued in the third quarter. Accordingly, during the third quarter, our constant currency bookings declined 14.6% year-over-year, excluding SIHI's contribution of $70 million.", "Original equipment orders were primarily affected, considering our $460 million of organic aftermarket bookings were down only 2% constant currency, which demonstrates the type of resiliency we typically expect from this franchise, especially considering some of the ongoing delays in maintenance activity.", "Total third quarter sales were $1.1 billion, which included $74 million from SIHI. Excluding SIHI, sales were down 5.6% constant currency compared to last year. Again, our aftermarket business held up better as sales declined only 2.3% on an organic constant currency basis in the third quarter. Year-to-date, Flowserve's constant currency revenues increased 2.8% through September 30 compared to 2014 levels.", "Looking at our margins, strong execution, aftermarket mix, and cost control delivered adjusted gross and operating margin increases of 110 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively, compared to the 2014 third quarter.", "We continue to focus on effectively managing SG&A with expenses down $27.9 million in the third quarter, excluding SIHI and realignment. As we position our business for current market conditions, our SG&A reduction reflected tight cost control and benefited from a strong dollar and reduced incentive compensation to reflect our alignment with shareholders.", "Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of approximately 28.8% was slightly lower than our full-year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. On a reported basis, tax appears elevated at 35.5%, as a result of one-off non-cash valuation allowance we took on certain deferred tax assets, reflecting ongoing challenges in Latin America.", "Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.81 includes $0.06 per share of negative currency translation and $0.03 of bad debt write-off, due primarily to a customer's bankruptcy, and excludes $0.11 per share of adjusted items comprised of $0.02 of below the line currency impact, $0.01 of realignment expenses, and $0.08 for the non-cash valuation allowance on the Latin American deferred tax asset.", "SIHI was essentially breakeven during the 2015 third quarter, even after incurring over $6 million of purchase price accounting, realignment and acquisition-related expenses. Altogether, reported EPS was $0.70 for the quarter.", "Turning to cash flows. Flowserve generated total operating cash flow of $113 million in the 2015 third quarter or approximately $0.85 per share. We continue to invest in organic growth with $25 million in capital expenditures during the period. Similar to prior cycles, with slower end market activity, we will continue to make disciplined investments in our business to support long-term growth.", "We still expect capital expenditures in the $170 million to $180 million range for 2015, substantially higher than our maintenance CapEx requirements, primarily due to planned investment on the new Chinese valve facility, which will increase our low cost manufacturing capabilities, as well as the purchase of a long-term license, which will provide good opportunities to increase our aftermarket business.", "Returning capital to shareholders was another key priority during the quarter as we repurchased approximately 2.4 million Flowserve shares, which is almost equivalent to the number of shares we purchased in the first half of the year.", "During the first nine months of 2015, we returned nearly $320 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Approximately $215 million remains available under our current share repurchase plan authorization at third quarter-end.", "Primary working capital as a percentage of our trailing 12-month sales improved slightly year-over-year to 27.1% versus 29.1% a year ago, excluding SIHI's impact. As a result of declining sales as well as high levels of receivables from certain Latin American customers, our days sales outstanding increased year-over-year by two days to 86 days. Inventory turns were 2.5 times versus 2.8 times last year.", "Flowserve's balance sheet is well-positioned for the current market environment. Our trailing 12 month net debt-to-EBITDA at September 30 was at 2 times and 2.2 times on a gross basis. Shortly after quarter end, we completed the second amendment to our senior credit facility, which provides committed liquidity now through October 2020, and at a lower annual cost.", "Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We are planning for current market conditions to persist with heightened uncertainty and reduced visibility into customer spending and order acceptance. Based on that expectation and our results year-to-date, we anticipate 2015 full year adjusted EPS at or around the lower end of our previous guidance of $3.10 to $3.40, with revenues to be on the lower side of our previous guidance of down 10% to 15% range.", "The stronger U.S. dollar that we've experienced throughout 2015 continues to present a significant headwind both to reported revenues and our earnings per share.", "As a reminder, our guidance excludes both SIHI's revenues and it's expected $0.25 per share net dilution for the year. Our adjusted EPS range also excludes the expenses associated with our realignment efforts, and below-the-line currency impacts, as well as other specific one-time events, such as the first quarter's Venezuela remeasurement, and this quarter's valuation allowance.", "Regarding our realignment activities behind SIHI that Mark mentioned, we now expect to spend approximately $125 million during 2015, and early 2016. This should generate approximately $125 million in annual cost savings, which will reach the annual run rate level by late 2016.", "From a cash perspective, we expect outflows of approximately $30 million in 2015 and $85 million in 2016, and the rest thereafter.", "With that, let me turn the call back to Jay.", "John E. Roueche - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Karyn. Operator, we have now concluded our prepared remarks. We would like to begin the question-and-answer period.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question is from Chase Jacobson of William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Chase A. Jacobson - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi, good morning.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Chase A. Jacobson - William Blair & Co. LLC", "So, Mark, I was wondering if you could comment on the pace of the backlog burn. Obviously, I think it's pretty clear the short-cycle work has been under pressure. But I'd like to kind of get a better understanding of how the projects that are in backlog are progressing relative to expectations. I know you mentioned that things are slower and some customers are pushing out shipments. I mean this is kind of a normal even in a normal market environment, but how much worse is it now than it was maybe a year just on average?", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Well, I mean, in terms of your general comment around backlog burn, if you look at year-to-date, our book-to-bill has been relatively flat at 1, which is certainly different from what we saw in the last downturn where you typically see a book-to-bill well below 1. So \u2013 and what's causing a lot of that as to your point is some of these projects \u2013 well, first of all, we're not the gating item or the bottleneck as we've been a number of years ago. But the fact is as these projects are ongoing, but they're not running at a quick pace. And so, customers don't have the incentive to really take the product. They certainly don't want to store it on site, because the product can tend to deteriorate, things can happen to it ultimately. So we have seen that stretch out really during the course of this year.", "Not atypical when you see a downturn in the industry because these projects are ongoing, but the pace of them slow. Because if you think about it, a project predicting a process is like getting a bond in place, and you generate the cash flows from the processing of the refined or the refining product. So they just don't seem too anxious to get these things online. We've seen that persist. We expect that will continue to persist some through the rest of the year.", "Chase A. Jacobson - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then on pricing, you mentioned a tough pricing. We've heard a number of different numbers from some of your peers as much as 10% to 15%. Can you give anymore color on what you're seeing in pricing and is it contained to the original equipment or is it also filling into aftermarket? Thank you.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Yeah. It's primarily on the projects. And we \u2013 again we saw this just for everybody to benefit, because I think people are trying to understand how we're going to maneuver through this cycle versus the last time. Keep in mind, in the last cycle when we came out, pricing was very robust. It never really got near those levels during this last period, this last run, but the fact is the first thing \u2013 area where you see a lot of competition, because this is around absorption of factories, these are big projects, these are the elephants that the sales organization likes to hunt. You do see a lot of price competition in that area, and we've seen that along the projects, not as dramatic as last time, but that's where you tend to see the pricing pressure on a lot of the \u2013 you do see some pricing on the run rate business. But keep in mind, a lot of that is around being able to respond quickly. There are smaller dollar items overall, and the aftermarket pricing has remained relatively stable.", "Chase A. Jacobson - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. So, do you think the 10% to 15% pricing pressure is too much or...", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I mean that's certainly something you would see on some of these big projects. I mean, if you remember, when we discussed project activity back in 2011, particularly in the Middle East, we'd see pricing, when you go to final bid, it get dropped 20% or 25% from where the bid levels were before. That's not unusual, particularly in the Middle East.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "Robert F. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Yeah. Hey guys. Good morning.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Robert.", "Robert F. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "I just wondered if you could offer a little more color on how you think we should interpret the better aftermarket bookings this quarter. I don't know if you're seeing some deferred maintenance resuming for example or if things just happen to trend a little bit better this quarter?", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Here is a simple way to look at it. Year-over-year parts tied to units is down. They are deferring a lot of what I would say are upgrade opportunities, they are like small capital projects around driving efficiency. There is some maintenance deferral. The offset has been continued execution on our end user strategies. So, over the years, a lot of the growth you've seen is just further penetration into existing customers, new customers, putting in new QRCs, taking advantage of the installed base. So, the market has certainly put a headwind to us. It's been mostly, not completely, offset by execution of our end user strategies.", "Robert F. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Got you. And then, I had a question on the new cost reduction efforts. How much of these $125 million in cost reduction efforts is assumed in your guidance this year? And then just how does the cadence, how much comes next year versus say 2017? Thank you.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, there is a little in the numbers this year we talked about. Now, we did see one of our divisions to get a good early execution in the third quarter, FCD. So, we saw a little bit of a benefit there, but the bulk of this will come in a run rate basis next year. And as Karyn talked about, we expect it to be in full run rate towards the end of next year.", "Also to my earlier commentary, I think I talked about two-thirds was, what I'd say, structural and in our view is sustainable through cycles, and a third was market reaction. Most of the incremental is more structural. So, we have responded to volumes and not that there is still \u2013 not a little additional volume response we can do. But now what we're starting to do is focus on really bringing in systemic change in terms of the structure, reducing complexity. As Tom and I talked \u2013 as Tom talked about, that will also go into our plant rationalization, product optimization. So, there's a lot of things that we're working on, and that we will continue to work on. The incremental is really are moving towards that direction.", "Robert F. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Got you. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks. Good morning.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "You talked about the chemical fees including some of the next round via North American crackers. How would you think that next round of plants be different for you than what you've experienced in the first round? If at all, just in terms of scope and overall magnitude of impact?", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I will look at the scope as being very, very similar and the magnitude not much, not much different, and obviously we're talking about some time in 2016 and possibly even 2017, beginning of 2017 for those next rounds. And remember there is two pieces. One is the new crackers themselves and then the second piece is the derivatives of the existing crackers that have now been built and now they're adding on additional chemical facilities to those. So, those are the two pieces.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And Tom, you just talked a little bit \u2013 or you mentioned the reliability models. Can you just talk a little bit more about that and how big those might be and when we could start seeing some impact there?", "Thomas L. Pajonas - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean, that's a \u2013 I would say a fundamental change in the business model that we think long-term is going to occur over time and that's where people get more of a driver on availability and reliability as opposed to just the cost. So, it factors in the total lifecycle of the product. We've gotten some good traction in our frame agreements in those areas, and we're seeing a lot of customers begin to get more interested in that model, and we have the set up to be able to do that in terms of the QRCs and the processes to bring that model to them.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "I mean is this expected to potentially be a swing factor for sales in 2016 or is it more longer term than that?", "Thomas L. Pajonas - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, I would say it's a gradual ferreting of that sales over time with more and more customers moving toward that model, I would say over the long-term.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Joe.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So, Mark, my first question, look, you guys had really good gross margin expansion especially in two of your segments this quarter, and no incentive comp played some of the role there. But, how are you guys thinking about your ability to hold gross margins as we kind of enter 2016, just given the backdrop that you mentioned with OE pricing being down?", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's, I mean, the pricing is going to put pressure on it. We \u2013 unlike the last cycle, these projects are not a big part of our \u2013 certainly, the backlog in the revenue like they were then. But there's no question, the pricing environment is going to put pressure on the gross margins.", "Now on the flipside, we are looking at things like aftermarket mix and the business and then quite a bit of the realignment improvement efforts that are ongoing in the business. There's a list of things not \u2013 within the $125 million, and then other things we're working on as well. So, in general though, you should expect that the pricing environment will definitely put pressure, and a lot of our efforts are designed, not only to respond to current market conditions, but we're trying to look longer term over the next couple of years at the margin profile of this business and drive even improvement off of where we were at peak levels.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And then maybe as you're kind of thinking about the restructuring efforts, how are you guys thinking about what portion of it is going to come through COGS versus SG&A? I know you gave us a two-third structural versus one-third market related. But, I'm just curious, it seems clearly a lot of the restructuring benefits this quarter that we saw in FCD were coming through the SG&A line?", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, it's roughly about 60-40. And then I think as we look at additional opportunities, it's going to tend more to the cost of sales, because that's when we start rationalizing the facilities as well.", "Karyn F. Ovelmen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "But traditionally, it's run in that 60% cost of sales, 40% SG&A and that's what we're expecting as we're going forward. As Mark indicated, the change that we had from the $100 million spend for the $70 million benefit. The change there is really due to the mix of the projects. So, the original plan had a higher mix of closures. And the updated plan that we have has more head count reductions. So the head count reductions have that ratio of 1 to 1.3 of savings, so about $85 million of that $125 million spend or about $110 million of the run rate savings. And now that we've got an additional 5% head count reduction, in the $125 million for $125 million, two-thirds of that spend now is head count reduction. And the closures have a ratio, more of a 2.4 to 1. So, about $40 million of the spend will be for about $15 million in savings.", "And then just to follow-up on your question there, with regards to compensation, looking at that from a comparative perspective, just to give you some information with regards to being able to model that a little bit better. Q3 and year-to-date actual, if you look at just overall annual compensation, the impact would be about 100 basis points on Q3 and year-to-date through September. And then from a segment perspective, it's slightly larger in EPD, lower in FCD and then of course much lower in IPD.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's helpful color. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jonny Wright of Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Jonny Wright - Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.", "Good morning, guys.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Jonny Wright - Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.", "Just looking to dig in maybe a little bit on the flow control side, actually the margin performance there is very strong. Can you maybe just kind of parse out the drivers behind that and where you're looking at that into 4Q and into 2016?", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So if you look across our segments, you can see the margins were \u2013 in EPD were certainly impacted by declining revenues and less fixed cost absorption across the SG&A line. It did have \u2013 about 90 basis points of that bad debt expense is in the number there as well. But as you kind of work across that, a lot of that is going to be where you see the project activity and the revenue decline and it's difficult to adjust the SG&A as quickly in that business, held up a bit by the strong aftermarket component.", "If you go across IPD, that's on the tail end of what I would say is our operational improvement in the business that you saw driving margins there. You also, including SIHI, saw, if you take out the purchase price accounting, some gross margin accretion, and that's because the SIHI gross margins were higher and we're starting to leverage that as well. The real opportunity in our industrial segment right now is on the commercial side, is taking the platform we have and we've got a significant opportunity to improve the way that business goes to market.", "In the valve division, the simple message is, they had a good quarter. It's been a very consistent performer, very, very efficient. It had good power shipments this quarter as well. So its foundation is very, very strong and it's able to execute on the strong MRO opportunities, good power shipping during the quarter. And then in the aggregate, as you look across the company, just cost control across the corporate expense. So that's basically what you see in our margin profile.", "Jonny Wright - Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.", "Okay. Great. And then, I guess, looking forward into 2016 then, you guys have talked about the incremental increase in the restructuring spend. As you sit there today, is the current kind of plan looking to hold margins flat, or do you think margins can potentially offset the sales decline next year? What's sort of the base case sitting there in a volatile market?", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the end of your statement is just that, it's a volatile market. I mean what we're trying to do is not only respond to the markets, but improve the operating platform long term. So as you look forward, a couple of things. As I mentioned earlier relative to last cycles, while we see price declines in projects, they're not going to be as dramatic as they were in 2008 to 2009, because we had a very strong pricing environment. So that should indicate less of an impact relative to prior cycles.", "But as you look at our business overall, we have more aftermarket business than we did before and our run rate business is growing as well. But the fact is, these are volatile markets. You don't know where your top line necessarily is going to come in with these push-outs and with the order activity, and that will tend to impact fixed cost leverage. So as you think through our business next year, a lot of it is going to depend on \u2013 the way I look at it is going to be the volume activity that we see. That's why I pointed you earlier to the fact that right now we have a book-to-bill of 1, and we saw significantly less during the \u2013 this period of time than the last cycle, but we'll have to see how that continues to flush out over the next couple of quarters.", "Jonny Wright - Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.", "Great. Thanks for your time, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "I'd like to follow up on Joe's question and particularly Karyn's answer regarding the impact of the change in incentive compensation. So, was it 100 basis points, so that should flow through to the fourth quarter as well, but not necessarily into 2016? Is that correct?", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean, as you said, it's all the way it's aligned to shareholders. So, these aren't necessarily one-time items. We set up our compensation plans that really correlate to our commitments to our shareholders, particularly around our guidance. So as we set that, if we over-perform, as we've done in the past, that will tend to put an additional cost on incentive comp. And then, if we underperform, it will put downward pressure in a sense on incentive comp. So, what I want to suggest is, this is the way we operate our business similar to other things that you do in your factories to align your interest to the shareholders.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, this is more of an accounting nit, but we're trying to figure out where that $0.03 of bad debt write-off, where does it show up in your results? I couldn't find it in the Q. So, maybe you can share with us what happened...", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Yeah.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And where we might find that.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, it's in our EPD segment and it was about a 90 basis point impact on margins for the quarter. We took it in there. We did not adjust it out. And it really relates \u2013 the end user is certainly still intact, but the way our policy works, as you talked about, after a period of time, if we have visibility, the contractor did go bankrupt, then we go ahead and take a reserve against it. But at the end of the day, the product still may ship in the future, because they need it for the facility, but the way we do our accounting, we took the charge.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Where would we have seen it discussed in the Q, I'm just \u2013 we saw the announcement in the press release last night and the reference in the slide, but there was no other detail provided. Would we not see that discussed, is it not material, I'm just curious, for next time?", "Karyn F. Ovelmen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It was highlighted in the press release. So you can see the impact on earnings per share on a consolidated basis, but materiality for EPD it's part of our normal reserve allowance analysis and didn't highlight it.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good morning, everyone.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Nathan.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Mark, I just want to follow up on Deane and Joe's there. If you're looking at that 100 basis points for the year on comp, you're looking at probably about $40 million. And as you said, that's largely levied to your delivering what you promised on guidance at the start of the year. So, what is the kind of \u2013 how should we think about how much of that comes back into expense next year assuming, say you give guidance in January or February and you actually hit that number?", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the way you think about it is \u2013 I mean, you've got a number of things in comp. I mean, what we're doing is, we're spending a lot of time on incentive comp, Nathan. But we have other things that go the other way. You way merit increases every year. So, I don't want to get too caught up in any one specific item. But the point is, you just take a step back. The way we design our comp is to \u2013 is aligned with our shareholders. So when you look at our guidance in any given year, you should assume that we have plans right around where our commitments are to the extent and it's all interlinked. I mean, you talk about our annual increases, our annual incentive comp or our bonuses, our long-term metrics that are all tied to the shareholders. So the simple way to think about it is, when we put a commitment out there if we exceed it, then we share the benefit with the shareholder. And if we don't, then it goes the other way.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "That's fair. And I would like to attack the margin question for next year in a different way. If we break down your business into, it's probably only going to be about 10% projects next year and say a 45% run rate and 45% aftermarket. If the pricing on project is down 15%, and say the run rate is down 3% that would get me something like a 250 basis point to 300 basis point headwind on margins in the absence of anything else. So just taking in isolation, is that a reasonable way to think about the pricing that's going to run through your revenue next year?", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, all other things being equal, that's of course the way the math would work. But if you see a mix shift towards more or less aftermarket, that will impact margins as well. The other thing is the cost savings, how they come through and when they come through. As you can see, once we get a run rate of $125 million, that's significant in terms of the margin profile, right. On last year's revenues, that's \u2013 what is \u2013 that's about 250 basis points...", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "...of margin in and of itself, but that is a way to look at it. I think I have commented before, during \u2013 when I referenced last downturn, we saw the margins in the projects go down by literally 25% \u2013 20%, 25% on all of 20% of our business, that was significant. So, the math works, but there's a lot of moving parts.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks. That's helpful on that part. And can you just give us an update on what you expect for incremental savings in 2016 over 2015 before you hit that full run rate?", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think that probably we have very little this year and we \u2013 right now we expect the full run rate to come in the end of next year. And I know that's frustrating, but let me tell you, when you deal with these things, they're anything but linear. I mean, we're talking about people, we're talking about various countries around the world and those are what drive the timing and achievement of these savings. But the fact is we just want to give you a general sense that we see a plan where we can execute these through the end of next year.", "And I think it's important to point out. Some of the \u2013 we're not going to stop with that. We still think we have significant opportunity in product optimization, certainly manufacturing optimization. You heard about our capital expenditures, we're acquiring a facility in China or we're going to build out a facility in China to move some of our valve manufacturing too. Over time what you're going to see is that's going to help us further optimize our global platform.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I wouldn't expect you to be standing still, Mark, and thanks very much for the color.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Appreciate it. Yeah.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Bye-bye.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Bye.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Bhupender Bohra of Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, so, just wanted to \u2013 if you guys can talk about SIHI, there was some commentary about like improving gross margins over there and how the integration is proceeding right now.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's going well. We have \u2013 as Karyn mentioned it was basically flat to slightly positive, including purchase price accounting and if you take that out, was about $6 million positive. From an integration standpoint and Tom mentioned, we've been able to use some of their very capable capacity to rationalize some of our facilities into \u2013 but I would say in general, the real positive has been the ability to leverage some of their capabilities. We've learned a lot. We've learned a tremendous amount from acquiring this business and we're certainly excited about it, not only in the results that you've seen, but in the potential of that business to globalize it. The comment I made around margins was historically, if you looked our industrial segment, you saw roughly mid-to-high 20%s in terms of the margins. SIHI had a higher margin profile, gross margins I'm referring to in the low-to-mid 30%s. So that was my reference around the gross margins.", "Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And just a follow up with Tom on these \u2013 the new crackers, which are coming up down in Texas. We're talking about the first wave and you mentioned about the second wave to hit maybe in 2017, just explain us like at what particular \u2013 at point in cycle do we the Flowserve actually participate, like when do the projects or the products do actually go into these projects, like is it early cycle or like late in the cycle of the projects?", "Thomas L. Pajonas - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I would say a little bit later cycle of the projects. And keep in mind that, we sell different types of projects into that cracker, again the residual plants that go in there. So, you could have a longer cycle projects that may last 8 months and you could have shorter projects that are 3 months to 6 months. So, it's a varied amount of the products into that \u2013 into those plants.", "Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And did we see that in the IPD, if you look at the aftermarket IPD, bookings were pretty strong ex-SIHI and the FCD bookings. What was that the factor over there?", "Thomas L. Pajonas - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I would say if you looked at SIHI, I think Mark also mentioned that there is about 80% of that business is run rate business as opposed to large project.", "Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC", "All right.", "Thomas L. Pajonas - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "So you're seeing some of that run rate business hold up as we've indicated in previously.", "Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And any color on power end market, final question?", "Thomas L. Pajonas - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. If you look at the power market, I mean, there's a lot of activity going on with coal, now with the environmental requirements. So we're seeing a lot of coal plants being discussed in terms of switching to natural gas. That's the one thing that's happening. We are seeing again some environmental change outs in coal units themselves, which present some opportunities. And then we're also seeing a combined cycle natural gas build out in a number of places around the world, which is \u2013 it seems like it's beginning to get some steam behind it.", "Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Thomas L. Pajonas - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.", "Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Couple questions for Karyn. With the discussion just around cash flow and balance sheet, the leverage ratio traditionally for Flowserve has been 1 times to 2 times on a gross basis. With you coming in, are you thinking about that differently, might you reconsider how you're looking at included cash and maybe some of the priorities, going forward?", "Karyn F. Ovelmen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. So, right now, no change to our financial policies that we have in place. We'll continue to look at that, but the stated target has been 1 times to 2 times gross debt-to-EBITDA. We have a regular dialogue with our board regarding allocation capital and any decisions regarding our capital structure. Look, we've used that opportunistically over the last few years to, one, I think kind of right-size the balance sheet and use as a source of funds for buying back shares over the past four years, we've returned over $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. And so this amount is significantly in excess of our stated policy over the longer term of returning 40% to 50% average of our two-year net income to shareholders. So we'll continue to work through that, continue to be opportunistic, but we'll continue to maintain a relatively strong balance sheet as we head into the markets that we are looking at.", "Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "All right. Fair enough. And just separately, could you maybe just talked about receivables. So there has been, I guess, mix data points about some of the national oil companies specifically and the bad debt expense, even that you took in the quarter, just about getting paid by some of these customers that are under particular stress with oil where it is. Can you just talk about your experience or the concerns that cash flow generation could slow down on that factor or are you seeing it differently?", "Karyn F. Ovelmen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We're seeing a little bit of a slowdown in terms of collections. In particular, in terms of our bigger customers, they continue to pay. And so at this point in time, we don't have additional reserves or concerns about ability, intent, otherwise we would have booked incremental reserves above the one bad debt that we had this quarter. But AR is down as overall just and primarily that's lower sales and lower pricing. But at this point, we don't have any significant concerns on anything in particular as we head into \u2013 at year-end but, of course, we continue to monitor that from a credit perspective, and are very, very diligent around it.", "Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from William Bremer of Maxim Group. Please go ahead.", "William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC", "Good morning, Mark, Tom, Karyn.", "Thomas L. Pajonas - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Bill.", "William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC", "Tom, the question is regarding downstream activity and you voiced of we're all seeing many of these refineries at or close to nameplate capacity. Would you be able to give us a little more granularity of what you're seeing here domestically, and what you're seeing internationally, and how that affects your business?", "Thomas L. Pajonas - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean, Bill, I would say overall the MRO activity on the downstream is \u2013 I would say has held up reasonably well versus the prior sequential. So we're pretty pleased with that aspect. And I would say in some of the businesses like the valve business, they've done pretty good on the aftermarket, the control valve business relative to the petrochemical area. So we're pleased also there. So I would say overall on the aftermarket, a good, I would say, steady performance, I would say, over the last three quarters, given everything that's going on in there. Now relative to the North America, I mean, we still see deferrals happening, but we still have our fair share of the aftermarket business.", "William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC", "Excellent. One for you, Karyn. You mentioned the DSOs came back couple days. The last question sort of voiced whether or not you're able to pull any more levers there, and given the pricing now and some of the end customers, should we just make the assumption that DSOs pretty much hold this type of level going forward?", "Karyn F. Ovelmen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Look, the company continues to make, I think, a lot of progress in terms of working capital, okay, in terms of the approach to it. So, for example, from an accounts receivable perspective, on a systems level, some really solid progress in terms of generating reporting tools that help to focus on collections. So one of the things that we're looking at right now is really moving that focus from the site level, we are driving improvements in terms of collections to really generate more meaningful improvement in working capital. We intend to take a global approach and focus on the entire end-to-end process.", "So to your question, yeah, I think we're probably going to level out here a little bit in the short-term. But in driving a more wholesome improvement, we do expect to lever the tools that have been created to-date and the work that's been done to-date. But in order for us to drive a more dramatic improvement in working capital, we intend to standardize terms and dedicate a global collection team, automate dispute management, drive further discipline, compliance, so all the way through the entire sales process.", "So we plan to implement global standardized procedures which will range from order to entry to billing to cash application, from purchasing to payables and from record to report. So, as we put out these standard procedures in place globally over time, we would expect sustainable meaningful improvements, but it will take some time.", "William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC", "I look forward to it. Care to give us a target?", "Karyn F. Ovelmen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Look, these types of shared service type models can take around two years or so to build. We would expect to see some tangible benefits within the first 12 months to 24 months, but real sustainability, once all the sites are rolled out and everything is back integrated, it's going to take up to about two years.", "William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC", "And my final question is on the underlying tax rate. You voiced the reason why it sort of jumped a little bit this particular quarter. Going forward and into 2016, where should we place it?", "Karyn F. Ovelmen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We're still expecting to be in the range of around 30% to 31%.", "William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Giordano of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "So most of my questions at this point have been answered. Just maybe if I can ask you about bid-ask spreads in the M&A space right now, particularly on \u2013 maybe on some energy assets, have we seen after the second leg down kind of a reevaluation of sell side expectations there?", "Thomas L. Pajonas - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "In general, what we've seen on the smaller ones that are privately owned is the sellers are still looking for recent prices that they've seen. It just takes a little time for that to adjust out of their thinking. I mean, these are often family-owned businesses they started, they've been involved with for a period of time. Unless they have some real urgency to exit the business, they will tend to have long memories on strong markets and short memories on weak markets.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Larger properties a bit more rational?", "Thomas L. Pajonas - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "No \u2013 we primarily had been focusing on the bolt-on space, but you've seen what's happened generally overall with some of the other flow control assets and how they've moved.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "For sure. Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from David Rose of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.", "David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted to follow-up on the backlog and the margins, and just to get a better sense in terms of the last time it took a while to work through backlogs, you had some pressure on margins, I mean, the longer the products sit in backlog. You've done a lot of work on documentation to help expedite this. So, is there a potential risk that we've got these lower margins in there for a protracted period of time, and maybe you can kind of handicap for us what you are seeing as products are delayed, what the impact is on your existing margins?", "Thomas L. Pajonas - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, yeah, I don't know if you were comparing \u2013 I mean, the last time, some of it was our fault around execution that extended these things in backlog, and we've significantly improved on that. The fact is that the backlog relative to where we were in the last cycle and projects is lower, so there is less to actually flow through over that period of time. So what you see in our backlog right now is more of a mix of run rate business and aftermarket.", "Having said that, as you've seen this in the oil industry, last time, oil snapped back relatively quickly, and these projects were \u2013 there was still a sense of urgency to get these projects on line. One thing that is different is, we're certainly seeing that these projects aren't running at a pace in terms of delivery that they were before, and even slower than what we saw in the last cycle.", "So, I think the risk is, and we've seen this during the course of the year, is that the backlog, the delivery can extend, we're not worried that they're going to go away, because a lot of these projects are well underway. But, we could see where customers can push these things from quarter-to-quarter and in fact we have.", "To your point, what that's going to impact, obviously if \u2013 project backlog is typically in almost all instances your lowest margin backlog. If it gets pushed, you could say that that could help margins, the fact is, around the project or the gross margin in and of itself. But it does impact revenues, and this is what you're seeing in the EPD segment is the revenue decline was \u2013 it was difficult to offset with reduced fixed cost, and so you lose the fixed cost leverage in your operating margins.", "David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, if we can kind of segue into the inventory side of it, maybe you or Karyn can provide a little bit of color on what you're doing to better manage the inventory in this environment?", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, part of what you see, and you can see it in some of our supplemental disclosures and our 10-Q is, when projects tend to get delayed in terms of delivery, you see a build in work in process, in finished goods. A lot of these projects are work in process. So it will tend to build there from an inventory standpoint.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Thomas L. Pajonas - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "And I would add, relative to supply chain, I mean we have efforts going on in terms of making sure that the material's coming in at the appropriate time to the facilities. We look at the cycle time on our products, and we always gravitate on projects relative to cost reduction and/or cycle time, and you'll see probably a little more effort on our part in terms of our research and technology area, gravitation towards lead times and driving more time out of the business that way. But a lot of effort going on in the supply chain right now.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question is from Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood. Please go ahead.", "Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to talk about the water business. It's something I hadn't heard you mention in quite some time in your prepared remarks. And you did so this time a couple of times. I think Mark and Tom both mentioned desal. So, can you expand on that for us a little bit, and where exactly you're seeing that, what types of projects those are, and what the materiality is where you felt it was worth noting?", "Karyn F. Ovelmen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean, the water and wastewater business was up not too much, it was up almost about 3%, but, it's a small percentage of the overall piece. A lot of our desal business is categorized in our power business, and we are still seeing, we are still seeing some good opportunities in the desal both in the Middle East, India, and while that business hasn't returned to the levels that it was \u2013 it's constantly, I would say always in the background, we're now starting to see some early kind of feed work starting in that area.", "So, the expectation is that there must be some movement towards moving that now to proposal stages as the EPCs get down with their evaluations.", "Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then, I'll throw this out there as well and just see if you have any comment. What \u2013 that CALDER business is essentially a duopoly and your biggest competitor there had a pretty notable development in the quarter, they signed a nine figure deal with Schlumberger to basically market a fairly similar device that they adapted for down hole drilling and fracking. They claim it's going to reduce pump needs dramatically there. Is that something where your team is looking at that as something you can adapt to your product as well or is that something \u2013 or have you seen that or any comment there?", "Mark A. Blinn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I mean, we certainly see that as an opportunity, but obviously as you can tell from them, they are ahead of us on that.", "Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.

And good morning, everyone. We'll quickly recap our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results this morning. Additionally and more importantly, I'll outline the actions we are taking to improve our operating and financial performance. ", "Let me begin by saying that overall I am pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance which delivered full year results in line with our expectations discussed last quarter. The downturn in our served markets during 2015 was more severe, widespread and persistent than we and the industry at larger originally anticipated a year ago. The sharp declined that began in upstream oil and gas spread across the industrial complex as year progressed. Compounding the challenges in our served industries, the strong dollar was also a major headwind throughout the year. And regionally petroleum driven economies in most emerging market such as Latin America remain more challenged. ", "Against this market backdrop, I'm pleased with how our organization responded. Our employees remain committed to our customers and continued to deliver quality products and services through our strong operating model focused on execution. Importantly, we've taken definitive, proactive measures to better competitively position Flowserve for long-term growth and value creation. While we anticipate ongoing headwinds in the coming year, we are confident that the actions we implement in 2015, and the expanded program and growth indicatives we will discuss today, provide us with a solid foundation to drive profitable growth through the market cycle. ", "As we look to the future, global macro fundamentals suggest that Flowserve's end markets will continue their longer term secular growth patterns confirming we serve the right strategic industries. Population growth in an emerging middle class will drive energy demand. And aging infrastructure in energy, power, chemical and general industries will require refurbishment or replacement. Our end markets are inherently sound over the long run. Although, they are currently cyclically challenged. While we can't control the near-term cyclicality, Flowserve is well equipped to weather period of volatility. And our track record demonstrates that we are well positioned to capitalize on long-term industry growth drivers. Even as we plan for a lower for longer environment in the near term. ", "Let me dive into some of the actions and opportunities we are pursuing. While leadership and technology products and services are fundamental tenant of our competitive model, the markets we compete and demand that we are also competitive with our cost structure. In 2015 and continuing into 2016, the actions we are taking are transformational for Flowserve. In essence, we are structurally repositioning Flowserve for the future. First, we are aggressively taking actions to align our SG&A cost structure to market realities. These decisions are difficult and we consider our options thoughtfully before acting. We are not taking these actions lightly as they impact our most valuable asset namely Flowserve associates. ", "In addition, we believe the current cycle creates the right environment to accelerate the structural changes we've addressed in prior calls. These actions are critical to leveraging our global operating model and establishing a flexible, responsive manufacturing network that addresses the need of market and customers. Against both of these objectives, we've made significant progress against our previously announced $125 million realignment plan. In the fourth quarter, we executed over $50 million of activities bringing the full year 2015 investment approximately $80 million. This investment includes the closure or repurposing of seven manufacturing facilities and a few redundant QRCs, while reducing over 5% of our workforce since first quarter of 2015. Beyond this announced program, we also made significant stride in integrating SIHI and achieving the synergies we expected to date as part of our transaction economics. Our ability to execute on our diverse set of initiatives during 2015 has provided us the confidence and the ability to accelerate even more of our longer-term plans. We developed these actions over a number of years and initially expected and extended timeline to implement. However, current market conditions provide the opportunity to act now. ", "As such we are now expanding the previous $125 million realignment initiative which we expect to execute over two year period. We now envision a total investment of around $350 million including about $50 million of expense that is below the operating income line. With expected annualized savings of approximately $215 million once completed. With approximately $80 million of realignment expense realized in 2015 excluding SIHI initiatives, this leaves us $270 million remaining to execute over the next two years. ", "While some of our initiatives are in respond to volume reductions in the current market, a majority of the actions we are taking are structural in nature, focused on capacity optimization, product rationalization, supply chain optimization and developing a low cost manufacturing base for competitive positioning. Together this will fundamentally change our engineered business. We've demonstrated, proven success in our ability to transform manufacturing capacity and permanently reduce cost. ", "During 2016, we plan to accelerate the closure or repurposing of eight facilities that were part of our longer term plan. Additionally, we will further delayer the organization which is intended to increase accountability and performance. ", "In summary, when our expanding program is complete, we expect to reduce our manufacturing footprint by approximately 30%. Improved plant and machine utilization and significantly increase our manufacturing capabilities and labor hours in low cost region. We expect to realize savings of approximately $125 million in 2016 and $185 million next year. We've a proven record of reducing cost and are confident that we can deliver on this plan. ", "In addition to our ability to drive further cost out of the system, I'm equally encouraged by growth opportunities that are available to Flowserve. For instant, we see significant upside for growth in aftermarket and MRO. We have a QRC network that is well positioned globally. Our core aftermarket activities of parts, repair and service have shown the resiliency we expect even in 2015. And while we won't predict the timing, we do realize there is a building aftermarket tailwind coming from last year's deferred maintenance activities. ", "As we've seen in the past, the longer facilities continuously run, the greater the workload is available to us when customers do catch up. And while much of our MRO sales were classified as run rate OE, this activity demonstrate substantial aftermarket attributes. ", "In short, a significant majority of our annual revenue is brownfield in nature serving existing infrastructure that is permanent and need regular attention, which we believe provides opportunities to improve our share of the customers operational spending. For Flowserve and our shareholders, this work forms an attractive recurring revenue stream created from decade of our installed base. And we intend to increase our focus on this aspect of our business with a number of initiatives. ", "We are also committed to remaining a significant, competitive supplier into new, large product opportunities that make sense for our business. The logic is simple. Project work absorbs cost in our manufacturing facilities and keeps Flowserve as a technological leader and innovator in our industry. Additionally, custom and highly engineered products inherent in our EPD segment create a new installed base and provide a competitive advantage for future aftermarket and MRO opportunities. ", "We believe with the manufacturing and product optimization strategies we are implementing that Flowserve will remain a strong competitor in the marketplace, while the quality of our products brand and operational excellence remain key selling point. We also see sizable opportunities in our industrial business. IPD is done an admirable job of lowering cost to drive margin performance in recent years. But the priority had is growth. We've recently named a new leader for this segment that brings proven track record of the success to drive IPD forward. ", "One of the unique opportunities available to us is to drive increase sales through the distribution channel. Our valves business recognizes about 40% of its revenue through distributors. IPD has a number of products that are applicable to this avenue and we are pursuing it aggressively. Additionally, our acquisition of SIHI has enabled alternative, go-to-market method with a greater focus on run rate business, which we can incorporate with existing IPD products. Additionally, we now have a more extensive portfolio that we can better leverage as a result of the Innomag and SIHI acquisitions. Both of which primarily serve the chemical industry. Even in the challenged market, we believe IPD is positioned for stronger growth long term. ", "In fact, we see opportunity to gain share in the marketplace across our strategic product line. With a depth and breadth of our unparalleled flow control product and service offerings, Flowserve is well positioned to continue adding value for our customers. Likewise, this frame agreements, multiyear performance contracts and preferred supply arrangement and traction in the industry, Flowserve compete very effectively as we currently have over 400 such programs predominately with substantial customers. And we believe there are still opportunity in our customer focus initiative and end user strategies. ", "Lastly, Flowserve continues to demonstrate operational excellence and a continuous improvement culture that drives result. We continue to lower the cost of poor quality, pursue outsourcing opportunities and leverage our supply chain and logistics, all in an effort to drive out cost. At the same time, we are committed to producing innovative products and enhancement for the industry and we'll continue to demonstrate discipline in our pursuit of new work. ", "Before turning it over to Karyn, who will cover our recent financials in detail, let me finish by saying that while our end markets remain challenged and maybe for sometime we are in top of it. Flowserve is and will remain a strong competitor with the ability and culture to drive performance. ", "Let me now turn it over to Karyn and I'll return afterwards for my final comments. ", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Thanks Mark. As we indicated in our preliminary release several weeks ago, 2015 fourth quarter adjusted earnings were in line with the expectations we conveyed during the third quarter call. A stronger performance this quarter leveraged strong shipment levels consistent with our traditional seasonality. Our adjusted fourth quarter EPS of $0.89 excludes realignment expenses of $0.31, negative below the line currency impact of $0.06, $0.02 for the non-cash valuation allowance and the Latin American deferred tax asset and SIHI impact of $0.01. Partially offsetting these items is a $0.05 benefit from the reduction of contingent consideration related to a 2013 acquisition. All in reported EPS was $0.54.", "In our preliminary release early this month we indicated our fourth quarter adjusted EPS would exclude the reserve established for in at-risk customer. As we've shown today, we did not add back the $0.06 incurred since we view this as part of our business and wanted to be consistent with prior quarters. But to compare on an apples-to-apples basis with our preliminary release, our results were at the high end of our expectations. ", "The reserve in question is related to an at-risk customer and includes the write-down of inventory, work in process and receivables from European company that has formally indicated it needs to rework its liabilities and if unsuccessful is at risk for insolvency. When market conditions get challenging we recognize we will see the occurrence periodically. While Flowserve generally does not have customer concentration issues, we do strive to take all the steps we can to protect Flowserve assets. ", "Turning to our bookings. On a constant currency basis, they declined 24.8% in the quarter excluding SIHI's contribution of $54 million. As a reminder, both the 2014 fourth quarter and full year had record levels of bookings which created tough comparisons. Looking further at our bookings profile, original equipment orders were down 32.4% or organic aftermarket bookings declined 13.6% in constant currency. As Mark mentioned, our core part services and repair aftermarket business has largely shown the resiliency we expect during 2015.", "While we have experienced some maintenance delays, the larger headwinds we face from reduced level of CapEx driven aftermarket projects such as efficiency upgrade as well as few parts tied to new units. Similar to all of 2014, our end markets during the fourth quarter continue to be impacted by low and volatile oil and gas prices. A strong US dollar and emerging market weakness. Certain end markets even deteriorated further in the quarter as oil drifted lower and uncertainty increase. ", "For instance during the first three quarter of 2015, our bookings in power, chemical and general industries held at better than we experience in our oil and gas markets. The trend changed a bit in the fourth quarter as we saw these markets taking additional step down as customers deferred capital investment and pulled in their maintenance budget conserving cash. Likewise in our regional basis the Middle East and North America were better performers through much of 2015 but this trend did not continue in the fourth quarter. ", "However, Europe produced some relative improvement and activity levels versus the first three quarters of the year. Latin America, our most challenged region throughout 2015 remains extremely soft with delays occurring in nearly all projects with our important customers in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. Considering the quarterly volatility in our served end markets and region we experienced this year, our visibility heading into 2016 remains limited. ", "From a sales perspective we generated $1.3 billion in the 2015 fourth quarter, an increase of 1.2% on a constant currency basis including $76 million from SIHI. This was also a 17.4% increase sequentially again reflecting Flowserve's normal seasonality. Excluding SIHI's contribution, sales declines 4.3% in constant currency compared to last year. Again our aftermarket business held up better as sales increased 2.2% on an organic constant currency basis. For the full year 2015. Flowserve's constant currency revenues increased 2.4% including $294 million from SIHI.", "Looking at our margins, even with Q4 revenue declines in over 12% in tough pricing environment, adjusted gross and operating margins declined only modestly demonstrating Flowserve's strong operating performance, a shareholder alignment and focus on cost. Additionally, the increased mix of aftermarket sales and some savings from our realignment actions also contributed. ", "Considering we are at a challenging part of the cycle we are focused on effectively managing our SG&A expenses. Our fourth quarter SG&A declined $23 million year-over-year, or 9.1% excluding the impact of SIHI, realignment and the benefit associated with the reduction in acquisition related contingent consideration. The decline is primarily due to lower variable composition and modest realignment benefits. ", "Our fourth quarter and full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 29.3% and 29.1% were in line with our full year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. On a reported basis, the fourth quarter and full year tax rate is elevated as a result of accrued exit taxes for site closures and a non cash valuation allowance we took on certain deferred tax assets in Latin America.", "Turning to cash flow. Flowserve generated total operating cash flow of $286 million in the 2015 fourth quarter or approximately $2.18 per share. Capital expenditures were $43 million in the quarter as we continue to make discipline investments in our business to support long-term growth.", "We also repurchased approximately 1.2 million Flowserve shares during the quarter. And for full year 2015 we returned almost $400 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. Approximately $160 million remained available under our current share repurchase program at yearend. ", "Turning to our 2016 outlook and EPS guidance. We are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.40 to $2.75 a share which includes approximately $0.10 of above the line currency headwinds. Our 2016 adjusted EPS target range expects total revenues to decline 7% to 14% including a 2% currency headwind. Additionally, it reflects yearend 2015 foreign currency rate, commodity prices and market conditions. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the $63 million to $66 million and a tax rate of 30% to 31%.", "We also expect the quarterly phasing of our guidance to follow our typical seasonal trend. Although the first quarter is likely to be slightly pronounced after challenged Q4 books an improvement should follow. Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of SIHI, quality through its realignment expenses, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration cost, below the line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discreet items. We also expect that 2016 capital expenditures will be reduced versus in elevated 2015 level where we increased manufacturing capacity in Asia Pacific and purchased a license enabling increased aftermarket opportunities.", "We also plan to continue contributing to our pension plan to cover service cost even as the US plan is largely fully funded currently. ", "With that review let me turn the call back to Mark for his remaining comments. ", "Mark Blinn ", "Thanks Karyn. In closing, Flowserve expects near term market visibility to remain limited as customers calibrate around the persistent macro uncertainties. We expect this will result in continued delays in investment decision. However, as you have heard the near term market challenges provide us the opportunity to focus on cost take out, our operational performance and growth opportunities while remaining disciplined in our bidding. We believe Flowserve is well positioned with its extensive portfolio and consistent operational excellence. We've demonstrated success through prior cycles, controlling what we can by leveraging our one Flowserve initiative performance culture and comprehensive product portfolio to drive profitable growth. ", "As we've articulated today, we are aggressively pursuing the sizable opportunities available to us to optimize our manufacturing portfolio and footprint. And we will pull the necessary levers to not only manage through the current market but to position Flowserve continue to deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders. ", "Operator, we would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator ", "[Operator Instructions]", "And our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. ", "Andrew Kaplowitz", "Hi, good morning, guys. Mark, so as you know Flowserve's overall business tends to be relatively late cycle. So how do you guys get a read on energy CapEx cuts which I know you know have accelerated over the last couple months when you are setting guidance? More specifically, how much concern do you have for additional pressure on your midstream and downstream oil and gas businesses? Really end markets like pipeline, LNG, even refining given relatively recent CapEx cuts?", "Mark Blinn ", "Yes. Thanks Ande. So a lot of cuts that you talked about are typically been with the multiple nationals. We do still see project activities with some of the state owned company around the world particularly in the Middle East. But to your point a portion of our business primarily in EPD is what you call late cycle. And as we talked about before and you started to see this happen in the middle part of 2014, they start to curtail their CapEx expenditures, you've seen this with the multinationals trying to protect their dividend. And the fact is as those things can go off the drawing board, get pushed a little bit and they don't come back real quick from -- primarily from the multinationals so they don't decide necessarily over night to bring it back online. But typically these are in their long-term plan. So this is part of the reason if you take a step back and looks why we primarily focused on our engineered business with some of these realignment activities. We've been looking at these for years. If you look at what is occurred over time and it's important that people understand this, we came through a strong cycle in 2008 and in 2009 we adjusted to market and they picked up relatively quickly. There were still quite a bit of activity in the Middle East. But more importantly what we did as we started setting up a lot of our SPO facilities in India, China, enhance the one we had in Mexico, built up more capabilities and our LPO/SPO strategy is designed to start to qualify these, so that ultimately we can move the product and work to those locations. So we had these things on the drawing board for a while. What this late cycle component does is gives us time to go ahead and execute the backlog that we've had for the last year, year and half and we still have backlog and there are projects that would still come into backlog but for the most part we execute that and then start moving those capabilities to these low cost regions of the world. If you look at around some of the pipeline and other activities, some of those are on some of our run rate business and that's not as late cycle. And a lot of that is we talked about earlier some brownfield activity. So there is still some good brown field activity because what happens is lot of these facilities continues to run and they still need repairing and upgrade. So it kind of walking through it what the market environment does allows to do and this is why we are doing it as it allows to plan and execute and accelerate some of our what we call transformational activities around restructuring primarily in our engineered segment. ", "Andrew Kaplowitz", "Got it, that's helpful, Mark. Okay, so let me ask you about the aftermarket in the context of you mentioned last cycle, obviously the last cycle, very different cycle but the aftermarket was flat in a difficult market. Aftermarket bookings in 4Q were down 11%, so the question is how do we think about your aftermarket business in the context of some of these big customers seemingly continuing to pull back on maintenance spend? Do you think you can maintain or increase the level of aftermarket bookings from the mid-$400 million range that you had this quarter or could it go lower still in the current environment?", "Mark Blinn ", "Well, if you look back to the prior cycle we saw something similar in that there was a -- they defer their spend as long as they could. But it came within the year back at towards the end of 2009, some of the spend activity. First of all, you talked about Q4 and the year-over-year compare we had about $550 million of bookings in Q4, 2014. That was a very, very strong quarter. That had a lot of parts tied to new unit. It also had a lot of upgrade projects. So those are small projects within the aftermarket portfolio. If you strip that down and you look you can see that our run rate base maintenance was down only slightly year-over-year both on a quarter bases and on a year-over-year basis, consistent with what we saw back in 2009. So we'd expect that to stabilize unless there is any kind of disruptive event that occurs out there. I mean what our industry saw across the board was very little activity in Q4 particularly on the project and even on the run rate side. That was reflected in our bookings. But we've seen some stability in the aftermarket business. My comments earlier are some of the deferred maintenance will need to come back and come back online. What we are looking for is to see where the efficiency upgrades come back in and while the rationalizing CapEx that may take some time. So that's market driven. From our standpoint, what we need to is to continue to execute on some of our end user strategies. I talked about this before but frankly we don't know where all of our installed base, we are working with some of our teams to increase in inventory where that is so we can call on those customers. They want to us help them; we just need to know that they are in and call on them. So we are going to continue to execute end user strategies like that in an attempt to grow the aftermarket business in any environment. And in fact if you look over the last 7 to 10 years, you've seen a fairly consistent strong growth through cycle. Most of that is not the net incremental and installed base. A lot -- there was a base amount of net installed base that went it. But the fact is the growth rates were higher than that. And that was primarily from executing these end user strategies. But when you look at our business, when you have volatile moves in oil, it takes everything with it. Everything tends to move in tandem when things tend to stabilize and normalize out even at lower levels then you can get what I would say is differentiation in your end user strategies. And any other strategy you want to execute. ", "Andrew Kaplowitz", "Right. So if I'm hearing you correctly, as soon as oil stabilizes if it has stabilized you should see more normal aftermarket behavior. Is that fair?", "Mark Blinn ", "That's fair. I mean if you think about customers they are trying to figure out what the number is. And they make investment decisions, capital decisions all around that. So I think that's part of what you see in the industry is that volatile moves and we saw it when oil moved up by the way back in 2007 so rapidly, volatile moves tend to increase the correlation of bookings and all other activity to that movement in that underlying resource. When things tend to stabilize then end users can start making investment decisions that are more longer term but when the short term is so volatile it's just tough to make a decision. That's why everybody is. ", "Operator ", "And our next question comes from Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. Please go ahead. ", "Mike Halloran", "Good morning, everyone. So first just kind of finishing rounding out that last thought, it doesn't sound like you think that there's a shift going on in the customer base in the aftermarket side between insourcing that type of work or outsourcing it to providers like yourself. So maybe you could just touch on that a little bit and if there's any change in trend line there if it's pretty normal relative to what you would have seen in previous cycles.", "Mark Blinn ", "Yes. I don't think there is any significant shift. If you think about it Mike you look at the complexity of the equipment of that goes in. That tends to lead to more outsourcing because a capabilities internally for the complex work. They are always going to look to absorb their fixed cost and good times and bad. So the trends that are occurring is the equipment is becoming more complex that is certainly one, also a lot of the resources internally to our customers are aging and retiring. And they would prefer to outsource that work. And then you add to that some of the capabilities we have around the end user. And this is going to be an opportunity. It's not just amount -- it's not just maintaining repair and servicing but its how do we get more efficiency out of those products. We haven't seen a lot of that recently, but that will -- that trend will continue. But short term Mike in fairness everybody looks to cover any of their fixed cost. So I can't say that didn't happen on the margin. But that's not a long-term strategy for refinery or any kind of processing plant. It's just trying to bring that in internally. Short term maybe some of the things I'll do but on the complex equipment they will tend to let the experts do it. ", "Mike Halloran", "Yes, that makes a lot of sense. And then on the IPD plan to move towards that distribution market, I guess a question on balance, how do you balance moving new products into that market versus an ability to maintain a margin profile, and speaking more on the idea of the level of engineering and aftermarket that's going to go through the distribution channels a little lower. So just talk about how you can protect the margin profile if not even do better than that as you move into new channels there.", "Mark Blinn ", "Simply answer I point FCD, I mean they have done thing, same thing. You can make money through your distribution channel. I think if you take a step back and look at IPD, our focus was on improving the operations and the margins which we've done. If you look at all the adjustments and take out at-risk customer, we were over 16% in the fourth quarter. So from our standpoint mission accomplished in terms of the margin improvement but some of my comments earlier were this group broke out of engineered business and we've a real opportunity to improve how they go to market. Various channels configure to order on electronically in terms of been able to response. Some of these pieces of equipment are couple hundred dollars, $500, $600, $1000, $1500; the customers aren't as price sensitive. They just wanted it and they wanted it now. So if we can execute through our online capabilities and improve those or through a distribution channel, typically you can command margin because they need these for their brownfield activity. So I think part what we are lining out for you is this is a segment of our business and we frankly we've learned a lot from the SIHI acquisition. This is a segment of our business which has some great opportunity. We just need to improve it. We need to improve the way we go to market and how we execute into the channels. And Mike you've always known me I'll say if things aren't operating the way they should be, I'll tell you this is one that has real opportunity for improvement on the top line. ", "Mike Halloran", "Great, I appreciate the time, Mark. Take care.", "Operator ", "And our next question comes from Charley Brady from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead ", "Charley Brady", "Thanks and good morning. Yes, hi, Mark. The commentary on EPD, on the bookings in the quarter obviously really heavy aftermarket weighting 72% or so which is I think probably unusually high for that business. You kind of understand why given that that's a large project business. But I'm wondering can you maybe talk about the margin impact on that significant mix shift and aftermarket versus OE, when you tie that in with obviously you've done some absorption because the OE is just dropping off I guess my question at the end of the day is what level can you maintain the margins with aftermarket to offset the absorption issues you're hitting on EPD?", "Mark Blinn ", "Yes. You are trying to find a math of what's kind of the inflection point but you are right with low level bookings in the project business you will have an absorption issue which can get pretty expensive. And part of the reason not necessarily just the Q4 bookings but part of the reason we are addressing that net segment. Charley, we had looking back to 2014 and folks would have considered that a decent market and a good year for us. We had about $150 million of under absorption in our business. And a lot of that was in that engineered segment. That's what put us on the path toward what we -- at that time it was going to about a five or six years transformation of that business. You never get your under absorption down to zero but you certainly can get it to run $50 million to $70 million in your business. So I just wanted to make that point around that engineered segment because that's a lot of the reasons we are taking those actions is to help it variablize and be much more competitive and not have to deal with under absorption. It had an overhang coming into this downturn and so part of that is we need to attack that. Once we attack that I think you are going to need to see higher levels of project bookings. In Q4, there were lot of projects that were right there in front of us and they got pushed. And that's not a typical because the customer can wait a couple of quarters and see where market settle out and it's very, very competitive. And it's to their advantage to wait over a short period of time. So I think what you are going to see is as we start to address that we'll deal with the under absorption, the after market mix will help but there is a lot of large expensive facilities in this division. So it's going to need project work but will offset that by starting to take cost out. That's also some of the facilities we took out last year. So I don't have the exact math because part of it is how we get to the cost both in terms of the gross margin line under absorption and the fixed cost as well as we mentioned earlier we are taking action in some of those areas as well. And then where the aftermarket business comes in. ", "Charley Brady", "Okay, thanks. And just my follow-up here is on M&A just quickly, I guess does the current market environment as lousy as it is in oil and gas change your thinking directionally on where you want to look towards M&A as you look out to your pipeline and maybe does it move you toward areas that maybe a year and a half, two years ago you might not have been thinking a strongly about?", "Mark Blinn ", "Right. Well, let me tell you one of our biggest cash M&A opportunities is this restructuring. It's got a great return but Charley, no, we had our line aside on certain industries which we find attractive and the real question is at what time do they make sense. I think what you don't want is for us to decide all a sudden to go in a left hand turn direction into some area that's not core to us, just because it may be viewed as relatively cheap. So it's fair to say that we are still focused on the areas where we think we make money. The chemical industry, we've talked for years around the opportunity around upstream, additional downstream or service capabilities. We made a small service acquisition last year. So we are going to stay focused on where we think we make money long term. There were a couple of things we need to think about. One is we don't want anything to conflict with these restructuring activities because this is a high return on our investment and we need to executing very well because our customers are relying on that. The other thing to think about is just we need to make sure we are very thoughtful with our cash both in terms of the restructuring and our shareholders as well. There is always opportunities use your stock as currency but we have to look at that relatively to the asset that we are looking at. So we are clearly opportunities may come in this type of environment especially for company like ours that has a very strong operating platform. But we need to always balance that against other priorities and what I'll tell you is when we can return $215 million, a lot of it is going to be permanent in our business with $350 million of spend, that's pretty compelling. ", "Operator ", "Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Nathan Jones", "Good morning, everyone. I'd like to just ask a couple of questions about working capital and perhaps get Karyn's take on this now that she's been there for a while. You ended the year with core working capital about 35% of 2015 sales which has gone up considerably over the last few years. What tactics are you guys using to get that down? What's a long-term target look like and how long does it take to get there?", "Karyn Ovelmen", "There are several things going on. First on the account receivable side, we are seeing slower payment in particular Southern Europe and Latin American customers. They are continuing to pay but albeit just slower. Accounts payable is down with inventory up, majority of those increases in inventory are in working capital. So adding cost but not necessarily in purchase parts, it's more labor and less payable associated with that inventory. Also in terms of accounts payable negotiating the terms with suppliers. We'll pay according to terms and all through 2015 there is an emphasis to actually paying on time. We've a lot of local suppliers so paying on time helps the timing and on time delivery as well as directionally pricing. We have been focused locally at the site in terms of improving working capital. As I mentioned on the third quarter earnings release call, we are stepping back and looking at this now going forward on a more global perspective. And really looking to implement in global standardized procedures around billings and cash and collection as well as order and purchasing. So those are the type of things we are going to look at those types of programs to take time. I think in addition with the realignment going on, we will see improvements ultimately when we get through this process. It will take a couple of years but as we consolidate and streamline our sites, we should see improvement in working capital but in near term don't expect any significant swings. ", "Nathan Jones", "Understand that. If you think longer term is there a number that you think Flowserve's structure should operate in terms of a percentage of sales in working capital or working capital turns or however you would like to frame it? Because it does seem like there's probably several hundred million dollars in working capital that you could free up to put to better use.", "Karyn Ovelmen", "We do believe there are some values there. We don't have specific target at this point like I said we are going to look at this in a more standardized global perspective so versus really at the local site. But yes we do believe there is some improvement there but we don't have specific target at this time. ", "Nathan Jones", "And Mark, I think you mentioned in response to one of the last questions that there were a few projects right there in front of you in the fourth quarter that got pushed. Are those things that got pushed significantly or are they imminent? Could those orders come through in the first half of the year or have they been pushed further out at this point?", "Mark Blinn ", "No. These were fairly well down the road and they just seemed to move. But they can move from quarter-to-quarter. We've seen this happen before but we did see they moved in. And Nathan they can move still another quarter or two easily. We still have confidence they are going to come online but remember they are very competitive. We will response but only to a point because if you remember back in 2009, 2010 and 2011 we had a lot of backlog they didn't have value to it. And that doesn't accomplish anything for us. So it is a competitive environment. These things tend to push. We have confidence some of them particularly in the Middle East are going to go forward. But just remember environment is very competitive. ", "Operator ", "And our next question comes from Joseph Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Ritchie", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I guess my first question is on the restructuring plans, Mark. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the magnitude and the cadence of the restructuring in 2016? And then specifically, is it fair to assume that a lot of the actions or a disproportionate amount of the actions are occurring in EPD?", "Mark Blinn ", "Some of the large transformational one in the large plant are in EPD, yes, Joe. And a lot of these as you -- as we talked about are in OECD countries and quite a few in Europe and they take time. You got have a long planning process in terms of just dealing with your constituencies but generally what my comments were is we expect to see about $125 million benefit this year, $185 million next year. So all other things being equal you get an earnings lift next year from just these restructuring activities. And then we will see the run rate in 2018 which will take us up to $215 million.", "Joseph Ritchie", "Okay and then from a cost perspective you're incurring about $150 million this year, is that kind of ballpark-ish the right number?", "Mark Blinn ", "I think that's number yes that we talked about earlier, yes. ", "Joseph Ritchie", "Okay. And then maybe my one follow-up is really around pricing. It looked like your gross margins in the fourth quarter decelerated a little bit versus the rest of the year. Just curious to hear what you're seeing on the pricing environment. Have things have gotten worse? And given that you have seen significant CapEx cuts to start the year from some of your customers, I'm just curious to hear what you're hearing from your customers today. ", "Mark Blinn ", "Well, some of those margins in the fourth quarter had these two customers issue right that we talked about it. And so if you -- in a lot more up in the gross margin line but in general we are actually pleased that our margins held up relatively well. But what you will see in the gross margin line is the pricing environment and to the extent we can offset by some of the restructuring activities. Because lot of those fit into gross margin line to the extent they impact manufacturing facilities. It's just going to be the timing in terms of one week and execute them, some of that is outside of our control. But we are seeing from customers and just remember we didn't have a really strong pricing environment in 2013 and 2014. It was okay versus the last cycle we had a tremendous pricing environment in 2007 and 2008. So but we are certainly seeing it down get competitive at that point in time. The other thing that we will have to deal with is the top line goes down is under absorption. And how quickly we can offset that with some other restructuring as well. But pricing environment is competitive. We saw this back in 2010 primarily because a lot of the project activity in 2010 was in the Middle East and that is always competitive in just about any environment. Typically you have Korean engineering and contracting firms there, they tend to be very competitive on price and demand out of their suppliers. So we are starting to see a very competitive environment. The real question Joe is how long this is going to last because the late cycle part of our business which is the projects which as we talked about has been well less than 20% of our business. It tends to-- the opportunities tend to move out quick and move back slowly.", "Operator ", "And our next question comes from Robert Berry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "Phillipe Forlorne", "Good morning, guys this is Phillipe Forlorne [ph] on the call for Rob today. So first question, going back to the restructuring, I mean the benefit of course looks up nicely versus the previous target but the return on the investment looks lower. Is that the message that incremental savings are becoming harder to find and is there any potential upside to these numbers if the environment were to get worse?", "Mark Blinn ", "No. The numbers are really reflective of the type of restructuring that you have. I mean when you $125 million for $125 million is pretty much one for one payback or one year payback. You don't typically see that in Europe. It cost more but the fact is those savings are permanent. An also what you saw was a lot of the initial part was what I would call volume related headcount reduction as opposed to permanent closures of facilities. But when you close a facility anywhere but particularly in any OECD part of the world and particularly in Europe, it cost more than the savings but the savings are permanent. I think the important thing to think about when you take a step back is if you look at our business, lot of heritage capacity going back 10 years was in very expensive parts of the world. And we are changing that. And so what that all mean is even some of our OECD facilities are going to be have higher load levels and higher engineered equipment in them, and we are going to get more advantage of some of our low cost manufacturing around the world. So that's why we are trying to emphasis this is permanent. This is the kind of thing that would have addressed that $150 million of under absorption back in 2014. And not only would that have significantly improved margins once executed. So as you think about us moving through the cycle and more margins have been this is something that will all other things being equal relative to last and we think that things are going to -- some things are going to change. But the fact is if we had this type of manufacturing profile four five years ago, our margins would have been a lot higher. ", "Phillipe Forlorne", "Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then on your 2016 outlook does that imply any recovery in refining MRO spending? And what's the latest outlook there given your discussion with customers?", "Mark Blinn ", "Well, there is an assumption that there will be some stabilization in some investment in some repair and maintenance in the business. But we are not really expecting the aftermarket upgrade and certainly not the tied units to come back during that period of time. But it does have some of our initiatives around improving the go-to-market strategy in IPD within that. So it's not matter of us just sitting back and letting the market deal what they are going to deal. We have to go and execute some of our strategic initiatives to achieve our guidance. ", "Operator ", "And our next question comes from Chase Jacobson from William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Chase Jacobson", "Hi, how are you? So Mark, you talked about increasing the aftermarket sales and doing a better job tracking where your equipment is going. But you also talked about more sales going through distribution which I thought would maybe make it harder to track the products and capture the aftermarket. So I guess one, can you address that? And two, as you do try to track the products better and capture the aftermarket are you putting more people on the ground or are you doing something where you're adding more technology to your products?", "Mark Blinn ", "Yes to both. Nobel technology to the products some monitoring capabilities, boot on the ground but also technology system to track our installed base. Going back to your earlier question, the distribution channels, those are out and present there, we are just not taking full advantage of them in our industrial product segment. And these distributors they can carry multiple product line and are responsive on one or two product basis to a customer that need it fairly quickly. The end user strategies are really designed around where there are substantial installed based. If you look at some of refineries around the world, there are hundreds of pumps that are out there. And all over the world, if you look at our heritage brands going back many years, there were literally some pumps that were installed in the 70s that were still supplying parts to in remote parts of the world. So it's really around getting our hands around that, inventorying it, making sure we are calling on the customer. So one of the things that we've done this year and you alluded to a little bit is really increased our focused on our sales organization and how we get out to customers on account basis. And get more share of their wallet. Well, part of it knows what customer to call on and on what product they have in their facilities. So we will be the first to tell you. We can do a better job on that. That is one of our key strategic end user initiatives this year. So if you think about how we rolled it out over the last couple of years, we've increased our QRC network and we will continue to do that. We've worked with systems and some end user strategies to help them develop and understand how they can bring more efficiency out of an existing facility. Because even right now they are looking for higher yields out of their processing facilities. The other element now is making sure that we have the right people calling on the right customers, not just out of QRC but our sales people and that's a separate and distinct strategy from using the distribution channel. Distribution channel has been very powerful for our valve business. We just haven't levered it on the IPD side. But your point is fair. A lot of this is OE that goes through distribution as opposed to service and repair work. But a distributor, they want to get certainly margin as well but what we found and you've seen in our valve segment is we can still get good margin on product that goes through distribution because keep in mind what the customer is looking for is they are looking for that product there very, very quickly. These aren't multimillion dollar pieces of equipment. These can be in hundreds or even in low thousand. So time is of the essence. ", "Chase Jacobson", "Okay, that's helpful. And then when you do your due diligence on some of the larger prospects, I mean it seems like always and especially in this environment the customers tell, whether it's the E&C company or the equipment suppliers they tell you that the projects are going forward until they are not. So I guess what is Flowserve doing differently now to make sure that you're putting more resources after the projects that are actually going to go forward versus the ones that are just always out there and always getting pushed?", "Mark Blinn ", "Well, if you think about it, when we interact with these customers we are doing a lot of the design work for these products, for these facilities, working on standardization. Some of our large customers we have quarterly meetings with them to go through exactly what they are planning. It's in nobody's interest that the both sides don't understand what's going to happen. And what I mean by that is a customer -- if they are going to go forward with the project they have reasons, long-term reasons to do that. They may push it a couple of quarters. So once the project starts moving down the road, we have pretty good sense it's going to go forward sometimes, it get cancel. We saw that last year some projects that we thought really were going to forward they get cancelled. It was by a multinational that was very focused on short-term capital. But we see projects drop off or the one that are in the ideation phase that are going on the drawing board. And as people look for visibility around the underlying value the resource they may put them off at that point in time. But I think what I want to explain to you is there is a lot of work that's done before these things are bid. So in doing that we get pretty good visibility.", "Thomas Pajonas ", "Yes. And I would add to that we do take a look at, is the financing in place with the project, and is the projects have off take agreement in place for the commodity that they are producing. We also have different levels of activities so something that is in their earlier stages we would deploy a budget level of resources. If all these things that I mentioned and Mark mentioned are in place then we will deploy more elaborate resources in order to go after that potential proposal. So we have a pretty good system for weeding out those are in early stages versus those that are more firming up and getting ready for real proposal activity. ", "Operator ", "And our next question comes from Jim Foung from Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.", "Jim Foung", "Hi, good morning everyone. So I just wanted to maybe you could size up the opportunity in terms of selling the industrial pumps through distribution. How large is that opportunity for you? I presume it would be incremental to what you're doing now.", "Mark Blinn ", "It is incremental. If you look at our valve business approximately 35% to 40% of their business goes through distribution and we are sitting probably less than 10% on the industrial side. So if -- and in fairness I would say that 30% differential is all incremental because part of what we need to do is have disciplined around what products go through our sales force and what goes through distribution because frankly a sales organization would want to have all other products at their disposal to sell, but the fact is they are only really focused on selling a few and we've seen that. So but a lot of that is going to be incremental in the business if we get it up to the right that our valve business is operating at. ", "Jim Foung", "So net you're in the distributive -- you're in a lower margin through the distributors, net-net your bottom line would improve from just the higher volume.", "Mark Blinn ", "Well, you do get higher volume but as I mentioned earlier time is the essence and so it's while distributors can make good margins, we make decent margin on products that go through distribution. If there was a significant margin differential, companies like ours would go direct to market. But the fact is there is a lot of value in our distribution channel. And Jim we are not talking about big, big projects going through distribution. Again this could be $1500 pieces of equipment and where the distributor add value is they carry an array of products tha they can serve the customer fairly quickly, often times they are proximate to him and so I am not saying a customer is price sensitive but they are really focused on getting that -- having that product available along with some other products that we may not serving to that customer, getting response quickly and getting their facility up and running. ", "Thomas Pajonas ", "And Jim if you look at distributors, there are many different types of distributors that add value. Some are just buy and resale, some will add content to it, some will add an engineering value added to that. So that distributor is really a route to market that we choose based on the value added that distributor can bring to that product in the territory region that the customer is in. ", "Operator ", "And our next question comes from Jonny Wright from Nomura. Please go ahead. ", "Jonny Wright", "Good morning, guys. On the restructuring if we can just look at that from a different angle, so I think historically in the valves you always hear a lot about increased competition from low cost Chinese competitors. You guys are now looking to kind of pivot the manufacturing base away from developed economies into places like China. How do you maintain the Flowserve brand whilst doing that with your customers? And also how do you think about avoiding passing that price, passing the cost discounts on to the customer in the form of just lower prices and becoming more of a like-for-like competitor with the low cost Chinese guys?", "Mark Blinn ", "Well, you keep in mind low costs Chinese are typically are in lower tier products. So some of these are very, very highly engineered piece of equipment. And we don't necessarily see a lot of competition from Chinese suppliers. These are high end controlled valves actuation, highly engineered pieces of equipment. But here is the important thing. The way we do this is with the permission of our customer. So part of what we've been working on over the last couple of years through the LPO/SPO strategy is working with our customers to qualify some of the manufacturing in low cost parts of the world. And don't just mention China because labor rates are gone up quite a bit there. We are talking about various parts of the world, India, Mexico. But the other thing to remember with our customers as well is often times they want to deal with the OECD facilities so sometimes what we do when we talk about repurposes, we'll make that facility engineering assembly in test, it will still be the front end but a lot of the activity around the value add to the piece of equipment will be done in a lower cost part of the world. So I am not suggesting customers on highly engineered pieces of critical equipment are wholesale moving everything to low cost parts of the world. That may occur over time and we are prepared to move with them and doing that. But I think the important thing these aren't commodity sold by the pound type equipment that typically get fully converted over to a low cost region of the world. And we don't expect that to occur over the short term. But we expected to occur faster than what it occurred over the last 10 years which is why we are taking these actions, one of the reason we are taking these actions. ", "Operator ", "And our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. ", "Brian Konigsberg", "Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions, most have been answered, but can you just give a little bit more clarity on the restructuring or the spend you're doing below the operating income line? What are you targeting specifically and what type of savings is associated with that action?", "Mark Blinn ", "Yes, I mean below the line typically those are going to be exit taxes, any non cash asset write-downs or certain things that are sitting below the line but lot of those are going to be exit taxes in the business. It's just not easy to move from OECD countries. ", "Brian Konigsberg", "Okay. So is there a payback associated with that or is it just spending that needs to be done because of the move?", "Mark Blinn ", "It needs to be done as part of the move. I'd look at it holistically and just take a step back and say we are spending -- we are going to spend $350 million, most of it is cash, there is some non cash component to that, most of it is cash to get $215 million of savings all of which is cash. It's still a great payback.", "Brian Konigsberg", "Yes. And also just maybe can you expand a little bit upon just the customers from you had a bad customer expense in the quarter, obviously there's stress really across the globe in the oil and gas space. Do you see -- what do you see from the rest of the customer base? Are there other accounts that are particularly stressed at this time where you might have to take similar actions over the course of 2016? Any color on that would be really helpful.", "Mark Blinn ", "Well, I mean things could have been typically a lot of our customers are -- we don't have high customer concentration in terms of sales. But they are certainly at risk parts of the world. If you look at Latin America, they are certainly things that are going on down there. I mean we don't typically have -- we serve a lot of large customers and but these things going to occur, I mean one of these was a relatively medium sized distributor or small size distributor that went out of business. So you typically when we you see the strain in our industry, it typically occurs in the first 18 months maybe two years. We don't supply necessarily a lot of the upstream, smaller upstream type companies E&P companies that you are hearing about. A lot of the companies that we serve are large names or ongoing process capabilities. But we watch this very carefully. ", "Brian Konigsberg", "If I could sneak just one last quick one in, just on free cash flow, so I understand you had high CapEx in 2015 associated with the move presumably? But even if you normalize that, we haven't seen net income equal free cash flow really since 2007 at this point. I know there's a question on working capital previously. But can you just maybe conceptually just talk about where you think this business should be on a run rate basis from a free cash flow conversion perspective. And I don't think you gave 2016 expectations. I assume that's going to be trailing as well. But if you could talk around that subject it would be helpful. Thanks.", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Yes. So going forward from a cash flow perspective, first quarter they are generally is more cash outflow from our operation associated with taxes, those types of things that we have in the normal first quarter cadence. Our capital expense will be significantly lower. We had approximately $180 million in CapEx in 2015. Our expectation is that's going to be more in line with around $110 million in 2016. So in 2015 we had higher than normal CapEx that are licenses and carryover CapEx work in 2014. Generally speaking on the working capital like I said with this market it's little tough. We don't expect significant swings in our inventories to go forward. And like I said over the course of the next few years as we execute on the realignment, we do have expectation that we will be able to bring working capital down but don't see any significant levers in the short term. ", "Brian Konigsberg", "Do you think that net income and free cash flow will be able to converge sometime over the next couple of years? It just seems to have been to so well below net income for an extended period of time, I'm just trying to get a sense of should we be expecting this business as it's it runs and you expect it to be run to be converting into free cash flow in line with the net income?", "Mark Blinn ", "In part of our reducing complexity is designed to that. It should start approaching it. It's going to take a while. I mean we are going to consolidate facilities then Karyn in the years out has initiatives that we start driving shared service models and things that help really drive more efficiency across the system. But let's keep in mind we are fairly distributed company across multiple countries and multiple facilities but no question that as we take out 30% of our capacity and doing some of the reductions in complexity which we think our customers are going to demand long term. We should get better free cash flow in our business. We've been as frustrate as anybody else has in terms of trying to seek that goal but we are determined to get there.

Please review the reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to our reported results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which can be found in both our press release and the earnings presentation.", "Please also note that this call and our associated earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, which are based upon forecasts, expectations, and other information available to management as of April 29, 2016.

Flowserve's first quarter results were largely as expected and in line with our cautious outlook discussed on last quarter's call. I will cover a few highlights then Karyn will take you to through our financials in detail.", "Let me begin by stating that despite the current challenging macro environment, we remain on pace for the year with our adjusted EPS of $0.39, which included the increased seasonality impact that we expected as well as approximately $0.07 of distinct expenses in the SG&A line.", "Our adjusted operating margin fell to below 10% for the first time in a while and included the 140 basis points impact from the distinct SG&A expenses. This margin performance demonstrates that cost efforts lag in a declining revenue environment. And the loss of fixed cost leverage results in increased under absorption in addition to the normal detrimentals.", "We do, however, expect our margin profile to improve for the full year particularly in the back half, as a result of the expected increase in volume as implied in our full-year revenue guidance, as well as the building cost savings from our realignment in integration efforts. In the current market environment, we are focused on controlling what we can.", "As we previously discussed, we are taking aggressive action through the acceleration of our planned structural cost initiatives to optimize our global manufacturing presence as well as adjusting to current levels of customer capital spending.", "Considering the size of our overall investment in this program, let me review some of our efforts. To begin, to simplify the tracking of our realignment programs, we have now combined our 350 million accelerated manufacturing optimization strategy announced last quarter in a nearly complete 50 million SIHI realignment effort into a single initiative.", "So we will now refer to 400 million investment expected to generate 230 million in annualized cost reductions once completed at the end of 2017. We made solid progress on a realignment initiatives in 2015 and continued this trend in the first quarter. Well some disruption and delays were expected in pursuit of a program of the size, I am pleased with the focus demonstrated by our employees to minimize customer impact and to deliver on Flowserve's commitment.", "During the first quarter, we achieved approximately 16 million of realignment savings compared to our year ago cost structure. And, we remain on track for the plant full-year 2016 savings of 125 million.", "Some of the major developments of the program include to-date, we have notified 13 plants of our intent to close, downsize, sell, or repurpose those facilities. Nine were notified last year, with two of the smaller once completed in 2015. And the others expected to be expected to be completed later this year.", "This year we have also notified four additional plants including beginning discussions with the appropriate parties on the proposed closure of a French facility and our plan to relocate those capabilities to other Flowserve facilities.", "The closure of the U.S. plant whose capabilities will be moved to our Pasadena, Texas location, with expanded manufacturing capabilities, and synergy benefits. Consolidation of two Chinese facilities into one, to generate cost reductions and to leverage capabilities in our newer, Suzhou location.", "And early in the second quarter we announced the plant closure of the former SIHI Colombian location whose capabilities will be moved to other facilities in Latin America. As you can hear, since the initiation of our realignment efforts, we have addressed numerous facilities and aggressively focused on aligning SG&A to current market conditions.", "We also recognize that these decisions affect our people. And therefore are never easy. So each action we take is thoughtfully and carefully considered. Our facilities however, are not the only area affected. As we also continue to delay or simplify and upgrade, Flowserve's leadership organization, which include some non-realignment severance expenses.", "While it takes time to take these costs out, largely due to the regions where most of the actions are occurring, we are proceeding with a sense of urgency. At the completion of our 400 million program, we ultimately expect a 15% to 20% reduction in our global workforce relative to early 2015 levels. ", "All in, these actions will help Flowserve to become leaner and more streamlined organization enabling us to expand our competitive advantages and ensure our ongoing leadership role within our industry.", "Turning now to the current market and bookings within our served industries. The recent increases in and stability of crude oil prices is generally a positive development for our markets. But macro uncertainty continues to impact our customers spending patterns particularly, as it relates to decisions concerning and the timing of capital investments.", "However, we fully expect a longer-term growth patterns, in our served industries to continue to rise. The world's population , urbanization trends and the resulting demand for energy of all types, all demonstrate a solid growth forecast and give us confidence if Flowserve is targeting the right markets.", "We are increasingly encouraged by the improved aftermarket activity, we saw towards the end of the first quarter. And we believe that our core aftermarket activities of parts, services, and repairs are stabilizing at these levels as our markets return to their regular maintenance schedules, we expect to benefit.", "Now, looking at our served end markets and bookings trends. While the market challenges of 2015 persist with many of our customers tightly managing their budgets, we are generally pleased with our book-to-bill of almost 1 and holding backlog at year-end levels.", "Project bidding activity has picked up as of late in some areas and after a slow start to the year March bookings demonstrated improvement. We do, however, continue to expect project opportunities to remain limited and competitive.", "So we will remain disciplined in our pursuit. Overall for the quarter, constant currency bookings declined approximately 8% year-over-year. Primarily reflecting lower project awards.", "Sequentially, however, our bookings declined only 4%, which is significantly better than the typical sequential decline, we experience in a first quarter. We are encouraged by essentially flat constant currency aftermarket bookings as compared to both last year's first and fourth quarters.", "Demonstrating the resiliency we expect in our core aftermarket franchise. Project awards were down significantly year-over-year and particularly in IPD. But partially offsetting this were some of the benefits, we've delivered from our commercial initiatives and activities that we have discussed.", "Our view remains that the maintenance deferral environment, we've experienced since early last year provides a building opportunity. Since much of this work cannot be pushed indefinitely. We also expect that the longer delays and deferrals will result in a greater level of work required when facilities are actually brought down.", "While we did see some of our customers that deferred in 2015, move forward in the first quarter, we continue to expect some 2016 plan takedowns to defer until next year. Large project opportunities remain limited. Although we have seen some pockets of improved bidding activity. However, we expect that those progressing will see an extended timeline to final investment decision and the bidding environment will be competitive.", "Looking at specific end markets, we delivered solid growth in power bookings, which were offset by lower oil and gas bookings and to a lesser extent chemical declines. Power bookings increased nearly 19% on a constant currency basis driven by strong combined cycle investment in North America and elsewhere. In addition to meaningful desalination project wins. This quarter, we benefited from our ability to successfully shift certain products traditionally focused on oil and gas markets towards our power customers.", "In our general industry segment, constant currency bookings increased 3% on strong pulp and paper activity in FCD including Greenfield projects in emerging regions and capacity monetization of existing facilities. TI also benefited from some progress in IPD's distributor initiatives. To utilize this channel to target previously unserved markets.", "Broadly speaking, we believe destocking has largely occurred and distributors are now maintaining inventory at lower levels. And ultimately we expect restocking to be a tailwind.", "Oil and gas markets generally remained under significant pressure. However pockets of bidding activity continue in the Gulf Coast region particularly as it relates to L&G export facilities. These LNG projects are at various phases and approval stages. With some developers pursuing offtake sales agreements before moving forward.", "Refining maintenance spend appears to have stabilized and we expect some improvement in the second half of 2016. Middle East activity has slowed in the last few quarters, following its relative outperformance in 2015 particularly in the first half of last year. Chemical markets continue to be impacted by project delays on new as in crackers even as they are supported by low cost feedstock in North America and the Middle East.", "And a downstream derivative facilities are also being slowed. Similar to our refining customers, maintenance deferral appeared to have stabilized. And we are now beginning to see some benefit from part spend on new facilities brought online in the last several years. To wrap up, our outlook for the remainder of this year is one of expected market stability.", "Our first quarter results were largely in line with our expectations and we began to see signs of improvement in certain markets. We expect limited project activity and for those progressing, increased price competition.", "We are pleased with the early results on some of our growth initiatives and the progress in our industrial activities. This together with Flowserve's proven track record of navigating challenging conditions, and reacting quickly on the cost front while maintaining financial flexibility, and a disciplined focus on investing for the long-term profitable growth, gives us confidence in our ability to drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders.", "Let me now turn the call over to Karyn.", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Thanks Mark. As we highlighted first quarter results kept us on phase for their full-year expectations outlined in February. We discussed at the time that our 2016 first quarter would be challenged beyond our normal seasonality due to industry headwinds experienced in the 2015 fourth-quarter which continued into the first months of the quarter.", "First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.39 was driven by a solid level of shipments and continued operational performance. Our adjusted results included approximately $0.07 of distinct SG&A expenses primarily related to accelerated non-cash SG&A accruals in the quarter from modifications to new long-term incentive plan grants.", "We also saw negative currency translation of approximately $0.03. Following our announced definition, adjusted EPS excluded $0.07 of realignment expense, $0.02 of negative below the line currency effects, and $0.01 of CE purchase price accounting and integration charges.", "Adjusted SG&A expenses appear elevated during the first quarter, but we do not believe this represents a trend. First we are including the 13.1 million of distinct SG&A expenses, primarily related to the non-cash accruals I mentioned, which will not recur in the remaining quarters this year.", "We also had some non-realignment severance in the quarter as we look to upgrade certain roles there is also a timing related impact associated with our cost reduction efforts where we've identified current savings but they haven't been fully realized in the quarter.", "As Mark discussed many of our actions are in high-cost regions and will take longer to achieve. So, as the year progresses, we expect our adjusted SG&A percentage to be below the 24% we saw in the first quarter.", "Turning to margins, first quarter adjusted gross margins were 33.3%, which excluded realignment charges of 7.2 million. Gross margins were negatively impacted by lower volumes increased under absorption and a beginning backlog that reflected the pricing environment of work booked in 2015.", "Adjusted operating margin of 9.4% excludes 13.5 million of realignment and 1.3 million of CE purchase price accounting and integration charges. If we further excluded the distinct corporate expenses adjusted operating margin would improve to 10.8%.", "Our IPD segment was particularly effective this quarter. A sales decline of nearly 12% with many of its facilities in high cost regions increased our under absorption. We are attacking this headwind, however, through our realignment initiatives. We also saw about 4 million of non-comparable cost this quarter.", "Finally, while we continue to be pleased with SIHI\u2019s revenue and gross margin profile, incorporating it\u2019s business performance into IPD was dilutive to the segments operating margins this quarter as reducing SIHI\u2019s SG&A has been pursued methodically and will be more back half weighted.", "Our first quarter tax rate of approximately 31.6% was slightly above our full-year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. On a constant currency basis our bookings in the first quarter declined 7.8% year-over-year and 4.3% sequentially.", "Constant currency original equipment bookings declined 14.6% as customers continue to delay and defer capital project. And as previously mentioned aftermarket bookings were essentially flat. Regionally we saw a good constant currency growth of 11.5% in Asia-Pacific and a modest 1.4% increase in the still struggling Latin American region. Middle East and Africa experience the largest drop both in terms of dollars and percentage while North America and Europe were down single-digit percentages.", "First quarter sales of 947 million were down 6.6% or 2.1% excluding negative currency effects, primarily on strong EPD OE shipments, constant currency aftermarket sales were flat. By geography, we saw significant sales improvement of nearly 35% in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting solid bookings there in 2015. In North America and Europe both declined single-digit percentages while Latin America and Asia Pacific sales declined above 10% on an FX neutral basis.", "We've discussed some highlights of our realignment actions and noted the combination of our manufacturing optimization program with the SIHI realignment efforts to simplify reporting.", "To be clear, the overall size of our program has not changed versus last quarter. To cover some numbers, since initiation of our realignment efforts in early 2015, we have expensed approximately 130 million, including the 2016 first quarter charge, 13.5 million.", "For full-year 2016, we expect total charges of approximately $160 million with the chief savings of approximately $125 million, including approximately $16 million achieved in the first quarter. In total, we expect our $400 million investment to drive total savings of $195 million in 2017 before achieving full annualized program savings of $230 million in 2018.", "Turning to cash flow, first quarter operating cash flow improved $85 billion as compared to a year ago. Free cash flow increased roughly $150 million or over $1 per share further benefitting from $64 million of reduced CapEx. Our realignment program used approximately $24 million of our cash during the first quarter and we also return $23.4 million to shareholders through dividends.", "Turning to our 2016 outlook and EPS guidance, we are reaffirming our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.40 to $2.75 a share following the first quarter's inline performance. Our 2016 adjusted EPS target range expects total revenues to decline 7% to 14%, including a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 of above the line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the $63 million to $66 million range and a tax rate of 30% to 31%. We also expect the second half weighting of our earnings to be more pronounced in 2016.", "As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of SIHI, and excludes realignment expenses, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below the line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discrete items.", "We also expect that 2016 capital expenditures will decline compared to the elevated 2015 level when we increase manufacturing capacity in Asia-Pacific and purchased a license enabling increased aftermarket opportunities. We expect cash expenditures associated with our realignment program of approximately $150 million during the year. We also plan to continue contributing to our pension plans to cover service costs, even as the US plan is largely fully funded.", "With that review, let me turn the call back to Jay.", "John Roueche", "Thank you, Karyn. Operator, we've now concluded our prepared remarks, and would like to begin the question-and-answer period at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Halloran from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Mike Halloran", "Hi, good morning, everyone. So first could you give us some more context around the improvement you saw in the March order rates. Do you think it's a sign that maybe outside the oil and gas space in particular there's a little less fear maybe more willingness to bring CapEx back to the market. Was the trend more than normal seasonality, so just a little more color around that improvement please?", "Mark Blinn", "Yes, we always see a little pickup in the month of March. Mike, if you remember, mid February, look what happened in the markets and in the price of oil, there was just a complete lack of visibility at the first part of the year. So you typically see a trend up in March as particularly in some of the emerging parts of the world that get their budgets approved and everything. But for us, we saw a kind of not back to what I\u2019d say normal levels but certainly some improvement particularly on the aftermarket side and I've seen it continue into April as well.", "So I would say it was stabilization reflecting kind of the current market environment. What we saw towards the end of the year last year and really in the first six weeks of this year, was something more can to what you saw in 2009 in parts. And there was not a lot of visibility.", "So process operations have to continue to run and as long as things are flowing through and they have to do that, but there are still times when people kind of stop and wait and see and we saw that in 2009 and we saw it really the last month of the end of last year and first six to eight weeks of this year's as well.", "So we're keeping an eye on it. As I made in my comments, you have seen oil certainly stabilize. Remember at the beginning of the year as they were concerned about oversupply, lack of storage and demand destruction in China. So some of those things have certainly abated. You see the price kind of stabilize. It will still move around. But as this occurs than people can kind of get back to life, so to speak.", "Mike Halloran", "So then when you think about growth and the return of growth, aftermarket starting to become a little bit more normalized for you may be even starting to improve sequentially. Some of that deferment starts -- at least dissipating a little bit, the OE site is starting to stabilize.", "So from here to get growth in 2017 what would you need to see different or just a continuation of the trend, may be just talk about some of those dynamics. ", "Mark Blinn", "As we kind of think of growth in really the three areas we talk about on the aftermarket, it is going to be the pent-up demand being released and not further demand being pushed out. And we talked about that a little bit, but some of that coming back online and then executing on our aftermarket strategies. Keeping in mind that over the last seven to eight years the growth that we've seen has not been -- it's been market driven to a certain extent, but more so around our strategies.", "When you look at the run rate business, I think there's a couple of things to that. Executing our industrial strategies we did see some good improvement and some traction in Q1 versus where we were last year.", "So executing our distribution, focusing on our channels market, our e-commerce to try growth in that business, also some brownfield activity. If you look at it may be some destocking has for the most part occurred. Maybe there's stock levels that come in and a little more activity around brownfield both direct and through our distribution channel.", "And I think the last piece Mike that what we need to keep an eye on is the larger project activity. While typically the lowest margin business that's something that can move your topline the most, what we've seen is projects -- there are some projects that are still out there, some that we had an opportunity to bid on in Q1. We just didn't like the terms and conditions. But they're out there. It's really keeping an eye on what's going on the drawing board.", "In terms of next year that may be come to bid. That's where we're still trying to get some visibility. And I wouldn't have expected that to snap back after what we went through in the last six months. But that's what we need to keep an eye on is, are they going to put some of these projects on the drawing board and start to work them up. ", "Mike Halloran", "Thanks for the time, Mark.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Kaplowitz", "Good morning, guys. Mark, I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the bookings in the quarter from the standpoint of specifically in power in general industries where's the power stream coming from. I know you cited the line cycle U.S. market is improving, maybe China nuclear is improving, maybe Gulf.", "But are you trying to signal that those end markets are getting better here and are you also seeing a bit of inflection in the general industry business. I know it's a hodgepodge of businesses that you mention pulp and paper. Are you seeing better sort of environment for general industry as well quick ", "Mark Blinn", "I think in the power it is the combined cycle some of the other project. I mean you've seen over the last couple of years power has been challenging relatively flat. Now you're seeing investment go forward. And if you look behind all this, we talk about this oftentimes the secular drivers, I mean people need more power there's not a sufficient amount of power. The infrastructure is aged.", "So you know these things will kind of come back around. It's been kind of soft over the last couple of years, but you've started to see some investment generally combined cycle in the U.S. with the focus on fossil fuels and also in emerging parts of the world.", "In the general industry there's certainly been some self-help around our focus on our distribution channel. That typically is reported in our general industry segment. Also as you saw a couple of years ago there was investment in the agricultural industry. Pulp and paper is kind of having its moment right now. So these things do tend to cycle through and come around.", "In general what you'll see the G.I. is going to track the distribution channel and then also certain other markets as well that will tend to see investment from time to time. But the way I look at that is what strategies are we executing around our industrial side and also in our distribution channel.", "And as for the other parts of our business, the chemical side certainly we see investment opportunities as you saw back in 2010 after a market decline. So you'll see investment. The one we've got to watch as the big projects on the oil and gas side.", "Tom Pajonas", "I would add maybe a little bit to what Mark said. In addition to combined cycle, you have a little bit more I would say push going on with renewable, solar by a mass, waste or energy, so that we\u2019re starting to see just some turning, turn there slightly, and I also I would tell China Nuclear, there is plans for a defined build up over the China nuclear over the next several years and even though the coal market is going through a transition, that may spur a lot of carbon sequestration projects as they look for clean coal opportunities going forward.", "Andrew Kaplowitz", "Got it, okay. That's helpful. Can you talk about aggregation of your saving initiatives. I think you reiterated your targets but you recognized only 50 million in savings in the first quarter. Your target is still 125, but I think that for \u201916, but I think that includes CG now.", "So concerned should be savings could be pushed to the right or little more into '17 and given by the reason to get cost down its compete in a more difficult pricing environment, how concerned are you guys that margins could get a little worse before it gets better?", "Mark Blinn", "Well if you look at it a lot of these costs are in the high-cost regions and in a particularly in Europe and it does take time to get those cost out. And so you see times when you are ahead of expectations and behind expectation. At this part of the year, sitting in April, we are still confident that we are going to be able to drive a lot of these costs out or get them teed up to drive them out during the course of this year as we talked about.", "But certainly in the first quarter you saw the lack of fixed cost leverage particularly in the G&A line, and a lot of that is just that it takes time to drive it out of the business. But for the specifics Karyn?", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Let me give you a little more granularity around how this will flow through. So 400 cost approximately 80% of that relates to closures or capacity reductions and that will represent about half of those run rate savings. And then the headcount reductions which really are less than one year type paybacks that's about 20% of that overall cost and about half of those savings.", "So Q1, just to roll through here Q1, 13 million, 50% of that cost of sales, 50% of that SG&A, we expect that ratio to kind of range between 50% to 60% as we go through into cost of sales and 40% to 50% SG&A.", "So, as we indicated in our comment previously inception to date expenses about 130 million of that remaining 270 million about 55% to 60% and for the remainder of 2016 and the rest will be in 2017. So it will continue and expect that split between cost of sales and SG&A.", "The year-to-date savings in 2016, about 16 million and we expect that savings to increase over 2016, so definitely waited heavy in the back half of the year. The run rate savings we expected to be around 230 million by the end of 2017 or early 2018 and expect savings of a little bit more than half that amount in 2016, 130 million and that's all growing to about 85% to 90% in 2017.", "Mark Blinn", "And so Andy, one other thing to keep in mind the cost of sales oftentimes those savings will take the cost out but they'll be capitalized in the project. So in terms of when hits a P&L.", "But I think the bottom line on this, this is an absolute priority for us. This is very significant. We think it's going to really position us very well for the future so we have a lot of resources on this. So that we can achieve the commitments that we talked to you about.", "Andrew Kaplowitz", "Thanks Mark.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Nathan Jones", "Good morning, everyone.", "Mark Blinn", "Hi, Nathan, How are you?", "Nathan Jones", "Good. Thanks. So this is about as bullish as I've heard you in a couple of years Mark. So I guess, even potentially a little bullish here on a large project business. Can you talk about maybe what your customers are telling you in terms of their plans to bring some of those things back to market what you're seeing in terms of behavior from your competitors on pricing. Just your general outlook on that going forward?", "Mark Blinn", "Well you tend to be encouraged when you see some stabilization after the last six months that we been through. Or actually the last what 15 months that we been through. I'm certainly not calling the ball that good times are here like they were certainly two, three years ago or more particularly in 2008.", "But we are encouraged by the stabilization, and I think I'm also encouraged it's always good when you see some of the initiatives that you have start to take hold, particular in our distribution and industrial segment.", "I think Nathan when we were together we talked about that a little bit. But I do want to make it clear on the project side as I mentioned earlier, there is some activity. These things have been on the drawing board for a while. We expect them to be very competitive, we'll need to be selective because we definitely can compete we want to position ourselves to but we need to be disciplined.", "I do want to express just my concern is with oil and gas the way its been, we just haven't seen things going on the drawing board that we want to see. They can come back online but that area we\u2019re still definitely cautious about. From a pricing standpoint on the projects, we expect that to be competitive. Look, we've taken that approach for the last nine months to a year plus, as we saw this market. This is why we\u2019re taking the aggressive action in our cost.", "A big part of our cost reductions are in our custom engineered business which addresses these projects. We want to participate in these projects. That's what creates installed base, that's what gets you in front of your customers. But we know that we need to really drive costs out of our business so we can remain competitive not only in this environment, but we can drive good profitability as pricing improves in the projects. So that's kind of our outlook.", "Generally, as you've seen with the integrated they\u2019re all focused, they continue to be focused on the dividend and they've gotten a little more I think tailwind to them. But they're focused on price as well so are we. Keep in mind, these projects are competitive, but if you look across the rest of our business we\u2019re turning to our supply base as well. So we're passing through a lot of that on the smaller business down to our supply base. ", "Nathan Jones", "And I know you mentioned we talked about this earlier in the year. I think it's one of the more interesting initiatives going on at Flowserve and I know you've got a new later in IPD. Can you may be give everybody a little bit more color on that growing distribution for IPD initiative what progress has been made, what kind of opportunity you think that is?", "Mark Blinn", "We started to see progress this quarter. So I wouldn't necessarily claim victory on that. What you're seeing in IPD is it is shifting truly to an industrial business. If you thought about my prepared comments, year-over-year we saw a significant decline in projects large projects particularly in the oil and gas. So IPD kind of road the -- for many years the oil and gas coattails as it emerged out of the pump business a number of years ago.", "But half of that decline was offset by traction in our industrial initiatives and also we\u2019ve been very pleased with what we\u2019ve seen from CE. The top line is held up well and the gross margin has as well. On the SG&A line, we've been very thoughtful in terms of what we do with that we\u2019ve been able to leverage it. Those costs will take time to get out.", "So as we take a step back, and think about the products that we brought in there over the last couple of years, we were under utilizing our channels to market.", "Both in a mag also we -- and we learned a lot from the SIHI acquisition. So from our standpoint we're encouraged with what we see, we need to grow that business we talked about that a couple of years ago. And that's what we see in the business. ", "Nathan Jones", "Is there any way to size the opportunity I mean you've talked about that being an unserved market for Flowserve. Can you size the market, can you size kind of what you're going out, going after in that market at all?", "Mark Blinn", "Market like the industrial market? ", "Nathan Jones", "Yes.", "Mark Blinn", "I mean it's -- it addresses the chemical industry. I mean there's multiple applications. I mean much more opportunity certainly in the chemical industry. For example, if you look at the vacuum pumps that SIHI has, they were primarily focused on the European market. So European market is good, but the Chinese market even the U.S. market is strong as well. So the opportunity is big. ", "Tom Pajonas", "And I would add Nathan to what Mark is saying is I mean the opportunity comes through distribution and the industrial side on the range of products. So increase the range of products that go in through the distribution side of the business. It's a regional play.", "EMA was a very good stable growth on the distribution side, and it was because of the new territories that we started to look at in service to our distribution business, including Russia. And it's also a play on the strategy of matching what the customers need there to the type of distributor that you need in a particular territory. So it's a little sophistication on the distributor strategy in those areas, region, products and customer drivers.", "Mark Blinn", "Its early days on that, Nathan. There's other companies out there that have very good products, very good channels and do quite well and have high margins in their business. That's what we aspire too.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Charlie Brady from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.", "Charlie Brady", "Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Just on IPD, can you just talk about \u2013 we\u2019re not getting I guess too specific, because you won't, the margin improvement to that business. I mean it took a pretty big hit on the margin Q1 relative to where that business has been and I guess a lot the absorption is hitting that.", "But as you go through this year, do you get it back to a double-digit margin and it was again in the 2017, further improvement on that or is it \u2013 structurally it's going to be kind of a slower crawl back up to that.", "Mark Blinn", "Well, no, this isn\u2019t reflective structurally of that business. What you have in the IPD segment this quarter is a good portion of those discrete expenses were in that segment. And also you have the SG&A burden from SIHI which will drive those costs out in the back half of the year. So it's not really reflective.", "Also, if you look year-over-year, the revenue decline, we need to get those SG&A costs out, part of those are in high cost. So there's a lot of things working. The revenue decline, the impact of the discrete SG&A items in the Q1 and as Karyn talked about those don't occur in the other quarters, and also the impact of SIHI. All of those things in a sense impacted margins during the quarter.", "But if you look underneath in the business, the gross margins held in there fairly well. The underlying SIHI business was strong we were able to offset some of the significant oil and gas project declines, so that's really representative of how that business looks. We expected it to improve. ", "Charlie Brady", "Okay. And can you talk on a more macro sense in terms of competitors given the downdraft in some of \u2013 in oil and gas market in particular, are you seeing any different reactions from competitors, either positive or negative to Flowserve's business?", "Mark Blinn", "No. I mean, it's \u2013 where we see them mostly is going to be on the big project side and that is each competitors making decision for their own reasons as to how they're going to approach a project. It could be absorption; it could be a desire to get the installed base.", "If you look particularly in some of our run rate business, it's \u2013 they\u2019re fairly large markets and the real issue there is making sure you\u2019re responsive to your customer, that you can give them the product that they want. What we do like is we have a broad array of products in our portfolio. And you've got to execute well on the channels.", "What we found that we've struggled, particularly in our ITD segment, going back to 5, 6 years ago it's when we haven't really taken good care of the customer. So that's really the opportunity that we and our competitors look for and that's why we're so focused on these initiatives.", "Charlie Brady", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Scott Graham", "Hi, good morning, all. Mark, one comment. I really wish Karyn had a better handle on the numbers. I'm going to have to go back to the transcript to see what she said. I couldn't keep up. I put my pen down. So, very well done Karen.", "I wanted to ask you a question about some of the dynamics of the bookings. In both flow control and particularly in EPD, there were some pretty rough and tumble organic booking numbers in the last four quarters and maybe if we start with EPD.", "Despite that, we've had organic sales growth in each of the last two quarters and not organic sales growth in the last two quarters in flow control obviously down, but the degree of the bookings decline even there would suggest that really the next couple of quarters, we could see a pretty significant reversion in sales there. Is that the right way to look at it there? I mean it would seem that the booking -- that the shipments are going to have to catch up to the weak bookings at some point in both businesses.", "Mark Blinn", "In EPD what you've primarily seen is the big project activity. So, as we talked -- that's been the bulk of the decline. So, the underlying aftermarket business year-over-year and sequentially the sales were relatively stable but you saw the project activity that we booked in 2014, those compares across it.", "On the FCD, it tends to be shorter cycle businesses and so you feel the impact of the bookings quicker, much quicker in terms of book-to-ship. So, I think if that's answering your question, I just want to make sure it is, that's typically what's driving it.", "Scott Graham", "Yes. It is in part, but it suggests to me that -- I mean if your sales guidance for the full year is down, seven to 14 and this quarter you were only down seven, it would suggest you guys are bracing for weak, slower year-over-year sales or weaker year-over-year sales declines in at least the next couple of quarters. That's when trying to understand.", "Mark Blinn", "Go ahead, Karyn.", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Thanks. So, I think as you go through the year, you have to look at first quarter and you have to look at it from the percent of revenues that we have in the first quarter.", "And so going forward, you have to kind of wait that a bit. But expectation as we move through the year, we will have increased revenues in the latter part of the year. Seasonally that's what we've experienced in the past as well.", "The key for us as we go forward, as you drive down through revenues, is looking at margins and looking how the realignment activities and under-absorption starts to improving the latter part of the year.", "Mark Blinn", "Part of what could help you if -- I'm sorry I'm struggling with your questions because I don't think I understand it, but if you look at the book-to-bill, often that can give you an indicator in a shorter cycle that will help you with the trend on subsequent quarters.", "But clearly what you've seen is the book-to-bill in the OE and EPD segment has been impacted by the lack of projects. So, you see that reflect through in the revenue side. That formed a lot of the basis of our revenue guidance this year. Because last year's revenue had a lot of project activity that was booked in 2014.", "Scott Graham", "Okay. I guess what I'm trying to get at here is that it seems like there has been an improvement in that sort of great middle. Not the project, not the aftermarket, but in fact the book and ship business. That trend line seems to have improved and if it hasn't, then it would seem that the sales declines in at least engineered products, are going \u2013 you'll start to see sales declines in next three quarters in that business for sure. That's what I'm trying to get a handle on.", "Mark Blinn", "Yes. In the project side, we do expect that and as I said that forms the basis. But even if you look in the first quarter, the book-to-bill in the flow control division was slightly over one. Let's say roughly flat. That's a good sign of things how things are stabilizing can improve over the period, same thing in the industrial segment as it tends to be shorter cycle.", "But if I'm answering your question right, a lot of the decline in our reflected in our guidance, is the project environment in 2014, the bidding activity in 2014 versus the bidding activity in 2015 and to a certain agreed the bidding activity we expect in 2016, because some of that goes through percentage of completion.", "Scott Graham", "Understood. Okay. Thank you. Second question is about the capital allocation policy. Last year you were pretty comfortably over what you've mandated yourselves at. I'm just kind of wondering does that kind of normalizing 2016 or can you stay above that 40% to 45% return. ", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Well, right now we haven't changed our guidance in terms of the 40% to 50%. As we talked about in terms of our capital allocation priorities, we always look internally and organic first. One of the things that we are very focused on is this restructuring. And that's where a lot of our cash will go to this year in terms of driving that.", "So the priority is going to be our restructuring activities, our capital expenditures, which are anticipated to be more modest than last year, but still important growth capital expenditures and then we\u2019re still sticking to our 40% to 50%. No change there.", "Scott Graham", "That's what it meant 40 to 50. You're so far above that last year and now it will have to probably be tempered little bit more, because of some of the capital that has to go toward the restructuring is that what you're saying?", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Yes. In the past couple of years, what we do is when we fund our internal initiatives and our priorities, we've over the last couple of years have returned the access to our shareholders, which is very import. So to the extent where those are going to be more cash utilization on the important internal initiatives, the likelihood is that we\u2019ll stick to our guidance.", "Scott Graham", "That's very good. Thanks. Nice quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Chase Jacobson from William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Chase Jacobson", "Hi, good morning. Mark, I think you touched on it a little bit; I just want to make sure I understand this. But, understood the gross margin was a little bit lower this quarter because of the bookings in 2014 and clearly the pricing deteriorated throughout last year.", "So, I guess the question is really how long do those longer cycle projects take to flow through the income statement and is 60% decremental gross margin what we should be expecting as we go throughout the year maybe into 2017 may be given how tough the pricing is been in the level of the OE bookings. ", "Mark Blinn", "Well, let's say all other things being equal and they aren't because of the restructuring, but let's just start generally with the way to think about it. First you look at the volumes. The volumes in 2015 in terms of project activity were lower than in 2014. The pricing environment in 2015 was more competitive than it was in 2014.", "Not to the extent of what we saw in 2008 and 2009 because the pricing didn't get near those levels. So those things flowed through -- started flowing through the P&L and -- last year and are reflective in our compares. So you'll have absorption which you address with some of your restructuring activities and also the pricing environment which you also address with your restructuring activities. But that's working its way through. So the marginal impact or the incremental impact starts to abate because you don't have as much project activity sitting in backlog.", "As we look forward in terms of the profile there. We do need to get at the absorption issue. So the cost savings will focus on addressing the pricing environment, and also the volume environment that we're in. And we're designing it to be very, very long-term.", "The other thing that is you start looking at mix. If we start driving growth in the aftermarket business, start getting traction in the run rate business, then that can certainly support margins. Those are the levers and those are really the dynamics around our margin profile. But we've seen quite a bit of our project activity certainly from 2014 go through the P&L and we're posting 2015 now go through the P&L. There wasn\u2019t lot of project activity at the end of last year by the way. ", "Chase Jacobson", "Right, okay. And then Karyn can use clarify the accelerated SG&A expense at $13 million. Can you just talk about that again quickly and how much of that was in the guidance for the year? ", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Mainly it's LTI. The acceleration its in non-cash accrual. Its really related to a change in our retirement plan. So accounting convention within a change in employee retirement you have to actually pull that cost forward. So really it's essentially taking three years of cost and pulling it forward. So you'll see a modest decline in our amortization of that over the next 36 months. The majority of that sits in our corporate expense and then a portion of that is allocated down to the segments.", "In terms of guidance, probably about -- I would say 50% of that was considered in our guidance and then real accounting adjustments were made in first quarter. ", "Chase Jacobson", "Okay and this becomes a tailwind to next your correct?", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Slight. It's modest over the next three years in terms of reduction in amortization. ", "Mark Blinn", "It takes -- what it does is it reduces its subsequent quarters it takes three years to kind of get the full cycle of this. So we will see this impact in Q1, but it will be less significant. But as Karyn talked about it is non-cash. ", "Chase Jacobson", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "Robert Barry", "Hey, everyone, good morning. I wanted to circle back to IPD for a second, you had mentioned being particularly significant price pressure there. Is that just really reflective of the segments historically higher EPC exposure at the projects? Or is there some other dynamic going on there and is that accelerating recently or has that been kind of the state of affairs there for a few quarters now?", "Mark Blinn", "So, Robert, I think you said IPD and we haven't seen \u2013 okay, no, we haven\u2019t seen the big price pressure in IPD, what we did see was the reduction in oil and gas project activity. So IPD has some project that can actually be repurposed for other processes as well. But they were able to line it to kind of the balance of the plant for some of these oil and gas larger products.", "What we saw was a decline in the bookings activity and these were -- these aren\u2019t huge but there could be $250,000 and above. We saw a significant decline in that year-over-year. Offset by more penetration in some of our other industrial chemical applications and distribution. Where we seen the pricing competitiveness now for really about nine months to year, is in the EPD segment, a lot of it is in the OE portion of that where we seen the pricing impact. Those are the big large projects, millions of dollar projects that are competitively bid.", "Robert Barry", "Yes. That's what I was thinking actually and so when I saw in the release yesterday this mention that the project booking opportunities were challenged competitively priced particularly in IPD, it\u2019s down for me, but maybe it's competitively priced until you are walking away from it, the net result for you is just lower bookings.", "Mark Blinn", "Right. I think the comment about project opportunities competitively priced will apply to everything. But the fact is, it was more volume than anything else in IPD. Good questions on IPD, the point there is, we have an opportunity to take the products that we have, we've got a good product portfolio, and much better penetrate the market.", "Is what happens when you get these large project activities is it all tend to tilt the entire organization to focus on those. We've made some changes not only in the leadership of IPD, but in our channel to market approach in terms of our sales organization, our distribution leadership to focus on this and we\u2019ve seen some traction.", "Robert Barry", "Got you.", "Mark Blinn", "So think of those as, we need to address markets better than we have before and that's what we intend on doing. ", "Karyn Ovelmen", "As market is indicated previously on the EPD side, in the IPD side, we also have had some projects that we could have taken but for some of the terms and conditions which were extremely onerous.", "Robert Barry", "Got you. Yes, just - thank you, that\u2019s helpful. One kind of big picture question, lots of discussion about moving capacity to low-cost countries. Not just that Flowserve but elsewhere too, so I was curious as you look at the company and across the industry, I mean to what extent do you think through this downturn and the restructuring and reaction to it, we are actually seeing a lot of capacity being, I guess, simply moved versus actually removed, or cut.", "Mark Blinn", "Now, that's a good question. This one is much more removed than moved than we\u2019ve seen in the past. Because what we're doing is closing facilities and consolidating that into some of our higher performing facilities even in the OECD countries.", "So there's a lot of closures relative to what we seen before, but then, again, what we'll do is we may move the product into a lead product facility into a mature market and a lot of the work goes into a lower-cost facility in some of the emerging parts of the world.", "But this is really designed to position the company long-term. In the industry, things we've been really had on the drawing board now for 2.5 years. We just accelerated it. ", "Robert Barry", "Got you. Okay. I'm in is clearly important because as we think about pricing tightening through the next cycle its obviously better if its being removed than just being moved in the cost lower, okay. Good. Would you say that the 15% to 20% reduction in workforce is kind of a good proxy for how much capacity you're taking out or do you have an estimate for that? ", "Karyn Ovelmen", "I think we've talked about a 30% of our physical capacity is getting taken out. So actually there's, there's more square footage in a sense then there is resources. And a lot of that is because we're, we're building engineering and engineering centers in India to handle higher volumes. What we're doing with the 30% takeout, what we don't want to do is not be able to address the markets when they become more robust.", "So I think the way to think of it is even though we're taking the physical capacity out, I believe we'll be able to handle at/or higher level of volumes then we been able to handle before. That's important we want to make sure that we can address our markets because we still believe in the underlying secular drivers in the business. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey guys, this is Tristan for Joe today. Most of my questions have been answered. But I was wondering referred some of operators wanting to out for standardization instead of going cast installations in their designs. How would that affect your EPD segment? ", "Mark Blinn", "You're talking about going for standardization? Actually we welcome that. We work very closely with some of our large customers to drive that because what it helps us do, is to streamline our manufacturing process, our ability to support it from an aftermarket standpoint but more importantly turn to our supply chain and drive value through there.", "Keep in mind, standardization does not mean commoditization, standardization means we develop a common and expected set of process conditions under which the equipment will operate. That actually helps us be more efficient. It also helps us get more of a share of the customer wallet as well because when you develop and can deliver the standard, it works well. I don't - - we don't look at that is favorably all we actually encourage it with our customers. ", "Karyn Ovelmen", "I would add, we've even gone as far as to put engineering talent in EPC facilities in order to drive that overall standardization strategy that they've been embarking on over the last couple of years. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Nice this is helpful guys. That's all for me. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Bhupender Bohra of Jeffrey. Please go ahead.", "Bhupender Bohra", "Good morning guys. Question for Mark, you know Mark talked about the FCD bookings especially mentioned about the talking about the distribution channels and kind of mentioned the word restock here. Can you give us a sense of in your FCD I believe 40% of that business goes through distribution channel and just wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing there on the restock? Thank you. ", "Mark Blinn", "We aren't seeing necessarily the restocking yet. What we talked about is we feel the destocking is abated and they're running just in time inventory. Now that\u2019s important, because for that channel to be able to be successful, you've got to be able to deliver in a timely and efficient manner.", "And if you look at FCD's performance over the past couple years the fact that it has the margin profile that it does is reflective of their ability to respond to all customers needs particularly our distribution channel. Now what I did make the comments is when we see some restocking occur that should be a tailwind for us but we have not seen that yet.", "Bhupender Bohra", "Okay. Got it. And just a follow on, on the aftermarket activity can you just go through geographically like how that will look in terms of project versus aftermarket?", "Mark Blinn", "Well, what we\u2019ve talked about is that the base aftermarket business has shown some stabilization. What we haven't seen that we saw in prior years what we call the small aftermarket projects some of the efficiency initiatives that some of our customers do.", "They are still holding onto that spend at this point in time but we're confident they'll do it because it actually improves the return on their operations but it's been pretty much stable what we seen across the board in terms of all the operations globally.", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Many of these projects that went in 2014 and in the beginning of 2015 are now going into a period where they need spares during the first two years worth of operation. So we are seeing some good activity relative to that in North America, Europe and Asia. Obviously, Latin America is down given the whole political situation there. So that looks, I would say that looks promising.", "And we're also seeing in North America because of the deferrals of the maintenance we are seeing some emergency repairs start to kick in. Customers are coming in with very quick turnarounds, so that business is now seeing a little bit different, I would say driver in that business. And our EMA maintenance business in terms of upgrades on flood control, we mentioned desalinization and even the refineries are seeing some positive signs there.", "Bhupender Bohra", "Okay. Got it.

Let me start with a quick overview of the quarter.", "First, Flowserve delivered solid financial and operating results in the second quarter. This performance, including our adjusted EPS of $0.57 per share, was generally in line with our expectations and kept us on pace to deliver within our prior guidance range for the full-year, although we did tighten our range this quarter by modestly lowering the upper end.", "We continue to make significant progress in our transformational realignment program to optimize our manufacturing platform and reduce our cost structure. Additionally, we are seeing early traction from some of our growth initiatives.", "I will review a few key highlights and then Karyn will discuss our financial results in greater detail.", "From an operational standpoint, our continuing focus remains to improve our on-time delivery, reduce past due backlog, ensure best-in-class quality, enhance our sales process, and project management capabilities, minimize the impact of restructuring on day-to-day activities and further leverage our supplier relationships. Our employees have supported these efforts, and I'm generally pleased with the operational execution that we've delivered, even while undertaking our realignment efforts and facing a challenging market backdrop.", "During the quarter, we saw less volatility in some commodity prices, most notably crude oil. While this stability is encouraging, we still expect our customers will remain cautious with their capital and operating budgets in the near term. Considering the multi-year nature of infrastructure original equipment investments, the more important criteria for our customers is stability and it will likely require several quarters of consistency before investment spending actively resumes.", "Despite the headwinds in many of our sectors and changing end market dynamics, our primary efforts remain on structurally improving our company, controlling our costs and positioning Flowserve for profitable growth and increased shareholder value creation.", "These efforts include strategically repositioning our capabilities, aggressively aligning our manufacturing presence with our served industries for the long term and responding to current market environment, while permanently reducing under absorption in our system, pursuing our growth initiatives and enhancing our value proposition for our customers.", "As noted earlier, we continue to make solid progress on our realignment program, delivering approximately $27 million of savings in the second quarter. To date, we've initiated actions on two-thirds of the facilities we expect to either be closed, repurposed, or sold. Importantly, we remain on track to meet our goal of reaching approximately $100 million of incremental savings which is expected in 2016.", "In terms of specific locations, we have ceased manufacturing and completed the product transfer at an IPD facility in the UK. And in Canada, we closed an EPD facility and also divested a non-strategic foundry. We also have initiated the process to transfer capabilities from our Dubai operations to another location in the Middle East and are nearing completion on closing a Dutch location where manufacturing has now ceased. During the third and fourth quarters, we plan to address additional manufacturing sites and continue to expect about $160 million in charges for the year.", "While we identify most realignment costs incurred for your analysis, it's important to recognize that our reported and adjusted numbers do include the expected negative impact on revenues and profits that have been delayed during the transition, which should materialize as the receiving sites come up to speed on the new lines. We should also see the benefit of eliminating all the duplicative costs resulting from the transition.", "With each site undergoing restructuring, we obtained valuable lessons learned and applied them to subsequent locations. Overall, the pace and progress of our restructuring is on track and we are confident that this realignment program will position our business for long-term success.", "Looking further at the market and bookings within our served industries, overall for the quarter constant currency bookings declined approximately 10% against last year's strongest quarter, as lower OE bookings and project awards more than offset the 2.3% growth in aftermarket bookings. Sequentially, our bookings increased 4%, reflecting both our resilient aftermarket franchise and normal seasonality.", "I spoke about the challenges of the original equipment business already, but we\u2019re pleased with this quarter's year-over-year increase in constant currency aftermarket bookings, which is the second consecutive quarter of this growth. Our aftermarket franchise largely demonstrated the kind of resiliency we expect even in these tough markets. And while operating budgets have remained constrained, this quarter's level was also supported by increased emergency response, brake fix type activity and the return of a few small upgrade projects, which were notably absent during 2015.", "Overall, we remain in a period of rolling deferred maintenance where many of our customers are catching up on the 2015 deferrals, but delaying activity previously scheduled for 2016. This practice will not likely continue indefinitely and we expect to benefit as operating budgets normalize.", "We've also recently see more customers enquire about new or extended long-term lifecycle agreements, or LCAs. We view this activity as positive. In these agreements, we seek to add considerable value to our customers while driving volume for Flowserve.", "From a segment perspective, we are particularly pleased with IPD's bookings growth of 3.4% on a constant currency basis. For some time, this business had largely leveraged EPD's oil and gas project work. Under new leadership, IPD is returning to its industrial root and demonstrated some early traction in our commercial initiatives for the segment, including increasing our exposure in the profitable chemical sector and other general industries, and better leveraging the distribution channel and growing its run rate in small project activity.", "Additionally, IPD has benefited from the ongoing integration of SIHI's products across Flowserve's selling platform, including product pull-through across Flowserve's broad portfolio. In fact, this enabled the former SIHI entity to achieve one of its highest levels of quarterly bookings to date in the second quarter.", "Turning now to specific end markets and looking at bookings on a constant currency basis, oil and gas declined 20% in the quarter, which impacted each of our segment and reflected the broad based pressure on our oil and gas customers' budgets. Oil and gas is our largest served market and this industry has been challenged for over a year and a half now.", "Power bookings decreased approximately 9%, driven by declines in the IPD and FCD segments. EPD's bookings were essentially flat, including strong nuclear aftermarket orders in North America and Europe, and our success in shifting certain products traditionally focused on oil and gas markets towards our power customers.", "Going forward, we continue to expect combined cycle investment in North America, while China continues to invest in nuclear where we participate in both the Western and Chinese designs. In our general industries, constant currency bookings decreased approximately 4%. Solid IPD bookings partially offset EPD's 18% decline.", "As previously mentioned, IPD's distributor initiatives showed progress and we intend to utilize this channel to target previously un-served markets. Flat FCD bookings were supported by solid defense-related orders in Europe and global pulp and paper activity. Broadly speaking, distributors remain challenged. While we believe destocking is largely complete in this channel, they are now maintaining inventory at lower levels and often ordering only when they have a customer order in hand.", "Chemical bookings were essentially flat in the second quarter, supported by a strong increase in SIHI bookings. We continue to see some delays in the expected ethylene-driven derivative plants as well as the second wave of crackers, but we expect this development to progress in North America and the Middle East supported by low cost feedstock.", "To wrap up, we are confident that we\u2019re taking the right actions to position Flowserve for the future and we are encouraged by the progress made this quarter. Although our served markets remain volatile and challenging, our first half results were largely in line with our expectations and we expect a stronger second half of the year with seasonality, cost takeout and backlog shipments as the key drivers.", "Aftermarket is showing resiliency during this time and if extended market stability occurs, we do expect growth in the original equipment orders to ultimately follow. Nevertheless, we expect our customers will remain deliberate near term and early projects to be very competitive. In this environment, we will remain disciplined.", "I\u2019d like to leave you with a final thought. While we are very much internally focused on cost reduction and structurally rightsizing our operations in this environment and making good progress, we are also positioning Flowserve for the eventual improvement in our markets. We continue to invest for long-term profitable growth, including in the distribution channel and other industrial opportunities, as well as new product development and improvements through our disciplined R&D process.", "I am confident in our ability to execute our strategic vision and the extended outlook for our served markets, as well as our capabilities to drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders.", "Let me now turn the call over to Karyn.", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our 2016 second quarter financials, our results were largely in line with our expectations. Bookings were highlighted by a growth in our aftermarket business, albeit still at low levels, and we also delivered sequential constant currency aftermarket and OE increases of 5.6% and 2.5%, respectively.", "Based on our first half 2016 results and our expectations for the year, we have tightened our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance, while maintaining our full-year 2016 revenue outlook. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.57 was driven by our continued operational execution and a solid level of shipments even with the challenges that come with executing significant realignment initiatives.", "Our second quarter adjusted EPS excludes $0.11 of realignment expense and $0.01 associated with the SIHI purchase price accounting and integration charges which were partially offset by a gain of $0.03 from below the line currency impacts. Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.48, which included an above the line negative currency translation headwind of approximately $0.01.", "Q2 revenues of over $1 billion decreased 11.7% or 9.7% in constant currency. Year-to-date, Flowserve's constant currency revenues decreased 6.2% compared to 2015 levels. Adjusted SG&A expenses declined 4.2% in the second quarter, but remained elevated as a percent of sales due primarily to the decline in revenues and the timing impact of expected realignment savings from our ongoing cost reduction efforts in higher cost regions.", "Turning to margins, second quarter adjusted gross margins were 32.7%, down 130 basis points from prior year and excluded realignment charges of $8.9 million and SIHI charges of $2.1 million. Reported gross margins were 31.6%, which were negatively impacted by lower volumes that resulted in increased under-absorption as well as work that reflected the challenging pricing environment booked over the last year and a half.", "Similar to the first quarter, IPD continued to be particularly impacted by under-absorption in many of its facilities in high-cost regions due to a nearly 18% revenue decline. We continue to expect margin improvement in this segment through the year from our realignment initiatives and the continued integration of SIHI.", "Our second quarter tax rate of approximately 29% was slightly below our full-year guidance rate of 30% to 31%. Looking at bookings in greater detail and on a constant currency basis, original equipment at bookings declined 19.4%, while aftermarket realized a 2.3% increase over the prior year.", "From a regional perspective, Europe's bookings increased 9.1% constant currency, while North America was down 10.6% and Latin America and Asia Pacific were down mid-teens. The Middle East was particularly challenged. Last year this region continued to invest in the downturn, but in the current environment we see limited project activity occurring and aftermarket work is being deferred.", "Turning to revenues, we delivered modest constant currency growth in the Middle East, which was realized from the backlog built during last year's positive booking environment. North America, Asia Pacific and Europe saw constant currency sales decline in the 8% to 12% range, while national oil company challenges in Latin America drove a constant currency decline of nearly 32% in that region.", "Shifting to our realignment program and the approximately $27 million of savings realized in the second quarter, this progress keeps us on track to achieving our goal of incremental savings of approximately $100 million in 2016.", "We expensed $20 million in the second quarter related to these efforts, bringing the first half 2016 total expense to approximately $34 million and we continue to expect an expense of roughly $160 million during 2016 as we continue to execute on a number of planned actions during the second half of the year. For the total program, we expect our $400 million multi-year investment to drive estimated total savings of $195 million in 2017, which is $70 million incremental to total 2016 program savings of $125 million. In 2018, the full annualized program savings are expected at $230 million.", "Turning to cash flow, through June 30, 2016, operating cash flow was down about $15 million versus a year ago as cash outflows related to realignment exceeded our book expenses. However, free cash flow improved roughly $62 million compared to the first half of 2015, due to elevated capital expenditures last year related to the purchase of an aftermarket license, and carryover investment on our new Chinese valve facility. We returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends, while our realignment program used approximately $34 million of our cash during the second quarter.", "As many of you know, typically the majority of our operating cash flow is realized in the last two quarters of the year and we expect that to be the case again this year likely with more weighting on the fourth quarter.", "Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, while we see continued pricing pressure and caution in our end markets, we remain confident over the longer term that our diversified end markets, comprehensive product portfolio and geographic exposures coupled with our strategic growth initiatives and transformational realignment plans position us for the future.", "However, there is still uncertainty given ongoing macro and political issues, including the impact of the recent Brexit vote. While we have limited direct exposure to the UK, the potential broader impact of the event on the UK, European and global economies is still largely unknown.", "Based on performance for the first half of 2016, our backlog and its expected recognition combined with our expectations at the current market conditions will largely persist. We tightened our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share.", "Due to the expected timing and margin of scheduled backlog shipments as well as our recognition of realignment savings, we expect our performance will be even more heavily weighted on the fourth quarter results compared to prior year's. On the top line, our 2016 adjusted EPS target range assumes revenues declining 7% to 14% compared to the 2015 level and this range includes a 2% currency headwind or roughly $0.10 per share of about the line impact.", "Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the low to mid $60 million range and a tax rate of 30% to 31%. As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of our 2015 SIHI acquisition and excludes realignment expenses, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below the line foreign currency effects and the impact of other potential discrete items.", "Moving on to cash usage for the year, we continue to expect full-year capital expenditures in the range of $105 million to $115 million, a significant reduction over elevated 2015 levels. Cash realignment expenditures are expected in the range of approximately $125 million to $150 million for the full year. Scheduled debt payments for the remainder of the year are $30 million and we also plan to continue contributing to our pension plans to cover service costs, even as the US plan remains largely fully funded.", "With that review, let me turn the call back to Jay.", "John Roueche", "Thanks, Karyn. Operator, we have concluded our prepared remarks and would now like to begin the question-and-answer period.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Halloran from Robert Baird.", "Michael Halloran", "First on the IPD margins, obviously a couple quarters in a row here of some challenges there, how does that cadence look through the back half of the year? What were the pressure points in the first quarter and second quarter here? And do those start diving off a little bit when you get to the back half and how should we think about the progression?", "Mark Blinn", "A couple of things; three things to think about in that business. One, it's in transition from a realignment standpoint. We talked about one of the facilities that was closed in the first quarter. And also in the transition as we take costs out during the course of this year from the SIHI acquisition a year ago and then finally its transition over to more of the industrial and the commercial approach. It's working through that, and what you see is it's not getting fixed cost leverage because the outflows of the project oil and gas year over year.", "So when we look at that business, we know it's going to be challenged from a margin standpoint during the course of the year, but we expect to get realignment costs and the SIHI costs out toward the back half of the year and then continue to drive and get the fixed cost leverage in the business. We think we can get the margins back up in this business to good levels, but it will be much more of an industrial type business at that point in time.", "Michael Halloran", "So basically modest progression in the back half of the year and then more meaningful as the cost savings take over?", "Mark Blinn", "Yes.", "Michael Halloran", "And the second question just on the downstream spending outlook, a lot of conflicting thoughts there, right. On one hand you are seeing some stability emerge in the aftermarket, slight uptick in some of these larger turnarounds and obviously there's been a lot of deferrals that need to get vetted out at some point. On the other hand, you see crack spreads that are struggling a little bit right now. There's a lot of inventory and there's concerns about what the majors are going to do with their spending. How are you thinking about the downstream environment going forward next two to five quarters range and all those competing things that meld together?", "Mark Blinn", "Well, that's just it, I think you identified there's a lot of competing information, so we've taken a conservative view on the downstream activity. Aftermarket has shown some resilience. Some of the small projects are needed to just maintain levels of efficiency. But when you start to get the projects, we definitely take a conservative view. And, Mike, that's why if you look at our restructuring activities, we've had this view for a while.", "I think when you've heard us talk we said we're going to take a lower for longer approach, conservative, aggressively restructure, particularly our custom engineered business, and then when the markets come back we'll get leverage from that. So we've taken a conservative approach. Most of the costs and a lot of the benefits are in the custom engineered design towards those downstream projects, and we do know they will come back at some point in time, but we will have a custom engineered business that will be more efficient than ever.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup.", "Andrew Kaplowitz", "Mark, so aftermarket awards in 2Q are on an absolute level; we're back to levels of the first three quarters of last year, actually, before oil and gas spending really fell off a cliff. So do you think they just level off here for a while, given still the uncertainty in the markets or could they start to move higher from here? You talked about potential for a refinery, turnarounds picking up, or simply maybe customers who previously deferred spend now actually spending, so what do you think from here?", "Mark Blinn", "A couple ways to look at it. I think from a market-driven standpoint \u2013 and one thing I want to make a point, a lot of our aftermarket opportunities are end-user strategies, where we go in and help people in any market improve the efficiency. We didn't see a lot of that last year because the reaction on the OpEx budgets was to constrain everything. But if you look at from a market-driven activity, I made the comment earlier we're in a rolling deferral period where you'll see an uptick there as if there's pressure that comes off the operating budgets. We don't see that over the short term. The market needs some stability.", "You look in the backdrop of what's occurred, the concern with the majors over having to cut their dividend has certainly abated, but they're still being fairly conservative. So from a market standpoint I think we'll continue to see the rolling deferral. But the opportunity for us is to continue to execute on our strategies, because the nice thing about installed base, it's permanent, it stays, and they're always looking for efficiency. And that's what we like relative to even what we saw in 2009. They're not shutting a lot of facilities.", "They are running them, and the one way you can improve your profitability is to make it more efficient. But I think from a market standpoint, we don't expect the budgets to snap back here short term. But we will continue to drive our end-user strategies. We saw a little bit of benefit of that in the second quarter.", "Andrew Kaplowitz", "Mark or Karyn, can you talk about how to think about EPD revenue moving forward? There are a couple puts and takes in the business obviously, stabilizing aftermarket we just talked about, but it's still weak projects business. So EPD revenue, it did turn down in the quarter, but you've got backlog down now over 20%. So should we think that EPD revenue could be down double digits at some point over the next few quarters before it starts to rebound?", "Mark Blinn", "Let me help kind of line out how to think about it. A big part of our aftermarket business is in that segment. And so you'll get the benefit from the market and the execution of the aftermarket strategies. Now, there's no escaping the fact that one of the biggest things that moved the needles is the projects. And I just want to make a distinction.", "While it moves the needle on revenue, keep in mind it doesn't move the needle as much on earnings, especially now as we start to restructure that custom engineered business, because if revenue goes down and you have a lot of under-absorption, it can impact your earnings. But as we start taking these costs out, keep in mind those projects are very competitive in good markets and bad, but it does tend to move the needle on revenues.", "So from our standpoint, until we see some project activity, we don't think that custom engineered business is going to see an uptick trend in its revenue, which is a component of the EPD business from a revenue standpoint. And again, that does move the needle. If you look in the aftermarket, we're encouraged by what we see in stability and sequential and year-over-year increases, that is also our most profitable business and drives a substantial amount of earnings. So, think of it two ways. One in terms of revenues and earnings, also think a third component of what we're doing with the cost structure in that project-related revenue.", "Andrew Kaplowitz", "Karyn, one quick clarification, it looks like last quarter you were saying that you're going to get $125 million of savings in 2016 in total. Now, you're saying you're getting $125 million by the end of 2016, with $25 million of that in 2015. Is that a different forecast? It's just a bit confusing I think.", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Nothing's changed there in terms of outlook for spend as well as the savings for 2016. So year to date, the expense is $33 million and inception to date our expense is $150 million. So of the remaining $250 million to spend, about 50% of that will be in 2016. So 2016, we are expecting to have $100 million of incremental expense. So the total for 2016 will be $125 million.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets.", "Scott Graham", "Mark, if you could answer this question it would be helpful. You've got a backlog which gives you visibility. You've got a little bit more stability in the aftermarket and we are largely through the month of July. So we know where the bookings are laying out. Would you say at this point you are in the middle of your sales range for the full-year, maybe toward the weaker end of that or toward the better end of that?", "Mark Blinn", "Well, I think Karyn made in her comments, Scott, and that's going to indicate where we are in the range from your modeling is a lot of our activity has and does occur in the fourth quarter. So we still have a big ramp up in terms of sales, but you're right, it is in the backlog both in the aftermarket and the original equipment. But just to be clear, there is an element of revenue during the course of the year that is still yet to be booked into backlog and will need to be shipped out.", "Scott Graham", "I guess the genesis of that question is that it doesn't really look like the OE bookings improved at all in the second quarter, whereas my sense from the first quarter was that you had a bit of a bump up off of very weak levels early in the first quarter and that got better as the quarter progressed. That doesn't look like it happened this quarter. Is that a fair statement?", "Mark Blinn", "Now, I'm just trying to think of \u2013 we saw some OE bookings, a small project that came through in the second quarter, I think in just trying to understand your math a little bit here, Scott.", "Scott Graham", "Very simply if I'm putting your numbers incorrectly, which I think I am, OE bookings in the quarter were down 22; in the first quarter they were down 17. You did face a more difficult call it stacked two-year comp, but even considering that, the OE being weaker in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis than in the first quarter, stock comp let's say maybe equalizes that but...", "Mark Blinn", "I got it. Yes, it does. It does equalize it. We had a real tough comp in Q2. So I wouldn't look at the year-over-year comps first quarter to second quarter. It's probably better to look in terms of what's happening on a sequential basis as we build backlog, or as backlog gets depleted. We built some aftermarket backlog, but our OE backlog particularly our big project backlog has been running down. But we did have a real tough comp in Q2 of last year.", "Scott Graham", "Moving on to the backlog itself, the margin in the quarter was, as has been discussed, on the weaker side of things. I'm just wondering, I know you are really being steadfast in your discipline with bookings. The margin weakness let's say a little bit more than what we've seen certainly in the first half as well is more volume than anything that's coming out of the backlog that is really weak margin. Is that a fair statement? You know where I'm going with this, Mark.", "Mark Blinn", "I do.", "Scott Graham", "A few years ago the legacy margin \u2013 legacy backlog that stayed with us for a lot longer than we thought, that's not what this is, right?", "Mark Blinn", "No, it\u2019s not. What you're seeing is fixed cost leverage and it's mainly volume related. And it's the fact that, I think we made this point last time, particularly in the areas where we're taking costs out, we can't take it out as quickly as volume declined. The other thing, and I alluded to this in my comment, is in the margin business when you restructure a business and all the activity that's going on, think about it, we've got ultimately will impact 30% of our sites.", "You have sending and receiving sites; you have all types of activities that occur with that. That impacts your business negatively. That's why we want to get through this quickly because when you do that, you naturally get a lift because you don't have the distractions you have in the business. So when we look at our margin profile, we see and understand what's going on in IPD, that had an impact in terms of the integration of SIHI and the volume leverage as well. We also recognize in our custom engineered business that volumes have come down, but it takes a while to get those costs out of the business.", "And then generally broad-based a lot of our other costs, structural costs considering where they are take time to get out. You add onto that the fact that when you make these kind of changes, there are costs in the system that we don't call out necessarily in realignment or in our otherwise results that impact your business negatively. Anybody that goes through a major restructuring like this, and we're executing very well, has those knock on costs. We expect them, we deal with them and we know we'll get through them.", "Scott Graham", "That's fine and that's extremely helpful, and that dovetails into my third and last quick one, possibly more for Karyn. When are we more through that? When is that more in the rear view mirror? Some of those duplicate costs and some of the potentially lost revenues, is that not until first quarter of next year?", "Karyn Ovelmen", "As we've indicated, 2016 is the year of major shifts that we have from a manufacturing footprint perspective, so heading into the end of 2016, as well as the beginning of 2017. So it's really coming out of the latter part of 2017 when we'll start to have the sending sites have shut down. We'll start to see any losses are under absorption or inventory carry there. So it's really more towards the latter part of 2017.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chase Jacobson from William Blair.", "Chase Jacobson", "I wanted to follow up again on the OE bookings and revenue dynamic. The OE bookings have been declining pretty steadily. I know you're coming off a tougher comp from 2014, but in total they've been coming down at a double-digit rate now for six quarters in a row. And this was the first quarter where we really saw the OE revenue decline pick up to double digits. Is that OE revenue decline going to get worse as we go over the next few quarters, just given how soft the bookings have been?", "Mark Blinn", "Chase, we don't break out guidance by OE and aftermarket. But what you can do is look at our guidance for the year, and you can see what stability we've had in the aftermarket business and make your own assumptions about that. But you can see \u2013 and then also the run rate business, it would tend to be more stable. And then on the margin what will impact revenue is going to be the project business. And that's what you're really seeing in terms of the revenue declines. It's primarily driven by projects that were booked in 2014 and there was good project activity there.", "It wasn't necessarily at a very, very high price, but it was an okay market at that point in time. Those are rolling through backlog. That's also going to be the pacing item for taking the costs out of our custom engineered business, because when a plant is full with backlog, you don't want to start restructuring the facility. So what that reduction in backlog does allow us to do that you can't see at this point because we're still executing on it is taking those costs out of that business.", "Chase Jacobson", "And on the pricing, we've been hearing some mixed things I think from some of the other flow control companies over the last couple weeks, some talking about the tough pricing in oil and gas spreading into other markets like power and some talking about companies actually becoming more disciplined and the pricing stabilizing. I'd like to get your updated thoughts on the overall pricing environment in your industries?", "Mark Blinn", "Power has always been competitive. That's new not new news at all. It's always been a competitive business. Definitely on the project opportunities it\u2019s competitive, but I can tell you that the market and the peers out there have been relatively disciplined, certainly relative to what we saw in 2010 and 2011. So there's been discipline out there and we assume a competitive environment, and that's why we go after the costs and actually increase some of our resources on the supply chain side, but no rational competitors out there at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.", "Joe Ritchie", "So I guess my first question, I fully recognize it's probably early to ask this question, we've got another five months left in the year, but maybe as we think through 2017, Mark, at this point what are your planning assumptions for growth? Do you think that you guys can grow in 2017? And the reason I'm asking the question is really because I'm trying to get a sense for how to really think about your margin trajectory for 2017.", "Mark Blinn", "Again, I'll go back to my statement. Remember projects are not as profitable on the margin side, especially if you don't take the costs out the business. The way we look going forward is we want to continue to execute on our commercial strategies, and we think we have growth in that.", "A lot of that is our OE run rate business, that's IPD. Look, you saw some traction in this quarter on IPD. That came as expected, actually a little bit earlier than we expected, also growth in our aftermarket business. Those are two contributors to our earnings and margins significant going into 2017. Then a lot of it will depend on how bookings come in in the second half of the year, both on those and any project activities.", "We're not seeing or expecting or planning for a lot of big projects to come back here over the short term. We think the market needs to see some stability. If they do, they might start ordering some of the long lead time items in these large projects. But I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that we'd see that in our order book this year. Could materialize next year and to the extent there is percentage of completion on them, we can take them into revenue, but that really depends on when we start to see them.", "Joe Ritchie", "And then maybe you touched on the aftermarket piece, it's nice to see the sequential trend the last two quarters. Based on what you're hearing from refineries today, somebody mentioned earlier there's a bunch of puts and takes, is $480 million the right run rate moving forward or do you still expect there to be some lumpiness in the trajectory of those orders over the next few quarters?", "Mark Blinn", "Well, a small amount will move the needle on a percentage basis. It doesn't take much in terms of our compares, but generally what we saw in the first quarter was a base level, which we were very pleased with, some stabilization. And I think one of the things just to understand our business, if you look at over the course of many years, even at the last downturn, our aftermarket bookings base resilient level are higher than they were before. The reason for that is this primarily, executing our end-user strategies, getting more penetration into customers\u2019 facilities, more share of their wallet. We will continue to focus on that to drive what we'd see as self help growth in this business despite whatever market conditions can be.", "Joe Ritchie", "And maybe one last one for Karyn, can you talk about the free cash flow dynamics a little bit? I know that you're more second half weighted, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that you expected to be more 4Q weighted as well and fully recognize during this transition that you have some elevated inventory levels. Can you talk us through how to think about normalized cash for you guys and when does that start to normalize, is it a 2017 phenomenon?", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Through the end of 2016, we should see some liquidation through the year, but however as you mentioned that should be potentially offset with some of the build up from realignment. So as we're transitioning through realignment, we have the potential there to have elevated inventories through 2016 as well as 2017. From a receivable perspective, we have seen some delays, in particular in Latin America. We've got full disclosure in our Q there regarding particular inventories that we're looking at and so we'll continue to work through those.", "Inventory, of course, is going to be reflective not only of the realignment, because it's very important as we go through the transition to ensure quality service on time to our customers during the transition. But in terms of executing our strategies, there's other strategic initiatives that could potentially result in carrying additional inventory. But of course those also result in higher margins. But we'll continue to work through that, we continue to see some delays with customers as they push out taking delivery. So market conditions are also playing there a bit.", "But as we go through the realignment, the expectation is that with reduction in the sites by definition we'll have more optimized product management, more optimized supply chain and of course more optimization in terms of our inventory turns. Once we get through that realignment, we'll then really start to look at it from an enterprise-level overall from our receivables, payables and inventory from enterprise [standardized] processes and going through that project to really focus on fine-tuning the metrics in the targets there. But key right now is to get through the realignment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Charley Brady from SunTrust.", "Charley Brady", "Just a question on the commentary in the prepared remarks or maybe it was the Q&A, the amount of revenues that are being delayed or held up by the transitory activities of realignment and restructuring and moving stuff around, can you quantify the magnitude of what that revenue is in the pipeline but just can't get out the door because of various realignment activities?", "Mark Blinn", "No, we really haven't quantified. We want to just comment generally to help folks understand what happens when you realign a business, because you're moving product, you're shutting down a facility, you typically have employees in production at the sending facility and the receiving facility. All kinds of things can occur where it gets held up in the system. You work with your customers on this. Fortunately, because of our strong execution historically and the lead times, we're not a bottleneck in a product right now. As a matter of fact, we still are the point where we try to deliver to customers and they're not ready for it.", "I think what we wanted to do is illustrate that there are costs, revenue, working capital associated with moving one plant to another location. These are not standard widgets that we make that you shut it down a facility and you just stand up the other one, you're moving project management, engineering capability, pattern capabilities, all type of things, know-how, employees to the receiving site, and then you've got to be able to stand it up and you overlap. It's kind of like when you integrate to or switch over a very complicated system, there's a lot of overlap that you need to have.", "Charley Brady", "I understand. I guess the point I was really driving to is understanding how much pent-up demand is in your internal channel that maybe is a headwind to the revenue growth this year or is in fact as you go through this, how much of that would get released this year versus having to drag it into 2017? I'm trying to get a sense from a down 7% to 14% revenue outlook for this year, the influence on that of just internal changes you're doing that's holding stuff up that otherwise would be flowing out the door.", "Mark Blinn", "That's fair. Let me try to answer it this way. It wouldn't move the needle on that guidance too much if it wasn't occurring. So I don't want to suggest it's anything really, really significant, but what's driving our revenue this year is primarily the market conditions offset by some of our strategic initiatives. As you've seen out there, it'd be a tougher revenue guide this year if we weren't executing on our aftermarket and run rate business initiatives.", "Charley Brady", "And switching gears, if I look at the guidance, the EPS guidance and square that with revenue guidance and drill that into margins, you look at EPD with aftermarket going to 70% plus of sales in that segment or bookings in that segment, which is unusually high for that business, how much of the mix shift \u2013 you get a positive margin mix shift on a higher aftermarket percentage, but you've got an absorption issue to offset that, if you look at the back half and you look at your backlog, particularly in EPD, how much does that mix shift to a very high percentage of aftermarket, presumably it's probably going to creep up a little bit more as you go into Q3, how much of that offsets the absorption issues you're having that can drive margins higher in the back half of the year?", "Mark Blinn", "The absorption issues are being addressed by the cost takeout. That's the primary thing that we're doing to address the absorption in the business. Now, to your point, what allowed us to be \u2013 have the confidence in our range is going to be the aftermarket business and the run rate business, which is more profitable. But what I'd tell you is there is some impact on the absorption from the other business besides the big project business, but most of it is going to be in the cost takeout.", "Charley Brady", "So the negative impact I guess as we go through the year on absorption is shrinking because of the internal realignment transformation stuff you're doing, correct?", "Mark Blinn", "That's right. And one point I think we made on the last one, when we looked at the beginning of 2014, and this is important, we had over $160 million of under-absorption within the four walls of our company. So, we're addressing what I'd say is under-absorption we came into this market and under-absorption caused by the environment that we're in. So there's a lot of opportunity there to take costs out.", "Charley Brady", "And just one more quick one, on the aftermarket side of the business, you talked about break/fix type business. Have you seen an acceleration of that or maybe the better question is has that break/fix mentality stabilized, it sounds from your comments like maybe that still has yet to happen?", "Mark Blinn", "Break/fix is not market driven, it's event driven. In other words, when you run a facility flat out and you're trying to capitalize on spreads, whatever you can generate in the revenue, break/fix tends to come in and you don't plan for it. We actually try to help our customers try to avoid it. But that is what happens when you defer maintenance.", "You don't go to standard takedown, scheduled takedown. You'll run into more break/fix, because these things are designed to run for a period of time, and if you think about it from a flow control item if one of those goes down then basically it impacts the operation of your facility.", "Charley Brady", "That's the point I was trying to get to is are you seeing an acceleration or pick up in break/fix because in fact the customers are pushing stuff out to the very limit that it can get to and sometimes it breaks sooner than they thought it was going to.", "Mark Blinn", "We're seeing it as a result of the deferrals. We're in a rolling deferral, so we'll see if they get back onto a schedule and stay ahead. But if they push it out, then you'll see more break/fix activity.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel.", "Nathan Jones", "Mark, if I could go back to APD and the margins for a minute, you talked about four big buckets for the margin issues that you're having there at the moment, which is absorption, increased expenses from the realignment, taking costs out of SIHI and the transition to industrial. And you also talked about the realignment taking out some of those absorption issues. So all of those four impacts should be relatively transitory. All of this stuff is planned to be finished by the end of 2017. If we held everything else constant, where do you think the margins in IPD should be in that timeframe in say 18 months once all of this stuff is behind you?", "Mark Blinn", "I made the comment earlier about two things. One, in IPD we think we can get it back to where the margins were before and even improving, because it will be a different business. It will be less of what I'd say the big projects; it will have fewer of those in there and more on the industrial side. It's going to take some work.", "I think the other thing is I commented earlier on our custom engineered business, which is primarily within EPD, plans we put in place starting in 2014 and have continued to execute are really to designed to make that more efficient than it's ever been. So when you look at two of our important components of our business, these are really designed when we get through it to make them as efficient as ever or more efficient.", "Nathan Jones", "So given that and given where the margins were, is it an unreasonable expectation to think that margins in that segment by the end of 2017 are going to be double digit to low teens?", "Mark Blinn", "I mean if I execute well and we can drive that, we'll need some top line. That's going to be important. You've got to give me the top line variable, but if we can have some market support and execute on the strategies then we can drive the margin improvement to that level. But there is going to be a fixed cost leverage component to that business.", "Nathan Jones", "On a little bit of a more positive note, you talked about getting some traction on some of the growth initiatives, the long-term agreements on the aftermarket picking up. Can you talk about some of those things that are going to have a more enduring benefit to the company rather than just talking about the cyclical pressures that we're under now?", "Mark Blinn", "A couple of things. We've seen improvement in our distribution channel. In the aggregate, it's actually gone up slightly, but that's with a fairly significant decline year over year in North America. Where we're seeing the benefits, believe it or not, are in Latin America as we bring new distributors on, rationalize some of our distribution, improvement in Europe, and looking over the horizon at Asia as well.", "Another one is just on our general commercial strategies, we haven't gone into a lot of detail, but how we've lined up our sales organization \u2013 we've always been very good at pursuing projects and I think we'll always be very good. We've got a great team doing that. But where we really invest a lot of time and effort is getting more share of the wallet, more around our channels to market, e-commerce and we're seeing traction there. It's very early days there is what I would say.", "So those are some positives we certainly see. As we move this business, we're always going to have the project side of our business. We like that installed base, but increasingly and to the credit of bringing the folks in from SIHI, we've learned a lot around how profitable that business can be and how we can grow it. So early stages there on the project business, we've always been fairly solid. It's really about being more efficient, and on the aftermarket it's continue to drive our end-user strategies.", "Nathan Jones", "And then on SIHI, I think one of the attractive parts of that business was going to be able to leverage your global sales force to more deeply penetrate markets with their products. Can you talk about how successful that's been, and also any color you can give on leveraging your aftermarket network to capture more of their aftermarket business?", "Mark Blinn", "I would say we've been slower to leverage our sales force and our aftermarket for all the right reasons. They have a really solid, capable channel to market in terms of e-commerce and sales approach that we're actually adopting in our organization. So we've gotten a benefit from that. And we have yet to really scale it globally the way we need to, both on the original equipment and on the aftermarket.", "It's delivered good solid aftermarket, but it's still \u2013 would say it's still fairly European-centric. But what we've done is we've been able to \u2013 really the improvement was taking what they had and leveraging it across our organization. So the better opportunities are still ahead of us with that, what I'd say, market and commercial opportunity in SIHI.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.", "Andrew Obin", "Just a question, you talked about your own restructuring process, and the way I see it's more focused on taking overhead out of the system versus the capacity. As we think about the industry, do you think any actual capacity is being taken out versus just overhead?", "Mark Blinn", "Absolutely, we're taking it out. We're going to take out about 30% of our facilities. A significant amount of the spend particularly in the custom engineered is capacity takeout.", "Andrew Obin", "But the way I think about it, isn't the plan that you're going to take out the manufacturing footprint but you put in more value streams in existing facilities, it's not like you're not going to be able to manufacture, you're just going to be able to manufacture with less overhead, right?", "Mark Blinn", "You're going to be able to manufacture in over less square footage over more efficient machines. We're going to actually leverage \u2013 in part of this we're moving some of the sub-manufacturing on non-critical items to suppliers as well. So we're pushing literally some of the manufacturers to third-party, but the key is there will be less square footage, much more efficiency. Now, if your question is are we going to get better fixed cost leverage, yes, but the biggest component of fixed cost leverage overheads, call it SG&A, is going to be volume related.", "Andrew Obin", "I don't think I'm making myself clear. People actually shuttering capacity, do you think when the industry is done with the restructuring, the ability to manufacture number of units is going to be the same or increased, or do you think the industry as a whole will be able to make less stuff? That's what I mean, because you will have your capacity. You'll still be able to deliver all the same products to your customers, just at a much better cost structure.", "Mark Blinn", "Got it. In terms of our ability to address the market, I can't speak for others in general, although I do know capacity is getting taken out. But I can tell you our approach is we actually will be able to deal with more volume. Why? Well, when you have a very efficient facility believe it or not they actually can crank out more volume, less under-absorption, it cranks out more volume, more automated machinery, leveraging third-party suppliers. So we have no concerns about being able to address industry demand at all.", "Andrew Obin", "Let me ask another question, what are you hearing from your customers about their access to capital, right, because I think last year people were clearly capital constrained because they had debt obligations, they had dividend obligations. This year it seems they are generating more cash. They've cut costs. What are you hearing about their ability to access capital? What are you hearing about their ability to go to banks and access capital? Are things getting better?", "Mark Blinn", "Well, yes. In general they absolutely are. Keep in mind a lot of our customers are big brand names and have plenty of access to capital. I think what we are seeing is that some view of stabilization, although as I mentioned earlier we need oil to be stabilized for a couple of more quarters here, but generally no concern over access to capital. What you did see was the marginal ones that we dealt with were impacted last year.", "There are some regional elements as you look around the world; parts of Latin America are definitely very challenged, but that's been the case for a period of time. We see that in \u2013 Brazil has certainly been impacted for a period of time. But a lot of the large ones around the world are well-capitalized.", "When you look at the industry in general, as you well know, a lot of them went over the last couple of quarters and secured their balance sheets. Typically if we have exposure to those folks, we would have had a letter of credit anyway, but it is good for the industry that they were able to go out and either sell some of their reserves forward or issue some equity and they did, or else also go out and raise debt. That was good for the industry, because in February there was a deal of concern, not saying that they're necessarily out of the woods, but certainly the industry is in better shape than it was four months ago.", "Andrew Obin", "And just last question if I have time on M&A, do you think there is opportunity to pick up some assets in this environment for you guys to be a consolidator or are you just too busy with internal stuff?", "Mark Blinn", "Well, make no mistake, our restructuring and realignment is an absolute priority. It is a $400 million acquisition that will yield $230 million of benefits. No acquisition can ever compare to that. Having said that, what we have seen is valuations have normalized some and we just need to be disciplined and opportunistic out there as we look at opportunities. But our priority is going to be the realignment, absolutely. But we'll weigh any opportunity against what our priorities are and we've got really good teams and people here that can do many things and do them well.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna Financial.", "Robert Barry", "It sounds like pricing has stabilized a bit, but I'm curious to what extent you think the P&L in the quarter is still reflecting bookings that were made under more favorable pricing? And where I'm going is I'm just curious how close you think gross margin down 150 basis points in the first half is versus where we'll end up bottoming there if pricing is actually stabilizing?", "Mark Blinn", "It's still a competitive pricing environment, Robert, especially on the projects. I don't think there was a lot of 2014 pricing in our revenue in the second quarter, so we're sitting pretty much reflective of market conditions since the downturn right now in our P&L. We are where we are in terms of where the pricing environment, no big uptick, no big downtick in the pricing. It's competitive on the projects, so that's going to be project by project, the backlog that we had is pretty much rolled through. So really the margin profile going forward is going to be around the cost takeout.", "And again, I'll mention just where a lot of these costs are, it takes time to get them out of the business. Also mix, one of the things with less project activity, assuming that it doesn't impact absorption as much is that you get more favorable mix. That's why we need to take the costs out, particularly on the custom engineered side and then what we can do on executing on our run rate strategies.", "Robert Barry", "[indiscernible] guess on where we might bottom out on gross margin?", "Mark Blinn", "We don't want to guide on that because anything can impact gross margins in any one general quarter. And where the volumes too, Robert, that's going to be an issue as well. So don't want to guide specifically on those, but a lot of our actions are designed towards enhancing our gross margins and getting the fixed cost leverage across SG&A.", "Robert Barry", "Just a quick follow up on the aftermarket and these life cycle agreements, I'm just curious whether they are a significant part of the aftermarket bookings? And where I'm going is just whether these LCAs are impacting the pace at which we think or should think about the aftermarket bookings reading out into the P&L?", "Mark Blinn", "They\u2019re still relatively small, but consistent. Historically a lot of them were in our seal business, but increasingly we're seeing them a little broader based. It's still relatively small and the point I want to make is we have to go out and earn our aftermarket every day in this business.", "But what we did see is there are benefits in the environments that we're in, believe it or not. And that is one that customers want to tend to make sure in this environment they go with very, very solid suppliers, suppliers that can deliver on time and a good quality product, can meet the engineering specs.", "Another thing that's important is they're looking for cost efficiencies as well. Part of the value proposition in the lifecycle agreement is going in and saying, look, we'll work with you because we do this all the time in terms of managing your costs down over a multi-year period. So they're looking for more value and we're certainly in the position where we can deliver it to them. That's really the benefit we've seen in this environment because it goes directly to their operating budgets, it gives them visibility and it gives them more efficiency.", "Robert Barry", "How does the accounting work if you book a multi-year agreement? Do you book the whole value upfront in bookings and then it reads out through the P&L?", "Mark Blinn", "No. You recognize the revenues as you deliver the product as you get paid. So there's nothing up front.", "Andrew Obin", "From a bookings perspective, though, how much...", "Mark Blinn", "You book it as order.", "Andrew Obin", "The full value of the...", "Mark Blinn", "Yes, you don't book everything up front.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from John Walsh from Vertical Research.", "John Walsh", "Thanks for fitting me in here after the hour. I wanted to ask a question about the cash expenditures for the restructuring actions into next year, so is there a range you can provide, the $200 million to $225 million of cash spending, how to think about that over 2017 and 2018?", "Karyn Ovelmen", "So basically from the actual expense going out into 2017, basically you should be looking at it in the concept of approximately $160 million for 2016. Incremental to that will be in 2017 approximately $90 million for a full spend in 2018 of approximately $400 million.", "John Walsh", "And then just thinking about the deltas, I know there was a little bit in the earlier answer, but deltas around debt reduction payments, pensions, some of those items you called out on that slide as we think about 2017, the deltas if any of those become tailwinds or further headwinds?", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Going forward, currently we are paying about $15 million a quarter in terms of paying down debt, so about $60 million annually. And 2017 will be consistent with that on the debt payments.", "Operator"], "Symbol": "Flowserve Corporation (NYSE:", "Period": "Q22016", "Month": "07", "Year": "2016", "Date": "2016-07-29", "Target": 1},

Let me begin by reviewing some of the key headlines from the third quarter, which we will cover in greater detail as the call continues. First, on the positive side, we are pleased to achieve a book-to-bill greater than one for the first time in over a year. This is a particularly positive development, given that our customers continue training cautious and deliberate with their budgets and spending patterns. As a result of these bookings, our backlog grew modestly and higher-margin aftermarket bookings now represent over 30% of our work under contract for the first time. We are also seeing some early signs of pre-feed and feed opportunities building in the pipeline.", "We are particularly pleased with the bookings' resiliency and performance of our aftermarket franchise throughout 2016, producing modest constant currency bookings growth for the year. We continue to make significant progress on our ongoing realignment program, which will drive cost out of our platform and position Flowserve to enhance profitability as a leaner and more efficient Company. Finally, while our third-quarter earnings were lower than expected, the Company continues to be well-positioned and we are actively pursuing opportunities for further improvement as we execute on our cost reduction initiatives and long-term strategic growth opportunities.", "With regard to market and Company-specific challenges this quarter, we continue to experience challenging global macro conditions. And, as I noted earlier, our customers have remained cautious and deliberate in their investment decisions. Reflecting this environment, project delays, rolling maintenance deferrals, and extended timelines for both order placement and delivery acceptance have become the norm. We were particularly surprised in September with the slow pace of industrial short cycle and aftermarket revenues, but the good news is these orders remain largely in backlog and we expect to deliver on them in future periods. There's also additional political uncertainty in many regions around the world, including the United States.", "We continue to see some operational and cost issues in our receiving sites as we shift manufacturing and implement our structural realignment program. However, we are actively addressing these issues. While we are pleased with the progress in our aftermarket bookings, the lower backlog associated with our OE facilities will increase under absorption in the short run, which occurs faster than we can realign or take costs out. As we execute and complete our realignment plans, our new cost structure should catch up to the current workload and alleviate this timing issue and position Flowserve when the cycle improves.", "Finally, we incurred some significant non-cash reserves during the quarter related to Latin America. As we have previously discussed, this region has been, and remains, challenged. While we have collected about $5.5 million year to date and will continue to actively pursue collections on these accounts, which are not dispute, we believe that fully reserving for certain receivables balances and work in process is the most prudent course of action.", "On an adjusted basis, EPS this quarter was $0.52. While we indicated on our last call that we expected this quarter to be light due to the timing of shipments, given the magnitude of this impact, along with the continuation of challenging market conditions, we are revising our full-year guidance. Karen will cover our financials in more detail, but operationally we will continue to focus on a disciplined approach, cost management and improving our efficiency across the business and addressing all of these with a sense of urgency.", "Despite the challenges this quarter, it is important to note that we have successfully navigated previous cycles and are actively leveraging this experience as we manage our business through the current market environment. Further, I am confident that our current strategic direction and ongoing cost reduction initiatives will position Flowserve competitively for the eventual recovery in our energy end markets.", "Our primary near-term challenge remains transforming our manufacturing platform quickly enough to reduce under absorption, while enhancing our operational flexibility to meet customer expectations of better value for their investment dollar. This situation particularly impacts EPD and IPD in the near-term, as pump OE backlog continued to decline during the period. With the recent operating issues and financial performance in our IPD segment, I have asked Tom Pajonas to assume interim leadership of the segment's day-to-day operations. Tom was instrumental in turning FCD into the stronger performer it is today and I am confident he will drive the necessary actions and accountabilities to improve the business.", "Key initiatives include accelerating the pace and execution of the realignment program and embedding sustainable process improvements to drive differentiated value for our customers, such as reduced lead times, automated order process through e-commerce, enhanced supply chain management and improving on-time deliveries. Ultimately, we are driving towards an operating platform and culture in IPD similar to that of our FCD segment. I have complete confidence Tom will improve IPD's performance with time.", "Next, I'd like to update you on the significant progress we're making as we execute our realignment program. Though we continue to have some operational issues in some of our receiving sites, we are continuing to focus on the structural transformation of our business platform. During the third quarter, we initiated actions to close two additional manufacturing facilities, including an Australian IPD facility which will be consolidated into another Flowserve site in that country and we are transferring EPD's Lawrence operations based in Massachusetts to other US and Latin American facilities.", "During the fourth quarter, we plan to address additional manufacturing sites, including recently announced initiatives to close a German manufacturing facility and the consolidation of Middle East QRCs. We continue to expect about $160 million in charges for the year. From a savings perspective, we delivered approximately $37 million in the third quarter, $80 million year to date, and importantly, we remain on track to deliver $100 million of incremental savings for the full year of 2016.", "While we identify most realignment costs incurred for your analysis, I'll remind you that our reported and adjusted numbers do not include the expected negative impact on revenues and profits that have been delayed during the transition, which should materialize as receiving sites come up to speed on the new lines. We are improving our manufacturing transitions with dedicated resources and teams to minimize bottlenecks and implement processes to apply lessons learned from completed actions as we continue to execute on our realignment program.", "Turning to our markets and bookings within our served industries, overall we believe the relative stability of oil around the $45 to $50 range over the past six months has been a positive development for many of our customers. Nevertheless, we still anticipate that our customers will remain cautious with their capital and operating budgets in the near term. Considering the multi-year nature of infrastructure original equipment investment, it will likely require several quarters of this level of stability before investment spending actively resumes and we expect the opportunities that arise will be competitive.", "Overall for the quarter, constant currency bookings declined approximately 7%, primarily due to an OE bookings decline of approximately 11%. As expected, aftermarket bookings continue to demonstrate resiliency, but did decline approximately 2% this quarter. While aftermarket bookings have increased constant currency year to date, third-quarter aftermarket sales saw a sharp drop-off sequentially during the quarter. We believe this is just a timing issue, as it is rare for aftermarket orders to cancel and was mainly because our first-half 2016 bookings included a few upgrade projects that will not ship until 2017. Additionally, some customers have been slow to accept shipments, but we do continue to see elevated levels of emergency response aftermarket opportunities. While pricing pressure has been a significant issue on larger CapEx driven greenfield and brownfield projects, we are pleased that we've maintained fairly consistent pricing levels in our aftermarket bookings.", "Turning now to specific end markets and looking at bookings on a constant currency basis coming off a low base. Bookings in our largest served market, oil and gas, increased 10% in the quarter. European orders and an ebulliator job for Asia were key drivers of this growth. While we are pleased with this improved level of bookings, we are certainly not calling a bottom yet. However, we do view our downstream and midstream focus as a long-term asset for the Company. Power bookings decreased approximately 21% on a tough prior-year compare. Going forward, we expect steady combined cycle investment in North America and fossil projects in Asia, which tend to be very competitive.", "China continues to invest in nuclear, where we participate in both the Western and Chinese designs. In our general industries, constant currency bookings decreased approximately 4%. The distribution channel remained depressed in the quarter. While we continue to believe destocking across many of our distributors is largely complete, distributors overall are maintaining lower inventory levels, placing smaller orders, often only when they have a customer order in hand, so a quick response time will be a priority for us.", "Chemical bookings were down 18% in the quarter, with low levels of new project releases. We continue to see delays in the expected ethylene driven derivative plants, as well as the second wave of crackers, but we expect this development to progress in North America and the Middle East, supported by low cost feedstock.", "To summarize the quarter, we remain focused on rapidly transforming our cost structure for these uncertain markets, while positioning Flowserve for enhanced growth and profitability. We've seen cycles before and fully expect our markets will recover. Importantly, we are confident that our investments to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of our global operating platform will lead us through current challenges and enhance the value that Flowserve can deliver to our customers and shareholders.", "Finishing up on a personal note, as most of you know about, a month ago we announced my intention to retire from the Company at the end of March 2017. After over a decade at Flowserve and as the Company begins its next phase of growth and development, now is the right time for the Company and me to begin this transition process. I am confident that Flowserve has the right strategic plans and the right team in place to achieve our objectives. Flowserve is a great Company, with a solid operating and financial foundation and is on the right path forward. Importantly, until the Board names my successor, it remains business as usual and I remain fully committed to the success of the Company, our employees and shareholders. ", "With that, let me turn the call over to Karen.", "Karyn Ovelmen", "Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our 2016 third-quarter financials. As Mark noted, our operating results were primarily impacted the continued challenging market environment and various associated factors, including Latin America, our realignment initiatives and our performance of the OE business, which I will detail. Third-quarter adjusted EPS of $0.52 excludes $0.47 of non-cash charges related to the Latin American activity, including a $63.2 million charge to reserves certain undisputed accounts receivable, which we will continue to pursue and a $15.9 million charge to reserve for inventory exposures in the region. Additionally, adjustments include $0.21 per share of realignment expense, $0.01 associated with SIHI purchase price adjustments and integration charges and a gain of $0.01 on below-the-line FX. ", "Reported loss per share for the quarter was $0.16, which included an above-the-line negative currency translation headwind of approximately $0.02 in both reported and adjusted EPS.", "Q3 revenues of $943 million decreased 14%, or 12.1% constant currency. Year to date, Flowserve's constant currency revenues decreased 8.2% compared to 2015 levels. Regionally and a constant currency basis, North America was roughly flat, while the Middle East and Africa, Europe and Asia PAC were down low- to mid-teens. Latin America remains our most challenging region, with a decline of nearly 39%.", "Adjusted SG&A expenses declined 10% in the third quarter but remained elevated as a percent of sales, due primarily to the decline in revenues and the timing of expected realignment savings from our ongoing realignment program and our paced approach to SIHI cost reduction. Additionally, we have continued to invest in aftermarket and distribution initiatives as we focus on long-term growth in the business.", "Turning to margins, third-quarter adjusted gross margins decreased 350 basis points to 32.4% versus prior year and excluded $15.9 million of non-cash charges related to our Latin American activity and realignment charges of $24.5 million. Reported gross margins were 28.1%, negatively impacted by increased under absorption on our volumes, the adjusted items and further challenged by shipments that reflected the pricing environment booked over the last year and a half. ", "Adjusted operating margin of 11.7% excludes non-cash Latin American charges, $79.1 million, $31.5 million of realignment and $2.6 million of SIHI charges, partially offset by realignment savings and lower compensation expense. Both gross and adjusted margins benefit in the quarter due to lower variable incentive compensations in the 2016 quarter as compared to a year ago. In total, we had over 100 basis point operating margin tailwind year over year during the third quarter as a result of this line item. On a year-to-date basis, however, variable incentive comp is, and is currently expected to remain, a slight headwind to our results. ", "Our third-quarter adjusted tax rate of 29.3% was slightly below our full-year guidance rate of 30% to 31%, due primarily to the jurisdictions where earnings occurred.", "Turning to our bookings, constant currency original equipment bookings declined 11.4%, while our aftermarket franchise remained relatively stable, down 2.1% over the prior year, but still showed modest growth year to date. From a regional perspective, Europe and Latin America constant currency bookings increased 7.9% and 7%, respectively. North America was down 6.4% while Asia-Pacific and the Middle East and Africa were down in the mid-teens.", "Shifting to our realignment program, we realized approximately $37 million of savings in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $80 million. With our continued progress this quarter, we remain on track to achieve our goal of incremental savings of approximately $100 million in 2016. We expensed $37 million in the third quarter related to these efforts, bringing the first nine months 2016 total expense to approximately $70 million and we continue to expect total program savings of $230 million at a total program cost of $400 million. We further expect total 2016 cost of $160 million.", "We continue to strive for efficiency in our investments and as we progress our efforts, we will continue to assess individual projects within the program to adjust or replace initiatives within the framework to which we have been externally guiding. We continue to estimate total savings of $195 million in 2017, which is $70 million incremental to total 2016 program savings of $125 million. In 2018, the full annualized program savings are expected at $230 million.", "Turning to cash flow, through September 30, 2016, operating cash flow is down about $73 million versus a year ago, primarily due to decreased earnings, partially offset by working capital improvement. In the third quarter we returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends while our realignment program used approximately $30 million of cash. As many of you know, the fourth quarter typically accounts for a substantial portion of the year's operating cash flow and we expect this seasonal trend to occur again in 2016.", "Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of the year, based on our first nine months 2016 results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we have updated our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance to $2.05 per share to $2.25 per share. Unexpected revenue declines of 11% to 14%, including a 2% currency headwind, or roughly $0.10 per share, of above-the-line impact. Guidance further assumes net interest expense in the low to mid $16 million, a tax rate of 30% to 31% and reduced variable compensation expense.", "As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance includes the operational performance of our 2015 SIHI acquisition and excludes realignment expenses. In addition, the Latin American non-cash charges recorded in the third quarter, SIHI purchase price accounting and integration costs, below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of other potential discrete items, are also excluded.", "Moving on to cash uses for the year, we continue to expect full-year capital expenditures in the range of $105 million to $115 million, a significant reduction over elevated 2015 levels. Cash realignment expenditures are expected in the range of approximately $125 million to $150 million for the full year. We have $15 million in scheduled debt payments in the fourth quarter, bringing the full-year debt reduction total to $60 million. We contributed $20 million to our fully funded US pension plan through the first nine months of the year and we anticipate no further contributions in the fourth quarter. ", "With that overview, let me turn the call back to Jay.", "Jay Roueche", "Thanks, Karen. Operator, we have concluded our prepared remarks and would now like to begin the question-and-answer period.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Charlie Brady from SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead.", "Charlie Brady", "Thanks, good morning. A couple questions really on the realignment program. First, you talked about accelerating some of the efforts that are going on there and I guess my question really is, there's currently some inefficiencies going on with the realignment and moving factories from one place to another. Does accelerating this program in your mind increase in operational risk, or what are you doing to mitigate that? And I guess my second question related to that would be, you talked about the absorption, the realignment savings not really overtaking the absorption right now. Is there a time you can provide us when you think, kind of ballpark, when you think that switch over might happen when you kind -- I know it depends on the volumes, obviously, as you go into 2017, but maybe some idea in your mind of when you kind of get that crossover threshold to where you're making up for the absorption on the lower volumes", "Mark Blinn", "Let me start with the latter one. A lot of the absorption issues are going to be in our large custom engineered facilities and those are also the ones that take time to effect the realignment primarily, Charlie, because you have backlog that you need to work off. You need to carefully transfer those product because they're very highly engineered. There's a whole skillset that needs to move, a lot of capabilities. So we anticipate a lot of those benefits from the custom engineer to come through next year and this was anticipated at all times as we worked off the backlog. So we expect that efficiency to start or to work its way through in 2017 and that will help offset because a lot of the backlog decrease that you're seeing is in these large projects. So it works somewhat in parallel as we work off that backlog and that's primarily what you've seen in our bookings decline. Those costs start coming out of the business.", "To your first question, I think the general comments were, you always plan for some inefficiencies when you're moving product. It\u2019s not like moving simple-widget manufacturing. There's a lot of know-how. There's product movement. There's a lot of planning that goes into it, so there is going to be some slippage. It is not insignificant, but you plan for it. In fairness, and I think we've been very upfront, in the IPD segment, we've seen more than we anticipated and in what that does is that impacts a couple of things. It will impact results. It will also impact bookings as well, because if a plant isn't operating efficiently, you can't book into it. In my comments earlier, that's why I said Tom has taken over. Your question is, what\u2019s the answer? And it's proven in the past it's Tom. He's assumed the responsibility for that and getting these things resolved and I'm confident that he well. But clearly, in general realignment is going as planned, but we\u2019ve seen some impact beyond what we anticipated, not insignificant, in the IPD segment and we will fix it.", "Q \u2013 Charlie Brady \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thanks, Mark.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Scott Graham", "Good morning, all. Mark, first of all let me congratulate you openly on your retirement. On your watch this has become a much better Company. While that's not reading through now, I have no doubt that will when the end markets improve. I only wish you\u2019re exiting at a time when the operating environment was better, so congratulations.", "Mark Blinn", "Thank you, Scott. I appreciate it.", "Scott Graham", "I have two question for you guys. The first one is about pricing and particularly given your comment, Mark, that even when things do get better, you expect some pretty competitive bidding out there, pricing is obviously down on a year-over-year basis. Would you expect it to continue to be down, maybe though by a lesser amount in 2017?", "Mark Blinn", "Well, let me separate this a little bit. On the big projects, until backlogs start to get full, I think you are going to see pricing pressure. Just remember in 2013 and 2014, factories weren't full in our industry, so you didn't have the kind of, near the 2007, 2008 time of pricing of environment that you had at that point in time. But if you look at these custom engineered facilities, our industry is taking capacity out. So what you'll see is that capacity that is remaining will become taxed quicker, but you need to start to see the pickup in the custom engineered and the large projects. As I talked about before, and in my comments, you see some early feed work that's being done, but as we commented before, we don't anticipate that that would come into our industry's bookings until the end of next year or 2018.", "Now, when you look at the other parts of our business, and this is why we talk about a lot e-commerce on-time delivering, a lot of pricing there is about being able to respond to the customer, because these aren't large, highly competitively bid type projects. This is about getting the product that the customer needs to him as quickly as they can and making it easy to do business with them. And so that's -- we see that as an opportunity. For example, I talked earlier about IPD. If we can respond and respond quicker, you can get price. You can not only get price, but you can get volume, so that represents an opportunity for us.", "And then in the aftermarket business, I think we commented, everybody's looking at their OpEx budgets. In this oil and gas, we're in the ninth quarter, so folks have gotten fairly focused on their OpEx budgets and continue to do that. But again, a lot of that is about being able to respond very, very quickly. So we've been pleased to see somewhat that there's been stability or reasonable fair stability in the pricing in the aftermarket business. So the way I'd look at it is, the projects, I think they are going to remain competitive until you start seeing some more robust bidding activity. Keep in mind that the industry capacity will be less than it was in 2014. And as to the other ones, I think a lot of the pricing is in our hands.", "Scott Graham", "That's a great answer, Mark. Thank you. The follow-up question is a simple. It's fourth quarter. The guidance assumes a lesser decline in operating margin than in the third quarter. My guess is that that's largely based on the ease of the comparison or is there something else that you would point to?", "Mark Blinn", "I think it\u2019s going to be volume. If you know, historically Q4 is our strongest quarter, so we get fix-cost leverage. I'm very pleased. If you look at our adjusted SG&A, we were below $200 million and we haven't seen levels of that in a number of years and a lot of that is some of the realignment, but I also I think just the cost containment efforts that we've pushed through our business. So a lot of that is going to be volume with fixed cost leverage and it permeates through the entire P&L, because of absorption issues and things alike. That's why.", "Scott Graham", "I got you. I did have one other question there and I forgot. I'm sorry.", "Mark Blinn", "Okay. We can follow up if you need it.", "Scott Graham", "That's fine. No problem. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Kaplowitz", "Good morning, guys. Mark, can you give us a little more color into your aftermarket sales in the quarter? If I look at aftermarket bookings, they stayed in the range of $450 million to $500 million, at least in the last couple years, but you mentioned that sales were low, took a step down. You talked about short cycle industrial weakening in September. How should we think about your aftermarket business moving forward? Can you quantify how much in sales were the delayed aftermarket shipments that won't ship until 2017? You see the aftermarket more stable. The bookings were flat. Are you concerned that the weaker sales number could continue for a while?", "Mark Blinn", "Well, there is a difference between the bookings and sales in the quarter. I think you've seen this in our industry, that there was a slowdown and for many unexpected, because you saw all the adjustments that occurred. But this is one of the lower aftermarket sales we've seen in a while. I wouldn't call it systemic at this point in time because in my comments you heard that we haven't seen large cancellations. I think there was just, it was a slow pace. If you look at the third quarter in our industry, there's a lot of vacation time in July and August and there needs to be a notable ramp up in September and we didn't see it. Now, we're certainly considering that in the guidance for the rest of the year, but we haven't fundamentally seen a structural change in our industry where people have no interest in taking any aftermarkets. Remember where those things go. So I think the bookings pace is still something to keep in mind, but in fairness we\u2019ll tell you, our aftermarket sales were low in the quarter.", "Andrew Kaplowitz", "Is October active like September or is it too early to tell?", "Mark Blinn", "It's too early to tell and even Q4, and again this is why we were cautious in our guidance, Q4, December is an important month as well. But Andrew, if you look at things with the election and all the things that are going on around the world, you can see why the world kind of took a pause in the third quarter, but we'll see how it comes out in the fourth quarter.", "Andrew Kaplowitz", "Got it. Okay. Mark, there's obviously a ton of moving pieces in your earnings, but maybe you can frame how to think about 2017 at this point. I know you don't want to give guidance or your backlog. It's been relatively stable now for about a year. It is down still significantly year over year. And aftermarket we just talked about. You should have increasing savings from your realignment plan. Hopefully IPD is going to start getting its act together. So can you talk about your conviction at this point that 2016 was the bottom?", "Mark Blinn", "That's a good way to think of it. You are right. We are three months away from giving our guidance, so I certainly don't want to do now because we are working our plans as we speak. But I think as you look forward, I mean clearly our lowest contribution margin business is the one that is seeing the bookings decline and that's our custom engineered. While that is coming down, that is where we are addressing the realignment and if you think about our business, that doesn't -- that industry has absorption issues, but not necessarily the biggest contribution margin, but it is certainly being impacted. In that you're also see the mix of aftermarket run rate become a higher mix. Aftermarket backlog represented 30%-plus for the first time really ever in our business.", "Also as you look forward, I mean you talked about the IPD, getting to work on that. There is good opportunity there. Just look at its historical performance. SIHI's a good business and Tom's on the matter in terms of the opportunity going forward, the benefit of the realignment. And then on the flipside is companies deal with inflation and as we talked about before, around the variable comp, but that's aligned with our shareholders. I think those are all high-level factors to think about when you look at our business and then ultimately what happens to the market.", "Andrew Kaplowitz", "Good. Thanks, Mark. Congratulations on your retirement.", "Mark Blinn", "Thank you very much, Andrew. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC. Please go ahead.", "Deane Dray", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mark, I'd like to start on that, the observation about rolling MRO deferrals. And we've heard this from a number of your competitors, so it's not a Flowserve, issue. It's a sector issue. We understand that. But your perspective on how much the MROs can be deferred. Some cases you run into plant safety issues so forth, but is this -- what you expect the duration for at least this (indiscernible).", "Mark Blinn", "Generally our sense is this MRO role is in a kind of steady cadence and from this point, if there's more confidence around the OpEx, it will start to abate some, but I think you're right, Deane. It does become a safety issue. There are planning issues around takedown. Keep in mind, a lot of these plants have to be taken down on specific repair schedules because if they don't, you definitely run risk. As I mentioned earlier, being two years into this, I think a lot of that deferral is kind of on a steady cadence. We haven't seen a pickup in it. We have, in terms of that abating, we have seen some emergency opportunities come up which customers don't necessarily like to have. But I think we're on a steady pace and I think what will happen over time is it will abate. It will not abate all in one quarter, because they just can't pick up their maintenance and service schedules that quickly. I think it will steady -- it will abate steady to a more normal pace in terms of MRO planned takes down in facilities, upgrades, repairs, all those things.", "Deane Dray", "Sure, that's helpful. And then how about go back to the fourth-quarter guidance if we could. That's an awfully wide range. We understand that kind of uncertainty that you're dealing with right now, but it would be helpful if you give us a sense of what would be the key assumptions that would put you at the low end and then also at the high end of the range", "Mark Blinn", "Well, I mean, we take into consideration if you look at what you heard from our industry, how the quarter and particularly September impacted them and how that impacts into seasonality. If you look at our fourth quarter, typically our fourth quarter is our strongest quarter in our industry and for our Company. And so just looking at the potential variability of outcomes, that's how we drove our guidance. If there's normalcy, then that impacts our guidance in one way. If we see any kind of reservation concern drop off, that's where we took it to the bottom end. If you look historically, we've had a range roughly here and we typically narrow it when we provide guidance in January.", "Deane Dray", "Exactly. So we should expect that that, you'll have more precision then?", "Mark Blinn", "We typically do. Again, that's three months away so I don't want to get ahead of that, but that's typically what we've done in the past, Deane.", "Deane Dray", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. Please go ahead.", "Mike Halloran", "Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the retirement, Mark.", "Mark Blinn", "Thanks, Mike.", "Mike Halloran", "So first on the backlog and then thoughts into next year, is there any reason to think that backlog wouldn't kind of have its normal bleed in the fourth quarter? In other words, does guidance assume that you have a normal backlog bleed off or dump in the quarter? And then if that's the case, as you go into next year, then short cycle aftermarket is probably going to be the key. Some thoughts on where you'd see it first, what customers are telling you and what it would take for that to turn around?", "Mark Blinn", "Yes, so Mike, you are right. Typically we have a book-to-bill less than one in Q4 and a lot of that is around the seasonality of our business. I mean, obviously it's going to depend on our Q4 bookings. That's one of the components of the book-to-bill. But it's fair to say, you're right in what you've talked about. Where we've seen the primary bookings decline are in the larger projects. That also correlates to where we're taking a lot of our aggressive realignment actions to address that. So as we look into next year, it is going to be more the short cycle in the aftermarket. The things that, as I look into next year that are going to impact that is obviously the work Tom is going to do in the IPD business, because I'll remind you, bookings in that business have not been insignificantly impacted by some of the challenges that it's had this year, particularly the over last two quarters.", "And then getting back to the earlier comment about where we are in terms of maintenance cycles, that will impact the aftermarket business. Where companies are on the OpEx budgets to do some small upgrades and efficiency repairs, which are sorely needed out in the industry right now. So if you think about our business, there are levers certainly we can pull, both from what I'd say a commercial sales standpoint around e-commerce, making it easier to order our products, which customers want to do and they want to do quickly and they have -- we have fairly good pricing power, to the operational improvements, how the market responds in terms of their OpEx budget, but we're -- the one thing with time and being in a down cycle is that brings you one day closer to when you start to move out of it. We're pretty far into this. ", "If you think about our industry had a relatively strong cycle on and off, but for the most part on, for about a 10-year period. We've been in a two-plus year downturn in the industry. That's quite a while and while that's not great from a retrospective standpoint, if you look forward, it does bring us closer to when this will start to abate and we'll move out of it. I think one thing I'll remind you, we\u2019ve taken a conservative approach on our future in terms of our actions. We don't think pricing is going to come back to 2007, 2008 levels. If it does, we\u2019ll be all the better off for it.", "Mike Halloran", "And then for just puts and takes on the margins into next year, you've already at least loosely talked about pricing. Obviously a lot of confidence in the interval initiatives and then volume leverage that you leveraged depending how that pans out. Any other puts and takes we should be thinking about, changes in incentive comp going to next year, pension, things like that?", "Mark Blinn", "No, not any large item. On the incentive or the variable comp, it's that. It's how do we deliver to our shareholders and what commitments do we make. It's other cost containment. If we look at issues around inflation in the business, all the things that I've talked about, we do and always have been reacting to that to look for ways to drive efficiency in our business. I think the items at a macro level to think about are, how can we respond to a declining project environment before it starts to pick up with our realignment efforts? How can we drive our realignment efforts that are on the table in the other areas as well? Improvement in our business, particularly in the IPD business. ", "Continue to look for efficiency and then just dealing with inflation that all companies deal with and the variable comp, how we set it. Probably a good high-level way of thinking of it and then starting to realize, really -- oh, I think there's one other element is in our CE business. That\u2019s still have an impact on our SG&A and as I commented earlier, adjusted we're below $200 million. We will get that out next year. It's a good business and we're learning a lot from it.", "Mike Halloran", "Great, thanks, Mark. Good luck.", "Mark Blinn", "You're welcome, Mike. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question come from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "Robert Barry", "Hey, guys, good morning. Actually just wanted to start with a follow up on an earlier question. You had referenced some elevated levels of emergency repair activity. How widespread is that and has that been accelerating?", "Mark Blinn", "Not really. I think it's just what happens when you stretch it out too long. These operators are savvy and they know their plants very, very well. Typically they will not manage those to the point where they created a state of disrepair, but it does happen. So it's more isolated, you see that, but in general, when you see rolling deferrals, that does tend to increase those because they're not perfect at pushing it right to the limit.", "Robert Barry", "Sure. Could you just give us a little bit more scope on these operational challenges? How many facilities are being impacted? You have a rough sense of what it costs you in orders in the quarter?", "Mark Blinn", "I do, but it's probably not worth going out and talking about those. The fact is it\u2019s not insignificant, particularly in IPD. Two of our larger plants, our horses were impacted. These things happen. I wish we could all say no, these things never happen here. They do. Question is, we acknowledge it and we\u2019ve got a plan to deal with it. Just look at IPD's results versus historical and you can draw your own conclusions as to what the opportunity is there, but it is not insignificant.", "Robert Barry", "And then maybe just lastly on this variable comp headwind, it sounds like it's going to be slight this year but in a typical year, what's the rough order of magnitude that you'd see in the P&L from resetting the variable comp?", "Mark Blinn", "It depends on how we perform relative to shareholder expectations. The reason, actually for this year, variable comp is a headwind relative to last year, but as you look out, it's all driven by our commitments to our shareholders. That's why we call it variable. We oftentimes work on cost containment and efficiencies to offset a lot of that, but if you think looking forward, it's a lot in terms of how we set our plans and a lot of that is aligned to how we're going to deliver to our shareholders. That's just the way business is overall. It's not a fixed cost in our business.", "Robert Barry", "Right. Assuming were not planning for a dramatic rebound next year but we're just kind of executing the restructuring, is this a like a 10, 20 basis point headwind or is it like a point of headwind? Just rough order of magnitude.", "Mark Blinn", "Robert, we\u2019ve got to set our plans. I think a lot of it is around the guidance that you see. The reason it's been not what we anticipated at the beginning of the year is part and parcel to the fact that you saw we dropped our guidance. So that is an indication to you that we created a favorability relative to our initial expectations, because we made a commitment to our shareholders and have come up short of that. I think that's the best way to think of it. It\u2019s really going to be what you see is in the guidance next year. But keep in mind, we've been dealing with this for many, many years. So inflation and everything like that is embedded in all businesses and the fact that we've been able to sustain margins and do the things we do, means we have a long history of dealing with these issues, delivering to our shareholders and addressing it. But a lot of it's going to be how we set our plans and our guidance next year. That's three months away. Thanks, Robert.", "Robert Barry", "Thank you", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Joe Ritchie", "Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congratulations, Mark.", "Mark Blinn", "Thanks, Joe.", "Joe Ritchie", "Maybe starting on the retirement, Mark. Just curious, can you talk a little bit about the process you guys have in place for both internal and external candidates? I'm also really curious as you think about the 2017 plan, at this point, who's going to own it?", "Mark Blinn", "We all own it. I mean, I think this is important and one thing to remember, Joe, while I appreciate the compliments on the call, this Company is a lot bigger than any one individual, and specifically me. So we\u2019ve got a leadership team that is well intact one and two levels down that is driving the process. So I don't go in my back office and come up with a plan for next year and deliver it to everybody. It is a very thorough bottom-up process that everybody owns. And so it's owned by the Company. To our comments earlier, our variable comp is very, very broad based. ", "To your former question around the process, worked very close with the Board. I have a lot of confidence in the process. It is going to be very detailed, very comprehensive, very thoughtful in terms of what I've seen and I think what's important is that I'm really confident with how they are approaching this thing and how they'll get this thing accomplished. I'm here to support for as long as they need. So you should think about it in terms of very orderly, very thoughtful, very communicative, very, very comprehensive, certainly with a long-term view. My assessment of it is, I'll tell you, I have a lot of confidence in it, a lot of confidence in them and the process.", "Joe Ritchie", "That's helpful. Mark. Maybe switching gears a little bit and talking about IPD for a second, so clearly it sounds like the restructuring is impacting orders and sales today. I guess the first question is, at what point does is stop? Is there -- you guys have a timeframe in mind with Tom coming on board and now running that business where you feel good, you're going to a level environment where that's no longer occurring? And then the follow-on to that is really, you think that there is going to be maybe additional pricing pressure to try to re-acquire some orders, or how are you guys thinking about that?", "Mark Blinn", "On the first one, if you ask Tom, he wants it done yesterday, but in fairness it's going to probably take about two quarters to get these things up and running. On pricing pressure, no, because that is about taking care of your customer. If you think about a $1,500 pump, an $8,000 pump, a $10,000 pump, particularly a $15,000 one you order online, you're not worried about 5%, 10%. You're worried about getting that piece of equipment under the process conditions that you need spec to order as quickly as you can by getting the plant to respond to you quickly. So I think the point is no, we actually anticipate pricing power because part of the issue is when you're not delivering, you don't have any pricing power and price correlates to ability to deliver on time. ", "So they may take your product with a longer lead time but they\u2019re going to command price reductions for it. When you can deliver quickly, you can command a higher price. So what I'd say is look over the next two quarters. I have a lot of confidence in Tom. From the pricing side, we actually think it will really start to feed on itself terms of price and volume once we can execute because we have very good products. It's just we're having trouble getting them to our customers and making us easy for them to do business with. We have to fix that.", "Joe Ritchie", "Got it. That makes sense. Thank you and congrats again.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America please go ahead.", "Andrew Obin", "Good morning. Mark, congratulations on your retirement.", "Mark Blinn", "Thank you very much.", "Andrew Obin", "Just a question on capacity. I think I heard you saying that the industry is going to have less capacity going to the next cycle. How do you weigh this against the fact that we are hearing that the Chinese players are getting a lot more active, particularly as Chinese EPCs are gaining market share, as well as the impact of additive manufacturing on the industry?", "Mark Blinn", "I think a couple of things. In general, the traditional competitors are taking capacity out. You are right in terms of Chinese EPCs, but keep in mind a lot of our capacity is designed to participate with those EPCs in some of their global efforts. So don't think about that these products, especially some of the more highly engineered, are going to necessarily just be picked up by local Chinese suppliers. Where we traditionally see Chinese competition are on the lower-end products. But one of our key strategies is to develop capabilities like in the China power business, because we're well aware that not only are those Chinese EPCs going to serve their local markets, but they\u2019re going to go to regions like Africa and we want to go with them.", "I'm trying to think of -- oh, your comment around additive manufacturing. Yes, in terms of some sub-manufacturing, a lot of our LPO SPO strategy is designed to have that internal capability and as part of the realignment, we're moving some of that manufacturing, base manufacture out to our supply base as is our industry. So you're right on in terms of your comments, but don't view that as a negative. One is specifically a strategic area where we are addressing and another one is strategic/tactical in terms of how we are approaching our realignment.", "Andrew Obin", "Just a follow-up question on the EMCs. What are you seeing in terms of people reopening contracts? Have we gone through the cycle already?", "Mark Blinn", "We haven't -- what we saw the cancellations in 2015 picked up quite a bit. We saw quite a few of those. That has significantly abated. In terms of cancellations and everything, there's been -- it hasn't been of any great significance. There hasn't been a bow wave or anything like that in terms of these. These projects are fairly mature. They're moving along. Keep in mind we're pretty far along in the projects in terms of our product deliveries. You do see them from time to time. Part of the Latin American one was one that, a project that's been put on hold for quite a few years in terms of that inventory right now. So I'm not saying it's not happening, but there isn't any significant change in the pace and cadence of those activities.", "Andrew Obin", "Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Nathan Jones", "Good morning, everyone. Mark, I'm going to save my congratulations for February because you\u2019ve still got five months of work to do.", "Mark Blinn", "Thanks, I'll appreciate it.", "Nathan Jones", "I'm going to go the M&A route here. When you bought SIHI at the start of 2014, you talked about that being an 18 to 24 month integration process, so you should be largely finished, if not finished at the moment. What is the Company's appetite for further M&A at this point? Does that change at all with your impending retirement?", "Mark Blinn", "I think -- just remember, the Company's not about one individual. If a good opportunity comes up, I'm sure Management, we would all take a look at the opportunity. But in fairness, new leadership may have a different point of view, especially as you get up the curve in terms of much more strategic type activities. But I think if something is compelling as SIHI were to come along and it would make sense, I am certain Management and the Board would take a hard look at it. I just want to point that out. We are continuing to move forward. We have things to do in our business and particularly realignment, which is an absolute priority. I'd go back to our capital allocation priorities and our priorities in our business. That's still first and foremost, which I can tell you may impact our view in terms of when we look at in an external opportunity.", "Nathan Jones", "Does the bandwidth required for this realignment program going through the end of next year make it less likely that Flowserve would embark on a meaningful acquisition at this point?", "Mark Blinn", "I can just tell you that realignment is a priority and I expect it to remain a priority, Nathan. A lot of that is determined by the opportunity itself. Where is it? For example, if we were having a discussion as a management team and something came up in our custom engineered business, you take a step back and say wow, there's a lot going on there. Could we really integrate it? You'd have to risk adjust the opportunity. Flip side, and I'm not signaling anything, I'm just telling you how we think about it, because if you look at our valve business, you say well, those are fairly discrete operations in terms of facilities, the ease of integration is going to be higher. ", "So on a disciplined approach, you look at everything on a risk-adjusted basis. But my point earlier is the highest return on every dollar we have is really in our realignment area right now. Hopefully that answers it because I don't know. It's a case study on the opportunity that comes up. If something came up that was very compelling, you have to evaluate that, but that's the way we think about it.", "Nathan Jones", "Okay, then I have one on capacity and price. You had probably your largest competitor in the engineered pump business talking about an expectation that demand and supply capacity would come at the balance towards the end of next year and an expectation that you wouldn't see any price improvement until at least then. Is that something that you'd concur with? Just any color you could give on how you think about it.", "Mark Blinn", "On our custom engineered, I think that's a fair statement is price is determined by amongst other things, capacity. I mean, you have to be able to engineer and design the product. You have to be able to deliver it on time. All those things being equal, it is going to be around capacity. I think in our other areas, particularly in IPD, it's going to be in our ability to execute. I think that's going to determine price more than anything.", "Nathan Jones", "All right, thanks very much. Look forward to talking with you guys again.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Go ahead.", "Bhupender Bohra", "Good morning guys. Mark, just a question on the month of September here. Can you give us some color in terms of the end markets? We saw oil and gas, coal orders, the bookings actually grew like 10%, but the non-oil and gas business has stayed weak here. If you can just (indiscernible) in September and what are we seeing in the first few weeks of especially October here?", "Mark Blinn", "Bhupender, I think my comments were in general about the industry. We don't go into bookings month by month. But in general, what you saw was typically you expect July and August to be somewhat slower, with -- you have Ramadan in the Middle East. You have vacations in Europe, vacations even in the United States. It tends to be a little bit slower in pick up. We just started out slower than originally anticipated in July and August, but just didn't see the ramp up in September. So my comment is more general around the quarter and I think you've heard that from our industry. I just wanted to provide you our color on it.", "If you look at specific bookings, we did have an ebulliator. Not huge, but an ebulliator opportunity booking that came in. so there's going to be a lot of moving parts but in general, what my commentary around the month of December -- September was, excuse me, was that we just didn't see the ramp-up that we normally saw in the month of September. But also as you think about September, there was a lot of uncertainty in the market then. So you look back and you go, I guess that wasn't really a surprise, but we just didn't see the ramp up.", "Bhupender Bohra", "Okay, got it. Was that specific to a particular geographical region here or regionally?", "Mark Blinn", "No, it was more in general. I think this goes around. You think about all that's going on. The US has elections and that has a worldwide implication as people observe what is going on. I just think it was fairly broad based.", "Bhupender Bohra", "So my next question was on the press release which you put out a day before your earnings was the collaboration with Honeywell on the Internet of Things here. Some of your competitors have talked about how they\u2019re converting their assets to the Internet of Things and making it more -- more them more intelligent here going forward. They have even talked about sales funnels because of this application. I don't know if you want to give a broad perspective on where Flowserve is as you're collaborating with Honeywell and I believe HPE and how that thing actually goes over the next two years or maybe even half.", "Mark Blinn", "Sure. This is important, because in these capabilities, these smart plants, the product matters. That's where you embed the sensors. That's where the basic algorithms come from in terms of the know-how or the process conditions. We're right in the middle that. I've talked about that on earlier calls. It's where we're spending some of our time is making sure that our equipment can, because it's critical to the process, our equipment has that capability because we think over time, customers are going to increasingly value that. What you saw with our relationship with Honeywell, you've seen them with other providers before, is part of the value chain in terms of how we deliver that capability to the customers.", "But keep in mind, a lot of the predictive algorithms and everything come from the product manufacturer because they know the product, they know the process conditions, they know the hydraulics. They're the ones that can actually make the machine smart. So we think it's a great opportunity going forward. My view is it's not going to occur overnight, but it's certainly going to start to penetrate the market and when I think about how highly engineered our equipment is, the know-how that goes into it, our ability to embed sensors, the ability to ubiquitously transmit that information, I think it's going to be a real opportunity.", "Bhupender Bohra", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And our next question come from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Joe Giordano", "Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions here. I wanted to talk about capacity quickly again. There's no question that everyone is taking footprint out, but you get the sense talking to some people that through things like lean and automation that the actual quantity of items that are able to be produced isn't really changing a whole lot relative to the amount of square footage being taking out of plants. So can you maybe comment on that a bit? Is there a need for larger scale consolidation within the industry to really achieve more of a balance?", "Mark Blinn", "That's actually a fair statement is I think that what you've commented on is we will have less footprint, 30% less facilities and I'm confident that we would be able to execute on any of the backlogs we've had in the last 5 to 10 years for the exact reason you've talked about. And that is, we had a lot of under absorption in the most recent peak in our cycle in 2014, so we'll eliminate a lot of that. But then the comment earlier around sub-manufacturing, our LPO SPO, the ability to move work, our focus on more highly engineered products. What that does is that obviously gives you better absorption in the business. So I think that as I look at our business specifically in terms of what we've done over the last, particularly in the last five years, we will have less square feet and equal or more manufacturing capability and throughput capability in our business.", "In terms of industry consolidation, yes and no. All manufacturing is not equal. You need to keep that in mind is that some of our facilities have the ability to manufacture certain or specific products. So when I think about our CE acquisition, that wasn't -- there was very little consolidation in that and it was more around adding product and product capabilities to our portfolio. Now, you can move some of their products into some of our facilities, which we've done, and by the way, we moved some of our products into one of their facilities. There is the opportunity to do that, but I'd caution you not to think of our capacity as ubiquitous, and it's just a matter of square footage. You've got to have the know-how, the capabilities, the right machining, the right experience in those locations. Clearly, though, our efforts are going to make us much more efficient.", "Tom Pajonas", "I would just add to what Mark says on the capacity side, that's one aspect of the realignment. The other aspect is a strategic repositioning of our products and people around the world, similar to the previous comment that came up in terms of the EPCs going in different locations. A lot of the jobs going forward are requiring more local content and that is one of the aspects of the realignment is a strategic repositioning of our assets.", "Mark Blinn", "That's a good point. In many countries, you must be present to win.", "Joe Giordano", "Is this -- while that's all obviously very positive for Flowserve, if everyone else is doing a similar thing, is this inherently bad for the industry where if the markets don't materially accelerate and get back to OE levels that would justify this level of volumetric capacity, has nothing really changed from an overall industry perspective?", "Mark Blinn", "No. Look, the industry has taken enough capacity out. Keep in mind, our industry was stretched for capacity in 2007 and 2008, so it's not like there was a bunch of extra capacity. The industry is taking capacity out. We're fairly aggressive on it. I can't comment generally, specifically on some of our competitors, but generally they're taken the capacity out. The industry knows how to right size itself. It's had plenty of time to do that. I'm confident that the industry, it's not going to be perfect on capacity. If anything, there will be a little extra. Just keep in mind, we are one of the ones that are more capable about moving products around our facilities around the world.", "Just because 80% of your plants are full doesn't mean that 20% of them won't be under absorbed even in good times. So I think it's probably to remember to say not all capacity is equal. Our industry is responding by taking capacity out, particularly players like Flowserve that tend to be on the higher-end products, they've rationalized that capacity. So I don't think there's going to be a big capacity overhang where we go into the next uptick.", "Joe Giordano", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Walsh from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.", "John Walsh", "Hi and thank you for taking my question. I have a clarification and a question. Thank you for the color on 2017 and I apologize if I missed it, but did you actually say whether or not you could grow earnings next year?", "Mark Blinn", "Did not. I said we'd provide guidance in three months.", "John Walsh", "Okay. Fair enough. As we think about cash flow into next year, obviously this year you have the headwind from the realignment cash. I think there's still a modest headwind based on your guidance for cash from restructuring cash, but how about some of the other lines, pension, CapEx, cash interest, how should we think about those into next year?", "Mark Blinn", "Our pension cash outflows have been fairly steady for the last couple of years and as Karen mentioned in her comments, we are fully funded. I don't want to again, get ahead of our guidance, but I would say the biggest consumer of our cash looking into next year is going to be following through on our realignment initiatives. It's pretty much as simple as that. Then as -- in our industry, as we deliver a lot of these large projects, that does tend to cause your balance sheet to liquidate slightly, especially the large ones. We will give the guidance in January, but I think if you look at the just generally trends that we talked about, I would focus the most on our realignment cash in terms of making your assumptions.", "John Walsh", "Okay. Appreciate the color. Thank you", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Scott Graham", "Hi. These are two quick ones. Mark, there's been a lot said about the aftermarket, the turnarounds, the lack of them, the push-backs and what have you, yet here you are with an aftermarket bookings number of about down two. It essentially shows stabilization. What are you trying to say about aftermarket with that type of number which supports stabilization? Are you concerned about it going forward or is it something else?", "Mark Blinn", "No, I'm not concerned about it. I will tell you we have to earn that business every day. But no, I haven't expressed a concern. We've been pleased with the stability we've seen in the tough environment we've been in.", "Scott Graham", "Got you. Last one is the corporate expense. Is that a number we can see repeat going forward, or is that maybe just really tightening your belts in the last two quarters of the year?", "Mark Blinn", "We are always going to continue to tighten our belt, Scott, and if you look at corporate expense over the last seven years, we've managed that very tightly. You should expect us to continue to do that.", "Scott Graham", "Very good.

Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Planning and Investor Relations.", "Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The Press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the web cast, and also on our web site.", "So if you please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.", "Next slide? Today, we will be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, a full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also the part of this presentation on our website. For the first quarter, the difference between GAAP results and adjusted results, consists of three items. Our normal adjustments related to recently acquired businesses on both deferred revenue and inventory valuation which totaled $3 million to both revenue and income measures.", "We have also adjusted our operating cash flow to account for the cash taxes paid in the first quarter for the Abel divestiture. The Abel divestiture you may recall was completed in the fourth quarter of last year. GAAP required this amount, $37 million in those tax payments, to be reported as an operating cash flow item even though it is related to that divestiture. We\u2019ve added this $37 million back to reflect the ongoing nature of our cash flow. ", "Now if you please turn the Slide 4, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and after his remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?", "Brian Jellison", "Thank you, John. So we\u2019ll go through today the first quarter enterprise results and we\u2019ll look at the detail around the four segments. And the outlook for the remaining of the year and while we\u2019re doing that, we\u2019ll comment on the second quarter and full year guidance at the end and then take your questions.", "Next slide. So we start with the Q1 enterprise results. Go to next slide, Slide 6. You can see there is a lot of great thing here, was a very, very good quarter for us and certainly puts us on track for a record 2016, but just one word I\u2019d say before we get started, Mr. Humphrey over here is actually just celebrating this month his 10 completed year with the enterprise. And as John refer to it\u2019s actually his 40th quarter. So with that, let\u2019s take a look at our first quarter and congratulations John.", "Revenue was up 4.4% to 906 million versus the first quarter over a year ago and organic, you can see was down 3.2%, which is really not the story, because excluding oil and gas the company\u2019s organic was actually up around 1% and if you look at the headwinds that we knew we had with the end of Toronto and Puerto Rico and so forth really the underlying basis, the activity seeing better than that or like plus 3.", "Our orders are up 9% in the quarter to a record. Book-to-bill was really spectacular, because we haven\u2019t had a book-to-bill above 101 for 2.5 years, this time [indiscernible] combined industrial energy together the book-to-bill was 104, medical was 103 and RF was even just here above 1, but actually had an adjustment in there for some debookings around the business that we\u2019re doing something with and otherwise it would have been 102. So very good backlog at 1.2 billion is also very good.", "Gross margin was spectacular, gross margin was up 210 basis points to 62.1% and what\u2019s really remarkable given the macroeconomic challenges around the world is each of our four segments improved the gross margin in the first quarter. EBITDA was up 4% and reached 34% EBITDA margin, we\u2019re going to talks more about that, we still don\u2019t report on cash earnings, but increasingly, we need to make sure people understand the quality of our earnings and the cash earnings nature, because we just have so much non-cash amortization.", "Our earnings per share in the first quarter were $1.50. Our operating cash flow was 245 million, which represented 27% of our revenue. And the recent acquisitions that we\u2019ve made in 2015, are really performing sort of beyond very well, they have outstanding growth, almost all of them are double-digit grower, so we\u2019ll talk more about that throughout today\u2019s session. We deploy 265 million in acquisitions in the first quarter, we have extremely big and attractive pipeline that we\u2019ll talk a little bit more.", "And so with that we can move to Slide, next Slide, which is 7. On the income statement, just to kind of backup some idea about how importantly orders were, I\u2019ll give you our book-to-bill for the last eight quarters was, last year it started out at 98 then 102 on a consolidated basis here. The next quarter was 99 then 101.98, a year before that, it was 101.99-101.98. So you have all way back to Q2 \u201913 to see something as high as the book-to-bill we got here. And that was despite revenue being up.", "Gross profit was up 8%, our operating income was basically flat to the prior period, but that\u2019s only because amortization in the quarter was up 120 basis points or $11 million, all of which is not in cash. So big difference between reporting GAAP operating income and what\u2019s really happening on the cash quality of the earnings.", "Interest expense was up 7 million, we did $900 million bond offering. In December, which really kind of term out, what we were doing on the revolver. So it gives us substantial capacity well over 1.8 billion [ph] to be able to deploy here a capital deployments throughout the year and it\u2019s certainly worth of the nickel impact. That said the different swings last year\u2019s $1.55 and $1.50 is in track with that nickel.", "Next Slide, if we look here as operating in EBITA margins as the company. You\u2019ll see that incrementally the operating margin went from 28.7 to 27.4 that\u2019s with the 120 basis points of amortization, near the backend, you can see essentially it was the same outstanding results as the year before. On the right hand side though so you can see the EBITA margins, which increasingly are more important for us and here there is no D in either side of that equation, this is just earnings before interest tax and amortization.", "So that\u2019s actually up in the last two years, 130 basis points from 31.6% to 32.9%. Furthermore, this gross margin increase that we\u2019re getting is encouraging us, which we\u2019re doing at a fast pace to step-up our R&D and engineering investment, which in this quarter was up 120 basis points over the first quarter of last year, it is now reaching 7% of revenue.", "Next Slide. Our asset like business model continues and were still easily able to compound our investment and asset like businesses and you get some sense about how important that is. So there is two aspects to slide like this, one is our governance process with our existing business and the second is the quality of the businesses that we continue to acquire. At the end of the firsts quarter just three years ago in 2013, our net number here was 7.7%, today it\u2019s 4%. Nearly a 50% reduction in just three years.", "Inventory back at \u201913 was 6.8% today it\u2019s 5.5% receivables were 19.3 and in a tough markets for receivables today they are only 17.4 and payables were 18.4 and now there 19, all go in our way. So we go from 7.7% down the 4% and even just in the last two years they\u2019ve gone from 6.3 % to 4% which is truly a remarkable number, we\u2019re very proud of all of our people focusing on asset velocity and the quality of the businesses that new leadership teams are bringing to us as we acquire them, next slide.", "To look at our cash flow per performance here you can see in the quarter operating cash flow was 27% of revenue, free cash flow was 26% of revenue, that\u2019s not a gross margin number, that\u2019s the free cash flow to revenue number 26%. Trailing 12 months operating cash conversion is a 135% and even though the cash conversation is a quarter above 150, we really thought it\u2019s much more balanced to look at the trailing 12 months operating cash flow to eliminate quarterly seasonality that occurs sometimes so, even there you can see gone from 8.44 to 9.13 and a we fully expect this year\u2019s operating cash flow for the full year would be a $1 billion or more. ", "We\u2019re continuing to compound cash flow despite these macroeconomic challenges and they are quite substantial for us, we had about a $100 million of foreign exchange in last twelve months and another $100 million of oil and gas headwinds and also the Toronto project for a millions of dollars and Puerto Rico escape which was another $10 million a quarter. So that compounding is to continuing the same way we would expect it to contain and we still think cash is the best measure of performs, next slide.", "If we look at the financial position the balance sheet is in really great shape, gives us tremendous amount of powder for capital deployment and our pipeline is really as good, maybe the best it\u2019s ever been. Here you can see we still have the $0.5 billion of cash, our undrawn revolver is actually paid off now it\u2019s $1.850 billion which is very substantial if you look at cash and the undrawn revolver you\u2019d be over $2.3 billion and you could see the EBITDA at a billion 256 will continue grow handsomely throughout the year so we\u2019ll have a very solid debt ratio opportunities. If you look at the last 15 months, we\u2019ve deployed over $2 billion in acquisitions and with a $1.8 billion undrawn revolver we could absolutely repeat that effort and deploy another $2 billion in the next 15 to 18 months, next slide. ", "Here we get into the very specific segment detail, next slide. So in the first quarter the segment performance you can see here was again very strong all the way across for line on our EBITDA measurement down at the bottom, there are two really big messages that we try to convey with the slide, and first is there are RF software segment and the medical solution segments together represent over three quarters of the Company\u2019s total EBITDA.", "But there is equally important messages here on the left hand side were we look at the energy and industrial business which remain as really extraordinary businesses. Those two business you can see how 25% EBITDA and energy even with all of the difficulty that you see we have very nimble leadership and the quality of those businesses still allow us to drive this kind of result, if you combined the two together $119 million in energy and $171 million in industry you only have $300 million out of our 906 in revenue, and yet you have 81 million of EBITDA on a $300 million base or 27% and those EBITDA margins in energy are going to continue to approve throughout the year.", "So great extraordinary businesses in industrial energy despite oil and gas, and oil and gas has becoming less and less critical and hear it\u2019s well less than 9% of revenue. All right next slide.", "We start off with the smaller segment which is energy. Energy had negative organic in the quarter of 14%, but essentially all of that was driven by the oil and gas business which now represents just a little over half of the total segment and inside energy it\u2019s different than the industrial portion of oil and gas because our energy business is primarily downstream about 75% downstream, about 25% up stream and the FX as you can see was 1 point. Oil and gas as a portion of the energy segment was down a low level 20% which is pretty much consistent with what we expected throughout the year, the biggest challenge and there used to be our diesel engine shutout valve business, this year it will shift over really to our compressor control business and they\u2019re moving quickly to try to address everything they can do from short fall in project that we will see throughout the year.", "Very nimble execution, we haven\u2019t really talked to the market about and the restructuring we\u2019ve done which is been pretty considerable and we\u2019ll do a little bit more in the second quarter, but we\u2019re really not even asking for an adjustment on our restructuring investments because the payback is pretty quick. Zetec in the quarter did extremely well, which was up high single digits, there is a lot of activity around the power generation side in Nuclear and Zetec is best-in-class in this area and its going to enjoy some continuing tailwinds for the next couple of years.", "And then just as we move to thinking about the remainder of the year Q2 through Q4, I\u2019ll just remind you that with the pullback in oil and gas about half of the energy systems business is actually industrial, measurement, technologies. We expect high single-digits organic decline in the rest of year, but that\u2019s just because of the oil and gas. And then we think we\u2019ll get this modest growth in the other half of the sector and we think margins will improve throughout the year sequentially and in energies you can see now it\u2019s down to only 9% of the company\u2019s EBITDA. Next side.", "If you look at industrial technology, the same situation with the oil and gas organic as a segment was down 5%. However, if you exclude oil and gas, industrial was up organically 3% in the quarter. So the upstream activity which in here is really Roper pump and a little bit of an adjacency there that upstream is about 80% of the market. And the total value of that, it\u2019s only about $10 million out of a 171 million in the segment. So it\u2019s down to less than 5% of revenue. Neptune had a really strong quarter, they were up double digits, then enjoying very good U.S. which overcame the fact this was the last quarter with the negative Toronto project variance which was mid-millions of dollars of headwind.", "This segment EBITDA margin I think if we can get a look at to which were really 30.1% on industrial. So the performance despite any of the headwinds that you see is still very solid. In second half of the year, we\u2019re look at kind of low single digit organic growth for the segment. We don\u2019t see any improvement in upstream oil and gas, we think that will actually continue to decline a little bit, but we\u2019ll have kind of flat to modest growth in all of the other markets and then very strong growth at Neptune because as we get into the second quarter, the Toronto project tailwind is essentially behind gas and that was worth quite a bit of -- will be quite a bit of positive variance now in 2, 3 and 4. Next slide.", "If you look at the RF and technology and software business and we have to throw the software recognition in here because the software business is actually becoming larger than the totaling business. So when we look at the segment you can see organic was down 1, but actually organic would have been up excluding the roll-off of the Puerto Rico exit that we had, which was $10 million just in that quarter. We had record margin performance throughout this segment, very strong software and SaaS business growth with terrific margins and cash flow and all of those businesses added into our most recent acquisitions performing very well, we got several new wins which are of strategic importance that legal community can be talking about and has already started to discuss and comment on our share gains.", "In the toll and traffic area, as we say our IPS business was down because of Puerto Rico, our Tag business continued to be strong, very good project execution and I also want to point out that that OP margin which was up 170 basis points to 32.2, again realized the quality of the cash margin. Our EBITDA margins were at 39.2% up 360 basis points so did the first quarter of the year ago. As we look to the second quarter we expect flat organic growth in Q2 only because we still have one more quarter of the Puerto Rico drag of about 10 million bucks and that\u2019s 3 to 4 points. But in the second half, we\u2019ll have a much stronger organic growth because the Puerto Rico comps will be going away. We\u2019ll get multiple opportunities we think in the Transco projects, we have very exceptional amount of bids in line, pretty confident in a lot of those, and the timing of when those are able to be announced will be important for us.", "And then the RF ideas which is doing phenomenally well will become organic in the fourth quarter so that will help our organic revenue comparisons. The software and SaaS business should grow kind of mid to high single digits, just a little bit better than we might have expected previously and they gives us strong cash returns. And then Aderant's is going to continue to gain shares which will help the segment. Next slide.", "Here we look at the medical solutions. Medical solutions points to another EBITDA margin story. You see the operating profit margin at 34.7, but that\u2019s just because it has a lot of non-cash amortization, our EBITDA margins are 43.5% in Medical. Organic was up 2%, acquisitions added 13% but medicals organics as a standalone portion of the segment was up 6% organically while imaging was down 13%. We had double digit growth in the medical product which really was driven primarily by Verathon and Northern Digital. The acquisitions that we\u2019ve made in this segment, our performing extremely well, if you put them all together, they actually or growing both at double-digit revenue and EBITDA basis.", "We had really exceptional growth at Strata, which is up very dramatically, as more hospitals understand what we\u2019re doing and are signing up for our SaaS solution on their cost visibility and how to contain and structure your costs. We acquired a small business called TCI Medical in the quarter, which will boost Civco\u2019s offering in Ultrasound and that business is close, we\u2019ll add some revenue for us.", "If you look at the balance of the year, you have high single digit organic growth in the segment, that comes from continued strength in the medical arena and then Strata SoftWriters and data innovations become organic in Q2, which will make those comps stand out. Very strong performance in all of those acquisitions, the IPA business that we announced some time ago has done particularly well from a growth perspective.", "Imaging will continue to improve with kind of substantial gains out of Gatan. Gatan, we\u2019re pointing a lot of money in innovation at Gatan to focus on cryo-EM markets, this involve significant R&D investments, but with really exciting out year opportunity, some of you have read about the discovery of the Zika Virus and how that was done and our products were absolutely crucial to the discovery, technologies that have been announced recently.", "We have positive contributions from our CliniSys acquisition, although CliniSys comes in initially at lower margins in the rest of our business, but we\u2019ll continue to improve those as we work with them. Sunquest Investments in Genetics continues we acquired on just a day after the quarter, so we didn\u2019t include it in here GeneInsight, which is a technology and business that was really good by partners help that we\u2019ve been doing in concert with and will have long-term applications in the out years at Medical.", "Also I would just say that, when you look at medical in this pie chart down here it\u2019s 43% of the company\u2019s total EBITDA and to put that in perspective, you can see energy the smallest piece of that pie and industrial is the next smallest. Those two together are only 24% of our EBITDA, Medical is 43% and RF is 33%, so you can see what the future looks like. Next Slide.", "So here we get into the guidance of the company. For the balance of the year, next slide. So the guidance of date that we\u2019re going to continue our current guidance as we articulated at beginning of the year. So we said the full year would be between 6.85 and 7.15 with the mid-point of $7 and then operating cash flow would be about a billion dollars. And our tax rate guidance is the same it was at the beginning of the year and really everything else, we see the same sort of revenue opportunities. There is one thing, we say about the second quarter, where we establish the guidance at 1.56 to 1.61. We had an extraordinarily low tax rate in the second quarter last year that some people were maybe looking at carefully. Tax rate was only 25%, we would expect the tax rate in the second quarter to be 30% to 30.5%.", "Another piece of good news, when we look at FY, we\u2019re really comfortable with the second half of the year. We\u2019re not really seeing any industrial contagion at all in those portions of industrially or the energy businesses that have not oil and gas. And certainly at the beginning of the year that was something that many people were worried about. And the high-end of our end what we really just be dependent on the adoption rates and project timing and seasonal activity. So it\u2019s sure quite good about reinforcing the full year guidance. Next slide.", "If we look at the summary of 2016, it\u2019s pretty simple series of things here, right. Revenue is up 4.4%, Medical and Software and Neptune were able to offset all of the declines in oil and gas. Our orders reached record level and got over a billion dollar backlog. Our gross margin, which would let you know how customers continue to feel about us and the products and services we provide or up 210 basis points and as we said each of the four segments increased their gross margin. Good thing is we're investing at the fastest rate in our history in R&D.", "Our EBITA margin, you can see is 32.9%, not all EBITDA is the same, we\u2019re already sometimes frustrated people telling us about some of these EBITDA margins, but it\u2019s really mostly D and then the CapEx sucks our away. In our world, the linkage between EBITDA 34 and EBITA 32.9 is only a 110 basis points. EBITDA as we said was up 4% to 307, acquisitions performing very well. We really can\u2019t say enough about how well the acquired leadership teams are performing and how well they\u2019ve embraced the Roper governance process. Every single one of these acquisitions is outperforming our expectation. And we have very attractive pipeline and we had said earlier this year, we expect to deploy over a billion in the year and it could easily be more than that.", "So great quarter on track for record 2016 and with that we\u2019ll open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays. ", "Scott Davis", "Just trying to get a sense, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever asked this question before and you may not have the answer off the top of your head, but you said 2015 acquisitions performing very well and clearly that looks to be the case, but can you quantify that? Is there a cash return on capital on those deals that you could quote for the first 12 months out or expected for 2016 or something that we could hang our hat on?", "Brian Jellison", "Well I think, you\u2019ve been around us a lot to know that I am not a fan of return on invested capital where people look at stuff and don\u2019t add back accumulated depreciation and don\u2019t really realize how much future drawn cash, their CapEx will be. So in our world we look at new cash return on investment. So in that case, you look at the net earnings of the business and then you add back the non-cash charges and you divide it by the gross investment which is the physical plant & equipment plus accumulative depreciation plus networking capital. All of this acquisitions are well above 100% cash returns many of them are in the several hundred percent, cash return basis and some of them get paid in advance for what they do, so they have a negative cash return which is even more powerful. So they are all doing it very well, I think there is a general rule and more you can assume that our acquisitions are going to come in and they\u2019re going to be substantially above the 34% EBITDA margin that the overall enterprise has and that they are going to have higher gross margins than the enterprise and they\u2019re going to have higher cash returns than the enterprise. ", "Scott Davis", "Okay. Fair enough and as far as you put a lot of capital to work last year I think it was somewhere than 1.85 billion, would you anticipate I mean say over 1 billion in 2016 book, but you also said you have $1.8 billion or so of firepower, would you anticipate something closer to 1 billion or closer to the 1.8 billion that you have in the hoppers as a potential or is it just too early to say?", "Brian Jellison", "I think that we don\u2019t sort of budget like let\u2019s deploy $1 billion. So just thinking about what we think about it is very simple is we\u2019re going to deploy our cash flow, we\u2019re going to leverage it three times or more debt to the acquired EBITDA. So given this usually its more between 1.35 and 1.5 times our -- the powder of whatever our cash flow is. So if we have 1 billion in operating cash flow, we pay out some dividends or whatever and we multiply that to the acquisitions, it is very easy for us to deploy a 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion all the time.", "So that\u2019s why we say we\u2019ll deploy 8 billion over the next four or five years and as we said we deployed 2 billion in the last 15 months, we could easily deploy 2 billion in the next 15 months. So it\u2019s not like a budgetary thing, Scott. I mean we\u2019re looking at things now that are over 2 billion and we\u2019re looking at things that are in the mid-100s of million and which ones we do and when they close is never thought of as a budget kind of thing but our balance sheet capacity and our debt ratios give us as much or more opportunities to invest than we\u2019ve ever had. ", "Scott Davis", "Okay, great. Good reminder. Thanks guys and congrats on the start of the year. ", "Operator", "Then we\u2019ll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.", "Deane Dray", "Just giving all anxiety we had last quarter regarding oil, it\u2019s interesting and some relief that the comments that you\u2019re expecting to see, margins improved sequentially in energy this year. So any comments on the visibility, the backlog and I know you didn\u2019t call it out, you mentioned you did restructuring this quarter, but could recite it for us how much restructuring was done and what that payback is?", "Brian Jellison", "We got a little bit towards the end of last year in anticipation of the difficulty we did more in the first quarter, we\u2019ll do couple of million dollars here probably in the second quarter, some of that you make the announcement, it takes a long time for people in Europe but we\u2019ll continue to pull back a little bit on the sort of baseline SG&A, but the businesses are really small I think if you add them all up we had about 65 million of oil and gas revenue in energy and about 10 million in industrial, right. So, they really don\u2019t have huge cost basis, they are very high margin businesses, if you look at them with sort of 30% pretax numbers or higher there is just not a lot of cost beside that takeout, we don\u2019t have big factories that we have to worry about with absorption issues and what have you. So there is another couple of million, I think we feel like where we could be.", "Deane Dray", "And then on organic guidance, I know you had a lot of moving parts in the second quarter especially, but what you\u2019re expecting for organic second quarter and how about for the year versus the previous guidance of 2% to 4%.", "John Humphrey", "We\u2019re still in the same spot as we were when we issued the guidance with respect to the full year, in the 2% to 4% organic, that does imply or in fact it\u2019s a part of our expectation that the second half will be in the mid-single digit organic growth, second quarter would be about flat. ", "Deane Dray", "Got it and just one last quick on, corporate expense came in a little bit light then what we were looking for where there any unusual items and or timing within corporate?", "John Humphrey", "No, we\u2019re not in fact that it was about what we had expected, in the it encompasses both from deal expenses as well as the equity compensation for the Company is all recorded that the corporate G&A line, in fact the stock price is up nicely from where it was last year that\u2019s reflecting in that number also.", "Deane Dray", "Got it actually I emphasize that was -- it came in higher then what we were looking for so, just want to --.", "Brian Jellison", "That is a directly tied to the share price going up, it\u2019s of equity comp.", "Deane Dray", "Thank you.", "John Humphrey", "We help it goes up higher again, it\u2019s a noncash charge. ", "Operator", "And we go ahead and take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.", "Richard Eastman", "A couple of things in the mid scientific medical products business the core organic growth in the quarter in orders, what did that look like and may be was there a book to bill in the core business there ex acquisitions?", "Brian Jellison", "We saw in organic basis for medical we were up 9% versus last year and the book to bill ratio was somewhere to the total, just a little bit above 1 even on core basis. ", "Richard Eastman", "Okay. And MHA's business, is the pricing component there of their business, is it holding flat or has that improved at all?", "Brian Jellison", "So the pricing component for the branded drugs is continuing to be a positive contributor there, you do have some other impacts around generics which are either down a little bit or flat in prior you know last in couple of years those have actually been up, so in that net-net pricing is about -- is up very modestly for that not very much. ", "Richard Eastman", "Okay. But at least flat. Okay. And then just one last question. On the RF business, the EBIT margin there, we have some real positive puts and takes, namely Puerto Rico's exit and then Aderant coming into the revenue and profit number. But is it a reset EBIT run rate that starts to push 32%? Does that start to be somewhat sustainable at that level?", "Brian Jellison", "Sure, yes. I think it will be in a low 30% range for the year, of course the timing of that -- the software businesses that we have are clearly higher margin, the timing associated with some of our toll and traffic projects which are often times little bit more on the equity side, and have a little bit more of a cost component to them even though there is not any negative drag from a cash flow prospective. Those margins come in a little bit below the average for the segment and so it\u2019s about timing of the IPS project of the toll and traffic project, but will effect that. We still see north of 30% margins here for the remainder of the year.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with UBS.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan", "A couple questions on medical. One, in terms of the plus 6% ex the imaging fees, the plus 6%, MHA, I think, had some comps in the quarter. With MHA down, would medical have been up even more? And then, also, as we think about margins for the second quarter and the year, should medical margins be down again because of either MHA comps or other comps or anything else? Or should we think about those starting to grow again? ", "Brian Jellison", "You know I think too we\u2019re seeing on the medical, we want to have people understand, but we\u2019re going to continue make acquisitions there, we have extraordinary margins that we had with Sunquest and MHA. We\u2019re going to make lot of acquisitions and we\u2019re going to have better then enterprise margins, but they\u2019ll be dilutive to software component inside medical. So this doesn\u2019t bother as in any way.", "Now medical products had spectacular performance versus the medical software which in services -- so we\u2019ve put Sunquest and MHA in the medical software services component and they were down a little bit organically in the first quarter, medical products was up more than double digit and off-course we still have the little bit corruption around imagining because we\u2019ve actually been intentionally winding down certain of kind of imaging businesses while we\u2019re going to have much better growth in Gatan. But the camera stuff this, we are trying to only participate in profitable markets, I don\u2019t know if that helps you, but that\u2019s the best way to explain it.", "John Humphrey", "And remember the margins in this segment are just extra ordinary [multiple speakers], we expect our operating basis to maintain in the mid-30% all year.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan", "Yes, that's fine. I knew that there was some lumpiness this quarter. Just in terms of getting the margins and the modeling and just lumpiness in terms of some of the margin contracts, that's all I meant. In terms of energy, Brian, you sound pretty constructive on the non-oil and gas parts of energy. Can you give a little more color there, Zetec and also the other pieces, what you're seeing there that you like?", "Brian Jellison", "Well, we like that they\u2019re not going down. They're inching ahead into low single-digit growth in both sectors, but industrials are going to have better growth because of Neptune. And then in energy we are getting a bit better growth in small business called DJ Instruments, we have business called Alpha that should have a stronger second half and Zetec is high single digits, might even get to the 10% growth, that\u2019s really becoming a secular trend for that. So for a while with Fukushima and other problems with bringing things online, Zetec was really challenged. But today these people are working with us on all kinds of new applications, so we feel really quite good about that. But it\u2019s a relatively small business within the enterprise, but nonetheless important.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.", "Joe Ritchie", "My first question's, going back to your comment on M&A, Brian, you said it's the best it's ever been. I'm just curious, how much of that is being driven by the IPO market not being all that great right now and PEs having a hard time exiting? I'm just wondering what the driving factors are there.", "Brian Jellison", "I don\u2019t think, it's really the IPO market, because generally the kind of things we acquire are things that probably wouldn\u2019t go the IPO route. They would either go to a strategic or they\u2019d get flipped to another private equity group. So I think there is a lot of forces of the work, there has certainly been lumpy feedback to sellers about just how much debt capacity they can get on things.", "Although frankly we don\u2019t ever see any -- well we see one thing right now but it's got six-times staple, but another one that we\u2019re really pursuing as a six and three quarter staple, there are still some seven staples. But the cost of debt has flipped around quite a lot, sometimes the mezzanine portion unsecured bonds of 10.5% other times they are 9% and the LIBOR 4% has been in play sometimes, maybe they gets 4.75 on the term loan. But it's really isn\u2019t because there\u2019ll be LIBOR 4 of 100 spent, 5.75.", "So I do think that there are a lot of private equity people feel as that they\u2019ve got an asset that they are going to sell in the foreseeable future, it may still be as good a time now to sale. And they changed weekly, and first they are very opportunistic right; so our situation, we are not affected by those things and our ability to finance stuff is certainly easier and better than their cost of debt, so I think that helps. But also there is lot of things we are looking at, they have been in various portfolios for a while, and they need to get out. They might be more worried about the financing markets in 2017 than they are announced. So I can think of the time we\u2019ve made a call, somebody has talked to them about their business that they haven\u2019t said come on over.", "Joe Ritchie", "That's interesting color and helpful. Maybe switching gears a little bit, you mentioned some of the known headwinds in the first half with Puerto Rico and Toronto. As we look into the second-half ramp, what do you need to see from an order standpoint? And how important is the second quarter to hit your organic growth ramp in the second half?", "Brian Jellison", "Well, what happens is, if you just think about the things that are going away that are reflecting us negatively. I mean if you adjusted for all of our headwinds, which is ridiculous. When you adjust for everything, it's bad. But if you really look through headwinds, we would have been up over 3.5% organically. So the idea that we are going up 2 to 4 organically over the course of the year is not a big challenge. I mean we should do pretty well in the second half, now things that can effect that are going to be the adoption rate of new products and some versions of software that are rolling out in second half, but you never know what those adoption rates will look like, great.", "So if they are high then we have a much better opportunity to get to that midpoint number above if they are moderate then it's harder. The second thing on the tolling projects, we have an enormous amount of bid activity right now. But there is never anything us as a supplier can do to influence the beginning or the execution of those projects.", "So if they go at an expected pace then that helps, if they go as a slow pace that it\u2019s not particularly helpful and then last year we got nothing, out of the year-end instrumentation businesses in terms of seasonality, that\u2019s the only time that\u2019s happened in a decade. So we would expect to get some more modest returns to seasonality in the fourth quarter in those instrumentation businesses. So those are the things that will determine where we\u2019re at, but within our guidance we\u2019re certainly comfortable that we\u2019re going to be within our guidance for the year irrespective of what happens with Q2 orders.", "Operator", "Then we\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Tusa with JP Morgan", "Stephen Tusa", "Just a quick one on healthcare. What do you think for the second quarter organic? And then these acquisitions are obviously crushing it. Just remind us of the impact on the ones that are coming in in the second quarter. And then when you say they're growing strong, I think its Strata and Data Innovations. Are you talking these things are growing 20% plus? Just trying to understand those dynamics because the acquisitions coming in are a big driver.", "Brian Jellison", "So as far as the segment is concerned, we expect that we are up in high single digits in the second quarter on an organic basis and that is aided a little bit by those acquisitions that turn organic because they\u2019ve been growing, you\u2019re right are well into the double digits even above 20% or maybe a little more. And so they add a couple of points to us for that --.", "Stephen Tusa", "And those combined last year were like $25 million, something in that range, in the quarter?", "Brian Jellison", "[Multiple speakers] quarter.", "Stephen Tusa", "Okay. And then so if you're doing flat in the second quarter to get to 3%, the midpoint of the range organic, it looks like you have to do something in the 7% range in the second half of the year. You mentioned mid-single digits as a tweener. I think some companies we cover would round that up to high single digits to make it look better. But for you guys you're a little more conservative with your messaging. Is that the right math we're talking about? Do you think there's a chance you're in the 7% range in the second half? ", "Brian Jellison", "That\u2019s the high end of our guidance absolutely.", "Stephen Tusa", "O", "Brian Jellison", "If you go to the 4% you\u2019re absolutely right on the math. So kind of we\u2019re at the midpoint, it\u2019s closer to the 6% range for the second half.", "Stephen Tusa", "Okay. Got it. Thanks. Sorry, one more on Neptune, sorry about that, more detail. What was the debooking there? I haven't heard that term that you guys have used before.", "John Humphrey", "We didn\u2019t have any fee booking at that time. That was in radio frequency software where we had a situation in the UK that we really decided with all parties would we better if they did something other than what they were asking us to do. So we debooked a couple of million dollars in the quarter.", "Stephen Tusa", "And that comes through in orders obviously. But that's reflected in your orders number or is that adjusted out?", "Brian Jellison", "Yes. That\u2019s right. ", "Stephen Tusa", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Robert P McCarthy with Stifel.", "Robert McCarthy", "Following up on some of these questions that have been raised, the second half organic growth outlook, are you going to have a better sense on the 2Q call what the adoption rates are going to be that drive the variability in your guidance, or is it not something you're going to know until mid 3Q?", "Brian Jellison", "Better view on the tolling project we\u2019ll have a widely different view on product launches, little bit in the medical products, a little less so on the software version update. But I think maybe you want to think about the fact, we saw we have this sort of artificial, we thought it is real, but we have a 3% to 4% organic drag because in Puerto Rico that goes away right Toronto goes away. So, so many things go away in the segments and they wind up with, if they were growing 3% to 4% organically, some are already growing 3% organically they are just. ", "Robert McCarthy", "Right. And my only question is, can you declare victory one way or the other on the guide when you report in July, or is it still going to be unclear, is my question.", "John Humphrey", "We never declare victory until the game is over?", "Robert McCarthy", "Or you do a big deal. Now, moving on to the restructuring, obviously that's something to be applauded. You do a lot of restructuring. It flows through numbers. Do you have a size across the segments or any flavor we can give? Obviously the returns are incredibly high in terms of what you do. But anything around the narrative around restructuring that would be helpful?", "Brian Jellison", "All the restructuring is centered around the oil and gas businesses and so a substantial amount of that is Roper pump which is virtually all off -- not, almost all upstream and has just collapsed. I mean it takes your breath away if you look at the numbers in the first quarter of \u201914 versus here. So, we\u2019ve done quite a bit of restructuring there and we\u2019ve done some restructuring at compressor controls and we\u2019ll continue to do more because their underlying service revenue will continue to be good and even grow. Plus the project activity around Compressor Controls will be off quite substantially. So Q2, I\u2019m going to guess $2 million additional as some of these European things finally come to bore. Be less than 3 million or 4 million in the last six months I\u2019d say.", "John Humphrey ", "And to put a little bit of more context on this. If you look at the number of people and industrial technology is down 10% more it was last year, saying first quarter this year versus first quarter last year. And then our energy segment it\u2019s down, I think 7% or 8%. So our costs unlike most other companies, our cost or people related. We never like to brag about having to reduce people, but when volume goes down, it\u2019s a necessary part of the retrenchment process. And so to put a little bit of contacts around that right, we\u2019ll take big restructuring charges that cost a lot of cash, so you have to close down factories or take out capacity. But we have had quite a substantial reduction in the number of people, who workforce in those two segments.", "Brian Jellison", "And Robert where you really see it, look at the detrimental margins and energy and you can see that they\u2019re dramatically lower than the gross margin. So people really do a great job and find tuning things.", "Robert McCarthy", "The last question would be just around the portfolio. This has been asked before so it's not exactly novel. But would you consider just separating into two companies, just allowing -- obviously taking the playbook of a noted competitor and then thinking about pursuing the higher growth opportunities? Do you think there's any crowd-out there that hurts the businesses that perhaps don't have quite the characteristics that your best businesses have?", "Brian Jellison", "Well, the reality is that, if you look at the industrial and energy businesses, they just have outstanding independent results, right. So they\u2019ve been kind of consolidated businesses with 30% EBITDA. They get all the internal investment they need and they throw off positive cash. So our view on that at least for now is good brief. I mean, why wouldn\u2019t you want to have a portfolio that you could deploy all of your cash into the highest possible returning businesses.", "So why keep the capital deployment model by forcing to invest in businesses with inherently lower returns than the technology businesses with inherently higher returns, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense for our investors. From an investor view point, if you split the industrial and energy, you\u2019re going to redeploy cash and stuff that produces dramatically lower returns than the high stuff, I don\u2019t know why investors would like us for doing that.", "Robert McCarthy", "Thanks for your time.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.", "Christopher Glynn", "Good morning. Brian, just wondering if, as it sounded, perhaps you're foreshadowing that Roper will switch to a cash-based preamortization earnings model. ", "Brian Jellison", "Well, I don\u2019t think so. We\u2019ll continue to watch what people say about that. There is GAAP really does distort a lot of things around cash. So I think we\u2019re content with showing people what the GAAP number is and what the non-GAAP number is. This particular year though, because all acquisitions come in, the loss of non-cash amortization. So it doesn\u2019t show up in operating profit, it distorts the number. So we want to have people understand that things are absolutely fine here. But we haven\u2019t gone to the point of saying, well here is what the cash earnings are, here is our share count and that\u2019s the earnings, cash earnings per share basis.", "Christopher Glynn", "Okay.", "Brian Jellison", "We think investors are smart enough to figure that out.", "Christopher Glynn", "Okay. And then perhaps another area where there's a little distortion from the sales of the acquired businesses. You talked about the added amortization component of SG&A but that was up a lot, too. Is that an area to whittle away at the deals and that contribution on SG&A to sales? Or is your comment on ramping up RD&E a more important thought there?", "Brian Jellison", "I\u2019m not sure we understand that question Chris. So there is a lot of happens. When you do an acquisition, say you do a $1 billion acquisition. You\u2019re going to have 2.5% or 3% or maybe more of the purchase price filling into non-cash amortization. So if you deploy a $1 billion are going to have all that cash deployment that\u2019s gone into something never coming back, it\u2019s not like capital reinvest that\u2019s continued to reinvesting and the depreciation is a call in the future. So that non-cash amortization on the billion might be $30 million. So it shows up in GAAP as a reduction in operating profit, when in reality it\u2019s an increasing cash earnings. So that\u2019s all we\u2019re talking about.", "Christopher Glynn", "Right. Yes, I guess I worded my question poorly. But even independent of the 120 basis points you called out, SG&A to sales was still up a good bit, so I was just wondering.", "Brian Jellison", "We\u2019re absolutely investing in product management. I mean, just like we said R&D is up 120 basis points. Our sales investments and product management they\u2019re excelling, they\u2019re probably up another 110 basis points. That isn\u2019t going to change. We\u2019re going to continue drive for long-term growth.", "John Humphrey", "And as we continue to really become much more of a technology company as oppose to manufacturing company. SG&A is that\u2019s where our value add is for customers. It\u2019s not really in the cost of goods sold line. It\u2019s about whether you\u2019re able to machine the widget more efficiently than the next guy. If the intellectual capital which is inherent in the Research & Development, it\u2019s in the engineering, it\u2019s in the customer support and customer application people, show up as G&A. But those are value added resources for us. And as we continue to be more of a technology company, that\u2019s how our P&L will continue to look like with less cost of goods sold and more on the SG&A side. Not as a cost to be reduced, but as an investment in the value producing parts of our enterprise.", "Christopher Glynn", "Perfect. Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "And now we\u2019ll end our question-and-answer session for this call.

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results. Press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.ropertech.com.", "If we please turn to slide two, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in on our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.", "Next slide. Today, we will be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also as a part of this presentation on our website.", "For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of two items. First, the $2.5 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue or software acquisitions that we've made. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized, if not for our acquisition. Second, a small inventory step up expense, related to the acquisition of RF IDeas last year in the fourth quarter.", "Now, if you please turn to slide four, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We'll take a quick look at sort of summary of the enterprise financial results here in the quarter, and then look at individual performance of the segments and the outlook for each segments and then turn to the guidance for the remainder of the year and go to Q&A. So, next slide is simply the introduction to the Q2 enterprise results; next slide is the explanation of those.", "So, orders were actually up to a record $956 million. They were up 9% in the quarter and our book-to-bill for the enterprise was 1.02. Revenue was up 5% to $934 million versus last year's first quarter. Organic revenue was down 2%. We had the divestiture that's still in our numbers through the third quarter, the ABEL divestiture, which pulls 1% away and acquisitions were up 8%.", "We had really terrific growth in medical and in software, and water, we'll talk more about that within those respective segments. But the oil and gas declines were actually worse than we expected. We went into the year thinking that we'd be down maybe in the high-teens to 20%. In the quarter, we were down 25%, but in the upstream areas, we were down dramatically more, 44%, 51%, 52% numbers that really were amazing for us. Those are across all businesses, so they all are directly EPS-type businesses because they don't have much in a way of non-cash amortization.", "The toll and traffic project delay was also a little bit of a disappointment that Saudi is rolling out their program slowly. We're on track with everything we do, but their rate of initiation of new zones has been slow. Our gross margin was another record, up 90 basis points to 61% and EBITDA was up to $314 million, 33.6% of revenue.", "Our DEPS number at $1.56 was disappointing from our perspective, because it did hit the low end of the range, but in a quarter where we had record orders or record sales, record backlog and record EBITDA and operating profit, we've just came up a little light on the revenue side from the oil and gas and project delays, each of which probably cost us $6 million to $7 million of revenue and that's why we were at $1.56 million at the low range instead of being up at the higher end of $1.61.", "Our operating cash flow was $170 million, which was strong in Q2. Year-to-date our operating cash flow has been $414 million which is 23% of revenue and that's a particularly pleasing number when you're going through the sort of oil and gas decline that you could still maintain these kind of ratios.", "Our recent acquisitions are performing well. We have an extremely strong pipeline, which is very active. We'll talk about it in a little bit. So it was a solid quarter, but we did have to adjust our outlook for the economic realities that we see in the second half of the year and we'll talk about that when we get to guidance.", "Next slide, here we're looking at the Q2 income statement. As you can see orders up 9%, book-to-bill: 1.02x, revenue up 5%, gross profit was up 6%, gross margin up 90 basis points. The operating income ratio is 27.4% versus last year's 28.5%, but as you can see amortization increased by $10 million and our EBITA performance, if we were reporting that way was lot better in terms of continued sustained upward trends in our ratios.", "The earnings before tax number was down 2% and the tax rate was a relatively big headwind in the quarter, although the tax rate is really sort of appropriate for us at 29.8%. Last year, we had an extremely unusual event in the Q2 numbers, which was $15.9 million of a good guide that came from a long-term settlement of a tax position. And that really \u2013 that $1.70 if you adjusted it for the $0.16 for that one-time benefit would have been $1.54 and this year we're at $1.56.", "Next slide. If we look here at the revenue bridge, I think most people find this to be quite surprising. The underlying core nature of the business is continuing to grow at double digits. Here you can see, if we looked at last year's second quarter, we printed $892 million. That included the $10 million Puerto Rico situation that we were trying to get out of because of all the reasons everybody knows, we were successful, but it's still in the number in the second quarter at $10 million. Then we have the divestiture of the Eastern German pump company for $6 million and then the oil and gas decrement in the second quarter alone was $33 million.", "So, those things were a $49 million headwind. If you look at the base spend at $843 million, you'll see we added $91 million to that number. So while the total revenue is up 5%, the revenue excluding the oil and gas and these things that are anniversarying, was up 11%. It's really almost identical to what happened in the first quarter or if you exclude oil and gas and Puerto Rico and the divestiture, we were also up 11%.", "The good news is that for the balance of the year, we think the second half will be similar, where we'll be up more than 10% excluding oil and gas, but we'll have a better organic growth, so they'll be a little less in the acquisition dollars and more in the organic growth dollars or at least until we do another acquisition. So, actually we felt the growth is pretty solid despite the headwinds.", "Next slide. Here, you can see that we continue with the governance process we had to make, remarkable progress in our asset-light business model. Two years ago, our inventory was at 6% of revenue and at the end of June this year, it's down to 5.1%, so a 90-basis point improvement. Receivables actually declined from 17.7% to 16.9%. So, we've got a faster receivables, and payables and accruals went up, as we'd like from 17.4% to 18.9%. So, we literally cut our working capital as a function of annualized sales in half in the last two years from 6.2% to 3.1% and that really speaks to the quality of the work that all of our independent operating people do executing our strategy.", "Next slide. On cash flow performance, again extremely good cash flow performance. Year-to-date, it's $414 million, which is 23% of revenue or free cash flow was 22% of revenue and our operating cash flow conversion was 132%. And note on this slide, you'll see in, two years ago our year-to-date cash flow had been $353 million and last year we printed $433 million, but $20 million of that was a onetime payment by Puerto Rico, as we got out of that situation with Puerto Rico. So, it's real money, but it was a onetime event. So, you take the $20 million, you're looking at $413 million and this year's $414 million, our cash performance will be even stronger in the second half, but still conversion is great.", "Next slide. From a balance sheet performance perspective, we continue to be very well positioned. You can see that, we've got a completely undrawn revolver of $1.850 billion at the moment, up from $1.185 billion last year. So, if you look at the cash and undrawn revolver, you're getting about $2.5 billion. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is $1.267 billion so our net debt number to EBITDA is running about 1.9 times. And that's after in that 12-month period, we've invested $1.450 billion. So, after $1.45 billion we still have a $1.9 billion debt-to-EBITDA number. So, ample liquidity we've got a very active pipeline. And really most of the numerous acquisitions that we're involved with now in late stages are application software companies and it's likely we'll be doing something soon.", "Next slide. Here, we'll look at the individual detail, and the outlook for each one of the segments. Next slide, all four segments continued to perform remarkably well. When you look at the kind of fall off in oil and gas that affects the Energy business, and to a lesser degree the Industrial Technology because Roper Pump is sitting in there. Here these two are clipping along with Energy at 26% EBITDA to revenue, and actually sequentially up from the first quarter, and Industrial Technology at 31%. So, those remain remarkable performance numbers. RF/software business at 38%, Medical at 43% as you can see in the Enterprise as a whole running at 37% without the corporate expense.", "Next slide. So, we'll take the largest segment first, which is Medical. Here you can see that revenue was up 12%. That came from eight points of acquisition and four points overall organic revenue, although imaging pulled that down by a point. So Medical organic in the quarter was 5% which is the 10th consecutive quarter that our Medical organic revenue has been mid-single digits or better and we certainly don't see that slowing.", "Growth was really led by the adoption of new products in three of our Medical product companies and software businesses as well. We had strong adoption of our Alternate Site Healthcare Solutions businesses where SHP and SoftWriters were growing at a very high rate and our internal software within MHA did well as well. Our new product launches at Sunquest, which would be very important for 2017 and hopefully important yet as the year winds down are launched and on schedule. We've got the sales pipeline which is growing, growing really rapidly and we have a couple of large people that we're talking to but you would expect to begin to see that affect the second half results favorably which you'll see below.", "In the second half, we think that the organic growth in Medical is going to be in the sort of 6% to 9% range. The product growth that we have in the core products is going to continue, we think that trend. The alternate site growth strengthens here because we are getting some real push out of SHP and SoftWriters becoming organic rather than just acquisitions. And then we actually have some favorable comps that will benefit MHA as the year unfolds.", "The laboratory software orders are going to increase on the adoption of many new products and while there are literally over 15 different things, that are being launched there are four core large launches around analytics and diagnostic communities and integrated pathologies and clinical content that we think will drive the future of Sunquest.", "Our imaging businesses are going to benefit in the second half as the cryo-EM technology emergence is getting better understood by people, and sort of our phones are ringing off the hook. They have a strong backlog going into the second half and their product releases are on schedule. Importantly, and here when you look at the operating profit margin, you see 33.7% which is down from the prior year, couple of reasons for that. The newer acquisitions have a lot of amortization. In fact, the second quarter number at 33.7% for OP, when you add back the non-cash amortization of 7.9%, you wind up at 41.6% or the every dollar of revenue contributing. And on an EBITDA basis it's nearly 43%. So, a good mix between Medical products and software and service, and then imaging should do better in the second half.", "Next slide. In the RF segment, which is really now increasingly a split between RF and software, you can see revenue was up 14%, acquisitions were up 18%, organic was down 4% but the organic revenue on our software and SaaS business segment was up 9%. Our toll and traffic had very strong orders but our revenue declined because of the Puerto Rico contract which finally anniversaried in the second quarter. So, that's a $10 million headwind that goes away.", "And then the Riyadh project is moving much more slowly. It could easily be $20 million less than what we were told earlier in the year, which is part of the reason for our guide down on the earnings profile. It's still going to continue to happen. The contribution margin we're getting as it rolls out is fine, it's just that it's moving more slowly. And it's not the only thing going into Saudi Arabia these days, it's moving very slow.", "We had very strong segment book-to-bill here at 1.09. Orders were up 26% with organic orders being up 9%. Again, lots of amortization in this segment. So you see an OP margin of 31.5%, which is up 20 basis points. But when you add back the amortization, which is 5.8% of revenue and the segment and you see the EBITA number is $37.3 million, the EBITDA number is $38.1 million, up 190 basis points from the second quarter of last year.", "We see at the bottom here in terms of forecasting revenue for the balance of the earnings, the segment organic revenue, we think will be up 5% to 7%. Toll and traffic will improve in the second half. We've gotten strong orders in Q2. The execution of those should be pretty favorable. And we have a big pipeline of opportunity. What has caused us to slow down the guidance for the balance of the year is that decision-making process around that has been slower than normal whether that's related to an election situation with people wondering about kind of ensuring their commitments, it's something that's not clear.", "Our software and SaaS businesses continue to grow at high-single digits with incredible cash returns that earns other investments and acquisitions. And then RF IDeas business and our On Center acquisitions from last year will go to organic in the fourth quarter, which is why you'll see this bigger mix of organic in the second half of the year and less on acquisitions than you did in the first two quarters.", "Next slide. On the Industrial Technology segment, here you can see that orders declined, well actually orders were up 3%, but the organic growth's declined by 1%, the divestiture was 3%. The organic, if you exclude oil and gas and Industrial was up 4%. The problem with this segment was simply that the upstream was worse than expected for Roper Pump and we'd expected a big down, but it was down 44%. It's a little bigger than we had anticipated. The good news is that it does appear that that's the bottom of the situation and of course Roper's Pumps' impact for the segment has dramatically deescalated as their revenue has dropped so much over the last two years.", "Neptune on the other hand is doing extremely well. They had double-digit growth in the second quarter on both orders and revenue. They continue to gain share in the marketplace despite people read about other people that are trying to sell their businesses. Neptune will continue to have record performance.", "The material analysis portion of the business, sort of test and measurement had record orders in the second quarter, which is very encouraging as their revenue had been down sort of high-single digits. So, that bodes well for the second half.", "If you look at the second half, we think that the overall organic revenue in the business will be flat because we don't see any improvement in the upstream markets. Although, there's a declining impact in the segment as the underlying base business at Roper Pump is getting very small. Neptune and instrumentation will be able to offset any of the declines we have in oil and gas. And finally in the fourth quarter the divestiture will anniversary and go away.", "Next slide; here we look at the Energy Systems and Controls segment. You can see that revenue there was down 15% and it's really a tale of two different businesses, the test and measurement business which was okay, and then the oil and gas businesses which were off. So, oil and gas was down 25% in the segment, and that really doesn't quite tell the story either because our petroleum analyzer business excluded a small portion of upstream and has \u2013 was really flat with actually improved profit contribution.", "But compressor controls, which is a high margin business was down by more than a third in revenue and de-levered at a quite high rate. We do feel that, from here, it's no longer is negative on a comparison basis as we started to see of course, some softness throughout the year. We did have sequential margin improvement. You can see the OP margin came in at 22.5% and this segment has some amortization which brought it to 25.8% and EBITDA a little higher. The OP margin in the first quarter was 20.4%, so we ticked up 210 basis points of sequential margin improvement.", "In the second half of the year, we think that the organic revenue in Energy is likely to be down between 7% and 10%, which is really driven by the continued lack of improvement in any of those oil and gas businesses. We do have an easier comp in the fourth quarter in those oil and gas businesses. They're normal. So there maybe some optimism there and a fourth quarter seasonal increase, we assume will be similar to what it was last year, which was not very good and that could be a positive surprise.", "The industrial test and measurement businesses will continue to improve. They're doing pretty well now, certainly in a low-to-mid single-digits growth mode and the margins there are going to continue to improve. And so that's quite good and the orders book-to-bill in the segment's about 1, so this seems to be pretty well under control.", "And we're into the guidance here, next slide, the outlook for the year, we took the full year down to $6.57 to $6.71, which gives you a mid-point, I guess of $6.64, which is certainly lower than what we had before. It's being driven by the more severe downturn in oil and gas. We thought maybe we'd be down in the neighborhood of $75 million in oil and gas for the year, but it \u2013 we're going to be down more like $100 million, so that's a $25 million revenue hit. And then the project push-outs in tolling were another sort of $20 million, $25 million. And then there's currency that we didn't have, Brexit and other factors and currency is another $10 million. So there's about $60 million revenue hit there and you can assume that comes in at close to 50% on a contribution basis. And then the rest is really just recognition of a somewhat lower global growth environment, so we think that takes a point or maybe two points off of the organic growth versus what we expected when we initiated guidance at the very beginning of the year.", "We did a very through bottoms up review for guidance this time with all of our senior operating people involved, and really kind of rebuilding what everybody had to assure ourselves that we were very comfortable with whatever the guidance we're going to put in place. We really could have some things that will become favorable for us. The factors that brought it down, oil and gas, severity, project delays and tolling, global growth challenges, maybe there's a little optimism there, but we're not ready to embed any of that in our guidance.", "In terms of an upside, certainly the toll projects could accelerate. I think the people had a clear view of what's going to happen with the election. They might have a better idea about whether they think they're going to be personally benefited or not economically from policy.", "The product launches that we have could ramp faster than we have in our guidance, so it'd be nice but you know, you never know. And then our capital deployment, which we certainly expect to have more of will augment growth as the year unfolds, but it's not in our guidance numbers.", "We look at kind of forward revenue and EBITDA leverage, and the EBITDA leverage is riding (24:45) a little better than a third of new revenue. So even with the deleverage we got from oil and gas, we're still having overall net positive EBITDA leverage on new revenue. And if we, what else we've got, the sort of organic growth is 2% to 4% with revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the second half. If we did a bridge, like we did at the beginning of the presentation, you'd see it would show similar results with the revenue being up by 10% or more excluding oil and gas.", "Second half tax rates are probably around 30% and then in the third quarter, we're looking at $1.59 to $1.63.", "Next slide, here if we look at the summary of what happened in the quarter, you can see for us, we normally we'd talk about the fact that we had record orders and backlog, record sales and operating profit and EBITDA, all of which is good. The margins are good, but we hit the lower end of the guidance, so we just didn't feel like leading what was kind of record results when we were a little bit disappointed on the actual EPS number.", "Orders, as we said were an all-time record and up 9% with the backlog at $1.14 billion and a book-to-bill well above $1 billion. So, we're well positioned to continue to have a stronger second half. We get rid of the $10 million-a-quarter drag from Puerto Rico beginning now, here in the third quarter and we get rid of the drag on the divestiture of ABEL in the fourth quarter, so little bit of a drag in Q3.", "Revenue being up 5%, we were able to do that because we had sort of high-single-digit, low-double-digit growth between medical, software and water, which allowed us to survive greater than 40% reduction in our upstream oil and gas businesses. Gross margin at 61%, we feel very good about that. The EBITDA margin is fine, likely to improve in the second half a little bit. Operating cash flow is the same thing, 132% conversion and $414 million. It will be stronger, as it always is in the second half. So, we're quite comfortable with where we are on the operating cash flow.", "Back in 2014, our oil and gas business was a little above $500 million and 14% of the company. And in 2015 that had dropped to around $400 million and about 11.5% of the company. And today, we think it will finish the year out at around $300 million, which will be less than 8% of the company and the upstream portion is going to be less than 2% (27:29) of the company, with the midstream being around 6%. So the worst is behind us for this kind of change and we're looking forward to that.", "We've got a very active pipeline. We're open on quite a few deals. We said at the beginning of the year, we'd expect to deploy $1 billion, but $275 million awarded thus far. And it's not going to be difficult to find a way to deploying that level of activity.", "We still have a great opportunity to continue to compound results. It really continues to drive our strategy. So, we've got our underlying core businesses doing relatively well on a growth perspective. It's just that the oil and gas and unique situation with Puerto Rico which was a win for us, even though it shows up negatively in the first half revenue, keeps us all of our strategies alive and we're very comfortable with our ability to compound results from here out.", "So, with that, we'll open it up to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. We will take our first question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey. Good morning, Deane.", "Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, Brian or John, I was hoping, you could start with bridging the guidance for third quarter and fourth quarter, just looks like the guidance cut here this morning is weighing higher obviously on the third quarter, down 12% versus consensus, but you're not as severe in the fourth quarter. And maybe is there some seasonality, is it the comps getting easier, better visibility on these product launches, but just some color there on the difference here, assumptions in the third quarter and fourth quarter?", "John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Deane. So, you did touch on it. So one of the things that we're expecting for this year is maybe not historically strong from a seasonality perspective but stronger than what we saw last year. And that's not just on the Energy businesses, but also on some of the other Industrial businesses that have some more seasonal activity as customers flush out some of their budgets. So we do expect that for the fourth quarter and that's why, you see slightly higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter as we look forward to this.", "My answer must have left everyone dumbfounded. Are we still live on the call here?", "Operator", "Yes, you're still live.", "John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay.", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Next question.", "John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So next question, Matt.", "Operator", "We will now hear from Robert McCarthy with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company.", "Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Deane must have dropped the mic. Good morning, everyone. How're you doing?", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey.", "John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "He must have. And well, if he comes back we'll insert him back into the queue.", "Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. In any event, maybe you can talk about the Medical business in terms of maybe amplifying your comments around the product launches, the favorable compares to MHA. And then what drives to 6% organic growth versus the 9% organic growth kind of for the back half?", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So we had \u2013 give Neil Hunn a chance \u2013 he's responsible for the Medical and software businesses there an opportunity to explain. The pipeline is growing candidly more rapidly than we could have even hoped for. And he can tell you a little bit about what these new launches at Sunquest are designed to do, so Neil with that fire away.", "Laurence Neil Hunn - Group Vice President-Medical Business", "Good morning. Yeah, the second half is \u2013 have strength across the board. I'll break it down by product and software. On the product side, there's new products at Verathon that continue to gain traction. On the software side, a number of \u2013 I think we've talked about before, a number of faster-growing software businesses turned organic, Strata, Data Innovations, SoftWriters, SHP. And then with the second half really at MHA, we see likely, well they are easier comps and then the market conditions around new customer adds give us an opportunity to do better in the second half than the first half.", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "But I think people are more interested with Sunquest, so let's just talk about the launch of the new \u2013 you've got four major offerings and then you've got mid-teens in terms of enhancements and upgrades at Matt's group are putting in place that we're already starting to solicit revenue. So you might explain what those things do.", "Laurence Neil Hunn - Group Vice President-Medical Business", "Well, Sunquest, very excited about Sunquest. The reality of the Sunquest is we have worked very hard for the last 18 months on a series of new products. We've talked about those number of new products that are being brand new or material upgrades or enhancement increases being in the high-teens. We're on track for all of that. We've just come off a great user conference at Sunquest, where the customers were excited about the roadmap and what was happening.", "We've seen a pretty meaningful increase in the pipeline, the sales pipeline, the sales funnel activities that you'd expect to see coming behind a large number of new products. We'd like to see that pipeline convert in the second half. We expect it to convert in the second half. So, we'll see bookings momentum and then that will give us the momentum heading into 2017 for Sunquest that we've talked about in the past.", "Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And switching gears to M&A capital redeployment. I think the messaging maybe up until this call has been a little more muted in kind of the second quarter given where public valuations are for a lot of companies, given where the cost of funds is. Maybe can you just talk about \u2013 do you think it's a difficult environment to transact deals, just given political uncertainly, a tentatively rising stock market, with an improving valuations and public fundamentals kind of bleeding into private fundamentals?", "And then kind of perhaps some of your companies thinking about the alternative route for initial public offerings. Could you just talk about how you look at this environment, and how do you think Roper's going to be able to transact in this environment and what kind of cadence you guys can transact in?", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think for us, it's kind of a perfect environment, although you're right about the pricing of assets and the expectation of sellers, is pretty high. But fortunately for us, we're not buying public companies and paying a premium for it. So, we're buying private companies that if they were public would trade at a higher value than they do trade in the private marketplace, which gives us always some beneficial arbitrage.", "There are as many things available in the acquisition market as I've ever seen. We have looked at billions of dollars of transactions this year, and we're directly engaged with a couple now that have a higher likelihood of closing, I think than the ones that we were looking at earlier in the year because of the quality of the business. Lot of the people that are running these private companies aren't interested in becoming public. They would much rather join our firm \u2013 at the public equity in our firm that and not have the quarterly calls and all of the things that you have to do with investors and banks. So we remain a very attractive home for people. And I think that the acquisitions we've made in the last couple of years give us a wider variety of things that we can look at. Application software has a huge number of potential verticals and there are lot of niches within them that the largest people that are, roll-up people aren't going to be interested in, so it's still a very favorable hunting ground for us.", "Now, the challenge I think for the multi-industry guys in buying things is they tend to not buy things that are as high a quality as what we're buying. And if you're in a marketplace where you're looking for synergies that are going to be driven by overhead absorption or business consolidation or administrative synergies or something, those businesses are trading at a disproportionately high price than where they normally would because the interest rates are so low.", "The highest quality businesses oddly enough, trade at a much deeper discount to public comps. People will look at Roper and, oh my gosh, look, they pay 12 times for something. Well, if you looked at the public company comp, it was trading at 25 times or 26 times. So, I think that people are focused on product-oriented, more asset intensive businesses that are trading at 12 times or 13 times because of very low interest rates and people are buying them for 12 times or 13 times or 14 times, we're not in that space. We're in a space where we're buying stuff at 12 times or 13 times or 14 times that if it were public would trade at a higher number because of our willingness and experience and how to effectuate those companies joining our public family.", "Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "If you indulge me to one last question and I apologize at the offset to be a little impolite, but do you think this is the last guidance cut we're going to face for 2016?", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I do. I've bet money on that.", "Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I'll leave it there. Maybe Deane will get back upon his seat.", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "We will now hear from Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. When you \u2013 I don't want to beat on Sunquest too much, you've really talked about it, but can you kind of get into a little bit more detail what these new products are actually? Like what actually are they, how are they expanding the platform and maybe talk a bit about the competitive dynamics in that market versus you guys and that bit of concern, how that's been progressing over the last maybe 12 months or something like that?", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, it's a great question Joe. So Neil, why don't you kind of explain these four core products and then all the enhancements.", "Laurence Neil Hunn - Group Vice President-Medical Business", "Sure. Well, I appreciate the opportunity. So let me give you a 30 seconds on the importance of what Sunquest does for our customers. So Sunquest customers are the largest, most complicated laboratories in the United States. These are laboratories that do millions of tests a year. And what our software does is automate from start to finish the laboratory processes. So you get super high quality results at low cost to operate the labs.", "So what Sunquest, the new \u2013 the turn of products ready at Sunquest is to extend that capability that's been steeped in the blood side or the fluid side of the lab and extend it to the other parts of laboratory. So first is a major product that is the integration of the pathologies inside a hospital. So it integrates the blood and to the tissue, to the molecular genetics, very important product for us and for our customers as they deliver medicine inside of their institutions.", "The second one is a completely refreshed view about how do you collect samples at the bed side. It's mobile enabled, it's integrated into a nurse workflow, important in terms of getting the draws correct, at the right location, with the right patient and get it to the laboratory as quickly as possible.", "The third category of new products is helping the hospitals extend their reach into the communities, importantly in the changing reimbursement landscape in U.S. healthcare, hospitals want the laboratory samples that are in the community, meaning where the physicians that feeds patients into their hospitals, they want the blood tests that are collected and all the laboratory tests that are collected in the physicians' offices to be routed into the hospitals or laboratory not just to drive volume in laboratory but to get the clinical information. And so we have a series of tools that integrate into the electronic medical records at the physicians' offices for ordering and resulting.", "And then finally, the laboratory space has been vacant of any meaningful analytics about how they run the operations, how they benchmark themselves against their peers and improve the operations. So we have a large analytics release that's happening in the second half of this year.", "Those are four net new opportunities. As we talked about earlier, there's a series of other meaningful upgrades. We've just released a major upgrade to our core clinical policy and our core blood bank. We've seen the opportunities associated with those upgrades number in the hundreds and so we're very excited about what the teams be able to build on a product perspective at Sunquest.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thanks for the color, it's really helpful. One, just kind of going with that, typically we see a pretty steep margin ramp in the second half for that segment overall and guessing most of us are probably in that boat right now. So, can you kind of talk us through what drives that historically, and is that something we should still think is applicable for this year?", "John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. It really is. It's something that we're expecting as well and it's truly volume driven. So, it's a \u2013 and this segment has our highest gross margins across the enterprise with gross margins that are north of 70%. Some of our businesses here even have gross margins above that. And so, as we see incremental growth on the top side, we expect that to fall through. And so that really is what drives the margin improvement as we go throughout the year.", "And, that's true on not only the software-type businesses like Neil was just talking about, but, also our products businesses and particularly at Gatan and some of our imaging business where they have very high gross margins because of all the technology and all the R&D that we invest there. It does result in high gross margin. So, if the volume increases, we expect that fall-through to improve, and that results in a higher margin in the fourth quarter than what we had throughout the first part of the year.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, good. And then, just last from me quick. On the order growth at RF Tech, is that driven more by TransCore, is that software related? I just want to kind of link that with your comments on who becomes president on the infrastructure side. It does seem like a lot of the road builders and those kind of guys see pretty positive outlooks right now. So, I want to see what you guys are thinking about that business in the U.S., particularly in the second half?", "John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, as far as the numbers are concerned \u2013 I'll turn it over to Brian on the commentary around the business outlook. But the order quarter growth was both on the toll and traffic side where the book-to-bill ratio was very strong 1.14 I believe. But it was also on the software side. Now, a little bit of that is seasonal, is our CBORD business, in particular, which serves the college, the university market. They have a lot of their renewals and upgrades and security applications that are booked in the second quarter and then delivered or recognized as revenue throughout the year. And so a little bit of that is seasonal, but we saw a fundamental growth on the software orders as well, but the largest reason for the book-to-bill being well above 1 is the backlog that's building on the toll and traffic side. Even though we've seen delays there, we still see fundamental growth happening there in the second half.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. Good morning guys.", "John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning Joe.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So, my first question's on the portfolio. Brian, clearly Energy's surprised to the downside, Industrial remains weak. But \u2013 and you guys are continuing to evolve as a technology company. I'm just wondering whether any of the end-market dynamics have kind of changed your view about the portfolio, wonder if there's any potential divestitures that you guys are considering.", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No. I'd say the answer is no. You know what, we went into the year thinking that we'd be down about $100 million on oil and gas, which comes in a little bit into Industrial, mostly into Energy. I'm sorry, thought we'd be down about $75 million, now we're going to be down $100 million. So, that $25 million extra negative situation on revenue is disappointing because it comes in at 50% or frankly 60% contribution. So, it's a big EPS number. It doesn't really diminish our cash performance by much at all. And, those businesses at the moment are just a free shot on goal for 2017 and 2018. They're on the books for well \u2013 extremely low basis. So, the only way if you were going to do something with them, you'd want to do either a straight spin or a sponsored spin or you'd want to do an RMT with somebody. It'd be safe to say that our phone's been ringing off the hook with people who want to do those kind of things. But we actually think there are substantial upside in those business, just not this year, and probably not in the first three quarters of next year.", "But, if they start cranking just modestly in 2018, we're going to have windfall kind of results. So, we'd prefer to hold on to them, continue to invest. The Industrial business was 26% EBITDA in the quarter for heaven sake. And, the Energy business, we got 31% in Industrial and 26% in Energy. So, I mean these are really good businesses.", "Most of our investors, when we talk to the long guys, their fear is, gee, if you put those someplace, how could we trust they can run them as well as you can. And, we always humbly say, well, maybe right. So, these are great businesses. They're just in a situation where if somebody's off 44% to 52%, it's incredible, but they're still able to perform at the levels they are because they're so nimble. So, I don't really see those as necessary sales. We know how to run, we know how to run them well. If they didn't have this extra $25 million headwind in the second half, our guidance reduction wouldn't have been so great. And then no one could predict what happened with what's going on in Saudi is certainly an interesting time and it's effected several of our businesses revenues in the second quarter, so.", "I think the underlying pieces for us is we've got some cash cow businesses that are at their absolute nadir. They're going to continue to drive a lot of performance over the years and they're a great annuity value for our investors.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got you. That's helpful color, Brian. Maybe switching gears, John, one quick question for you on the Medical and Scientific Imaging margins. In the first half of the year, down 250 plus basis points year-over-year. It looks like the D&A as a percentage of sales was roughly the same as last year. So I'm just wondering, were there any mix issues that impacted the first half as well beyond just the M&A?", "John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. I mean, the M&A does have an impact here, right, because we acquired CliniSys, which on an operating profit basis is below the segment average. And frankly, even on an EBITDA basis, it's below the segment average, right. Remember, the segment average here is in the low-40% EBITDA margin range. So the fact that CliniSys comes in at only in the 35%, maybe a little bit less than that EBITDA margin range even drags it down. So that is a contributor.", "And then the other piece is, frankly, the relative mix between \u2013 so our Medical growth so far this year. And in fact for the remainder of the year as well, although not as much in the fourth quarter has been driven more by product, Medical product sales, still terrific businesses and great margin but not the highest margin businesses inside the segment, which is really more of the software and services side. So it's more of a mix issue, but we see that mix issue actually moderating as we go throughout the year and to an earlier question that's why we see some fall through in margin expansion in the fourth quarter.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.", "Operator", "Our next participant is Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.", "Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks. Good morning.", "John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Morning.", "Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "If we look at the tolling and traffic timing, maybe dive into that a little bit more. I think you called out another $25 million or so second half headwind. I guess that's a mix of Riyadh and non-Riyadh pieces, but \u2013 is just a \u2013 does this project strength into the first half of in 2017, is that the best way to think about that?", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, there is no question about this.", "John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah.", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I mean, yeah that \u2013 the decision process \u2013 I mean look that decision's made, it's done, we've started, but we would have expected it to be in the thirties of millions of dollars and totally offset some of the issues with Puerto Rico. It's going to be above $10 million. How much above that is hard to say. If you'd really \u2013 they're doing a massive transit system over there. They've got lots of priorities. They're extremely happy with our performance. We're happy with the relationship. It's going to be extremely valuable over a long period of time, but in the short run, we're going to likely get at least $20 million less than we expected in the beginning of the year. And we've got somewhat less in the quarter. In this quarter and all of our numbers issues are really just around the severity of the upstream being far worse than we thought and the toll and traffic kind of stuff, if you look at the quarter is pretty significant. When you look at the year, it's easier to calibrate now.", "Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then the non...?", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You know just so you understand it's true, the projects are just getting pushed out. So if we're not having them now, they'll come in, whether they come in in the fourth quarter or they come in in the first quarter, they're going to come in.", "Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And that holds for Riyadh and non-Riyadh, correct?", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely correct.", "Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then the Neptune growth was really standout. Any lumpy there or is that just broad-based rich execution?", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think it's a combination of market share growth and all the normalized stuff and then them getting what we knew would be the lion share of new business from a customer that they didn't do much business with for the last couple of years. So, other people were talking about big revenue, we're showing big revenue.", "Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then, Energy Systems, you alluded to the \u2013 what's baked into the guidance is a weak 4Q seasonal ramp like last year, but you dangled positive surprise prospects in there. What's the kind of thought process behind dangling that?", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we just don't know. Last year was \u2013 normally you get \u2013 basically because people have a lot of MRO left at the end of the year, but we didn't see any benefit of that because people just shutdown. This year, all year along anybody who's in the upstream business would know that people are cannibalizing what they've got, nobody is buying anything, rental fleets are in distress. But there're an increasing number of signals that would say that the cannibalization of all the stacked horsepower business out there, at some point will turn into new orders in revenue. We just have no idea where it will be. We do expect a modest improvement in the fourth quarter of this year, versus last year and could it be even better, I don't know.", "Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you.", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Next we will hear from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.", "Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yes, good morning.", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, good morning.", "Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Brian or John, could you just speak for a second, the order number that you've put up there, what was the core order number in the quarter?", "John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Organically, orders were up 2%.", "Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Plus 2%, okay. And then, the assumption would be that that's pretty much driven by Med-Scientific is that reasonable core order?", "John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So the core \u2013 so the organic orders, I wanted to give that to you by segment. So, in the Medical segment it was plus 2%. In RF it was plus 9%. It was plus 2% in Industrial and minus 11% in Energy.", "Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Energy, okay. All right, I see. Okay. And then, also within the Med-Scientific piece of the business, could you just maybe sift through the core revenue growth, local currency was plus 4%. How did the Medical products do versus the software and SaaS business? Is it \u2013 I was just trying to pick up on the cadence there. The software and SaaS business effectively much better in the second half, how was it relative to the 4% core growth this quarter?", "John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. So, the Medical products was up, I know it was in the 9% or 10% range, with the medical, software and services up I think 1%. And so, as we go throughout the year, that relative mix probably changes a little bit out if it goes to 8.2% or if it goes to 7.3%, but it's in that range. Maybe even it stays at 8% then the medical, software and services comes up a little bit. But that's the relative contribution right there. There's also little bit of what we were talking about with the margin impact and the outlook for the rest of the year.", "Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "I understand. Okay. And then, just one last question for Brian. You had mentioned earlier in the M&A pipeline, it was full, the application software businesses. There were a lot of those prospects in there. Is there anything that Roper could do in that application software area that would have more scale? We've seen good success with Sunquest and MHA, and tucking in some related businesses at Sunquest, at CliniSys and GeneInsight and Atlas. And I'm curious, do we stay on that path with the \u2013 more of the bolt-ons to Sunquest and MHA or is there something in there with some scale that we could pull in?", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, it's a really good question. The answer is yes and yes. So, one of the incredible things about Sunquest and MHA is their platform status. So, if they allow us to do these incredibly attractive small acquisitions that we wouldn't do on our own. I mean, things like SoftWriters and Strata, and they're just really amazing. I mean, these are very high growth businesses and hopefully, we'll continue like that even though they're on a small base.", "If you look at the last large transaction was Aderant. There are a lot of things that are sort of the size of Aderant. And Aderant also offers us an opportunity for some bolt-on acquisitions to kind of grow its platform status. I would hope that the next acquisition we have is more like that where it's meaningful, it's something that we know how to do. People would be confident that we're already doing those kind of things. So that is likely what the next thing would be. Now, that said, this year we've looked at a number of very large transactions, and...", "Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "...those are always an interest. We're incredibly conservative and careful around those. But I would be disappointed in the next two years or three years if we didn't do a quite large transaction.", "Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "So, are there opportunities or targets in the pipeline that are not Medical-Scientific? I know Aderant was an exception there. But I'm thinking, anything literally it's a bad word these days, but something on the Industrial side that would be more software or SaaS, is there any of those opportunities in the pipeline?", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, there aren't a lot of Industrial situations. There are a few, but there are a lot of things that are not medical, that are vertical, just like Aderant is certainly not a Medical business.", "Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yes.", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Some of the other acquisitions we've made are not Medical at all. I think that you're likely to see some acquisitions that are not Medical at all, that's why we're kind of suggesting...", "Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "...there's a lot of attractive application software businesses that are immediately in front of us.", "Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And there are project management businesses that are out there. Quite a few of those that are very interesting, some which are sort of horizontal opportunities and others that are small vertical. So...", "Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We have enough internal intellectual capital to handle a large acquisition that would not be in the Medical space.", "Richard Eastman - Robert W.

The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast or also available on our Web site.", "Now if you will please turn to slide two. We begin with our Safe Harbor statements. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in on our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.", "And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our Web site.", "For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of two items. First, a $2.2 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized, if not for our acquisition. Second, $0.9 million debt extinguishment charge related to the replacement of our former credit facility with a new $2.5 billion facility that closed in the quarter.", "And now, if you will please turn to Slide 4, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?", "Brian Jellison", "Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody. We will start here with the Q3 enterprise results, so next Slide.", "We had a record for just about everything again in the third quarter. Our orders were an all-time record at $929 million, and by the way if we had booked the MTA order couple of days earlier but it wasn\u2019t quite ready to go, we would have been -- we would have had our first $1 billion order quarter in our history.", "Revenue was strong. Net earnings were, of course, a record EBITDA cash flow. Revenue was up 7% to $947 million, which gave us 2 points of organic growth despite the headwinds in oil and gas. FX costs us 1 point, and then acquisitions and divestitures netted out plus 6% because this was still the last quarter without all the divestment in.", "Growth was led by both the medical and RF technologies, software businesses and certainly Neptune. We had an outstanding quarter, you will see in a minute. Declines in oil and gas were basically about what we thought. We thought they would be sort of down 20% or so and they were. Gross margins were up 60 basis points to 61.3 and EBITDA was up 8% to $328 million. Our net earnings reached $169 million, which gave us a DEPS earnings per share number of $1.65 ahead of our guidance.", "Free cash flow was up 40%, really an astonishing quarter, where free cash flow was up 11% year-to-date but up 40% in the third quarter. And then our ConstructConnect acquisition, which we are announcing today, and which will close this week is another terrific business for us. It's a SaaS network business for the pre-construction industry, and we will detail that later in the call this morning, and it should close yet this week.", "So we had very strong cash quarter. We had record results and then we had this pre-acquisition. So the next Slide. Here if you look at the income statement, you can see orders were up 4%. The book to bill was 0.98, which is okay because of lumpy activity. It's in the wheelhouse but had we been able to book the MTA order, our book to bill would have been 1.05, which would give you just some idea about how strong really the core orders were. The only thing in the quarter that was odd is the normal fourth quarter delivery schedule stuff was not very strong.", "Revenue was up 7%. Our gross profit was up 8%. You can see we are up 60 basis points in gross profit. The operating income margin because of the acquisition and amortization in these things, you can see it going to 28.5%, which is still spectacular but down 20 basis points. The reality is, on the next Slide you will see the EBITA margin actually went up 30 basis points, which is the right way to look at a cash oriented business like ours. And then net earnings were up 4%. Tax rate at about what we thought.", "Next Slide. If you compare the operating and the EBITA margins, we certainly have not reported leading first with those kind of numbers, but our EBITDA margins, you can see in 2014's third quarter were 32.5%, last year at 33.4% and this year at 33.7%. So our margins on the operating cash side are up 120 basis points in just two years, and our gross margins continue up as well. If focusing on the operating profit margin where you get a lot of non-cash amortization charges which lead people to the wrong conclusion, it's the wrong way to think about a cash business like ours even though the results are outstanding.", "So we are really focused on continuing to improve our EBITA margins which were up 30 basis points. Next Slide. We continue to comp out cash flow at a quite strong clip and we don\u2019t see that slowing down any time soon. We really have a terrific operating cash flow in the quarter, $317 million, both operating and free cash flow were up 40% and you can see the comparison to last year at $660 million, year-to-date operating cash flow, and now we are at $731 million, up 11% despite less than robust end markets in our industrial and energy businesses.", "Conversion was pretty spectacular, you can see our year-to-date conversion on operating cash flow was 146%. So excellent cash performance. Next Slide. Our asset-light business model which five years ago people told me you couldn\u2019t make it any better than it was, continues to improve at really phenomenal rates. Here you can see inventories down 80 basis from two years ago, receivables are down 150 basis points, and payables and accruals are actually up 160 basis points.", "So, two years ago we had 5.8% net working capital to revenue in the way we measure it. Today, we closed the quarter at 1.9%, that\u2019s a 67% reduction as a function of revenue in just two years, 390 basis points. So the quality of the asset-light acquisitions that we have been doing the last couple of years in addition to our own governance process around improving everything we own, is really having just astonishing impact on our ability to compound cash and deploy future capital.", "Next Slide. If you look here at the financial position of the company, you get some sense of the balance sheet. Just as a quick note, this is absolutely the biggest balance sheet that we have ever had to capture capital employment opportunities. We now have an undrawn revolver of $2.5 billion, and we have $882 million of cash, so nearly $3.4 billion of powder, and even after paying for the ConstructConnect business, our acquisition powder is right around $2.8 billion.", "We have deployed capital since January 1 of 2015 at a rate of $2.7 billion during that 21-month period. So our compounding of the cash and the strength of the balance sheet and the flexibility that our new credit facility gives us, is all great because we are going to be able to put that to good use with an incredible acquisition pipeline that we continue to see. And you can see our net debt to EBITDA number is only 1.7. After the acquisition it's still just around 2. So we\u2019ve got a lot of ramp space here to be able to continue to make transactions that are accretive to the company.", "Next Slide. We will look at the segment detail of each of the four segments the way we had reported and then talk about the detail of the business here after that. So the next Slide. Here if we look at the Q3 segment performance of energy, you can see it's EBITDA margin was 29%, industrial tech 32%. The first point about thinking around these businesses is how remarkable there margin performance is in these challenging markets. The nimble execution that we have inside the presidents to run those businesses is really amazing.", "In 2003 those businesses, the industry and industrial businesses taken together, had about $377 million in revenue and this year taken together they had $303 million. And yet the EBITDA margin in '14 was 32% of those combined businesses and here this year it's 31%. So despite a significant fall off in revenue, the margins have been able to maintained. The second point of the Slide is that of course our future and nature of the enterprise you can see, continues to compound towards the RF, the application software, the medical software and the medical products businesses which now make up nearly 75% of the EBITDA of Roper's entire entity. And they also have done remarkably well. Two years ago those businesses had about 39% EBITDA, today those businesses have about 41% EBITDA.", "We look at the first, in our controls and energy systems now is down to barely 10% of the company, and its organic growth was down 13%, generally the way we thought it would be. The segment while down as expected really did modestly better than it did in the second quarter and is likely to do modestly better again in the fourth quarter. Terrific profitability. You know the OP margins in this segment in the third quarter were 25.4% and the EBITDA margins were 29.2%. When we look at the fourth quarter, we think oil and gas will be down about another 20% in this particular segment, same as it was in the third quarter but we don\u2019t think we are going to get much growth in terms of fourth quarter seasonality. We didn\u2019t get much last year but generally it's been quite substantial. So we are sort of assuming that we won't get that this year.", "Margins will improve again in the fourth quarter. You know we started the year out in energy with 20.4% OP. Second quarter went to 22.5%, the third quarter is already up to 25.4% and the fourth quarter will be substantially materially above that. So these businesses still in our view represent sort of a free shot on goal for us and the only represent 10% or less of revenue.", "Next Slide. On the industrial technology side, you can see that this is the, fortunately, the last quarter. We will talk about this divestiture of ABEL. If you adjust for the divestiture, the segment was actually flat despite the upstream oil and gas piece that\u2019s in industrial technology being down 35%. So how did that happen? Well, it happened from double-digit growth at Neptune who continues to gain market share and very strong demand for the R900 automatic meter reading and AMI technology with lots of migrating upgrades. We had a significant number of wins last quarter, over ten. And really the $50 million that we put into R&D in the last three years at Neptune has gotten us into a very outstanding position that people will begin to appreciate just how much we have done and how far advanced we are going to be over the next couple of years in this space.", "We did get some sequential improvement at Roper Pumps and that we expect to have a little bit better results again in the fourth quarter despite the basically that two other businesses in here that are really purely related upstream and have been severely hampered. The rest of our businesses in here, it's kind of test businesses, are all doing relatively well. Some of them actually have record quarters and on balance we don\u2019t see any deterioration in those businesses. In the fourth quarter we think we will have sort of similar revenue and margin performance to what we had in the third quarter. And while upstream markets are sequentially flat, there is a tiny bit of improvement that we are seeing.", "Next Slide. Here we look at the RF technology and software segment. It's really increasingly right to think about three legs in this segment with the RF product side of activity and then you have the tolling side of activity and then you have all this applications software business and of course now in addition to that with ConstructConnect. So here the businesses revenue was up 20% in the quarter, the operating profit was up 26%. The OP margin is 31.7% but the EBITDA margin was 38%, up 230 basis points.", "We had organic growth of 7% in the segment and had about one point of foreign exchange headwind and acquisitions helped by 14%. Very strong growth at toll and traffic on project activity in Florida and Texas, Pennsylvania. Sounds like swing states in the election. Continues high single digit growth in software led by freight matching and CBORD. We did some really exciting things at freight matching. We moved to a more modern software-friendly location in the Portland, Oregon area and that we have put together the freight matching networks of DAT in the U.S. and get loaded into a new software development. A process that\u2019s going to expand our customer base.", "We had double digit growth in the RF products business. Lot of that\u2019s driven by senior living. There are several of our businesses that touch senior living. And then toll and traffic would have had spectacular orders, of course, if we would have been able to book the bridge and toll project -- toll and tunnel project which we hoped would happen a little bit earlier in the year. We had a five year extension of our toll mandate in Dubai and the Saudi project sort of back on track. We wound up with our about 30 installations here in the fourth quarter we think which will get us to about 70 of the 350. So we feel much better about the progress in Riyadh.", "In the fourth quarter, TransCore was awarded the $70 million plus MTA project to convert nine bridges and tunnel around five boroughs. All of you who go back and forth in that are well aware of what that\u2019s like in others, like 800,000 people a day going through that process. And conversion with our Infinity technology will people to not have toll booths and there will be fines, of course based on video tolling. But if you have a normal toll tag you will be able to get through.", "The growth in toll and traffic we think will continue to manifest itself in the fourth quarter and certainly into 2017. The software business universally remains strong. We had kind of mid-single digit organic growth in the whole segment which gives really strong momentum going into '17, certainly the best position that we have had in the segment in a long time. And now we have acquired ConstructConnect which we will talk about here in a second, for $632 million. It's got about $150 million in revenue and sort of Roper type expected EBITDA margins which will get better as it gets inside the Roper to govern its process.", "Next Slide. So talking about ConstructConnect for a minute. We issued a separate press release on this. I think today is an interesting day in addition to being a record quarter, it's a record number of press releases. This is really an amazing business. When our teams made the trips and the diligence process, and working with Dave Conway's staff, you get to work in their training center and you can watch the network live. It's really -- it\u2019s just like watching the floor of the exchange with all this activity going, you realize how many people are interacting with this thing. They have $55 billion of bid activity. It's just remarkable. It's like our freight matching network where something is up for maybe 1, 1.2 seconds, before it's grabbed by somebody else in the network and here you are seeing all this usage around the data which is just unprecedented that is inside the network that\u2019s accessible to everybody.", "So it's all cloud-based technology. The network allows people to see what projects are coming up. They can see what contractors, form their own opinions about who might be competing for it, what the call up is for everyone's specifications. There are also going to be benefitted by the way because they will work together with our On Center business that was just dry wall construction only. And their own niche things that are going to be able to fold into ConstructConnect going forward. Those 800,000 users were laughing about this -- in preparation of the call, basically there is 800,000 people that use the bridge and tunnels in New York every day. So we have decided to, perhaps every person going through the tunnel represents the ConstructConnect user.", "This business is headquartered in Cincinnati. It's revenue for next year should be something, hopefully about $150 million. It's got to generate something in the $50 million plus of EBITDA to us and remember lots of non-cash amortization in these things. So terrific cash business. It will meet all of our acquisition requirements. It's got a great management team. Dave's been running this business through its acquisition phase and through its evolutionary shaping of the preconstruction industry. So he really is the domain expert. Very high recurring revenue. It's a subscription business. So you have all those great cash characteristics. It has deferred revenue so have very few assets of any kind, and it really has multiple growth opportunities. And that\u2019s another reason why we have found it to be a very attractive acquisition. I think a great home for ConstructConnect who can now focus really on continuing to shape the evolution of the pre-construction industry.", "Next Slide. The medical and scientific imaging business. You can see here we were up 12%. 8% on acquisition, 4% on organic. A little less than one point of negative FX but around its down as opposed to up. The medical businesses are 85% of this segment and they grew organically at 5% and interestingly throughout the year, the medical businesses have grown organically at 5%. Each one of the separate businesses are sort of hospital software or alternate type solutions business and the medical products, all three groups grew. Sunquest, the way we look at order intake is surely different than bookings against the entire business because there are so much recurring revenue that doesn\u2019t really change from a bookings space. But on an order intake basis, they had a record and the third quarter was up by the most it's ever been.", "Scientific imaging was about 15% of the segment. It did okay in the third quarter. It had modest growth but actually it's a bifurcated situation where the life science portion, because of cryo-EM market opportunities, grew over 100% in the quarter, while the physical science business continued to be pretty weak and was down about 20%. So the opportunity in front of these businesses is best it's ever been. In the fourth quarter, we think we will have continued mid-single digit growth for the medical businesses, led really by the Alternate Site Solutions business.", "Scientific Imaging we think will be terrific on demand and bookings for new products but most of those probably will have early 2017 deliveries, which is another reason that you maybe get some here in the fourth quarter, we would just have to see, but we are going to assume that mostly that\u2019s going to be the first half of next year. Okay. The next Slide is the guidance update. Turning to page, here is the specifics on the guidance. We are going to go in -- for the fourth quarter we had $1.77 to $1.89. It's a broad range, probably not really a broad range given how much money we make and how few shares we have. So seasonality in the industrial and energy business is not something that we think will help this year. We could be wrong about that and if get normal seasonality, then we will towards the higher end of the range.", "The New York City MTA ramp is very important in the fourth quarter. There was a commitment to get the first three projects completed by January 1 and how that project ramps will have a direct effect on whether we are towards the low or the higher end of the guidance. And then customer preferences around delivery. We talk of third quarter orders were satisfactory but not carrying immediate delivery kind of results. So I think there is some hesitancy in the industrial and energy markets about exactly when they want things that they are booked and committed to.", "The full year guidance, given the fourth quarter addition to our year-to-date results, would give us somewhere around $648 million to $660 million. Most of our internal projections and external projections are on around $655 million to $660 million. Full year cash flow conversions would still be spectacular, 140% or so. And that will allow us despite terrific oil and gas headwinds this year to have 5% to 6% revenue and EBITDA growth for the year.", "Next Slide. If we look at the summary of how we did in the third quarter, it's kind of a long list of good things. We got record orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Four standout businesses there. Medical software, tolling and Neptune were really quite good. Because, remember, we got 20 plus negative on the energy side of the business. EBITDA got up to 34.6% of revenue and our free cash flow was phenomenal.", "The New York City MTA bridge and tunnel all electronic tolling project, we really expected to win this for sometime but the news about it, the commitment around it didn\u2019t come until last Friday. So we have been planning for a Q4 kick-off and we will do what we said we will do for them, which is get the first three projects done. But almost the vast majority of this work is going to come in 2017 and not in the fourth quarter. We acquired a great SaaS network business in ConstructConnect and it along with the things you can do with On Center in a cooperative way, will be very beneficial for us in 2017.", "The cash performance that we have year-to-date along with a brand new balance sheet with a much better credit facility, supports our continued ability to deploy capital. It's the most powder we have ever had and eh opportunities that we see are excellent. So we had outstanding results in the third quarter and we are very well positioned for 2017 and ready to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Deane Dray at RBC Capital.", "Andrew Krill", "This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. I want to start off on ConstructConnect, this is the second meaningful deal you guys have done recently in Software-as-a-Service after Aderant. So I am just wondering if you could talk about market share within construction, and if there are any unique barriers to entry versus peers for the business.", "John Humphrey", "Well, this is John Humphrey. So as far as barriers, I mean the barrier of course for a networks business is the strength and size of the network, and the ability for all of the different users to be able to transact business and grow their own businesses by utilizing the ConstructConnect network and software solutions. And I think it goes to the size of the network. When Brian talked about 800,000 users and 55 million invitations to bid every year encompassing almost 400,000 different commercial construction projects. I mean the size of the network and the combination that ConstructConnect has been able to put together between their different brands of iSqft, Bidclerk and Construct Data, and really turn that into a single integrated platform and that\u2019s truly unique inside the industry.", "So from a competitive position. I think for most of those customers, the way that variable to grow their business and to bid on more projects and to win more, is through connection to the ConstructConnect network. And so that\u2019s really the strength of that in the competitive position. There are a couple of competitors out there that also provide, particularly on the construction data side, but on the network and the integrated data, we really don\u2019t think there is anyone of size there.", "Andrew Krill", "Okay. It is very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. Do you have any sense of potential accretion and then I guess kind of where you guys that EBITDA margin could eventually go versus the sort of 33% or so you are expecting next year. Thank you.", "John Humphrey", "Well, we still have a lot of work to do. I mean we are going to close on the transaction but it is worth thinking about it as probably somewhere in the $0.10 to $0.15 accretive for next year. We will be able to update you on that of course as we finalize the purchase accounting. And the margin profile here is also very good, right.. We are talking about something that\u2019s already in the mid-30% EBITDA margin. And so as it continues to grow, it will grow with high incremental margins. And so that\u2019s how we see the margin progression over time as this network continues to get bigger.", "Brian Jellison", "I just want to add to the understanding that these acquisitions have a lot of non-cash amortization. So on a GAAP DEPS basis, people are looking at expensing that amortization and depressing what otherwise looks like earnings per share. Reality is, it will be very cash accretive. But on a GAAP DEPS basis it may only add $0.10 or $0.15. I think you get paid as a shareholder for monitoring what's happening to the quality of the cash earnings. The cash earnings of ConstructConnect will be great.", "Operator", "And we will move next to Robert McCarthy at Stifel.", "Robert McCarthy", "I guess, first, just talking about the -- again, congratulations at a very strong cash generation quarter. These questions will relate obviously to DEPS. But in terms of the medical cadence for the fourth quarter and energy, could you just expand on your comments about what kind of brought the guide down for the fourth quarter.", "Brian Jellison", "I think two things in terms of the DEPS. It's just our view of that is that we are not going to get much in the way of seasonality. When we look to the orders that came in the third quarter, we get a lot of footprints and we call them booked and so they are booked with a quarter, shipped within the next quarter. And we didn\u2019t see any uptick that would give us a reason to think we would have normalized Q4 seasonality, but we could be wrong about that, that would be upside that could happen to us. So, I think it's more than any one item and then we have been ready to go on a couple of projects that we expect and we are ready to [indiscernible]. Okay.", "Robert McCarthy", "Energy is not particularly surprising but the medical cadence. Could you just expand upon that because I think your expectation was kind of high-single-digit growth as kind of an exit rate for fourth quarter?", "John Humphrey", "Yes. Rob, I think you are right about that. And once again, it goes back to what Brian was talking about. When we look at the product orders, and I am talking specifically around medical products. Well, we expected that kind of last time we talked, that\u2019s exited closer to the 10% growth rate, that\u2019s existing closer to the 5% growth rate, and that combined with the timing of imaging orders and deliveries. So all the life science things that Brian talked about earlier, those are actually very sophisticated instruments and cameras and filters. They aren't as kind of the -- it's not like just machining and creating a pump. So the process in order to be able to turn that from order to delivery can easily be 60, 90, 120 days depending on yield and throughput, particularly from suppliers around some of the centers. And so as we look at the deliveries and the delivery schedule, particularly on the imaging product side and also on the medical product side, that\u2019s where we see a slight difference from what we would have thought before, but we still see this segment exiting at the mid-single-digit rate, very consistent with where it has been over the past 2.5 years.", "Robert McCarthy", "Okay. So you see no underlying deterioration in the core organic growth rate of that segment?", "John Humphrey", "No, we do not.", "Brian Jellison", "No, no.", "Robert McCarthy", "Okay. And then in terms of the M&A pipeline, obviously you have transacted on a very interesting deal this quarter. But I mean what's the state of play in terms of how you look over the next, kind of 12 to 18 months in terms of capacities of these deals and the environment to get deals done. Because it has been, in the main, kind of a difficult environment to get deals done.", "Brian Jellison", "Yes. You know if you go back to January '15, in that 21-month period we have deployed $2.7 billion in capital. I mean in the next 21 month period or much sooner I would think that that kind of run rates are impossible. You know we have got hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of capital to be able to put to work and getting the new $2.5 billion revolver which is [on ] [ph] done, was a big deal because it's given us some flexibility around how much we can deploy at anyone point in time and that\u2019s very helpful. So there are a number of small deals that we are engaged with at the moment and a couple of larger transactions which would be even bigger than ConstructConnect that we are involved with, we think are very attractive. So you never know, in terms of your word, cadence, how that will happen. But I would be very very surprised if we didn\u2019t deploy that capital in the next 12 months.", "Robert McCarthy", "The final question is just around, you have heard this many times, but would you consider doing something akin to what some of your competitors have done, simply not competitors but public comps, in terms of perhaps just shifting to EPS excluding amortization.", "Brian Jellison", "Well, there's a lot of smiling in the room because that\u2019s the proper way to measure us. I guess we are not interested in stepping on the SEC. Those people that are doing that, they can continue to do it for a longer period of time and if the SEC doesn\u2019t say anything about it, that\u2019s a smart thing to do, because it's the proper way to measure the business. It's just not the way GAAP measures the earnings. So we had $50 million of amortization in the third quarter and what do we have, 101 million or 102 million of shares, you can do the math. I am apparently now allowed to say what that math generates. EBITA, earnings per share for the company will be and are spectacular.", "Robert McCarthy", "Brian, you would have banging my head against the wall for that for about 15 years and I am a slow learner. So I will leave it there.", "Operator", "We will move to our next question from Joe Giordano at Cowen and Company.", "Joseph Giordano", "Do you get the sense that given where rates are and when you are looking at deals, are you having to stretch a little bit more in terms of multiple because competitors who are looking at the same assets are able to kind of do some funny math with rates being here in terms of returns?", "Brian Jellison", "Well, I wish it were funny math but it isn't funny math. The difference is, we don't like to go above like four times debt to EBITDA, and those guys are willing to take [that staples] [ph] and banks put on things in non-bank entities, but [on times] [ph] at eight times EBITDA, right. So, they don't deploy much more equity in a transaction that we do, we just don't want to have seven or eight times debt to EBITDA. We are going to remain investment grade and to do that you want to be around four times debt to EBITDA coming back to 3 or 3.5 or something. So you know we are very disciplined about wanting to and guaranteeing ourselves to maintain investment grade status.", "The prices that people are paying for things are really bifurcated. Oddly enough, the industrial assets are trading at really more than they're worth in a normalized interest environment in the M&A world, because they don't have a lot of EBITDA even though they all require a lot of capital spending to maintain that EBITDA. So those multiples are interestingly high. Then the asset light business trade at a premium to that but the arbitrage for us on the asset light businesses is more favorable than those people that are buying the more capital intensive businesses. So something like ConstructConnect, it will be a long-term compounder of investment for us which is great as opposed to the guys that are buying the capital intensive businesses thinking that, gee, you know, it looks like I'm paying a lot but there is the nature of their cyclical activity and when there is this higher number, this will happen. We will leave that field to everybody else. It is not where we're going.", "Joseph Giordano", "Thank you. I just wanted to touch on Neptune as well. I mean the results this quarter, obviously very, very strong. There's this story out there, that has been out there for a while, fair or not, about a lack of investment. You talk about $50 million of M&A. Can you just talk about your positioning there on the highest technology type products, like on the AMI development and how you're capitalizing on your installed base? I mean the numbers speak for themselves but this has kind of been out there for a while and I guess, maybe give you guys a chance to address that.", "Brian Jellison", "Yes. I think $50 million was what we have done in R&D, not M&A.", "Joseph Giordano", "Sorry if I misspoke. Yes.", "Brian Jellison", "In the last three years we have put $50 million of work there. We are also opening a new software development center for Neptune that will really help us and a lot of things we're doing. So we're not going to provide a lot of information about what we're doing but I can just suggest you that we have the best reading technology that\u2019s available and has the highest integrity results. We have an enormous installed base and maybe people forget that the way our 900 product works, we can upgrade that, the AMI status. And there is a lot of ways to collect the technology but if you have got the right core unit that can use multiple ways of gathering the data, you will be a little bit ahead of the game. So we are able to do upgrades for people in the AMI arena that they always, if they ever migrated to it, they do that and we have won a lot of those. Over $30 million of that just in the third quarter.", "You saw other things. Mobile activity, you see Verizon picking us as the person that they are working with development on mobile technology. So there's a lot of different things going on and we are not going to provide more information than we have around that but Neptune will have record performance in 2016. So if anybody thought it didn't have some kind of long term reason for performing well, explain to me why they are growing so much.", "Joseph Giordano", "Fair enough. And last if I could, John, you talked last quarter about, we were talking about Sunquest, some small hospitals, they were taking maybe [indiscernible] and you said that made sense for that size of a customer and your core being large hospitals. Can you just talk about how that went through 3Q? Is that kind of stabilized and then the customer base that you focused on, you remain to be -- the capture rate there is being consistent.", "John Humphrey", "Yes. It has been consistent. And you are absolutely right, in fact Brian talked about the order intake, right. So remember that fully two-thirds, if not more, of Sunquest revenue is recurring revenue in terms of maintenance on installed software that's already been out there. And so when we look at the order intake, it's a much smaller piece of their total revenue buy. But when they look at their order intake which is about the new Lab 8.0, it's about the new blood bank solution, it's the new outreach solution. So the nurses can start the testing process right at the bedside and be able to start that data flow and workflow to the lab right from the bedside. So all of those upgrades are driving that order intake to be a record level for the third quarter. It is true that on the lower end, the smaller hospitals and integrated solution can make economic sense for them, but the competitive environment and the solution that Sunquest delivers is, it continues to be very good and our competitive position continues to be very strong, particularly in those larger hospitals.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Brian Gesuale at Raymond James.", "Brian Gesuale", "I am wondering if you could expand a little bit on Sunquest. You talked about record orders. Maybe just the richness of this product upgrade cycle that we have seen and maybe give us a little bit of a preface as what we might expect in 2017.", "Brian Jellison", "I think it's early to talk about 2017. We actually have a review coming up with Sunquest in about a month. So we will be talking about not only 2017 but importantly 2018 and 2019, and the plans that they have around the investments there. So one is what I was kind of just mentioning in terms of the continued on the upgrade side around Lab 8.0 and the new blood bank solution. But also wouldn\u2019t ignore the investments that we have made around genetic testing and the workflows associated with that. So you really have the blood side which is the core lab, high volume testing environment that every hospital has to have. And I think of the other side, which is the anatomic technology and the emerging genetic workflows around genetic testing.", "That\u2019s where we have made important investments with the acquisition of GeneInsight and continued R&D around to be able to make that workflow as efficient and as quick with getting information back to the doctor as timely as happens today on the blood side. And so for all those reasons, I think the Sunquest and our entire platform of hospital software solutions, which of course includes Data Innovations and CliniSys, and GeneInsight and a variety of other things, all of those businesses really deliver those software solutions to hospitals. I think there future looks very bright as a result of the investments that we continue to make there.", "Brian Gesuale", "Great. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe just a follow-up on the M&A pipeline. It sounds robust. You certainly have a lot of dry powder. Can you maybe talk about the quality of those deals? This ConstructConnect looks very asset light, negative working capital. It appears that the quality is actually increasing as the pipeline is. Could you maybe discuss that?", "John Humphrey", "Yes. You can really see that when you look at that net working capital chart where you are down 5.8, people think you could never get lower and now we are 1.9. Certainly a lot of that as you get deferred revenue and you get paid in advance for work you do and most of the things that we look at these days have those qualities. So I thought, we get to zero ultimately negative at some point but I don\u2019t see us going up. The amount of small niche businesses that work in kind of oligopolies where customer [indiscernible] is critical and then those that have the ability to have kind of a network effect, there are most of those things out there than you might imagine. Because when you are focused on product businesses, you don\u2019t necessarily see some of these kind of things. But all of the people that are involved in transactions and banking businesses and then private equity businesses, kind of meddle what we favor, what we look like. And so the funnel what we have of incoming opportunity is really amazing. And just incumbent on us to sort through that funnel, find the best management teams. So that\u2019s the end market opportunities that are in favorably competitive environments. And believe me, there is more high quality things available that our balance sheet could tolerate. Fortunately, we have got a big enough balance sheet to capture some of them.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Richard Eastman at Robert W. Baird.", "Richard Eastman", "Brian, could you just talk for a minute or two about the New York MTA contract. I think you had mentioned there sites should be performed in the fourth quarter, kind of accelerated. Given the size of that contract, are we talking about maybe $20 million to $25 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and then the balance of the sites, the other six sites, does that all fall into the first half of '17?", "Brian Jellison", "No. No. I think commitment in the contract is pretty specific in terms of what they've been willing to release. And it will be done by November of 2017, is what we're told. There was really even one -- remember you have got the, like ramp, right. So we've been doing some engineering work with them to assure that the overhead kiosk and everything that were being built-in, are going to be okay. So it will start slow. I don't know, maybe we could get $10 million in the fourth quarter of revenue that we have with the rest being -- whatever is it, it's about $72 million for the entire period and it will be really up to them at the pace they want us to do the installation and release of the technology.", "Richard Eastman", "Okay. Understood. And just then just a last question, I have, just around MHA. There is a lot of noise around drug pricing, both generic as well as branded. And then also I noticed in the Slide that you had, that there was a suggestion that the alternative site solutions business would kind of be a leader here in the fourth quarter. Can you just kind of pull all that together? Has the noise around drug pricing impacted just the revenue stream in the pasture there at MHA, and then also is this alternative site solutions business being kind of the fourth quarter leader? Is there timing there or is there contract renewals or what would drive that in the fourth quarter?", "John Humphrey", "Yes. Sure. So in terms of its contribution on the growth side, it was up in the 3% or 4% in the third quarter and we expect that to be modestly better in the fourth quarter. From a drug pricing standpoint, I mean you are right, that is something that we look at. A lot of the headlines that you see around drug pricing are really targeted for our being sold to the senior population. Remember MHA is around alternate site healthcare and the largest portion of their revenue is coming from skilled nursing homes, long-term care facilities. It's not really the headline prices around EpiPen or whatever else that you might read in the Wall Street Journal. It's really for kind of the longer chronic illnesses that are being sold through the MHA contracting vehicles.", "So, we do look at drug pricing. It's been lower than what we would have seen in years past but still positive in 2016. We're not counting on an awful lot of drug pricing lift as we think about the future for MHA. They continue to expand in their solutions in non-drug supply chains, including food and other things around long-term care facilities and other nursing homes. So they continue to expand that. And then they also expand their software solutions around data analytics. You have seen us make a couple of acquisitions that also serve the alternate site healthcare which are not GPO but are really around software solutions that allow those members and customers to run their businesses more efficiently. That's where we look for growth. We don't really count on underlying drug price increases as something that is going to drive our performance, although it does have an impact on our revenue.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Alex Blanton at Clear Harbor Asset Management. Mr. Blanton, your line is open.", "Brian Jellison", "Audra, we will have to follow up with Alex, I think.", "Operator", "All right. And that will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to management for any closing remarks.", "Brian Jellison", "Well, thank you very much for joining us and we look forward to speaking to you again in about three months.", "Operator"], "Symbol": "Roper Technologies, Inc.

Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Planning and Investor Relations.", "Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The Press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the web cast, and also on our web site at www.ropertech.com.", "So if you please turn to slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.", "Next slide? Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation available on our web site. For the third quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted, consists of purchase accounting adjustments. One, to acquire deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions, that totals $2.2 million. In addition, we have an inventory step-up expense for RF IDeas of $2 million. As a reminder, these adjustments represent -- absent our acquisitions, those businesses would have been able to recognize their profitability and revenue.", "Now if you please turn the slide, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and after his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our participants. Brian?", "Brian Jellison", "Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. So we start here with our Q3 enterprise highlights. We had a record third quarter, which we thought, was significant, given sort of issues associated with the end markets and foreign currency. Our revenue actually was modestly up from last year at $886 million and our book-to-bill was 101 and above almost everywhere, with the exception of RF, which is of course project driven.", "Growth was led by Medical, which was up 12% in revenue and RF Technology, which was up 6% in revenue. The declines that we saw in industrial and energy were virtually exactly as we had modeled. FX was about a 3% headwind in the quarter, and that result was a bit of negative organic, as you can see it was about 2% with those industrial and energy headwinds.", "Gross margins were spectacular, they were up 130 basis points to 60.7% over last year, and even up sequentially from the second quarter. EBITDA margins were up 80 basis points to 34.4, both records. Net earnings were up 4% and our diluted earnings per share were $1.61 versus our guidance of $1.53 to $1.57.", "Our free cash flow was $220 million, which was up sharply from the second quarter's $162 million and the $220 million of free cash flow represents 137% conversion. We deployed $435 million in three acquisitions, RF Ideas, Atlantic Health Partners and On Center, which we have discussed earlier, and we just completed the Aderant acquisition on Wednesday, which was $675 million net of tax benefit acquisition, we will talk more about this morning, and today we are announcing two more transactions, CliniSys and Atlas Medical. So it was really an outstanding quarter and of course great capital deployment for us. ", "Next slide; if you look at the income statement, we are sort of laughing, because it\u2019s the old story about the ducks on the pond and they are moving along nicely, but underneath, these are moving wildly. Lots of activity, but at the end of the day, we are up $1 million, but you got to know, that that's in the face of oil and gas being down about 3% of our entire revenue, and FX about 3% and of course, the City of Toronto roll-up, another one, so we had to overcome quite a bit of headwinds and still produce positive results.", "Our gross margin was up from 59.4 a year ago to 60.7 and it really demonstrates the quality of our businesses, because even in these difficult markets, they not only are holding our gross margins, but oftentimes, increasing them.", "If you look at the operating margin, it too shows incredible execution, 27.9% a year ago and 28.7% this year, up 80 basis points, despite having quite a bit of M&A expense we took in during the quarter for all this activity. You can see that tax rate was 30.4, which was a little bit lower than last year's 31.3, but I'd remind you, our second quarter it was only 25.7, so there was a $0.12 headwind relative to Q2 on the tax rate, and the tax rate gives about $0.02 favorable in the quarter. And then you can see the DEPS at $1.61.", "The compounding of cash flow, if there is any theme around here, it would be that. We are in base, a compounder. You can see our cash flow -- operating cash flow is going up from $579 million during the first three quarters of last year, at $660 million now. Operating cash flow conversion was 141%. Our free cash flow conversion was 137%, and while we always ask people to look at, even though we don't report on a cash earnings per share basis, if you take a look here at our revenue, free cash flow, you will see that 25% of our revenue turned into free cash flow in the quarter. Our year-to-date free cash flow is up 15% over last year at $632 million, and we still do think cash is the best measure relative to performance.", "We continue to look at the balance sheet and our asset velocity. You will see that, we have improved another 160 basis points from the third quarter of 2014 through the third quarter of this year. Everything is better, inventory is down, receivables are down, payables are up, and so the net effect as we go from 5.8% at the end of the third quarter last year to 4.2% now and our governance process just continues to drive the working capital focus for every one here throughout the unit.", "Next slide; we look at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with very strong balance sheet. We had $700 million in cash, while its outside of the U.S. of course, an undrawn revolver, giving us sort of cash and undrawn revolver capacity of about $1.6 billion, and our gross net number you can see there is at about $2.8 billion. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is about $1.239 billion, that's not pro forma, that's just the actual number, pro forma would be higher, of course with our acquisitions, giving us a gross debt-to-EBITDA profile of about 2.3. Our pipeline opportunities are still really quite good, so we are going to continue to see acquisitions flowing here in 2016. We are rapidly getting to the point, where we are going to have $1 billion of cash flow very soon on an annual basis, and of course, we tend to reinvest that at about 1.3 or 1.5 times that cash flow. So we still look forward to another $1.5 billion or so of investment opportunity next year.", "The Aderant transaction of course is going to be around $695 million in terms of the cash cost of that, so that will take up the rest of our revolver, and as a result, we have upsized the revolver from its $1.5 billion to $1.850 billion, and the CliniSys transaction will be basically funded out of non-U.S. cash, so there is no new borrowing required. So it gives us a very strong balance sheet.", "Here we just have a placeholder before we start talking about our segment deal and the outlook.", "Next slide; if you look at the performance of all four of the segments, they continue to be just marvelous. I mean, here you are with these headwinds and currency challenges and everything else in energy, and yet our EBITDA margins in the quarter were 33%. Our Industrial Technology, which is only about 10% effective by oil and gas, still had 31% EBITDA margins, while RF had 36% and Medical 45. So all of these segments have just incredible margins, and if you think about it from a historical perspective, going back to look, just to 2011, not very long ago, our collective EBITDA is up about 580 basis points since the third quarter of 2011. And also, you want to remember, when we report EBITDA, almost all of our D&A is really just non-cash amortization, and unlike depreciation, that non-cash amortization has no call on future capital spending. Also, you can see Medical and RF are still over two-thirds of our total EBITDA.", "Next slide. So we look at the smaller segment, Energy Systems and Controls, we went into the year saying that about 60% of that segment would be in oil and gas, and that's actually going to be slightly less than that, just due to the sales, but notwithstanding that, we had a lot of FX exposure in energy with a lot of non-U.S. activity, so FX was a negative 5% headwind in the quarter. The oil and gas markets, were about as weak as we expected, in fact, when you look back about how they performed versus how we model them, there was literally no variance.", "The other served markets were flat with a few modest exceptions that were up. We had really terrific margin performance, as every body executed very nimbly, terrific deleverage performance and the operating margin is actually up 60 basis points from a year ago, and I think notably, its up 330 basis points from what we reported in the second quarter. So we have gone from 26% OP margin to 29.3% sequentially, on effectively the same revenue. So that's quite an accomplishment, and I think those -- everybody in this segment, for the most part, deserves a lot of credit for that.", "When we look at it, it's trending into Q4, what we would see is sort of the same level of weakness, but some incremental improvement, just because of some seasonal programs that tend to occur inside Energy. But with Energy being less than one in every $7 of revenue, it won't have a big effect for us.", "We had strong growth in our nuclear test business on improving market conditions. There is a good deal of activity that's emerging, both in China and Korea based opportunity in the Middle East, and startups again in Japan for their nuclear activity. So that's going to be a material improvement for us in the fourth quarter, and into 2016. The cost actions that we took earlier this year, you can see, have already improved our margins here in the third quarter, and we expect the margins to improve still a bit more into the fourth quarter of this year.", "Next slide; the industrial technology segment, which is about 10% oil and gas by the way, a little less in this quarter, it had a 4% hit on FX. We also have, in the industrial technology segment, the City of Toronto roll off from Neptune, which we said this year, would be in the neighborhood of $40 million or about $8 million to $9 million a quarter, and that's about what it was in this quarter. So that's most of the organic issue.", "Neptune, on the other hand grew mid-single digits, excluding the completion of the Toronto, so we were pleased with that. Our oil and gas markets were almost exactly as we expected them in here, but the margins remain really strong, when you think about the challenges that those folks had. They could have done a little better job on deleveraging, and we have talked to them about that, and I think we will see better performance in that respect in the fourth quarter. We continue to have growth in our Material Analysis businesses and they are holding up very well, given their European and Asian exposure.", "In the fourth quarter, we have already announced, as of October 2nd, that we completed the divestiture of Abel Pumps; that was a business that we sold for \u20ac95 million. It has very strong fourth quarter, so the buyer would be benefited by that, we had it projected in our guidance at about $14 million in revenue and about $0.03 a share of earnings, which of course, now goes away. On the other hand, we get \u20ac95 million and have already effectively reinvested that money in the acquisitions we have just made in higher margin businesses that don't require the assets that Abel was going to require to sustain its growth.", "Oil and gas is still weak, but growth in the other markets is pretty good and is offsetting for the most part, the oil and gas weakness. We do think in the fourth quarter, we will have better margins, with better leverage performance.", "Next slide; we look here at RF Technology. We were up, as you can see, 6% of revenue and up 10% in operating profit. If you look at that operating margin at 30.3% up 120 basis points, I want to remind us that the EBITDA margin in this segment is 35.7. So we have a lot of non-cash amortization and the 35.7 number demonstrates just how powerful the cash earnings profile of the RF Technology segment is. Organic revenue was up 4, FX was a 1% headwind, the growth continued in our Infinity Lane Systems, both in Florida and Texas and we have a number of quotations out, so that looks very favorable, as we go into next year.", "We had quite reasonable subscriber editions in our various Freight Matching businesses that supported growth in the quarter, and then we acquired RF IDeas in September, and that business has historically grown at double digits, and we certainly expect that that will be the case in the future; both Rick and Craig who are driving that business, have been there a long time. They have created an unbelievable value-added reseller network and terrific direct connectivity with OEMs. Primarily, the business provides proprietary card reading technology, so we can think of it -- doing for the individual, what Neptune reader technology does for a big collective entity. Lots of identification and authenticity ID that they have -- a lot of it is for single sign-on things like printers. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of applications and thousands of customers, its quite a decent balance sheet, as you might imagine, as our deals are.", "If we look to the fourth quarter, the software business, as we think will continue to grow at mid-single digits. We will get great leverage out of them and terrific cash flow performance. The backlog and proposal activity that we have at tolling traffic is pretty good. We don't see any slowing in that arena, and we will finally get done with a couple of projects, which have been -- things that have been challenging, to say the least, that it will be behind us, and that's really good news. And then, we will have very strong segment margin performance, we think, continuing, led by our SaaS and application software businesses.", "Last Wednesday, we completed the acquisition of Aderant. Aderant is really an incredible company, if we turn the slide here, we can look at a detailed exploration of Aderant. In a sense, its just a great business. It has lots of complementary notes that have come to us from various admirers of Aderant and Chris Giglio's team is -- I think we have never had as many unsolicited inbound notes about what a great business this is, and thank goodness its finally in the home of a public company, that will continue to invest and there has been an amount of fear, maybe unwarranted, but nonetheless, very real for law firms, who I am sure, wouldn't shock you that they tend to be somewhat conservative, who were not too happy to see Aderant in the hands of private equity previously, and it always makes people worry about, whether they can depend on continued internal development and growth.", "Aderant has a really end-to-end platform of mission critical software, that primarily goes to law firms now, but could be expanded to other professional services organizations. It has 3,000 of the world's largest law firms and professional services organizations, and they really do a full suite of activity, all the way from time capturing and billing to docketing. They are in Atlanta, they have got a great software business also in Auckland, New Zealand, which we were very encouraged by. We think they are going to generate over $125 million in revenue in 2016 and beyond, and of course, it is as always, a high margin business.", "If you look at our acquisition criteria on the right, you will see it has got an excellent management team. In fact, we are retaining everyone. So that's a checked box [ph] high recurring revenue yet, you can check that box, over 95% customer retention. Strong cash flow characteristics, asset life, well once again, negative working capital, so people pay us in advance for work that we are going to eventually perform. Very deep domain experience inside -- in terms of people who are accustomed and used to working with law firms and what their needs really are, and it has multiple growth opportunities, including opportunities to do additional acquisitions at Aderant, which is one of the things that we have been so encouraged by these last three larger transactions in the form of Sunquest, which you see us doing continual bolt-ons to and MHA, which we continue to do, and now Aderant, which is the third largest acquisition that we have made, will have a very strong forward opportunity to continue to add businesses to this very good platform. So another great niche software business for us.", "Next slide; if you look at Medical Solutions, and we haven't really dropped the reference to scientific imaging. I mean, the reality is, that its no longer very material; and in the quarter, the scientific image business had about a 6% decline, all of which really was our rugged mobile business, which we have been just gradually winding down. As you recall, we sold the Black Diamond business. That was reported in RF, it had a both DAP and JLT, and these things should be pretty well cycled through before the end of the year. If it weren't for that, scientific imaging would have been flat in the quarter.", "You can see that the medical businesses grew organically by about 5%, while total revenue was up 12%, because of the acquisition content. FX in the segment was 3% headwind. We had continued growth at MHA, with significant customer acquisitions, and Mike Sicilian and his team were able to acquire Atlantic Healthcare Partners, which is really a vaccine GPO, but it gives us a new channel direct to physician offices. It will contribute meaningfully to our EBITDA in 2016, and it is a terrific acquisition and so congratulations to Mike and Jason Connelly and others there.", "Our recurring revenue increased at Sunquest, which was a good sign. We really do believe, Sunquest is going to be positioned for a strong 2016, and everything that we have seen, as we continue to do these acquisitions, we will talk about the second, suggests we are putting together quite impressive platform of opportunities over a long period of time at Sunquest.", "Our medical devices business were quite stronger than by new product introductions and the execution around introducing those, at both Verathon and Northern Digital, those certainly outperforming the rest of our medical product businesses. Our recent acquisitions that we have done this year, all of which are performing above our internal plans for how they would do. ", "We signed an agreement just sort of virtually within the last couple of days to acquire CliniSys Group U.K., it\u2019s a leading provider of hospital laboratory software, and so just think about it basically as being the Sunquest of Europe. It has sort of an elongated customary merger control review process that will happen in the U.K. and Europe. We expect that we should be able to get that all closed out, and it ought to be inside our reporting entity by the -- maybe the end of January, or certainly early in 2016. We invested \u00a3170 million in that business, but all CliniSys will be paid for from our non-U.S. cash.", "In the fourth quarter, we think we will continue to have kind of like mid-single digit organic growth in the medical businesses. But we think those margins will continue, as incredible as they are today; and once again, you will look at the op margin, where we reported 36.6, but remember, that the EBITDA margin is 45%. So lots of non-cash detractors on the op margin can confuse people about how great and powerful these businesses are on a cash earnings basis.", "We continue to have outstanding margin and cash flow performance in the fourth quarter. Our Atlas Medical acquisition, which literally we finished yesterday, will also expand our laboratory connectivity. This is really an amazing business that has been developed by founder Rob Atlas, who is extremely well known in the hospital arena, and Rob will be joining the Sunquest team. Atlas Medical, whose business will really be a bolt-on for Sunquest, but it provides a support mechanism to both Sunquest and Data Innovations.", "Connectivity Solutions are basically thinking about the lab to the physician outreach that a hospital would have, and then within the hospital, the concept of lab-to-lab communication, where oftentimes, people can't see the data they want, it results in unnecessary additional tests. We like the whole concept of coordinated diagnostics inside the hospital. We really believe that this gives us a pretty eminent edge over what other people do in this category, and over time, you will hear us talk more and more about Sunquest and Atlas as a combination.", "Next slide; here we will look at the guidance for the year. Next slide; we updated our guidance -- actually raised the guidance for the full year, to $6.69 to $6.75. Previously, it was $6.61 to $6.75, so this moves the midpoint up from $6.68 to $6.72, so it\u2019s a $0.04 a share increase. But remember, this is despite Abel leaving and Abel will cost us $0.03, maybe $0.04 during that. So if we had not sold Abel, we would have raised the high end a little more, but we have to absorb that offset.", "And again, when you look at the cash conversion, this third quarter, it was 137% cash conversion for the year, certainly shouldn't exceed 130%, so the DEPS number is one thing, but the cash performance is quite much more important. We also raised our operating cash flow target to between $9.25 to $9.40 for the full year, and that's another projected increase from what we have suggested in the past, and CapEx is not running very high this year, less than $40 million, so its going to promote a lot of free cash flow.", "Next slide; so we go to the summary here for the third quarter, really a record quarter, despite the headwind. So not sure, we could have expected to do as well as we did, but we are quite pleased with the performance. Book-to-bill at 1.01 is a good sign for the fourth quarter, and gross margins reaching 50.7. I went back to look at where we were in the third quarter in 2011, and we were at 53.7% gross margin, so we have added 700 basis points to our gross margins in the last four years here, in the third quarter. Our operating margin is 28.7%, and our EBITDA margin is 34.4; and if you go back to the third quarter of 2011, you will see EBITDA was about 28.6, and now its 34.4.", "Our DEPS, $1.61 exceeded our guidance. Free cash flow, 25% of our revenue and 137% conversion. Full year DEPS raised and cash flow guidance raised; we deployed $435 million in three terrific acquisitions, and then, just as we began this quarter, we acquired Aderant, our third largest transaction in our history, and yesterday, signed an agreement to acquire Atlas Medical. So we were able to confirm everything we thought that would happen in the fourth quarter, and really believe we are very well positioned to have a record 2016, but we won't provide guidance around that until we report earnings in January.", "So with that, John, I think we are ready for opening up to questions.", "John Humphrey", "So Wes, I think we are ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Shannon O'Callaghan at UBS.", "Shannon O'Callaghan", "Good morning guys.", "Brian Jellison", "Hey, good morning Shannon.", "Shannon O'Callaghan", "Hey Brian, as you further expand into software right, we are in medical, now we are adding legal, and you mentioned the ability to go into potentially other professional services. I mean, is there any eventual barrier where a certain industry has some level of domain expertise, where you guys couldn't acquire and succeed with the software business like this in that industry? Maybe just a little understanding of why can you succeed in legal or why could you take this to other areas and is there ultimately somewhere you couldn't go?", "Brian Jellison", "Well I think that, we are always funded by these niche transactions, right, so we don't want to go into some situation, where people are going to write software off of our software. We are really providing some kind of service to somebody, we happen to be using software to achieve the benefit of what it is. But you have to have domain experience. So our guys at the core are software people, they are domain experts who use software to create a solution for somebody, that's efficient and effective for them.", "So as long as we continue to see things that are in those spaces, we will be able to make the acquisitions. Couple of sessions ago, I said, when we did Sunquest and we did MHA, they were really-really as important for the future of Roper Technologies, as Neptune and Transcore back in 2003 and 2004 for Roper Industries.", "Sunquest and MHA gives us world class leadership organizations, that allow us to do bolt-on acquisitions and things that are complementary to them, and most of what we have done this year, has something to do with one or the other of those organizations.", "Aderant is similarly positioned to do that. It\u2019s a great organization. You can go back and look at Chris Giglio, he did a YouTube video on the day of the acquisition, that was just brilliant and you can see how he is expressing the fact that now being owned by a public company, his customers could have confidence that they will get the continued investment for his program to continue to become the most important player in that area.", "So we are always kind of agnostic about what it is the business does. So we don't really have a boundary around the business, as long as it hits the excellent magic high recurring revenue, great cash flow, prefer to have few, if any, assets and domain experience, then we are pretty wide open on where we would deploy our capital.", "Now, we also have some internal things, we always want to be able to add value to the business in some meaningful way that we can understand, and we want to think that people working our government system will perform better than they were, when they weren't in it. And if we think, in our diligence process that, neither of those would happen, then we would abandon the deal.", "Shannon O'Callaghan", "Okay. That helps. And then, on some of the pressure against the -- or the performances amidst the oil and gas pressure, you talked about the sequential margin improvement that you got in energy, but a little less happy with the margin performance in industrial tech in the quarter. Can you just talk about the differences in terms of -- maybe just basic blocking and tackling of costs out, or maybe just a little bit more on what drove that and what you expect to improve in the fourth quarter?", "Brian Jellison", "Well I think that, what we got out of deleveraging and energy was more traditional, in the sort of 30-35, 38% type of stuff that we saw in most of the businesses. We didn't think that upstream guys in oil and gas and industrial, which by the way, was less than 10% of our revenue. They delevered it more than 50%, which we though was unacceptable, and we have shared that with them [ph].", "So they were moving pretty quickly, but they haven't been as used to that kind of change, because they have been driven really by the fracking opportunity, and there really wasn't any cyclical uptick -- it always has gone up, they have never really gone back for a long period of time, and they just didn't do quite as good a job as quickly, as the energy people did. But that problems are behind us.", "Shannon O'Callaghan", "Okay. Great, thanks guys.", "Brian Jellison", "You have the City of Toronto cycling through, so that's an $8 million or $9 million negative income thing, which isn't useful.", "Shannon O'Callaghan", "Right. Got it. All right. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "We will take the next question from Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets.", "Deane Dray", "Thank you. Good morning everyone.", "Brian Jellison", "Good morning Deane.", "Deane Dray", "I'd like to stay on the oil side of the business for a moment, and you mentioned that in the energy segment, you were expecting to see some cost savings benefits flow through, as well as fourth quarter, seeing some seasonal benefits. I was hoping you could provide some color there?", "Brian Jellison", "Well usually, you get -- typically, our Petroleum Analyzer business will get and [indiscernible]. They get fourth quarter seasonal activity, that is oftentimes MRO that's left over. These things we have are really not capital sales, and so they have every year, even -- I think, now every year they have an increase in the fourth quarter. So that will just give us a little bit more revenue in Q4 than we enjoyed in Q3, and with that, get a little bit better margin. They have been very nimble in responding, I don't know John, if you want to add anything to that?", "John Humphrey", "Yeah I mean, what I would tell you is that we are expecting some sequential increase from Q3 to Q4. Not as much as what we have seen in the past, in terms of the dollar increase. If you look back at kind of how this segment has performed in 2012, and 2013, and 2014, well we tried to add a nice jump up there. We are expecting some, but not as much as in the past, just because of the other headwinds that are present in new oil and gas markets.", "Deane Dray", "And how about the cost savings benefits?", "John Humphrey", "The cost savings benefit will continue to just manifest itself most of the costs out would happen in the first half. And so that, that flowthrough just continues in the fourth quarter against last year cost levels.", "Brian Jellison", "I do think, from a read-across [ph] basis, everybody believes there [indiscernible] of what they are seeing from a revenue viewpoint. We went through our quarterly review process and people certainly didn't have any optimism for the fourth quarter, but they all though things should pretty well bottomed out, and they were feeling better about Q4 than they did in Q3, and we don't yet have their forecast for 2016, but in the verbal discussions, people feel a little bit better.", "So the good news for us, is its getting to be such a small portion of the enterprise, that it doesn't have much effect, as you can see here. Because upstream is probably down 35% this year, and even with that kind of drag, we had record revenue and record cash and earnings performance in the quarter.", "Deane Dray", "Thanks. And just to follow-up on Aderant, did you disclose what the growth has been for Aderant and the renewal rates?", "Brian Jellison", "The renewal -- we said retention was about 95%. I don't think we have said a lot about growth. But its going through a little bit of a growth spur, as its gaining share against its primary competitor, who has got some issues. They will have to deal with terms of the software that supports their system historically.", "John Humphrey", "And also remember that this is another business that has a substantial install base, so you get a lot of maintenance revenue, right. So this is not a SaaS business. They have a small SaaS offering, which we think has very interesting prospects. But the majority of this business is a traditional license and maintenance model, and so when you talk about what's the growth rate -- the underlying growth rate of the ongoing maintenance, which is kind of in the low single digit range, but then you have the upside opportunity, as well as what they are capturing today, which is new share and new applications, which is growing much faster than that. So you blend it all together and it has a similar to Sunquest, kind of in the mid to high single digit, is what we expect of this business going forward.", "Deane Dray", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Scott Davis at Barclays.", "Scott Davis", "Hi. Good morning guys.", "Brian Jellison", "Good morning Scott.", "Scott Davis", "I have been following your stock for a long time. I don't think I remember a time period where you have had such a flurry of deals and pretty attractive stuff on the surface at least. But talk to us a little bit about what would you attribute that to? I mean, sometimes maybe these things work out in the timing. But is there an acceleration on part of sponsors to try to pare some assets off their books at this time, and you're benefiting from that?", "Brian Jellison", "I think that might be the case more so in the next 18 months than it has been in the last 18 months. There has been a lot of stuff for sale, but there is always a lot of stuff in the pipeline. But I do think you are starting to see the signs of people getting worried about -- to get any kind of uptick on the risk premium around CCC credits and financing. People are going to start to worry about their exit multiples versus what their entrance multiples order. So I think everybody is wondering about what their exit time ought to be, if it should be moved up. But boy, the guys that we work with and talk to all the time, I mean, they are still deploying capital like crazy. So you see them making big bets and the launch of [indiscernible] very high trailing multiples at least, for what they hope will be able to grow into.", "So I don't think that there was anything particularly unusual, I think that we have owned Sunquest long enough, that we have a real purposeful strategy about what we are building out there, that's just starting to be able to be seen. We are still going to tell everybody exactly what we are doing. But when you look back and you see what we have done with data acquisitions and with strategic healthcare partners for MHA and Atlantic Healthcare. For MHa, and what we are doing here with CliniSys and what we are doing with Atlas, a couple of years from now I think people will -- we won't ever get another question about what ring counts look like.", "Scott Davis", "Understood. And just to follow-up -- and I understand that's business as well. But you talked about CliniSys being kind of the Sunquest of Europe. I mean, is the product offering comparable enough that you could consider merging these two entities or having commonality in management or any kind of synergies that would be not traditional or less traditional for Roper?", "Brian Jellison", "Well the problem of course is the U.K. health system, right. So Germany is different, U.K. is different. So there are regionally specific regulated industries that require different kinds of performance criteria versus what Sunquest faces in the U.S. There certainly will be synergies in the sense of improving our software development capability for those entities, and that's good. I can see, John's anxious to add too.", "John Humphrey", "Yeah I don't think there is any -- in fact, I know there is no plan to merge those things. What we do see is the opportunity for these businesses to work together, to bring new solutions to the market. There are kind of similar unmet needs and opportunities to do things, whether its around blood bank or other solutions. So there may be opportunities for the two businesses to work together in the future. But as far as the core offering, its very-very niche and kind of purpose built, and we don't expect those things to have any overlap.", "Scott Davis", "Fair enough. Thanks good luck guys. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs.", "Joe Ritchie", "Thanks. Good morning guys.", "Brian Jellison", "Good morning Joe.", "Joe Ritchie", "So, you guys operated really well this quarter, despite organic growth turning negative, and I guess I am just trying to parse out some of the comments for 4Q and beyond. Do you guys see the third quarter as a trough in your organic growth? And as you kind of think about 2016, clearly, there are some headwinds this year, with energy, the Toronto Project, tough software comps and Sunquest. I am just trying to get a sense for just general comments across your portfolio on your organic growth in 2016?", "Brian Jellison", "Well I think 2016 is going to be a lot easier for us, because the headwinds that we faced this year should all subside. So I don't think that oil and gas would be worse in 2016 in a material way than it has been in 2015. Its likely to be stable or perhaps up a little bit on some of the areas.", "I think our fourth quarter will be kind of similar to the third quarter, but 2016 is a different story. So we are going to enjoy some of the acquisitions that we have made, will become organic in 2016 and that always helps. So just about everything is favorable. In 2016, you get rid of the City of Toronto drag, which, to bear, we get rid of the Rugged Mobile kind of winding, that has been down. We do get rid of a lot of drags. And so organic, these will be more favorable next year.", "Joe Ritchie", "Okay. That's helpful Brian. And maybe on my follow-up, it seems like this year you have been a little bit more apt to take a look at your portfolio, little bit closer with the divestitures of both Black Diamond and Abel. I am just curious, whether you guys are -- as you think over the next couple of years, will there be continued portfolio pruning as you continue to become more of a software type entity?", "Brian Jellison", "Well, we still love our cash generation businesses out there. They don't have any amortization. I don't know, maybe one of these days, we are going to report it on our cash earnings. It would be a different story. But man, the EPS we get out of our historical business is pretty spectacular, 33% EBITDA and fluid handling. Its hard to bind something with 33% EBITDA, right. So these businesses are really great. We think they are valued pretty highly inside our overall portfolio. I think people approach us -- I mean, our phone rang off the hook, when people saw -- we sold Abel, everybody in the world is calling us up about, hey can we buy your pump businesses, can we buy your energy business, can we do this, can we do that? And the answer is no. I mean, what are you talking about, you guys traded at a multiple that's lower than the imputed value on our business. And if we are going to do it, then we are going to do it for shareholders, so that shareholders get a premium to what they would be.", "So I do think there are creative things that people kind approach us on, and I was willing to listen to various things, but we like the businesses that we own today, for the most part.", "Joe Ritchie", "Thanks Brian. Helpful color.", "Operator", "We will take the next question from Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer.", "Christopher Glynn", "Thanks. Good morning. I will resist the temptation to cease this leading [ph] opportunity to ask about rate comps [ph]. Speaking with energy, you did have a really dramatic sequential improvement on flat revenues with margin there, so just wonder if there are any trade-offs with that kind of material, really bring up some margin upside? And then how to think about, what that says about the leverage or the margin performance, as those markets actually return?", "Brian Jellison", "All good news. As they -- let us know when they are going to return by the way, we are not aware of that yet, Chris. But if they do come back, we will be printing money there. There is no question about that. We are already printing money in a hideous market. So yeah, that's all good news. But there is a little bit of a loss [indiscernible] numbers. The difference I think, if you look at the op and energy in the second quarter, and the op and the energy in the third quarter, we are up about $4 million in operating profit quarter-over-quarter on the same revenue. So you get sort of a nice kick there.", "John Humphrey", "And also Chris -- so structural. So the structural piece of these businesses, is the fact that they have a highly variable cost structure. So we don't have a lot of fixed costs that are hard and expensive and time consuming to take out, and then also, hard and expensive and time consuming to put back in. So these are primarily people related expenses, and so I don't expect that to be structural from that standpoint. Its flexible, and that's the important thing for those businesses, and to make sure that they are able to flex very quickly with volume decreases, but also be able to capture opportunities when volume comes back.", "Christopher Glynn", "Makes sense. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "We will get next to Jeffrey Sprague at Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Thank you. Good morning gentlemen.", "Brian Jellison", "Hey, good morning Jeff.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "I just wanted to circle back to kind of the deal activity again. A lot of moving pieces there. First, just to help us get our head around everything? Can you just kind of square us up? I am sure you don't want to go through every deal individually, but collectively, the $1.7 billion you're spending here in 2015, kind of what the combined EBITDA multiple might be or the run rate revenues from this basket of deals?", "Brian Jellison", "Well, we get some tax benefits in there, but on balance, I'd say, our purchase price for these things has been around 11 times, first year EBITDA. So you can kind of use that as a guidepost into what we would expect for next year.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Net of revenue?", "John Humphrey", "In terms of revenue, for our first 12 months of ownership for all of that, right? So the first 12 months for Strata and SoftWriters and Data Innovations is largely in our numbers this year. But when we add all of that up, we get to something in the $375 million range.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Right. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a -- actually just a quick modeling question, John, has the tax rate got a downward bias here, is that part of the guidance construct in the Q4?", "John Humphrey", "Not really. Probably 31% or something like that into the fourth quarter, right? 31.5. But its hard to feel you have a downward bias, when you pay our tax rates. We are not in aversion, we just don't have any kind of things that are going on around the world. So our tax rate, pretty much for the year, if you look back historically, its going to be around 29% to 30% most of the time.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Right. And then just one other one, Brian, I totally get your point on the industrial businesses, right, they get a Roper multiple instead of some other multiple, which makes it difficult to exit and you got a lot of cash you can deploy. But can you just give us a little bit of additional color on why Abel and why that might be different from the others and how you will be looking at this thing; because I am sure, you do have an open mind around value over time. What's just kind of the overall thought process there?", "Brian Jellison", "So Abel is really unique. In terms of the pumping technology it uses, it is unrelated to what we do at Cornell and its unrelated to what we do at Roper, which are our other two pump businesses. So it really offers us no surges of any kind, from a technological development viewpoint. The PP&E that's used to generate an Abel pump, these are really large. They are more like Flowserve or Dresser-Rand or something like that, or just totally -- typically in large test facilities, mostly witness tests. A lot of their growth, which should be quite good, will be in India, related to power generation. So the end markets that they serve, we are going to require additional capital deployment for us, to continue to grow those businesses. And it wasn't the place we felt like we should invest, therefore, we really felt that that would be better, if we cut this loose to somebody who is seeing it as a growth platform, which it can become. I think it\u2019s a good acquisition for the people that bought it, and I think it will perform quite well for them. But we are able to get out if it at \u20ac95 million and, would be hard pressed to say, sort of 12 times trailing number was something we should turn down.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Richard Eastman at Robert W. Baird.", "Richard Eastman", "Yes. Good morning, Brian, John, Rob.", "Brian Jellison", "Hey, good morning.", "Richard Eastman", "Brian, a quick question. TransCore has had some really nice wins, recently in Massachusetts, Central Florida. There has also been some commentary about Saudi Arabia and the Riyadh, maybe dialing down the metro spend in Riyadh. And I am just curious, when you sit through all that and put the wins there, with potential -- a little bit of softness in Riyadh, how does that business look over the next 12 months? Is the backlog support -- comfortably support a mid-single digit growth rate for TransCore?", "Brian Jellison", "Yeah. I think so. I mean, its cyclical up and down in terms of projects, its not sort of cyclical with the economy, but we are certainly not seeing any slowness. In Riyadh, they are expanding the project. Somebody said to me I think this morning, oh my goodness, Saudi Arabia, they need to borrow money, they want a bit of cash, they can't do any of that. I mean, wow, people do react on a lot of various things. I do not think Saudi Arabia is going out of business in the next month and a half, and I don't think Riyadh is either. So this is a multiyear contract, and once you have the work deployed, people have to have the backroom operations, they can't do it on their own. So there is a lot of different things that happen. Now this is mostly a traffic translink project, with a lot of upfront opportunity that's more civil engineering, and as that gets behind us, then actually margins will improve.", "Richard Eastman", "Okay. And then again, with the wins, it seems like most of that is incremental in new wins, so you have to feel pretty comfortable about the business then?", "Brian Jellison", "We have ample opportunities to go through with TransCore and the rest of our businesses to see what the next 12 months or the next three years looks like, and we will be able to share that totality of that picture at the fourth quarter, when we initiate guidance for 2016. So I mean, just taking out one piece, yeah, we feel very good about that. But wait for the whole picture.", "Richard Eastman", "Okay. And then, can I also just ask you internally, with Atlantic and mHA and all the conversations going on around generic pricing on the drug side, what have been the internal discussions there on the price component at those two GPOs? It sounds like you had some new customer wins here, which is really a positive, but any internal discussions around this generic pricing issue, and the impact, positive or negative it could have on those two businesses?", "Brian Jellison", "I mean so far, it has been modestly positive. But I would say that we are not in those conversations. We don't set prices, we help our members negotiate the best pricing and the best supply chain solutions that they can obtain. So it has been modestly helpful, but not by any stretch, is it the largest piece of the MHA growth that we have experienced.", "Richard Eastman", "Okay. Nice work and congrats on the quarter.", "Brian Jellison", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take the next question from Joe Giordano at Cowen.", "Joe Giordano", "Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Brian Jellison", "Good morning.", "Joe Giordano", "I had a question on CliniSys and maybe if you can help frame that market generally. You have your positioning in Sunquest kind of niche in the United States and then CliniSys you said is the Sunquest of Europe type property. Maybe, some color on how many -- if we look globally, what does this market look like, how many major players of that kind of size really are there?", "Brian Jellison", "Here is a situation, we just signed the agreement. When we are filing-- a lot of material like, either we do here with HSR, so that's all going into customary merger control reviews. So we have agreed with the seller, that we are not going to provide any information until after the deal closes. So I can't tell you a lot about that. But the end markets are quite similar to what happens here in the United States, the hospitals. While people think that there is universal healthcare in the U.K., there is actually a wide variety of potential providers that side that system, and CliniSys allows these people to have a uniform operated platform around all the things that go on, lapse. And we will be able to make them be more efficient for the healthcare system, because they will now get access to our Data Innovations technology and they will get access to some of the ways we do things at Sunquest. So we think from an end user viewpoint, the owner who has built this very good business in the U.K. and recently acquired business similar to it -- and Germany will benefit from providing additional services and clarity to the people that use hoar [ph] system to try it in laboratories.", "So we are bullish about that, but that's about as far as I can go, Joe.", "Joe Giordano", "Fair enough. You mentioned a slight strength in the materials analysis and industrial tech, and I am just trying to get a sense of how much is that market dynamic or how much is that unique to your businesses there? Maybe we can touch on that for a second?", "John Humphrey", "Its probably about 50-50. As you see global industrial production, whether that's around steel or automobile, so that is -- Joe we have got a little bit of positive tailwind. But you also have a lot of new and upgraded products and the expansion of Struers' global reach, and so it puts them in a very good position to continue to take some share. And we also have a very good line of other things, not just on the material analysis, their traditional area, but also some new things around hardness testing and some things they are introducing there, that has helped them. So it\u2019s a little bit of both, little bit of market, little bit of self-help.", "Joe Giordano", "Great. And then just lastly, one quick housekeeping one; are you guys having any impact of Aderant in the fourth quarter guidance that you put up?", "John Humphrey", "Sure.", "Joe Giordano", "Like on an adjusted level, you have adjusted accretion in there?", "John Humphrey", "Yes. I mean, it will help us out by a couple of pennies.", "Joe Giordano", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.", "John Humphrey", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.", "John Humphrey", "Okay. Well thank you all for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking to you again in late January.", "Operator"], "Symbol": "Roper Industries Inc.
