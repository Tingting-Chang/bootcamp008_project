My name is Holly, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Valmont Industries Incorporated Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Laudin, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey Laudin", "Thank you, Holly. Welcome to the Valmont Industries\u2019 third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are Mogens Bay, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Jaksich, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Tim Francis, Vice President and Corporate Controller; and Steve Kaniewski, Group President Utility Support Structures.", "Before we begin, please note this conference call is subject to our disclosure on forward-looking statements, which applies to today\u2019s discussion and will be read in full at the end of the call. The instructions for accessing a replay of the call can be found in your press release.", "We now like to turn the floor over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mogens Bay.", "Mogens Bay", "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. And I trust you\u2019ve all read the press release. Today, I\u2019m going to provide an update on our restructuring plan announced earlier this year. Then review third quarter company results and segment performance, before turning it over to Steve Kaniewski, who heads our Utility Support Structures business.", "Steve will provide a deeper dive into this business. From time to time, we will invite our segment presidents to join the call to discuss their businesses to provide additional insights and exposure to our operational management. Mark will then provide context on our financial performance before we open it up to Q&A. With that, let\u2019s turn to our efforts here in the third quarter.", "We made significant progress on executing our restructuring plan, which we began in earnest in April of this year. We\u2019re now estimating that the annual cost savings from restructuring and other cost reduction actions will be $30 million, up significantly from our initial objective of $19 million. This cost alignment touches all areas of the company. At a high level, the focus has been on consolidating production into lower-cost facilities while maintaining the capacity to meet our customers\u2019 present and future needs.", "To recap, there been several major actions taken today. In Asia and Australia, we consolidated production of seven facilities into our remaining ones. In North America, we consolidated concrete pole production into fewer plants. We also reallocated production from our Brenham, Texas plant to lower cost facilities and consolidated two composite structure plants and did the same with galvanizing, moving production from three to two facilities in Canada.", "Finally, we have reduced global headcount across the company by approximately 700 so far this year. Also, we have significantly streamlined our footprint over the past six months, moving with urgency to address the persistent macro headwinds.", "Moving into third quarter earnings, when comparing this year\u2019s third quarter to 2014 the notable items were: one, the negative effect of currency translation, particularly in Engineered Infrastructure Products and Irrigation; two, the unusually positive impact of storm damage in Irrigation\u2019s numbers last year that did not repeat; three, the revenue impact of lower steel cost particularly on our utility revenue; and four, the decline in energy and mining investment. For our other businesses lower steel costs were a modest tailwind.", "Now, let me turn to comments on the third quarter by segments.", "In the Engineered Infrastructure Products segment, results are a tale of two sub-segments. In total, the core coal businesses represent about 75% of annualized segment sales, in other words, about $0.75 billion. We expect this portion will deliver high single-digit operating income as a percentage of sales, despite being in a very difficult market environment.", "The remaining 25% is tied to energy and mining and will have low-single digit operating income as a percentage of sales, which is not surprising given the collapse in energy and mining investments.", "In the Irrigation segment, the three main drivers of results were the global decline in farm incomes, the absence of approximately $25 million worth of storm damage in North America that occurred during the third quarter of 2014 and significantly lower results internationally. For the most part, industry pricing remain disciplined during this seasonally slow summer month.", "Results in the Coatings segments were a tale of two regions. In North America, businesses performed well, even after considering the reduced internal irrigation volumes and the benefit of an insurance recovery recorded last year. While zinc costs were lower than last year, industry pricing remained disciplined. We continue to be challenged in Australia and had taken actions to reduce our footprint and increase productivity.", "I will now turn the call over to Steve.", "Stephen Kaniewski", "Thank you, Mogens, and good morning, everyone. I will address our Utility Support Structures business, including proactive measures taken to address continued headwinds, to best position us for the current environment, as well as an overview of the current industry landscape.", "During 2015 federal mandates directing utilities to reduce coal-fired generation has led to some capital deferrals away from transmission CapEx. Meanwhile, a dramatic decline in steel costs resulted in a significant drop in revenue this quarter compared with last year, and we continue to experience a greater mix of smaller projects and poles. We maintained pricing discipline in the bid market. While we may be forgoing a nominal amount of business in that bid market we are filling our plants with business that is more attractive for us over the long-term, and that will drive improved earnings quality.", "The major driver of long-term demand for our transmission poles and substation products is the regulatory emphasis on improving grid reliability. Secondary drivers are the interconnection of regional transmission grids and the integration of new generation sources including renewables. While the influence of the massive policy driven project of the past, such as CREZ and CapX 2020 has waned, we believe there is significant investment remaining to be made in the North American transmission grid. This is confirmed by industry specialists.", "There has been a lot of discussion about FERC rule 1000, which allows non-incumbent utility investors to compete in a local utilities home territory. The regulator\u2019s goal is to make investment in transmission infrastructure more competitive. Our initial reaction to this rule is that the increased complexity of the competitive process could favor Valmont\u2019s capabilities in project management, engineering, and product design and materials.", "Meanwhile, there has been some concern that pressure on allowed rates and utility returns on investment might lead to lower investment in transmission infrastructure.", "I\u2019d point out that the average ROEs requested by utility has been in downward trend since 1990. And nonetheless investment in the grade has increased substantially since that. Even at slightly lower ROEs transmission investments remain attractive and are drawing new investors into the space.", "One of the key actions my team is executing to enhance profitability in the current environment is to centralize the production planning process. We are now allocating production to the best and lowest cost sites for each individual job. This has the secondary effect of engendering friendly competition between sites to reduction costs and surface best practices.", "Our global footprint allows us to distribute production to optimally utilize our lowest cost plants. We\u2019ve now shifted from a profit center to a cost center focus at the plant level. This is a change from when business was stronger and individual plants were profit centers, which work particularly well for that environment. I\u2019m pleased with our progress so far, critical to successful production planning is also material procurement, which is now also centralized to aggregate purchases and achieved more favorable costs.", "Regarding our capacity, the initiatives we are implementing is a further restructuring have allowed us to achieved cost savings with that allows our market position or reduction in total machine capacity. We are utilizing all of our equipment and can need additional demand by adding shifts. When we measure hours worked across our plant network they are similar even to 2013 levels, but the mix has been weighted more towards smaller structures and substation products.", "Given the restructuring and cost alignment activities that Mogens, previously discussed, we have a roadmap to achieve the 200 basis point improvement in earnings quality in 2016. I believe Valmont is very competitively positioned in the market with the broadest product offering of transmission, distribution and substation structures that include steel, concrete and hybrids. I am also proud of our manufacturing capabilities geographic footprint, including lower cost locations and our engineering resources on a global scale. We have made the necessary moves to further strengthen our position.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark, who will cover the financial review.", "Mark Jaksich", "Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. There were a lot of moving parts in this quarter, which include restructuring and impairment charges. I will take a moment to review these items and then comment on the financials and general for the quarter. Included in this quarter\u2019s results were intangible asset impairments totaling $15.2 million on a pre-tax basis, were largest of these was $9.1 million impairment of goodwill in our Asia-Pacific\u2019s Coatings business unit.", "We also reported $6.1 million of trade name impairments related to our Asia-Pacific coatings and access systems business units. The impairments with the result of difficulties in these markets over the last couple of years, and the general state of the mining and energy investment in the Asia-Pacific region.", "Restructuring charges during the quarter totaled $8.89 million. These charges related mostly the actions we disclosed earlier this year, and which are now being recognized in the income statement has incurred. Most of the cash charges of $5.5 million were related to severance expenses for workforce reductions. In addition $3.3 million of fixed asset impairment charges were record.", "On the whole, the restructuring actions of progressing as planned and we believe these difficult but necessary actions will position us to take full advantage when core markets begin to improve. We continue to see negative effects to currency translation as the U.S. dollars much stronger against most global currencies of share.", "The effect on sales and operating income in the third quarter was about $58 million and $6 million respectively. While, largest impacts for us were related to the Australian dollar, the Brazilian real and the euro. Based on current rates, we do not expect, the effect to be quite as large in the fourth quarter as the U.S. dollar started to appreciate the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Aside from currency translation effects, the decrease in sales was largely due to lower sales volumes for largest of which was an Irrigation segment. Gross margins before restructuring charges were slightly below last year, mainly related to some factory spending deleverage associated with lower sales volumes. At a positive note, SG&A before restructuring, impairments, currency translation and other items affecting comparability was lower by approximately $6 million from last year.", "The effective tax rate on reported earnings for the quarter was 47% mainly because there is no tax effect on the $9.1 million goodwill impairment charge. The effective tax rate after factoring out all the impairments and restructuring charges was about 33%. Historically, our tax rate is better on 34%. We are exploring actions to reduce our effective tax rate over time. This will enable us to remain flexible and our cash balances globally to take advantage of opportunities as they arise into manage the tax effects of cash movements.", "We generated cash flow from operations of around $64 million during the quarter, but capital expenditures totaling about $10 million. Capital spending for the year is now estimated at about $50 million. Regarding capital deployment activities, we completed the American Galvanizing acquisition on October 1 for purchase price were approximately $13 million. We also continued our share repurchase program by 247,000 shares or $27 million during the quarter. We have $207 million remaining on our February 2015 authorization.", "Our balance sheet remains strong with an appropriate amount of leverage for the cyclical nature of our businesses. We\u2019re providing us a room to pursue investments and growth of our core businesses or either internal investments of new product development, or through acquisitions. Our ending cash balance was $313 million, most of which is located outside the United States. We had no borrowing under our revolving credit agreement at the end of quarter. We have demonstrated the ability to generate good cash flows in good as well as difficult times, and we intend to maintain our investment grade credit rating.", "Our cash priorities remain unchanged. We will use cash to; one, support our current businesses through working capital and capital spending as needed; two, make acquisitions that strengthen were closely adjacent to our existing businesses; three, pay dividend at 15% of net earnings over time; and four, repurchase shares.", "I will now turn the call back over to Mogens.", "Mogens Bay", "Thank you, Mark. 2015 has been a difficult but busy year. We remain squarely focused on executing what is within our control, and what have most of the restructuring behind us by year end. We look forward to delivering improved earnings next year as a result of our actions taken this year.", "We are also currently assessing how we may improve our communication with the financial community, and you understanding our businesses strategy and market. Today we took the first step with introduction of Steve Kaniewski, and as I previously noted we\u2019ll continue to have our divisional management participate from time-to-time on future calls. As well, we will host an investor day in New York City on February 25, 2016. Our group presidents and senior management will participate and we look forward to seeing you there, and that was February 25, 2016.", "Thank you. And at this time, we will take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instruction] Your first question will come from the line of Schon Williams with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Schon Williams", "Hi, good morning.", "Mogens Bay", "Good morning.", "Schon Williams", "Mogens, I wonder, and maybe this is good timing on the utility side, but I just wanted to maybe address some of the concerns in the marketplace on just kind of the volume of projects that are out there. I mean, we\u2019ve seen two of the large contractors in that space come out this week, this past quarter and basically say they\u2019ve seen a pretty significant slowdown in projects, and I guess looking at kind of more smaller projects versus larger projects. I just want to get a sense of how much of that is essentially what you\u2019ve already been experiencing kind of for the last six to nine months. And how much of that is maybe some kind of incremental concern about where the next six months lay on the utility side?", "Mogens Bay", "Hey, I\u2019m going to have Steve to answer your question.", "Stephen Kaniewski", "Good morning, Schon. This is something that we\u2019ve already seen in the marketplace and actually have guided on in previous discussions. So we don\u2019t anticipate any new risks from what you\u2019ve heard from the two contractors. We\u2019ve already seen that in our business over the past year, frankly. There are a couple of large projects in 2016. There are a few more in 2017.", "But the general mix of smaller poles and smaller projects is something that we\u2019ve already been dealing with.", "Schon Williams", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, and then, maybe if we could just touch on the pricing strategy. I mean, so last quarter, Mogens introduced initiative. Potentially, it sounds like you\u2019re going to be walking away from some of the lower margin business. As you look out, I mean, does that mean we should be seeing a scenario as we move into 2016 where volumes are probably still going to be down in utility as you walk away from business, but we could actually see the margin profile improve? Is that - I don\u2019t know. Is that plausible?", "Stephen Kaniewski", "I think what you\u2019ll see is that it will be flat. The markets really out there at this point are projected to be flat. And most of any erosion in business that we\u2019ve already had is taking place going back into the early part of this quarter and second quarter. So you will see the improved margin on our orders. But ultimately, we should not see any further big degradation on the top line.", "Schon Williams", "All right, thanks, guys, very helpful. And I\u2019ll get back in the queue.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.", "Tim Mulrooney", "Hello.", "Stephen Kaniewski", "Go ahead, Tim.", "Tim Mulrooney", "Hello.", "Jeffrey Laudin", "You\u2019re live.", "Tim Mulrooney", "Okay. Yes, good morning. In the Irrigation business, I think the fourth quarter is typically stronger than the third quarter. But last year, actually the fourth quarter took a step down from the third quarter. And I\u2019m just wondering from what you\u2019re hearing from dealers so far through October, do you expect sequential improvement in the fourth quarter or do you expect it to take another step down like last year?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, last year, the reason you saw us step down in the fourth quarter was really because of the storm damage in the first quarter. If you just looked at the non-storm-damage sales in the third quarter of 2014 you would have seen a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. This year we did not have the storm damage in the third quarter. And you will probably see a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, keeping in mind though that the markets are soft, net farm income is going down. So I think you will see an improvement, but I wouldn\u2019t expect a large improvement.", "Tim Mulrooney", "It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, Mogens. And then, just one more on acquisitions, how much should acquisitions add to revenue in the quarter on an absolute basis? I think it would just be Shakespeare and AgSense.", "Mogens Bay", "About $7 million - $17 million.", "Tim Mulrooney", "$17 million, okay, thank you. And maybe if I could just fit in one more about your corporate expense, I think the run-rate was about $13 million to $13.5 million per quarter, if you go back a number of quarters. But it was only $9 million this quarter. I\u2019m just wondering if there was a good - what the reason was for that, and maybe what we should think about for modeling corporate expense going forward. Thank you.", "Mark Jaksich", "Yes, this is Mark. And there are really a couple of things that really drove the change in corporate expense. One, of course, is incentives, because I think probably the time period you are talking about for years where incentives were relatively strong. And, of course, with where we are this year, the incentives are going to be pretty small. That\u2019s the first thing.", "The second thing is, is that we do have some adjustments that take place related to our deferred compensation plan and that\u2019s something in this quarter gave us a benefit to corporate expense of about a-million-nine, but that was offset by other expense that was in the area below operating income. So those are the two main things. But on a go-forward basis, we would expect to see that corporate expense to run around $8.5 million to $9 million per quarter or about $35 million or so per year.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.", "Nathan Jones", "Good morning, everyone.", "Mogens Bay", "Good morning, Nathan.", "Nathan Jones", "I guess I\u2019ll start in utility, Mogens. We had seen nonconsecutive quarters of the margin declining sequentially in utility up until this quarter, where we have now seen that on corner and an increase. I know it\u2019s still lower than you would like it to be. Do you feel like we have passed the bottom-line pricing there? Have you seen pricing get any better or not get any worse or how should we be thinking about that going forward?", "Mogens Bay", "I\u2019ll give you a couple of comments and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve. But I would say that - I wouldn\u2019t say that pricing is getting better, but our costs are going down. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the margin improvement. And as Steve pointed out, we think that if you take the average of the operating income of utility this year and you will take the average a year from now for next year, that\u2019s where they expect to deliver the 200 basis points in improved margins without expecting any improvement in the pricing environment, but be more selective in the jobs we take. And I\u2019ll have Steve elaborate on that or confirm it.", "Stephen Kaniewski", "Yes, Nathan, what we\u2019re seeing overall is that market is staying still highly competitive. Pricing discipline is still kind of over the board and not necessarily the same project-to-project. There are still people trying to take business to fill plants. We decided to take a disciplined approach to look at operationally can we deliver the results to the 200 basis points before we quote the job itself. So there\u2019s not really any pricing stability per se. The market though remaining flat, I think you\u2019ll start to see the other players in the market decide where which the level can be set, but it still remains to be seen.", "Nathan Jones", "Is there an opportunity to close or to at least idle one or more plants in the utility business, while you\u2019re looking at finding the bottom here in the demand level?", "Stephen Kaniewski", "Well, as I mentioned in opening comments or that was in the opening comments we have already consolidated production into a number of facilities. The hours that we\u2019re producing right now, in total production hours, is very similar to the 2013 levels and almost equal to the 2014 levels. So I can\u2019t really close another facility and continue to deliver even what we have right now. It\u2019s just that the mix of products and project size which Quanta and some others have mentioned is just gotten smaller. So we\u2019re doing smaller poles and smaller projects overall. But they still consume a number of hours to produce them.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse.", "Ronald Weiss", "Hey, guys. This is Ronnie Weiss on for Julian.", "Mogens Bay", "Hi.", "Ronald Weiss", "I just want to touch on the restructuring plan. What type of macro background is this kind of predicated on? And if you guys do see some even worsening of the macro-environment, is there more cost able to come out and bigger opportunity there?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, in general, we increased our restructuring benefit by continuing to look at places to take our cost from $19 million that we talked to you about earlier this year to now $30 million. And it is predicated on the headwinds we are seeing between currency and mining and energy investment and low agricultural commodity prices and limited investment by public energies and infrastructure development not getting any better.", "Do we expect it to get worse? I wouldn\u2019t say that, but that we are not see - there\u2019s no reason today to say a quarter or two quarters from now this is really going to turn around. It may, but if it does, our leaner operation and more focus on productivity will give us good leverage. So the macro-environment has not changed and we will continue to look at ways to get more productive.", "Ronald Weiss", "Looks like great. And then, just on the M&A, just maybe little more focused on kind of where the focus is between the segments, if one has priority over the other, and what kind of metrics you guys look at? Is there a minimum ROI target you guys kind of aim for when looking at some potential deals?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, first of all, I\u2019d say that it all comes down to what kind of deals would give us the best return on invested capital. And I wouldn\u2019t say that we favor one part over the - or one segment over the other. But it really comes down to beating our cost of capital within a fairly short period of time. And we are kind of an EVA type company. And we look at how fast can we have positive EVA. We are not looking at just EPS accretion because in today\u2019s debt environment that\u2019s not difficult. We are staying disciplined and making sure that we would beat our blended cost per capital going forward. We did accomplish or finalize one this quarter. We have a pipeline that\u2019s pretty significant, but often we lose out to in many cases private equity that would pay a higher price than we can.", "Ronald Weiss", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instruction] Your next question will come from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.", "Ryan Connors", "Great. Thanks for taking my call. I wanted to focus on the irrigation business if we could for moment. Obviously, the commodity price pressures are a big part of the headwinds here, but also it\u2019s been a very wet season and lot of flooding issues this year. So I wonder if you can - is there\u2019s any way you can isolate the impact of that on your business in the third quarter and year-to-date, to what extent weather contribute to the declines, and hence if all else equal, if we get a more normalized weather environment next year, in theory we\u2019d get some of that business back?", "Mogens Bay", "I think that\u2019s going to - Ryan, I think that\u2019s going to be - it\u2019s difficult to do. The one thing, well, weather, and in this case, good wet growing conditions early on have hurt the parts business, because the pivots have not been operating in this country, as Mark said, they usually do. But, I would say, the closest correlation short-term to our short-term business is net farm cash income. And if you look at the expectation that farm income will drop anywhere from 30% some to close the 40% this year, it\u2019s a lot like what we have seen in the Irrigation business.", "So at the current time, when we plan for next year, we do not plan for an improvement in the Irrigation business. There are no indicators out there that would say it\u2019s going to get better. There are some indications that ending stock in corn maybe slightly less than what it was last year, but we haven\u2019t finished the corn harvest yet. And here in the Midwest for sure the weather has been good for harvesting. So I don\u2019t see anything out there that will say Irrigation will get better next year.", "Now having said that, it is a very unpredictable business, if you have difficult growing condition somewhere in the world or you have a demand change, it will change commodity price as fast. But at the current time for planning purposes, we are not planning on it, but we will be ready for it.", "Ryan Connors", "Got it. Well, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for that. My follow-up is also related to Irrigation and just on the margin side of that business, it seems like margins there had held up pretty well, but then kind of took a bit of leg down in the third quarter. And there is a - in the press release there were relatively minor one-time adjustments to that number. So can you just talk about kind of what happened there from a margin standpoint in the quarter and the outlook on that side going forward?", "Mogens Bay", "Yes. I mean this is really a volume-driven and therefore absorption decline in the margin. We have not seen a major decline in pricing. On multiple system deals things are more competitive than they otherwise are, but in general pricing discipline has stayed pretty good in this business in North America. But when you have - the third quarter is usually a very weak quarter from a volume standpoint, because that\u2019s when farmers are growing their crops. They\u2019re not installing pivots. The exception is when you have a lot of storm damage.", "So last year you saw a tremendous leverage from having a busy third quarter and this year you saw the deleverage. So when volume goes back, which it will in quarters that are seasonally stronger or if the market environment changes you will see the other side of that, you will see good leverage.", "Ryan Connors", "Okay. Well, that\u2019s great. We\u2019ll look, we\u2019ll see you in February in New York. That should be very timely. Thanks for setting that up. Take care.", "Mogens Bay", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.", "David Rose", "Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. Couple of questions just to go on the restructuring side, it sounds, I mean, you obviously had a little bit more traction than you expected and I guess that\u2019s all part of the process. Can we expect more actions in 2016, some incremental actions?", "Mogens Bay", "I would say, probably, yes, but not to the extent that we saw this year. There is couple of geographies where we are looking at further actions that we may be able to take but nothing to the level of what we did this year.", "David Rose", "So part of the - any processes you think you go through this, as we\u2019ve discussed many times, it\u2019s a journey. So I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019ve all of a sudden, you\u2019re starting to build a nice funnel of project activity too. Have you been able to quantify your funnel of projects for cost takeouts or productivity?", "Mogens Bay", "Yes.", "David Rose", "Okay. Can you give us a range on that?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, we\u2019ve given you the range that we think that the cost takeouts are going to be now in the neighborhood of $30 million. Now, we hope that depending on volume that we\u2019ll also see some improvements as more volume go through fewer plants.", "David Rose", "Okay. And the cost takeouts if largely, we haven\u2019t discussed in the Irrigation side, and your point is, is that that farm income is down mid to high 30s percent, at least estimated net farm income. So is there an opportunity to improve productivity on the Irrigation side or reduce the structural costs as well?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, actually that irrigation - the Irrigation business is pretty good of doing that. And already starting last year Irrigation was downsizing their cost structure. Now you have to weigh that also against what kind of investments do you need to make in technology, other parts of product development to be ready for when the cycle changes again. We\u2019ve been in this business for 60-plus-years. And the cycles always change; and every time we get into a down-cycle, it kind of ends higher than the previous one. And the tip of the cycle or the top of the cycle ends higher than the previous one.", "So we try to balance between maximizing profitability by taking out cost where we can, but not hurting the future of the business by cutting out investments in product development that are necessary to continue to stay the leader in this business.", "David Rose", "Okay. I understand. It\u2019s a cyclical business and you want to be able to flex-up when you can. And for my last question is on the cash flow, you had some really nice progresses. Is there anything structural that improved on the free cash flow or was this simply a timing issue?", "Mark Jaksich", "Yes. David, this is Mark. I don\u2019t know if there was anything really structural. I would say though that we were probably - we\u2019re carrying a little bit more inventory than we would probably normally carry at this time. But I think to some degree that\u2019s a consequence of some of our mill-direct [ph] programs and utility where we got longer lead times. But one of the things we\u2019re paying a lot attention to is our - is that cash flows on a monthly and quarterly basis, so that we can really understand where we\u2019re going to be from a cash position so we can execute on our capital allocation objectives.", "David Rose", "Okay. Thank you, Mark. I appreciate it.", "Mark Jaksich", "Holly, are there\u2026", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Jon Braatz with Kansas City Capital.", "Jonathan Paul Braatz", "Good morning, guys.", "Mogens Bay", "Good morning, Jon.", "Jonathan Paul Braatz", "Good morning. Mark, I have a question. Obviously, currency has been a tremendous headwind this year. And I\u2019m not going to ask you to try and be a currency trader. But if the currencies stabilize at this level for 2016, will currency be still a headwind or pretty much neutral?", "Mark Jaksich", "I\u2019m trying to think here for a second. I would say, if they stabilize from where they are right now, I think it will be - if there maybe a little bit of headwind or a tail - or headwind, excuse me, but not nearly to the extent we saw this year. I think the dollar - excuse me, did get a little bit stronger during the year. But now it\u2019s kind of retreated a little bit as well. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a big FX impact if we into go into next year comparing 2015 and 2016.", "Jonathan Paul Braatz", "Okay. Can you refresh my memory, what - how much of an impact so far we\u2019ve seen this year on currency? Do you have that number?", "Mark Jaksich", "I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s in the neighborhood of about $13 million or $14 million at the operating profit level.", "Jonathan Paul Braatz", "Okay.", "Mark Jaksich", "So far this year, year-to-date.", "Jonathan Paul Braatz", "Okay. All right. Okay. And, Mogens, a follow-up question. The $30 million in restructuring benefits, cost savings, will they be fully realized in 2016 or will they extend into 2017? Can you give us sort of a timeframe there?", "Mogens Bay", "Yes, the $30 million will be fully realized in 2016. A small amount of it has probably already been realized, that will be realized during the second half of 2015. But we are not expecting any of the $30 million to have to wait till 2017 to see that.", "Jonathan Paul Braatz", "Okay. All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Jose Garza with Gabelli & Company.", "Jose Garza", "Good morning, guys.", "Mogens Bay", "Good morning.", "Jose Garza", "Mogens, I was just hoping you could add a little bit more color in South America on the Irrigation side and the decline in the volumes, maybe give a little bit more on - maybe magnitude and country-specific.", "Mogens Bay", "Okay. In general, the biggest market in South America is Brazil by far. And it has been a very strong and very profitable market for us. You all know about what\u2019s happening in the Brazilian economy in general, the political situation and the increase in the interest rates charged by FINAME, which I think now is 7.5%. So we have seen a significant drop in revenue in Brazil particularly translated into US dollars, because the real has weakened substantially over the last year.", "So Brazil is kind of an unknown right now as to what\u2019s going to happen going forward. There is further talk now about FINAME financing being tied to the inflation rate in Brazil and may be changing on a more regular basis. Our businesses down there, they are doing a good job of managing through this. They are still nicely profitable and - but not to the extent we saw last year.", "Argentina is another area with lots of issues both from a currency standpoint and from a political standpoint. But it is a country where our business is much, much smaller, so it doesn\u2019t have the impact that we will have from Brazil or have had from Brazil.", "Jose Garza", "Okay. Thanks. And, just switching gears into the Coatings business, you guys continue to perform pretty well there and are adding to it with the American Galvanizing acquisition. What are the opportunities to kind of grow the value in that business a little more kind of considering there seems to be a little bit of value disconnect between it and its biggest peer?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, I think in North America we continue to operate those businesses well. We continue to drive for productivity improvements, fine-tuning zinc pickup et cetera, et cetera. The problem or the challenge we have in the Coatings business is mainly Australia and to a certain extent Southeast Asia. And there we are looking at or will have already consolidated plants and taking out cost. So we plan to see improvement in the profitability of that business going forward.", "We\u2019ll continue to look for acquisitions. But again, when you look for acquisition in this business these are not businesses that are high growth businesses. They basically grow with the general economy. So therefore when you buy them you better buy them right or you will live with no returns for a long time. So we have to stay disciplined.", "Jose Garza", "Was there any opportunity for financial engineering with that business potentially?", "Mogens Bay", "Could you expand on the question financial engineering?", "Jose Garza", "Potentially a spin-off of that business as a sole entity.", "Mogens Bay", "Well, I don\u2019t think that it would make much sense as a separate company. In theory, yes, it probably could, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s on the drawing board here. We like the collection we have on businesses. We say that over time they all to a certain cyclical, but they don\u2019t run in the same cycles. A couple of years ago they were all in an up-cycle on most of them, and right now they\u2019re all in a down cycle. But I think when we look at the future we\u2019ll probably revert to having businesses that are not exactly running in the same cycle.", "Jose Garza", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question is a follow up question from Schon Williams with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Schon Williams", "Thanks for taking my follow up. Mogens, could you just split out the $30 million among the divisions?", "Mogens Bay", "I could, but I don\u2019t have it here, but most - well, maybe we have it here. Hold on a second.", "Timothy Francis", "This is Tim. I\u2019m sorry. Is your question the $30 million of savings or is your question the $30 million of restructuring cost that we\u2019re going to incur during the initial phase?", "Schon Williams", "Well, I guess, how are they different? And I guess, I was more concerned about the savings that are going to be realized, how those are going to be split among the divisions.", "Timothy Francis", "We don\u2019t have - we have a list of $30 million. At this time, we don\u2019t want to share that because there is a lot of different input that are going into our estimates. I can tell you how the $30 million costs are going to be incurred. And from a utility perspective, it will be approximately $5 million, Irrigation will be $1 million, Coatings will be $5.5 million, EIP will be $14.5 million, and then corporate and our other segments will be the remaining $5 million. And again, those estimates are what we\u2019re going to incur in this initial phase of restructuring cost.", "Schon Williams", "And why would the savings be substantially different than kind of that allocation that you just laid out?", "Timothy Francis", "Some of this are asset impairments and the depreciation - although we will save on depreciation run-rate we will save more in terms of what we\u2019re going to incur in cost savings versus fixed asset impairment.", "Schon Williams", "Right, and the asset impairments would be mostly in the - I guess, Coatings and EIP division for Australia?", "Mogens Bay", "That\u2019s correct.", "Timothy Francis", "Yes.", "Schon Williams", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, if I could back up a little bit, in the press release, Mogens, you talked about, there was commentary around North American telecom being weak because of the absence of, I guess, a carrier this quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about kind of what the situation is there? Just telecom had been a source of strength within the EIP division the last couple of quarters. So I just wanted to see, has that dynamic changed, the communications products has been up on a year-over-year basis. I just want to get a sense of it, if that market is changed.", "Mogens Bay", "What I would say, that the big carrier that has been absent in North America for a while has actually been absent for I think more than a year now. We have had good strength in the wireless communication business in China over the last several quarters and that still seems to be the case. And our components business has improved this year despite the weakness with having a big carrier kind of sitting on the sideline for a while. So otherwise I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any big change in the wireless communication business.", "Schon Williams", "With communication products, I mean, would that - that would be negative this quarter then on a year-over-year basis?", "Stephen Kaniewski", "I don\u2019t think so.", "Mogens Bay", "Well, you mean, a negative comparison to last year same quarter?", "Schon Williams", "Yes, just in terms of the growth rate year-over-year. I mean, it had been positive in the first-half of the year, has that turned negative in Q3?", "Mogens Bay", "Hold on a second here and we\u2019ll get you that.", "Mark Jaksich", "Our sales for communication products are actually up year-over-year for third quarter. But you also have to remember that that includes our China business. And China has been building out its 4G network. We\u2019ve been getting some tailwind from that.", "Schon Williams", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, one more if I may. Mogens, hopefully this question is not too brash. But can you just talk a little bit about maybe what the lesson learned is from some of the Australian asset purchases? I mean, when you think back to kind of the original thought process into enquiring some of those businesses, do you feel like to some extent the timing which is for just given what we\u2019ve seen in the commodity complex and what that\u2019s - what\u2019s to the effect that that had on the Australian economy?", "Was it simply just a bad part of the cycle to be getting into that business? Did - was there - I don\u2019t know. With pricing was - in your mind was pricing not favorable when you entered that transaction? Can you just talk a little bit about kind of - maybe what you would have done differently given you had the benefit of hindsight, if you would have done anything differently?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, first of all, it all goes back to the Delta acquisition, which is five years ago. And for the first several years those businesses performed very well. Then you had the mining decline, which affected the Australian economy. And so, maybe even bigger extent, the currency changes between the Australian dollar and the US dollar. So are those businesses going to be good businesses going forward? Yes, we think so.", "The biggest challenge in Australia is profitability in the coatings business. The other businesses are actually operating a fairly good profitability levels, but not to the extent we saw a couple of years ago.", "Now to your general question, if we lived in a world of 20-20 hindsight, they are lot of things we would do differently. What do we think that long-term these businesses are not good businesses, no, we do think that they would be good businesses. We would have to as we have done restructure them in such a way that we can maximize profitability in a weak economy in Australia, but Australia is resources not going to be needed in the future, no, that\u2019s not the case, and we will continue to participate there. Is that answer your questions?", "Schon Williams", "Yes, yes. I appreciate the insight. Thank you, Mogens.", "Operator", "And your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.", "Nathan Jones", "Yes. Thanks. So could you just go back to the corporate expensive for a minute. Mark, can you talk about how much incentive comp has come out over the corporate line over the last couple years. And if you look forward into 2016, how much of that you think, it is likely to come back in?", "Mark Jaksich", "I would say, Nathan for this year, there is little of any in the base number. And if you look at target level incentives that\u2019s in the neighborhood of about $4.5 million to $5 million on an annualized basis. And if you went back into 2013 that number was a lot higher than that because we\u2019re above target and then, of course, there is the share impact on the long-term plan. I don\u2019t have the 2013 figures at my fingertips at the moment.", "Nathan Jones", "It\u2019s reasonable\u2026", "[Multiple Speakers]", "Nathan Jones", "Sorry, go ahead.", "Mark Jaksich", "I was going to say that was the largest impact if you look between 2013 and 2015 it was the incentive side of it.", "Nathan Jones", "So what would you expect if you perform that plan for 2016, in terms of incentive comp to come back into the cost structure?", "Mark Jaksich", "It would be about that $4.5 million to $5 million\u2026", "Nathan Jones", "Okay.", "Mark Jaksich", "Yes. And that would be part of the $35 million corporate spending.", "Nathan Jones", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And that will conclude the Q&A session of today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Laudin for closing remarks.", "Jeffrey Laudin", "Thank you, Holly. And thank you for joining us on our third quarter conference call.

Before I get into the quarterly discussion, I wanted to remind everyone that we are hosting an Investor Day in New York City a week from today. You will have the opportunity to hear from each of our segment Presidents as they discuss their businesses and we look forward to providing a deeper dive into our company. We hope you can join us in person or via the webcast.", "There were a lot of moving pieces this quarter as well as some important developments including the portfolio re-segmentation. Before I get into that, let me first provide an update on the restructuring effort we announced last April. Planned initiatives have largely been completed. This along with other cost-reduction actions will total annual savings of about $30 million. Approximately $8 million of the benefit was realized in 2015. And we are looking for the remainder of the cost savings, around $22 million, to occur over the course of this year.", "Many of the actions taken were focused on footprint rationalization and realignment. We enter 2016 with 14 fewer manufacturing facilities and a reduced global workforce by approximately 7%. While these decisions were not easy to make, they were necessary. The benefit from our restructuring and our focus on operational improvement should position us well to deliver earnings growth this year.", "During the fourth quarter, we modified our reporting structure to improve transparency into our business portfolio, especially as it related to the collection of businesses in our Engineered Infrastructure Products segment. Going forward, we will report in five segments. The renamed Engineered Support Structures segment will now comprise of our global lighting, traffic and wireless communication poles and towers, along with our highway safety business.", "This is a large global business with operating income close to 10% despite operating in a very difficult economic environment. The newly-created Energy and Mining segment will comprise access systems, offshore and grinding media. These businesses have mainly been serving the energy and mining industries and are negatively affected by the recent collapse in energy prices and depressed mining activities. Still, we believe they're good long-term businesses to be in.", "Our tubing business will be folded into our Irrigation segment, reflecting the importance of agriculture to its revenue. The Utility Support Structures and Coatings segments remain unchanged. And finally, there will no longer be an Other segment. We believe this new segment structure will provide you with a better understanding of and visibility into our businesses.", "Let me now turn to the fourth quarter results by segment, excluding the effects of restructuring impairment and nonrecurring items. In the Engineered Support Structures segment sales declined about 15%. Currencies translation, less intercompany demand from utility and general weak economic conditions contributed to the decline. Positive sales momentum in North America was more than offset by declines in Europe, Middle East and Africa. In Asia-Pacific, we saw some uptick in our wireless communication market in China, but softness in other Asian economies.", "In the Utility Support Structures segment, the decline in revenue was to a great extent the result of a much lower steel cost, a significant weakness in our Canadian market and a less favorable project mix. Still, we're seeing improvement in the quality of earnings of this segment as a result of their focus on operational excellence. As we have communicated before, we expect the 200 basis point improvement in the quality of earnings in this segment going into 2016. This segment delivered 8.9% of operating income for the year 2015 and we should return to double-digit operating income for 2016.", "Let me elaborate on the $17 million accrual this quarter in the Utility segment. This accrual is for the anticipated settlement of a commercial dispute with a customer that is a joint venture between two of our biggest customers. This joint venture and its owners have placed orders with Valmont totaling nearly $1 billion over the last number of years. So, they are very, very important to our business. The dispute is over potential warranty issues and connection with a major transmission project. At Valmont, we have complete confidence that we will not have an issue, but to address the concerns of our customer, we would be agreeing to a settlement, including an extensive testing regime, over the next 10 years, as such, we have accrued the expense to cover this.", "The Coatings segment's performance is a combination of two very different markets. North America continues to show strength with external volume offsetting weaker internal volumes. On the other hand, the Australian Coatings businesses is negative affected by the general economic malaise given depressed mining activity levels and a weakening Australian currency. In the newly-created Energy and Mining segment, we are feeling the full blunt of the collapse in energy prices and result in curtailing of capital expenditures by the world's energy companies.", "This environment has affected all three business units in this segment, workforce access systems, Donhad grinding media and Valmont SM's offshore energy-related businesses. One positive in this segment is the strong order backlog at Valmont SM for offshore wind turbine structures. Our challenge in this segment will be to find new markets outside energy and mining to leverage our manufacturing and engineering capabilities.", "Turning to our Irrigation segment, low commodity prices and declining net farm income continue to pressure revenue both in North America and globally. Political challenges and unrest in many parts of the world, combined with a declining value of many local currencies, have added to the headwind. Our Irrigation business, however, continues to manage costs and productivity very well and delivered good earnings quality despite a challenging environment.", "I will now turn the call over to Mark for more color on our financial performance.", "Mark C. Jaksich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Think you, Mogens, and hello everyone. The fourth quarter involved a number of nonrecurring events which I will review before covering specifics on ongoing operations. First, we incurred a total of $26.8 million of intangible asset impairment charges this quarter. In Asia-Pacific galvanizing business unit, you will recall we took a $9.1 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter. As required under GAAP, we completed the full revaluation of this reporting unit in the fourth quarter.", "Because the fair value of the fixed assets in this reporting unit was higher than carrying value, this required a write-down of the remaining goodwill of $7.1 million. In addition, the goodwill associated with our access systems reporting unit was written down by $19.6 million. This business unit has been under significant operating pressure due to market conditions in the mining and energy sectors. In the fourth quarter, oil prices, including the outlook for oil prices going forward, continued to fall dramatically and we reassessed our intermediate-term outlook. Accordingly, we determined that the goodwill was partially impaired and resulted in the write-down.", "Secondly, we incurred an aggregate of $24 million of pre-tax nonrecurring charges related to the commercial settlement in Utility Support Structures segment that Mogens previously discussed and receivable provision related to a customer in the Irrigation segment.", "Let me add some color on the bad debt provision on the Irrigation receivable. This receivable is due from a large customer in China with whom we have done tens of millions of dollars of business over the years and we've always been paid promptly. However on the most recent contract with this customer, we received a number of progress payments, but the receivable is past due and we made a partial bad debt provision a couple years ago.", "In 2015, the customer's economic condition deteriorated further and progress payments were stopped. Accordingly, we determined that a $7 million provision to fully reserve against the receivable was warranted. Despite provisions, we have and will continue to pursue the payment for the amounts owed us. Lastly, $16 million of restructuring charges were incurred in the fourth quarter, largely completing the charges related to the plan announced in April of 2015. Of the charges, $7.9 million was in cash and is related to severance expenses for workforce reduction and the remainder being noncash impairment charges of fixed assets.", "To recap our restructuring charges, in April 2015, we announced a plan of up to $60 million. Our actual charges totaled $82 million, including $40 million of restructuring and $42 million of intangible asset impairments. Almost all the difference between the planned and actual amounts is the goodwill impairment of the access systems business, which was not part of the initial restructuring effort.", "With respect to our international operations, we continue to see negative effects on our quarterly comparisons associated with the stronger U.S. dollar. The effect on sales and operating income in the fourth quarter was approximately $44 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The most-significant currency movements affecting us in the quarter were the euro, the Australian dollar and the Brazilian real. Aside from the impairments, restructuring and other nonrecurring charges, operating income was $49.4 million, down 26% from last year and 7.8% of sales. The decrease in operating income was mainly related to sales decreases. Gross profit margins from operations were comparable with 2014 due to lower raw material costs that helped offset lower sales pricing.", "Operational performance also mitigated the effects of lower volumes on gross profit. On income taxes, we realized tax expense despite a reported loss before taxes. This unusual relationship was caused by two main factors. First, the goodwill impairments mentioned above are not tax-deductible; and two, the UK lowered their corporate tax rate from 20% to 18%. Accordingly, we revalued our net deferred tax assets using the 18% rate, resulting at about $7 million of deferred tax expense.", "Offsetting these factors were a number of smaller items that favorably affected our tax rate such as R&D credits and tax contingency expirations. So, on a normalized basis, our tax rate for the quarter would have approximated 34%. Operating cash flows for the quarter were strong at nearly $90 million and capital spending was approximately $11 million. For the year, operating cash flows were $272 million, reflecting our ability to remove working capital from the business as a result of lower revenues.", "Capital spending for the year was $45 million and we expect capital spending to be around $75 million for 2016. And the 2016 capital spending plan includes a galvanizing facility we're in the process of building at our pole manufacturing site in Texas.", "Regarding other capital deployment activities, we acquired American Galvanizing this quarter for approximately $13 million and repurchased $21 million of our shares under the current reauthorization. We have $179 million remaining under this authorization, which does not have an expiration date. Funding for future purchases of shares will be dependent on available free cash flows.", "Despite a difficult year, our balance sheet remains strong with appropriate leverage for the cyclical nature of our businesses, while providing room to pursue investments and growth of our core businesses through internal investments and new products or market development or acquisitions. Cash at the end of the quarter was $349 million, the majority of which is outside the United States. We have no borrowings under our $600 million revolving credit agreement at the end of the quarter. We remain fully committed to maintaining investment-grade credit rating.", "Our cash priorities remain to: first, support our current businesses through working capital and capital spending as needed; two, to acquire companies that strengthen or are closely adjacent to our existing businesses; three, pay dividends at 15% of net earnings over time; and four, repurchase shares.", "I will now turn the call back over to Mogens.", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Mark. 2015 was surely a transformational year for Valmont, as we completed our planned restructuring efforts to strengthen our position amid ongoing end-market softness. As we look ahead, we cannot short term count on an improvement in the global economic environment to support our results. Restructuring benefits and a focus on operational improvement, however, should position us well to deliver improved performance in 2016.", "We are issuing annual guidance with an outlook calling for earnings improvement of approximately 12% to 15% from 2015's adjusting earnings of $5.63. Additional expectations in forming our current outlook include stable input costs and foreign exchange rates. We expect the first quarter results to be about flat with last year and positive comparisons for the following three quarters.", "And with that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator and take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Thank you.", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Julian.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Hello. Just my first question is around the operating profit guidance for 2016. So, you're guiding overall for EPS growth with muted sales. Could you give any color as to the operating margin expansion that's within your guidance this year? And also, whether there's any EBIT benefit from mix or input costs in 2016 or if the EBIT improvement is all driven by the incremental cost savings of $22 million?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The income improvement is driven by; one, the $22 million remaining of the projected benefits of $30 million where $8 million was already achieved in 2015; and of improved productivity and result of our focus on operational excellence. And as I pointed out, a good portion of that improvement we expect to see in Utility business. We're reverting to double-digit operating income for this year.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Thank you very much. And then my second question is just around pricing conditions, not so much input costs. But what are you seeing in terms of customer pressure or competitive pressure on pricing, particularly in the Irrigation segment and Utility Support Structures?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. In the Irrigation segment, as you can see, the quality of earnings have been good, which means our Irrigation business has done a good job of managing productivity and pricing. Now, as I've said before, you always have a concern if a market continues to weaken, the pricing can become more of an issue. I think what we've seen in the marketplace, we may have seen some price reduction, but they have, if you will, been funded by lower input costs, particularly steel.", "So, I would say, so far so good. But as I pointed out before, it is an issue that, in the past, we have seen more pricing pressure in a down market that we are seeing right now. When we go to the Utility side, you will remember that earlier this year, we made a conscious decision to increase our pricing in the bid market. As a result of that, our hit rate dropped quite a bit. But over the next several quarters, we've seen our hit rate increase, which is a good indication that we're getting traction at higher pricing and the market may also be paying attention to that.", "So, whereas it was maybe a difficult decision to make up at the time, we didn't feel we had any option but to make it, and currently I would say we are getting the business we're planning to get, at better margins than we saw 12 months ago.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Bibb.", "Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.", "Hi. In the USS segment, what was the steel-only impact on revenue?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Could you repeat the question? You were not clear when you started asking it?", "Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.", "At USS, the decline in revenues that was attributable just to steel was approximately...?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "What I would say, in general, you would say that steel cost is about 50% of sales price. And over the year, steel has dropped about 50%. Now, obviously, there's an average in there somewhere between the zero and 50%, but it has been a significant effect on revenue in Utility.", "Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.", "Okay. So, about 25%, in that ballpark?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That would probably be high. I would say, it'd be a little less than that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Drab.", "Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that settlement with the large customer. What kind of inspections \u2013 or what can you tell us about what kind of inspections will take place and where will they take place? And can you talk a little bit more about what prompted the inspections? Thanks.", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we have an agreement with a customer that we don't provide too much detail on it. But inspection is basically inspection of the line, making sure that everything is a-okay and we have agreed to do that over a 10-year period. As I said, our engineers and our manufacturing people are positive that there is no issue. But when you have a customer that may have a concern and it's a customer that is of the size that I mentioned that they have combined the owners of the joint venture and the joint venture have given us business for about $1 billion over the next number of years, you do what's right to retain the customer relationship.", "Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Understood. Thanks. And could I talk a little bit about the utility market and what are you seeing in terms of pricing, capacity utilization since the end of the third quarter? And can you give us a little bit more confidence around that 200 basis point improvement? Is that going to come mainly from restructuring or is that market-driven as well?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think \u2013 let's start with the last part of your question, where's that 200 basis points coming from. They're coming partly from the restructuring, partly from productivity improvement and partly from being able to increase our price in the bid market, as I talked about. Our hit rates are up at higher pricing. So, in general, I'd say that I would still say that the utility industry that we participate in, in North America, still has a very aggressive pricing environment. But we have seen, in some instances, lead times moving out, which would indicate that capacity utilization is going up.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nathan Jones.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good morning, everyone.", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Nathan.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Mogens, if I could start on Irrigation segment, we have heard recently that Valmont may have begun to cut pricing a little bit more. You were talking about a minute ago about passing on lower steel costs. Is this something you're doing just passing on lower steel costs to your customers? Are you getting a little bit more aggressive on going after some share in this environment or what's going on with Valmont's pricing in the irrigation market at the moment?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, since we are the largest player in the market, if we start a pricing war, the competitors have no option but to follow. We don't do that. And I think I've also said in the past that we don't believe that market shares in North America move significantly at all. You can have a competitor that may short term decide to buy some market share, but it reverts to where it was. So, therefore, trying to gain market share because you can is usually \u2013 it's not a very good use of your financial capabilities and it will hurt your earnings over time. So, we are not out trying to lower price in the Irrigation business. Now, you can have project business somewhere in the world or project business in North America that gets more competitive because of the volume involved, but that's no different than we see year in and year out. So, there's no strategy or initiative on our part to lower price in the Irrigation business, because it never works.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "That's very helpful. If I could just get one in on the guidance, I'm having a little bit of trouble getting to your up 12% to 15% on earnings. You've got $20 million \u2013 $22 million from restructuring. Some of that's in Utility, so maybe there's another $10 million coming out of productivity and pricing utility. Irrigation looks like it's got to be down $5 million to $10 million, I think maybe the big wildcard here is the Energy and Mining segment. You were pretty much breakeven in the fourth quarter, but by the looks of the income in the Other segment for the remaining quarters in the year, profitability in that segment had been declining as the year went on, there's no real, I think, idea that you're going to see a rebound in 2016 in that market.", "So, you're maybe down $20 million there, ESS flat, maybe Coatings flat outside of that, gets me to maybe you're up mid-single digits on the earnings side. What is it that's going into your guidance here that gets you to that 12% to 15% earnings growth?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, first of all, we probably surely have more insights into what we expect in these business unit than you would have on the outside. And I would say that it's simply going through business unit by business unit effect of the restructuring, effect of the productivity improvements, effect on supply chain efficiencies, effect of a whole bunch of activities we have taken to lower our costs.", "It is not dependent on a better market position. I would say \u2013 I would agree with you that energy, if anything, may be weaker this year than it was last year, because it didn't start out as weak as it ended up. The Irrigation business, we expect some downturn in revenue, but we expect to hold on to quality of earnings. In the Utility business, it is \u2013 as I have said before, that is driven by both restructuring and productivity improvements and better pricing in the bid market as it relates to the business that we are taking.", "And in the Coatings businesses, I think that in Australia we have probably bottomed out in what we see there and we will continue \u2013 we expect to see some improvement in North America. When it comes to the pole businesses, it is kind of eking out improvements in a difficult market everywhere. As I said in the either press release or in the talker, North American commercial lighting sales improved last year and we expect to continue to see some improvement in that part of the business.", "As the year progresses, we may see some benefit from the Highway Bill. And so, it's a combination of a whole bunch of inputs that gives us confidence in giving the guidance of 12% to 15% with a proviso that it is \u2013 that markets remain not buoyant, that currency exchange rates don't change a lot, and then we're going to see some benefit, not a lot, from having fewer shares outstanding on average in 2016 compared to 2015. So, we are okay with the guidance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kevin Bennett.", "Kevin Bennett - Sterne Agee", "Hey there. Good morning, guys.", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Morning.", "Kevin Bennett - Sterne Agee", "Mogens, I wanted to follow up on your answer and dig in a little bit more on the commercial lighting market in the U.S. I know there's a lot of fears out there that non-res is kind of rolling over. So, was wondering if you could comment on that and maybe put some numbers around what you saw last year and what you may expect going forward.", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, you know we participate in the commercial side of business and in the more highway funded business. And the highway funded business, which is federal and state funded, has continued pretty depressed. Maybe some states have managed to do more of the financing of projects by themselves. But we have seen an improvement this last year in sales to our commercial customers. And going into this year, we are not picking up any indication that there will be a pullback in that part of business. So, these are not big changes. But our overall guidance is made up of a whole bunch of small changes. But the one bright spot in the whole business in North America has been the commercial side of lighting.", "Kevin Bennett - Sterne Agee", "Got it. Okay. And then my one quick follow-up, I'm wondering if there is \u2013 you just did this $30 million restructuring. I'm wondering if there's potential for more in 2016 or if you've kind of cut most of what you can cut without interrupting the business?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say that we're not expecting another restructuring plan in 2016. Does that mean that we're not continuing to find ways to cut costs? No. Examples would be that we are currently going through a major valuation of consolidating back-office activities among our plants in Australia, not only within segments, but also across segments; in other words, centralized accounting, receivable management, payables, treasury functions, HR functions, et cetera, et cetera. These we would not consider restructuring, but it will be part of an ongoing effort to drive our cost to improve profitability.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dave Rose.", "David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, David.", "David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Just maybe a follow-up on the Utility Support Structure business and in the past it's been a little bit difficult to forecast small versus large shipments. And maybe you can provide us a little bit more color on your visibility in terms of the size of the projects, what you're seeing in and the visibility you have in the near term, next six months versus the next 12 months?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say, in general, and I think we mentioned before, the market has changed from larger projects to a whole bunch of smaller projects. If you go back a few years, the large project would be $50 million and up. Today, a large project is $10 million and up. So, we have many, many more smaller projects that we are getting that's just a couple or a few million dollars. It does put pressure on drafting and engineering and scheduling. But we have pretty good visibility, I would say, over the first two quarters of this year. And I would say, it's no secret that a couple of years ago, we were not very good at forecasting what was going to happen in the Utility business. But I would say that currently over the last number of months, Utility has delivered what they said they were going to deliver. So, they have become much, much better in forecasting. And that's what gives us the confidence that we're going to see 200 basis points improvement in their profitability this year.", "A lot of it really came from making the decision to raise prices in the bid market and walk away from business at levels that we didn't think were sustainable for us. And as I mentioned, our hit rate dropped quite a bit when we first started that process, but it has been improving ever since. So, we're glad we did it and we're seeing some of the benefits from it. But we don't have the visibility that we had several years ago with very large projects that span several years. That doesn't mean they won't be there. But currently, the way of life of this business is much smaller projects and many more of them.", "David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe lastly, on the Irrigation side, there are some comments from some of the precision irrigation providers, some of the technologies that are being provided in terms of precision ag. Have you seen an increase in demand for that business such as AgSense? (33:25).", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. AgSense continue to grow. Technology is becoming a more and more important part of the Irrigation business and we will spend more time on that at the Investor Day in New York a week from today.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Braatz.", "Jon Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates", "Good morning, Mogens.", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jon.", "Jon Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates", "You've taken some impairment charges over the last couple of quarters. And I guess my question is, given the acquisitions that you made and the impairment charges, are you refocusing, reprioritizing, rethinking your acquisition strategy, looking at things a little bit differently, in different markets that might not be as cyclical? Any comments on that, on your acquisition strategy.", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, yeah, in general, that would be great. I mean, if we had anticipated the collapse in both mining activities and energy prices, we may have made a different decision then. The good news, though, when we look at those business, and let me take Webforge, as an example, a lot of their business went into those two industries, but the products they made and the capabilities they have are equally useful in general industrial plants and other industries outside mining and energy. So, we just have to refocus where we go after business. The same in Valmont SM, they are energy-related business. You know in the energy business right now it's not like the energy companies around the world dropped their capital spending by 5% or 10%. They basically put a stop on it for a while and we're seeing the impact on that. But yet, on the large structures for wind turbines, we have seen an uptick in Northern Europe in that business. And we have found opportunities outside our traditional markets to look for new opportunities. A good example of that is the I think it's about $10 million utility order that Valmont SM got in Germany for delivery this year that they would not have gotten; one, if they weren't part of Valmont; and two, it was a way for them to leverage manufacturing and project management and engineering capabilities outside their traditional businesses.", "So, we'll just have to continue to double down on our efforts there. When it comes to acquisitions, in general, our focus will continue to not be on creating EPS accretion, but to beat our cost of capital, and we will be disciplined in that sense. The closer we are to the core markets that we know very well, the closer we are to the geographies we know very well, the less risk we see in those acquisitions. So, as I've said before, people often ask me, well, do you have a goal on how much your international business should be as compared to the North American business? And the answer is no. The more opportunities we can find in North America, in the market we know is the best, the more we're going to go after it. And we may think and we do have very, very limited growth in this country, but when you travel the world, we're the envy of the rest of the world. So, opportunities in this country, I think, will continue to present themselves.", "Jon Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates", "Okay. All right. Thank you, Mogens.", "Operator", "We have a follow-up question from Craig Bibb.", "Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Sorry. Can you hear me this time?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I hear you loud and clear.", "Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.", "All right. So, just back to USS, so if you take out steel, it looks like the USS backlog was actually up in tons, is that correct?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we have said that actually the tonnage going through our plants in 2015 compared to 2014 was down only slightly. And I can't give you a specific answer as to whether tonnage is up in the backlog, but obviously if steel costs have stayed the same, you would have seen a different number in the backlog. So, I would not dispute that it could be that volume in the backlog is actually up, but I can't give you a definitive answer.", "Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then, also on USS, looks like there's a large number of the HVDC projects that are getting closer to actually happening. Do you guys have \u2013 do you have visibility into 2017 on some of these really large projects?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we do have \u2013 when we get our business reviews from utility, they are talking about projects where they see activities both into 2017 and 2018. But the order flow has mainly been smaller projects.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brent Thielman.", "Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Yeah. Good morning.", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Brent.", "Operator", "Brent, your line is open.", "Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Yeah. Hey, Mark. Do you have what the overall impact of lower steel prices was on Valmont overall for the quarter in terms of revenue?", "Mark C. Jaksich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. What I would say, Brent, is that, really on the whole, the impact of lower steel prices, if you match that up with effects on sales pricing and mix and things like that, was relatively benign, I would say, on the whole. And I think as Mogens mentioned, in some cases, there has been, like in Irrigation, whatever pricing actions have been taken, have been to some degree giving back to the market some of the lower prices. So I don't think it had a large impact in and of itself on the gross profit.", "Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Got it. Okay. And then on the Energy and Mining segment, obviously, the business is going to probably continue to be tough. But what sort of margins are you targeting over the next 12 months and what can we kind of think about for normalized margin for that business?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That's a tough one to answer, because the speed with which oil dropped and the speed with which energy companies curtailed their capital spending will translate into more competition, I'm sure, and therefore, more pressure on driving down cost. We expect our Energy and Mining business profitability in 2016 to be about even with 2015 in a tougher environment.", "Operator", "Our next question \u2013 we have a follow-up question from Nathan Jones.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi again, guys. Just thinking, again, about the USS business, I recall in early 2014, the canary in the coal mine for some of the downturn in that business was a real compression in the lead times from book to ship. I think you had 90 days of backlog that compressed down to 30 days of backlog or something like that. Can you talk about how that lead time on the backlog is now versus 12 months ago, how that's progressing?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Without knowing exact information on our competitors' backlog and lead times, the impression we get in the marketplace is that lead times have been moving out, which would be an indication that the combination of taking out capacity that most of the players have accomplished and the market staying pretty flat has driven up capacity utilization. So, lead times moving out is a good indicator that the pricing environment should not get tougher.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, agreed. That is a nice positive sign. And Mark, are you planning to give us some pro forma information on the quarters under the new segment reporting structure?", "Mark C. Jaksich - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, Nathan, we will. As we get into the Qs for 2016, all of the 2015 numbers will be recast for comparability. Was that your question?", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Brian Drab.", "Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi. Just wanted to ask a follow-up on the EPS guidance, and Mogens you made a comment that made it sounds like that gain from share repurchase would be only modest in 2016. Given the authorization you have outstanding, if I just run some numbers by you quickly, if you repurchase or reduce the share count by not even 1 million shares, let's call it, 900,000 or 1 million shares, that could get you $0.25 in 2016 and that'd be a full third of your expectation for EPS improvement in 2016. Is that kind of in the ballpark of what you might do or can you give us any thoughts?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think we are planning on that kind of a plus from share repurchase. I think we're more planning on maybe $0.10, $0.12, $0.13, depending on how the year progresses. Depending on what kind of opportunities may we have to apply capital elsewhere, the share repurchase program can accelerate or decelerate. We don't have an end date. This is an open repurchase authorization. So, I think, as Mark has pointed out several times, we're not going out to borrow money to buy back stock. So, a lot has to do with competing uses of our capital and our ability to continue to generate good cash flows. And we will shed more light on our goals around cash flow generation a week from today when we see you in New York.", "Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, if I could, just quickly, the Irrigation backlog was up nicely year-over-year. I know that's not that meaningful and doesn't extend out even a full quarter, but just a curiosity up, from $53 million to $87 million?", "Mogens C. Bay - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The increase in backlog is totally international increase in backlog. And international increase in backlog has to do with projects and it comes with lots of challenges on letter of (44:17) credits and so on and so forth. So, I wouldn't put much weight on the increased backlog as it relates to the kind of revenue we may get. If the increased backlog had been all in North America, I would look at it differently, but that's not the case.", "Operator", "And there are no more questions at this time. I hand the call back over to you, presenters.", "Jeffrey S. Laudin - Manager, Investor Relations", "Thank you, Kayla. This concludes our call and we thank you for joining us today.

Thank you for joining us. The quality of first quarter earnings improved with double-digit operating profit of 10.5% versus 8.6% a year ago. Earnings per share rose 13% driven by the benefits of the 2015 restructuring plus ongoing cost reductions and productivity improvements. Our end markets however remained challenged with no sign of recovery in the near-term. Sales which declined 11% this quarter were negatively impacted by a sharply lower steel cost, negative foreign currency translations and low volumes.", "Let me turn to the performance by segments, in the Utility Support Structures segment sales declined 18% from last year, about half of the decline is the result of lower volume and other half is attributable to a significantly lower steel cost impact on revenue. Efforts to control what we can control led to an improvement in operating income of 10.2% of sales up from 8.7% of sales in 2015. As a reminder, we initiated a price increase last year and while we saw hit rate decline initially it is now commensurate with higher levels, this coupled with our restructuring and productivity improvements efforts has also resulted in an improvement in the quality of our backlog. We expect second quarter revenue to be about 10% higher than it was in the first quarter, and we expect to continue to deliver double-digit operating income. As such we remain confident in our ability to deliver 200 basis points of improvement in operating income this year off the 2015 base.", "Turning to the Coatings segment, lower internal volumes in North America were largely offset by the effect of an acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of last year resulting in flat year-over-year North American sales. Meanwhile continued weakness in Australia pressured sales below last year\u2019s level. Segment operating income improved slightly despite the lower sales helped by restructuring benefits, including plant consolidations implemented last year. Our newly carved out Energy & Mining segment continues to face a very difficult market environment, but we are making strategic moves to strengthen our position.", "In the Access System businesses, we are diversifying our customer base and expanding further into civil and architectural markets. Early results of our efforts are encouraging. In the Donhad Grinding Media business we continue to drive productivity improvements to offset some of the weakness from the depressed mining market in Australia. At Valmont SM we continue to see solid demand for structures and rotor housings for offshore wind farms. For those product lines serving the oil and gas industry remain very weak. Given our expertise in large, heavy, complex deal structures we are focusing on leveraging our capabilities to expand into other verticals.", "In our Irrigation segment North American activity levels continue to face downward pressure as a result of declining net farm income. In the international markets projects in the Middle East and Eastern Europe offset market weakness in other regions. We are not seeing any indications that Irrigation market will improve in the near-term. Second quarter results will be very dependent on volume from storm damage which is unpredictable. On a positive note, the quality of earnings remain very good. Productivity improvements, cost takeouts and effective price management resulted in operating profit of 18.3%, as well we are continuing to invest in new technologies and product development.", "In general we have not seen a meaningful disruption in pricing in North America although multi-system deals and projects continue to be very competitive. In the interest of increasing senior leadership visibility and providing greater transparency into our businesses last year we began including our segment leaders on the call. Today David LeBlanc who is Group President of Engineered Support Structures is here to provide the quarterly update on that segment. Many of you met David at our recent Investor Day in New York, David?", "David LeBlanc", "Thank you, Mogens, and good morning everyone. Q1 2016 at Engineered Support Structures was a solid quarter and a good start to the year. While sales were basically even with prior year operating profit showed healthy the expansion versus 2015. Positive sales trends in the Asia Pacific region particularly wireless communication build outs in China and Australia and improving infrastructure investment in India, offset a number of headwinds. Those headwinds include a large European export order in 2015 that did not repeat stagnant market conditions in the U.S. telecom segment, and revenue compression from raw material deflation. An additional bright spot for the segment were solid U.S. lighting markets, particularly those exposed to commercial construction where markets remain strong.", "While currency translation negatively impacted sales by $5.6 million in the quarter, segment operating income improved to 8% of sales compared to 5.3% last year. This expansion reflected last year\u2019s restructuring efforts, lower input cost and improved manufacturing productivity. As we look forward we expect to continue to make progress expanding our profitability but at a substantially lower rate of improvement then we saw in Q1. We don\u2019t expect the gains in material margins to repeat and we face more challenging overall comps through the course of the year.", "We also expect that the drivers of our improvement will shift some. Our U.S. businesses drove two-thirds of our margin expansion in Q1, in Q2 and beyond, we expect the majority of our profitability gains to occur outside the U.S., as our improvement programs around the world gather momentum, prior year comps in Europe softened and material gains in the U.S. subsided.", "Our overall markets look to be stable coating activity in the U.S. remains solid and our U.S. lighting and traffic backlog is healthy. The market drivers of our Asian businesses are expected to remain intact, while our European businesses are prepared for a stagnant economic backdrop. Rapidly rising steel prices pose a risk for ESS as end market pricing takes some time to adjust. While near-term global steel pricing is likely to rise the medium to longer term is less clear with global steel capacity utilization still in the upper 60s to lower 70% range.", "Our teams around the world are very actively managing and getting out in front of this dynamic on both the purchasing and pricing side. Execution in this overall low growth environment remains critical. Our teams remain focused on driving a number of manufacturing cost reduction projects along with steadily improving our commercial productivity. Summary, our first quarter progress at ESS was very encouraging and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark.", "Mark Jaksich", "Thank you, David, good morning everyone. Starting with sales the 11% decrease was due to a combination of volume of 4%, pricing and sales mix of 4% and foreign currency translation of 3%. The volume impact was largely seen in the Utility Support Structures, Irrigation and Energy & Mining segments. The most significant pricing mix effects were realized in the Utility Support Structures segment which accounted for about half of the decrease in segment sales this quarter. Sales pricing in this market is somewhat related to fluctuations in steel, as such significantly lower steel prices versus the same period in 2015 had a negative effect on our revenues.", "Gross profit margin for the Company was 27% in 2016 up 230 basis points year-over-year. All segments except Energy & Mining reported improved gross profit margins which resulted from lower raw material prices and operational improvements in our factories, including the positive effects related to our 2015 restructuring actions. We\u2019re starting to see some upward momentum in steel prices as we enter the second quarter and lead times have extended for some grades and types of steel. We continue to monitor movements in steel and other key inputs and our working with our key suppliers to ensure effective operations.", "With respect to our international operations the strengthening U.S. dollar continued to be to serve as a headwind. The effect on sales and operating income in the first quarter was approximately $20 million and $1 million respectively. SG&A spending was down from 2015 largely as a result of our cost reduction efforts and to a lesser extent FX translation effects. Operating income of 62.4 million was up 8% from last year and was 10.5% of sales. Our effective tax rate was 32.3% in 2016, an improvement over 2015\u2019s rate of 35%. For fiscal 2016 we estimate our effective tax rate will be 33%.", "Operating cash flows for the quarter was strong at 80.5 million as compared with 55.5 million last year. The improvement resulted from the improvements in working capital management, hence delaying the annual contribution payments for our UK pension plans. Capital spending was approximately $14 million resulting in free cash flow of $66.5 million well in excess of net earnings. We expect annual CapEx to be around $70 million which includes the build out of galvanizing facility at an existing structures\u2019 manufacturing site in Brenham Texas. This galvanizer which is on space vacated by utility as part of last year\u2019s restructuring is expected to be operational later this year. Regarding other capital deployment activities we repurchased $17 million of our shares under the current reauthorization. As of today we\u2019ve $164 million remaining under this authorization which does not have an expiration date.", "Turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet remains strong, our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.7 times adjusted EBITDA, well within debt covenant. Our leverage level is appropriate for the cyclical nature of our businesses while providing room to pursue investments in growth in our core businesses including new product development, market expansion and acquisitions.", "Cash at the end of the quarter was 388 million about 300 million of which resides outside the U.S. As we have communicated our cash priorities are to support our current businesses, where working capital and capital spending is needed. Acquired companies that strengthen or closely adjacent to our existing businesses, pay dividends at 15% of net earnings overtime and repurchase shares. Finally, we are reaffirming our annual guidance for EPS growth of 12% to 15% of 2015\u2019s adjusted EPS of $5.63 per share. I will now turn the call back over to Mogens.", "Mogens Bay", "Thank you, Mark. The first quarter results demonstrated the positive impact of last year's restructuring and our ongoing effort to lower cost and improve productivity while enduring the persistent difficult macro-environment. We are monitoring steel cost very closely but recently we have seen increased steel prices both in China and in North America. As I've said before we're not overly concerned with the level of cost of steel as long as it is getting to where it is going in an orderly fashion. In such an environment we can usually manage our margin profile pretty well. However if steel spikes we can see margin price as we work through the unprotected portion of our backlog and conversely if steel drops rapidly we can see margin compression as a result of steel in our inventory being quite higher than the current market. And with that we're ready to take your questions. Kayla if you'd like to cumulate the queue we're ready for that.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell. ", "Julian Mitchell", "Just the first question maybe for Mark around the gross margin trend, and as you said that grew over 200 points year-on-year in Q1. Is there any way you could parse out I guess the difference in there in terms of the drivers of material costs versus productivity?", "Mark Jaksich", "Sure, yes Julian. I would say that on the whole the effect of lower raw material prices that were in excess of what we had to give back to sales pricing and the effects of productivity were about equal in that regard, so both of them had a good contribution towards that margin expansion.", "Julian Mitchell", "And then Mogens maybe on the Utility business you know the pricing or price mix I know it\u2019s lumpy but it seemed perhaps slightly less negative than most of the quarters you've seen in the past sort of 12-18 months. Are you seeing any change in end demand conditions in Utility at all or is it just sort of lumpiness quarter-to-quarter and specifically I guess if you are seeing any shift in conditions around that, that small projects versus large projects. And the backlog you have the visibility there?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, I would say that in general the market is probably pretty flat. I think pricing has firmed a little and the -- that is mainly evidenced by or should be evidenced by the extension in backlog and in the lead times. The industry lead time has probably extended by a couple of weeks. We have most of second quarter in the backlog, and pretty good visibility to the second quarter. I would say that the mix between large and small projects is still very much skewed towards smaller projects. There's some talk about larger projects but probably not until going into next year but I would say that the environment has not deteriorated from what we saw last year and I think our productivity improvements and cost takeout is what basically has driven our better performance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Craig Bibb.", "Craig Bibb", "Hi, I guess I noted in the press release that the Tubing revenues were down a lot into the first quarter you have reported with these segments. So how much was U.S. Irrigation down and just Irrigation by itself?", "Mogens Bay", "I would say without breaking out the Tubing business but the Tubing business is the one that will see the biggest impact on revenue from lower steel cost prices, so if the whole segment was down 9% and the Irrigation business is probably down more in the 7% range.", "Craig Bibb", "Okay, and international's about the same?", "Mogens Bay", "Yes, in local currencies slightly down as translated into U.S. dollars.", "Craig Bibb", "Okay. And then you guys also called out the China Wireless Tower business, it looked like it was up in the quarter, if do you have visibility through the remainder of the year?", "David LeBlanc", "Yes, this is David LeBlanc, the visibility is decent, I mean as far as the China market provides, we have decent visibility through Q2 at least, second half so a little bit more challenging but the overall dynamic that we saw in Q1 at this point still looks to be similar for the rest of the year.", "Mogens Bay", "Which is a bright positive in China because the China economy in general has been softening so it\u2019s nice to have kind of a niche market there that has helped our activity level in China.", "Craig Bibb", "Great and I just want to\u2026", "David LeBlanc", "It is more than just China it's a piece of India and Australia as well for the telecom space.", "Operator", "Again as reminder please only ask one question and one follow-up question. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman.", "Brent Thielman", "Mogens on the International activity in Irrigation are these more one-off project opportunities or maybe indicative of broader demand within the regions where we can kind of think about better volume going forward?", "Mogens Bay", "I would say that if you look at the base business in markets that have been well established for a long time and in the U.S., Brazil, South Africa, Australia, as an example. Those markets are seeing some of the same pressures as we have seen in North America. Brazil even more so as a result of the declining value of the real, but the Project business is by definition kind of one-offs and I have actually I was pleasantly surprised to see the level of activity in Eastern Europe and the Middle East despite all the political and all the issues surrounding there. I was in Dubai a few weeks back and I was very pleased with activity levels we see there, but there their projects and as I've always said from quarter-to-quarter they can be there not be there, but we benefited from them for sure in the first quarter.", "Brent Thielman", "Okay. And then just thinking about M&A, it looks like you've got the costs aligned restructuring successful here I guess any thoughts are you thinking a little bit more about M&A of rather allocation?", "Mogens Bay", "The answer is yes, as we went through restructuring we still are working on our pipeline for acquisitions. There has not been a lot of activity but as Mark pointed out we have between cash on the balance sheet and our revolver. We have about $1 billion available so we were probably step-up activities in the acquisition side but stay disciplined to not just create an EPS accretion but also seeing our way to beat our cost of capital.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Rose.", "David Rose", "If we can spend a little time on the Irrigation side given that I guess 40% of operating income in the quarter was from there and just a better sense in the margins given what you saw in the quarter was in I think Julian\u2019s question was largely based on that the entire company but maybe if you can breakdown the what you saw in terms of productivity gains, waste, fixed cost absorption or purchasing from the margin component. And then walk us through how we should think about margin pressure on Irrigation particularly from steel because that's a shorter lead time smaller inventory, so you'd impacted more quickly so maybe you can help us better understand pricing dynamic as well given that last quarter you have reduced prices slightly because of lower steel prices and is that implied that you have to raise them in order to maintain margins?", "Mogens Bay", "Well that was a lot of questions, but\u2026", "David Rose", "Sorry, sorry they are all broken out so I can get my additional question.", "Mogens Bay", "I'll try and give you an overall picture. As we have said before the biggest risk to profitability in the downside in Irrigation is if pricing discipline disappears in the market and I am mostly talking North America, but we continue to see very competitive environment for projects for multisystem deals both in North America and internationally. But overall pricing discipline has been pretty much in place, I would say that the improvement in the quality of earnings despite a down draft in revenue is really focused on significant productivity improvements not so much restructuring cost takeout because Irrigation business we've been through that so many times so we took out cost very quickly when the markets contracted. Some benefits from lower steel cost but I would say less that than productivity improvements and I think that if steel moves up here in the next quarter or so this a fairly low quarter from a revenue standpoint the second quarter, so it's more important what happens to steel going into the third and fourth quarter of this year. But I would say that the productivity through the plants cost takeout is the main driver for the quality of earnings.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors.", "Ryan Connors", "My question is I just wanted to talk a little more about Irrigation domestically and when you hosted your Analyst Day back in February one of the things you talked about was it was still a little early in their \"selling season\" to really pine on the market and how it\u2019s shaping up, so now that we do see here in the heart of the selling season, can you just kind of give us a characterization of the market what you\u2019re hearing back from your channel on how things are shaping up here?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, I would say that the market is kind of coming to an end for this year, second quarter is one that really slows down and I would say that there has been no change in the external environment. We still see downward pressure on the revenue side also going into the second quarter. The wildcard in the second quarter as you know it's going to be storm damaged but the underlying business there is nothing out there that says that that will get any better. We always say that then when you move into the third and fourth quarter it all depends on acreage planted and the expectations for net farm income and even there on this we have a production problem somewhere in the world or major shift in demand we have healthy ending inventories and I don\u2019t see much change. So I would say for the rest of this year unless something changes over the summer time more of the same.", "Ryan Connors", "And then just one quick, quick item is on the highway market any update on the Guardrail business? I know last year you talked about it affected your reseller for one of your partners who had the legal issues there, and that that was a headwind last year. Any update on that front?", "Mogens Bay", "I am going to have David address that. And remember that our Guardrail business is in Australia-New Zealand.", "David LeBlanc", "Yes, so for the most part as Mogens said it is an ANZ focused business and that business for us is stable in Q1. I think the supply chain challenge out of the U.S. was a problem for us last year. During the first quarter of this year it was a much more fluid supply chain that helped us serve otherwise stable markets with a better supply chain that was a contributor to better margins for that business in Q1. So the dynamics around U.S. issues and as they affect us and where we compete went away for this year and was an overall positive for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sean Williams.", "Sean Williams", "I am going to take advantage of having David on the call here. Could you just talk a little bit about maybe U.S. Wireless I think in the comments on the call was about that it is still a bit stagnant maybe just talk about when does that market start to perk back up? And then also just any thoughts on when we start to see the kind of the highway portion of the logging business start to really ramp?", "David LeBlanc", "Yes, Sean. As it relates to U.S. telecom, it's primarily related to one large carrier who has redirected most of their CapEx into financing paying for pretty large acquisitions. So, I think that dynamic started last year where there was a heavy pull back from that carrier. And that same dynamic is continuing on into this year. So, we\u2019re not seeing any bounce back from that, that\u2019s been sort of the defining feature of the U.S. telecom space, so it's down and it's staying down from that level. The second question relative to the Highway Bill, long-term we think that that\u2019s going to help us, in the short-term where it does affect us it's going to be I think somewhat limited in that most of the projects that affect us would be longer cycle sort of beyond a one year time plan type of project. So, we are seeing better coating activity, we do think that that is a support for 2017 but we don\u2019t expect a huge uplift from that in 2016.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones.", "Nathan Jones", "Mogens, you talked about some of the sources of the improved margin and one of the things you talked about was improved productivity. I know you have talked about things like in the Utility business the planning of the flow through of the material through the plant, maybe wasn\u2019t as good as it could be. Can you talk about kind of what the sources are of those productivity improvements? How do you feel about execution within each of the businesses, things of that nature?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, let me address it in a broader sense under the label of lean, and we\u2019ve been on a lean journey for a while. I would say the Irrigation business is probably a one that\u2019s the furthest down and have seen the most benefit. Utility has had a laser sharp focus on that over the last 12-18 months. And they\u2019re seeing great improvement. So, one measure is fully loaded cost per hour in our utility plants and we\u2019ve seen a constant reduction in that number and that\u2019s one of the measurements we are looking at. But it's all aspects I believe and the productivity improvement we have seen in the Utility business is impressive. And the way they\u2019re loading the plant centrally, filling the low cost plants the first and how they are centralizing their steel purchasing, doing more mill direct, all of these things have helped with the improved earnings picture. That improved earnings picture is not a result of better pricing, it's a result of better productivity.", "Nathan Jones", "And I guess my second question in on Utility you talked about having raised prices last year, a lower initial hit rate but that going back kind of to where it was before now. Is there a thought of maybe repeating that exercise or do you think you're tapped out on your ability to raise prices there now?", "Mogens Bay", "Well I would say, being back at the hit rate we had is a nice place to be. We've seen an improvement in the quality of our backlog whether we can do that one more time it is possible. You know the trick in the business is that if we want to own more, if we want to gain more of the business, we have to earn it not buy it. And therefore the better we become at running our plants servicing great projects will give us opportunities to probably continue to increase that hit rate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Drab.", "Brian Drab", "On the Utility segment you know the commentary over the last year or so has been you've been seeing volumes kind of hold up and be flat essentially but we saw in if I heard correctly a negative 8% move in volume in the quarter. Was that a surprise relative to your expectation?", "Mogens Bay", "Not really, because going into the first quarter we had a pretty good feel for what volume would be. I would say there was maybe one or two projects that moved into the second quarter that we had expected in the first quarter, but otherwise, you know when we talk about volume one of the things is and we talk about, we have always talked about capacity in this business. When it comes to hours worked, we are pretty flat with what we had last year, but structures tend to be smaller and therefore lower steel volume goes out the plant so they tend to be more labor intensive. So as I also mentioned we expect a rebound in revenue on that business going into the second quarter which is reflected in our current backlog.", "Brian Drab", "And Mogens do you think that that business for the full year ends up kind of flat in terms of volume with that rebound?", "Mogens Bay", "Yes, I think about flat and I think -- what's the biggest change in the Utility business this year is going to be the quality of earnings.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jon Braatz.", "Jon Braatz", "Mogens over the past year you've taken out a lot of cost and restructured certain areas and cut capacity. And I guess my question is what kind of revenue levels can the Company support given that the current dynamics of the Company and without adding additional costs per se. I'm trying to get a sense of maybe what the leverage opportunity should we see revenues begin to increase?", "Mogens Bay", "I would say a lot, in the Irrigation business we can go back to the levels we had two or three year ago, no problem, we can ramp that up. In the Utility business we didn't get rid of equipment. We moved the equipment to other plants. So the question there's ramp of shifts, adding welding stations, adding more people, so we can absorb quite a bit of expansion there. In the Pole businesses we're not a situation where we need to even think about adding capacity. So I would say from a capacity addition standpoint that's not going to be a problem even with a significant increase in revenue.", "Jon Braatz", "Okay, so when we look back I think your, I think it was in 2013, your peak operating margins were 14.5% or 14.3% or something like that. Do you think you've now positioned the company such that when the revenues come back that you can exceed I don't want to put a number to it but or make you put a number to it but do you think you're in a position now to exceed that type of operating margin.", "Mogens Bay", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Bennett.", "Kevin Bennett", "Mogens just one question for you, in the release you stated that you think for the rest of the year revenues will be more in line with last year and I'm just curious what kind of gives you confidence in that statement given I guess what's going on in Energy & Mining and Irrigation?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, you know any given quarter you have to look into the crystal ball and see based on what we know today where we think we're going to be. And we think that in our forecast for the year we don't have an increase in Irrigation revenue we have some business units that's going to do better revenue wise but on balance and not exactly quarter-by-quarter but on balance for the next three quarters, we feel pretty confident that revenues are going to be approximately what they were in 2015.", "Kevin Bennett", "Okay, I mean can you give us a little, I guess a little bit more detail about what will drive that I assume David\u2019s segment I think is one, but is that I mean higher steel prices or what, again what kind of -- what do you think drives that the easier comp on a year-over-year basis or?", "Mogens Bay", "We are not forecasting any impact currently of steel price increases. There may be some but in our forecast it's not a major impact. We do forecast that Irrigation business will not continue to decline in the second half of the year second half of last year was lower quite a bit from the year before, so, and actually in most segments we expect a pretty flat environment and that move a few percentage points up and down yes and for the quarter, yes also, but as we look at it today in total we expect it to be about in line for the nine months with last year.", "Operator", "And we now have a follow-up question from the line of Craig Bibb.", "Craig Bibb", "So it is just maybe a little bit of summary one, but it looks like you have a green shoot that USS margins have improved, you're looking at 200 basis points there, does that business bottom last year?", "Mogens Bay", "Well I didn't hear the first part of your question, was it\u2026", "Craig Bibb", "I mean for you USS, did the business bottom last year I mean were you past the bottom?", "Mogens Bay", "I think so, yes, I think as we said revenue maybe pretty flat but all our internal efforts to improve the quality of the business will drive improved profitability and what we see out there is not a market that will continue to decline.", "Operator", "And we have another follow-up question from Sean Williams.", "Sean Williams", "Maybe Mark, could you just clarify maybe the thoughts around share repurchase I mean operating cash flow was actually quite robust this quarter but this was the slowest rate of repurchase in a while, I am just trying to think about at this point are there higher priorities on the list and share repurchase is maybe a little lower, lower down the list at this point?", "Mark Jaksich", "Yes Sean, I would say the first quarter cash flows if you look back historically were probably a little bit stronger than we normally would have in the first quarter, but that's always -- it's always a bit of balancing act as far as all the different possibilities for uses of cash. And so it is one of those where there is just a fair amount judging that goes into where we are in terms of share repurchase day-to day, week-to-week. And there are some days there has been some days where the volume, trading volumes were pretty low, so that effects our ability to buy shares a little bit as well so no I -- we still plan to continue to be in the market to buy back shares the pace at which we do that is going to vary somewhat overtime. But we try to be as opportunistic as we can and so those numbers may bounce around a little bit well we are certainly continuing to and planning to continue on the share repurchases.", "Operator", "Our next follow-up question is from the line of Brian Drab.", "Brian Drab", "And just quickly I want to follow up on gross margin and just make sure I understand it, if cost gains cost takeout gains have already happened for the most part for the year or will we see those maybe put some upward pressure on margins as we move through the year and specifically can you say whether gross margin, how should we think about gross margin for the Utility segment specifically and overall as we more from first quarter in the second quarter in particular given also these price and input cost dynamics that you talked about?", "Mogens Bay", "If you recall, we talked about cost takeout of about $30 million of which $8 million we have already benefited from in 2015, so yes there will be a little more difficult comparison as we get into the second half of the year. But offsetting that is probably getting more traction on the productivity improvements and operating of this new footprint. And continued focus on cost takeout, I think we mentioned to you at the Investor Day and another occasion that we continue to look for instance in Australia can we further take cost out by consolidating back office activities such as receivable management, invoicing, treasury functions et cetera, et cetera. So we have a sharp focus on continue to find ways to take cost out as we had last year but the main restructuring is behind us, but that doesn't mean that our commitment to find other ways to reduce cost is also behind us.", "Operator", "And there are no more questions at this time. I hand the call back over you presenters.", "Mogens Bay", "Thanks Kayla. This concludes our call and we thank you for joining us today.

The instructions for accessing a replay of the call can be found in our press release.", "I would now like to turn the floor over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mogens Bay.", "Mogens Bay", "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I trust that you've all read the press release. Today, I will address our second quarter performance highlights and provide an update on our focused areas before turning the call over to Steve, who will provide an overview of our Utility Segment.", "As a reminder, we have made it a practice of including our business Presidents on our calls from time-to-time to provide a deeper dive into our portfolio businesses. Following Steve's update, Mark will provide an overview of financials and our capital deployment efforts.", "With that, let me turn to second quarter highlights. Our performance this quarter improved with operating profit increasing despite only 1 segment posting sales growth. Operating income as a percent of the sales were solidly double-digit at 11.2%, earnings per share rose 15% above last year's adjusted earnings, a lower tax rate contributed about $0.04 of the $0.24 earnings per share improvement.", "Last year's restructuring comparable ongoing cost reductions and productivity improvements are having a meaningful impact on our results. Since the first quarter, little has changed to modify our outlook for weak end markets. To improve performance, we must remain operationally lean and expand our market coverage, which we have been doing.", "Now let me spend a moment on segment performance. In the Engineered Support Structure segment, sales were basically flat with the quality of earnings improved to double-digit levels, driven by lower factory and raw material costs.", "Sales in North America were lower due to the sluggishness in the wireless communication market in the U.S., and weaker lighting market in Canada.", "Sales improved in the Asia Pacific region driven by increased wireless communication sales in China and in Australia, and higher sales in India, a small, but a growing market for us.", "In the EMEA region, sales were similar to last year's; markets remain constrained by low levels of government investment in infrastructure projects. Operating income for this segment improved.", "Turning to the Coatings segment, North America\u2019s sales rose mostly due to the American galvanizing acquisitions, which we closed last October. Sales to outside customers were modestly higher, while internal volumes were lower. Asia Pacific sales further decreased as a result of the weak improvement. Also in this segment, operating income improved.", "In the Energy and Mining segment, a better mix of wind structures and rotor housings for wind turbines boosted Valmont-SM sales. Grinding media sales were down due to weak mining in Australia, while Access Systems and offshore construction remain challenged by the weak global oil and gas markets. In this segment, operating income was down.", "In the irrigation segment, North America activity levels contracted as farmers were reluctant to invest capital under the prospect of lower net farm income. And as you know, our domestic irrigation business is strongly correlated with net farm income levels.", "Our international sales were flat with last year. Still we are encouraged by the performance giving persistent weak global crop prices. Our efforts to build strong dealers in important agricultural regions around the world has led to a solid business with a good mix of project activity.", "The AgSense platform which is remote monitoring and control technology continues to see solid uptake in our global rollout, which we initiated last year. The quality of earnings in the irrigation segment remains high. Cost with auctions and lower input cost contributed to operating income as a percentage of sales of 18.2%.", "While the environment remains very competitive as demand is constrained, there has not been a meaningful disruption in industry pricing in North America. Lower average input cost have served to offset the impact on price declines, where they took place.", "With that, I'll turn the call to Steve Kaniewski, who is our Group President for the Utility Support Structure segment, and he will provide more insight into his business.", "Steve Kaniewski", "Thank you, Mogens, and good morning, everyone. In the Utility Support Structure segment, sales declined 7% from a year ago. Most of the decline reflects lower steel cost and its impact on reducing revenue. Volumes were in fact higher most prominently with smaller structures and projects. The quality of segment earnings improved 370 basis points with operating income increasing to 11.6% from 7.9% last year.", "Demand is solid in our market today. The drivers of great reliability, the regulatory push for improved interconnection, and increased renewable mandates are driving demand. Industry competitiveness remains strong. However, we believe our unique capabilities and manufacturing excellence, project management, and a range of product offerings set us apart from the competition.", "Lead times in the industry have moved out some by about 5 weeks on average year-over-year, reflecting increased demand and manufacturing rationalization within the industry. Our move to raise prices in the bid market has been effective, and we have returned to historical hit rates.", "The improvement in the segment's operating performance is being driven by actions our team initiated last year. As you will recall, we consolidated manufacturing facilities and centralized our sales and operations planning process, allowing us to optimize production, the best in site capabilities and costs. We modified our purchasing processes in order to maximize mill direct purchases as oppose to more costly service centers. We are aggressively addressing freight costs, managing both inbound and outbound expenses.", "Lean manufacturing techniques are employed across the entire business allowing for improved slow and accentuating our cost reduction initiatives across the segment, including the back office.", "Given recent steel price increases, I would like to explain the pricing mechanism in the utility industry. Since steel is a significant portion of cost, we have mechanisms in place to share the risk of cost fluctuations in the steel market with our customers and regularly modify prices to account for those fluctuations. While it is possible to experience some dislocations in the short-term, long-term, the effect on margins is neutral, as prices adjust with our customers to match market prices.", "To conclude, the actions taken by the team have allowed us to improve margins meaningfully from last year. I\u2019m proud of their accomplishments, and this should allow us to continue to deliver these improved results and position us well for the future.", "Now I turn the call over to Mark.", "Mark Jaksich", "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Starting with earnings per share, about $0.15 of the $0.24 improvement over adjusted 2015 results was due to improved pretax earnings. We also benefited from lower shares outstanding due to share repurchases and a lower tax rate.", "Drilling down into results, the 6% sales decrease for the second quarter was mainly due to a combination of pricing and sales mix of 4% and foreign currency translation of 2%. In the aggregate, volume changes were minor, as increased utility support structures volumes were essentially offset by a decrease in irrigation. The most significant pricing and mix effect was in the utility segment, which Steve described in his earlier comments.", "Gross profit margin for the company was 27.4% in 2016, an increase of 140 basis points over adjusted 2015 second quarter. The improvement resulted from lower average raw material cost and operational supply chain improvements in our factories, including the positive effects related to the 2015 restructuring actions.", "On a segment basis, the most significant improvement in gross profit percentage was in the Engineered Support Structure segment. When we reported to you last quarter, steel prices were starting to increase. Prices continued to increase throughout the quarter. In some cases, indexes rose nearly 40% throughout the quarter, but have recently leveled off. The impact of rising steel prices on our second quarter results was not significant, due to supply arrangements and inventories in place to meet sales demand. Our expectations are for steel cost to be relatively stable for the balance of the year. With that assumption, we are expecting some sequential headwinds in our gross profit margins in the third quarter, most notably in the Engineered Support Structure segment, where we expect negative comparisons.", "We are raising steel prices - sales prices in light of steel cost increases and will continue to make improvements on our supply chain and operations to proactively mitigate the effects of higher steel costs on our results. We continue to see some pressure on quarterly comparisons associated with currency, albeit at a much lower rate than last year.", "For the quarter, the impact on sales and operating income was approximately $10 million and $1 million respectively. SG&A was down from 2015, as we continue to reduce cost as part of our restructuring initiatives. Operating income was $71.8 million, up 5% from last year before restructuring charges and was 11.2% of sales. We saw an improvement in our effective tax rate this quarter, which was 30.6% as compared with 32.1% in 2015. This was due mainly to a stronger mix of earnings from international operations and U.S. tax credits for research and development.", "For the fiscal year 2016, our estimate on our effective tax rate is to be about 32%. Operating cash flows to the first-half of 2016 were solid at $94 million. Year-to-date, capital spending was approximately $26 million, resulting in free cash flow of 68 million. Our current projections call for free cash flows to exceed net earnings for the 2015 fiscal year.", "We continue to expect capital spending to be around $65 million in 2016. As a reminder, we are building a galvanizing facility at our existing structures manufacturing site in Brenham, Texas. The space was vacated by utility as part of their streamlining efforts last year. The galvanizers expected to be operational later this year.", "Regarding other capital deployment activities, we repurchased $12 million of shares during the quarter under the current authorization. As of today, we have a $153 million remaining under the authorization, which does not have an expiration date.", "We have a strong balance sheet. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.65 times, well within our debt covenant which is 3.5 times. Cash at the end of the quarter was $344 million, $278 million of which is outside the United States. Our cash priorities remain to support our current businesses through working capital in high return capital spending as needed, acquire companies and strengthen or closely adjacent to our existing businesses, pay dividends at 15% of net earnings over time and repurchase shares.", "I will now turn the call back over to Mogens.", "Mogens Bay", "Thank you, Mark. Second quarter results reflect the positive impact of last year\u2019s restructuring and our current efforts to manage what is within our control. We continue to implement activities to drive down cost and improve productivity. We have previously discussed with you our intention to evaluate the consolidation of back office activities and operations in Australia. This analysis has now been completed and has resulted in a plan to further restructure our access system and galvanize operations by consolidating more facilities and headcount reductions. This would result in mostly cash restructuring charges of $4.7 million recognized for the remainder of the year, but with a very fast payback.", "We expect to realize $5 million in lower fixed and compensation expenses during 2017, as a result of these activities. There has not been a meaningful change in our end markets. There are pockets of strengths, in Asia Wireless, offshore wind and North American lighting. The utility market is firm. Our tons shipped are higher than last year. Our coatings business in North America has been running at level similar to last year. The irrigation business is understandably weak given farmers reluctance to make capital investments at this point of time.", "This is the outlook that forms the basis of our guidance. We are reaffirming 2016 guidance for earnings per share improvement of 12% to 15% from 2015\u2019s adjusted per share earnings of $5.63. This includes our assumption that steel will see reduced volatility and costs be at current levels, but it excludes the forthcoming restructuring in Australia.", "And with that, I will turn call over to the operator, and we will take your questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel.", "Mogens Bay", "Good morning, Nathan.", "Nathan Jones", "Yes. If we could just start off talking about the price cost balance sheet. You are obviously seeing very steep rises in steel prices, very steep rises in zinc prices. You talked about some gross margin pressure in ESS, but no talk of that in irrigation or in coating. So I was hoping, if we could start with irrigation, I understand you have a captive distribution network, so how much of the price cause the increase in costs you pass through is really up to you. How do you think about balancing passing that increased steel cost through to the distributors with the potential demand destruction from raising prices to customers?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, let me first say in general, that steel is a minor part of the cost picture in irrigation, probably 15% to 20%, so it doesn\u2019t have the impact, it will have in our structural businesses.", "Second, we have made a lot of progress across the supply chain to drive down cost of other components going into the irrigation business. And in general, even though, there can\u2019t be some very short-term disruptions, steel will usually being able to pass on to the market place overtime.", "And every competitor in this business are in the same position that we are in. We will probably see in the third quarter, a lower quality of earnings that we have in the second quarter, but that\u2019s just seasonal. We still expect the good comparison with last year\u2019s third quarter. But in the irrigation business, I don\u2019t think steel price is going to be that big of a deal.", "But on that subject, you\u2019ve just heard Steve talk about how it\u2019s managed in the utility business, which is unique. The biggest impact is going to be in the engineered support structure business, because you have a good size backlog, favorably funded projects, you cannot go back and change any prices. So you can have a quarter or two before these dislocations get settled down. But if history is any guidance, we have been able to pass on steel prices fairly attractively overtime, and we expect to be able to do that again.", "It looks like current estimates are that even though steel increase quite significantly during the first half of this year, it\u2019s not settling down and our expectation is that it\u2019ll remain at above the current level for the rest of the year.", "Nathan Jones", "And then, within the coatings business, zinc prices are up close to 50% as well. You\u2019re in a fairly weak demand environment, especially outside of the United States. How do you approach passing that increased zinc cost through to customers versus potential demand destruction from higher prices there?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, I don't think you\u2019re going to see demand destruction. You can have some competitive issues depending on using lower cost I think that's already on the kettles. But again, historically, we have not had any issues with passing on zinc price increases, and we don't see anything in our forecasted financials for the rest of this year that would have a negative impact from zinc.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Bibb with CJS Securities.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning. This is actually Robert Magid [ph] filling in for Craig today.", "Mogens Bay", "Morning, Robert.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Could you give us an update on the backlog in USS, and perhaps if any large orders were delayed at Q2?", "Steve Kaniewski", "Sure. This is Steve. Our backlog remains pretty strong. It's up year-over-year. In terms of large orders what we are seeing as we look out at 2017 is a similar picture to 2016. So there are a few large projects on the slate, not nearly to the levels of '13 or '14, but still a good healthy mix of projects. What you tend to see right now is more of a small to medium size type of project structure that's out there right now. But again, our tonnage and hours of production are pretty healthy at this point.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you. And can you also give us an update on your acquisition pipeline, and where your focus is these days?", "Steve Kaniewski", "Yes. On the acquisition side, we continue to have an active acquisition pipeline, nothing that we are ready to announce or anything that's close to being ready to announce. Pricing has still been pretty high, and as you know, we stay pretty disciplined on not looking for just EPS accretion, but looking for beating our cost to capital. If markets continue to be fairly weak, one could expect that price expectations for acquisitions would also moderate and hopefully that will take place. So we are active. Lots of conversations taking place, but pricing is still fairly lofty.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell", "Hi. Good morning.", "Mogens Bay", "Good morning, Julian.", "Julian Mitchell", "Good morning. I just want to circle back on the ESS steel price impact. So I guess, if I look back to say 2008, 2011, the last time you had a big steel price jump, ESS margin went down maybe 200 or 300 basis points, the operating margin. Is that the sort of order of magnitude do you think we could see in the next sort of 6 to 9 months before you offset the cost and possibly customers?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, I think you can see price here for maybe a couple of 100 basis points. But I don't think you will see it 6 to 9 months, you will more likely see it 3 to 6 months. That is with the assumption that steel has settled into a new level.", "Julian Mitchell", "Got it. Thank you. And then you seem - the free cash flow seemed to be hurt by a large outflow for working capital in the first half. I just wondered sort of what drove that, and how quickly that reverses.", "Mark Jaksich", "Yes. Julian, this is Mark. The first quarter's operating cash flows are actually were pretty strong. I think there were around $80 million, but historically has been pretty strong for us. Second quarter is not a strong and sequentially, we had an interest payment on our debt, which was $20 million, sequentially, sales were up between first and second quarter, which drove some increase in receivables and our inventories are higher in part, because the inventory we took on hand to help protect ourselves against rising steel prices.", "So if you take all that into consideration, our cash flows on a quarter-by-quarter basis do fluctuate somewhat, but we expect good cash flows to second half of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian Drab from William Blair.", "Brian Drab", "Hi. Good morning.", "Mogens Bay", "Good morning, Brian.", "Brian Drab", "First, just wanted to start on the restructuring. Mogens, can you talk any more specifically about the number of plans that you are consolidating or closing in Australia in energy and mining, and coatings. And maybe just give us a more complete picture of how many plans are there in that region, and how many will we have after this program is executed? And then also, of the $5 million in annual savings that you're expecting from these incremental actions, how much of that do you expect to recognize in fiscal 2016?", "Mogens Bay", "Okay. I\u2019ll start with the last part of your question. We expect to realize very little in '16, because a lot of the expenses are [timestamp 25.45] also into the fourth quarter. We expect all of it to see that in 2017. So it's a less than a year or about a year payback. We are probably going to end up within access system and galvanizing to lower our number of facilities by 4; 3 in the access systems side of the business, and 1 in galvanizing, where we are consolidating into other facilities.", "So I think over the last year or so, we are probably reduced our footprint in Australia from a number of facilities by more than 10 facilities, and we will end up at about 30.", "Mark Jaksich", "We\u2019ll end up at 26.", "Mogens Bay", "We'll end up 26 facilities at the end of it. A lot of those are small facilities, and we have been able to consolidate some of those without giving up the ability to serve the customer basis that we have in those businesses.", "Brian Drab", "Okay. Thanks for that detail. And then I guess, I'm still really not sure at this point, how to model going forward the operating margins for utility, in particular, for the back half of the year. I wonder if you can just give us any more help there. I'm assuming that, despite being able to offset some of the steel pressure that we should still expect operating margin probably to have some pressure on it in the near term. And then, if you could give us any help on the other segments, I think, it's pretty clear how to model ESS, given the previous question, but just kind of operating margin for the segments in rational?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, in the Utility segment, we actually expect the operating margin to remain about where it is now. So a good solid improvement over last year's levels. In ESS, yes, we just talked about that, and I think for certain in the third quarter, we are going to have an unfavorable comparison in earnings in ESS, and hopefully that will turn around in the fourth quarter.", "Irrigation is more a question of seasonality than it is quality of earnings as a result of pricing. In the third quarter, which is the weakest quarter, we're going to have less factory absorption, and that's going to translate into lower margins like we had last year in the third quarter and the years before that. And in the coatings business, we expect to continue to see margins about where they are now, with low margins in Asia Pacific and higher margins in North America.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Schon Williams from BB&T Capital Markets.", "Schon Williams", "Hi, good morning.", "Mogens Bay", "Good morning, Schon.", "Schon Williams", "I wonder the Coatings segment had a pretty significant sequential improvement in revenues. I mean, just much more seasonally much stronger than what we normally would have seen out of that business. I just wanted to see if you would, is there anything you call out, I mean, whether a pattern or whether some price increases that went through in the quarter that normally don't happen this time of the year or I don't know anything from a volume standpoint that you called out?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, probably part of it was the acquisition of American Galvanizing. Otherwise, I don't see anything particular. You will see a slight increase in customs revenue and a slight decrease in internal revenues, but nothing out of the ordinary.", "Schon Williams", "Okay. Yes, I was talking about kind of on a sequential basis, which should account for American, but we can maybe get into a little bit more offline. The other thing, just on Utility, when should we actually expect to see pricing turn positive there on a year-over-year basis? How quickly can you pass that through? And then, any comment you can give on, you talked at length about some new product rollouts in that division where - if you could just give a little bit of color on where we are with those, that would be helpful?", "Mogens Bay", "Okay. I'll turn it over to Steve. But just in general, he addressed the pricing issue and how steel is less of an effect in pressuring margins in the Utility business, because of the escalators and de-escalators that are [timestamp -30.30] how we do contracts at the Utility business. But otherwise, I'll have Steve talk about it.", "Steve Kaniewski", "Hi, Schon. The effect of competitive pressure is still pretty market out in the marketplace right now. So we do see the ability to continue to raise price as being fairly limited until the market becomes even more robust or there is more capacity taken offline. We don't believe in our forecasting that, that will happen anytime soon. So we are just working on what we control, and what we control is our operating performance, our pricing discipline.", "And as you mentioned with new products, we've introduced a number of new products over the past number of quarters, but the lifecycle of products in the Utility industry is pretty long, and so it takes a while to get traction. But those products have gained good market acceptance over the past couple of quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ryan Connors from Boenning and Scattergood.", "Ryan Connors", "Great. Thanks for taking my call.", "Mogens Bay", "Good morning, Ryan.", "Ryan Connors", "I wanted to discuss the escalation of steel prices from a bit of a different angle in the USS Utility business, in particular. And that is, you talked about the impacts on your margins in terms of individual contracts, but what impact does the spike like this in steel have on the project pipeline. Did some customers back away or defer projects and wait to see whether steel comes back down? Or is there any impact on the cadence of project activity?", "Steve Kaniewski", "Good morning, Ryan. No, there's not really a change in behavior that we see from rising or declining steel price to any major degree. On some other very small structures, there may be some stocking programs that they may time, but it is a very small part of the business.", "On the project-base business, with the time lines, and again, with our overall structures only being about 10% to 15% of the project cost for Utility, the bigger movers are in construction and right of way issues not really are product cost. So it tends to be minimal.", "Ryan Connors", "Got it. And then, my other question just had to do with irrigation. Obviously, we're in a down cycle or depressed market, but you still did $150 million plus in sales in the quarter. So that's a fair number of pivots. Can you just talk about the composition of demand right now? I mean, who's buying? Is it mostly replacement demand right now? Or what's the makeup of the market right now?", "Mark Jaksich", "Ryan, this is Mark. I don't think it has changed very much. I can't give you the exact numbers, but over time, we have kind of been one-third new development, one-third conversion and one-third replacement. And when corn and other commodities were very high, the new market portion of it kind of about 50%, but I think it's settling down to the more traditional combination.", "Internationally, as I said, the international market has actually been performing better than what I would have expected. We have good activity levels throughout the world. And we have actually seen good and surprisingly good activity in Brazil, which is a country that's dealing with lots of both economic and political headwinds, but phenomenal financing and the general robustness of agriculture there has performed better than I would have expected.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Braatz from Kansas City Capital.", "Jon Braatz", "Good morning, everyone. Steve, I've got a question for you. There's been a growing consolidation front within the Utility industry we saw that here in Kansas. Is that impacting you at all in terms of doing business with the same customers? Do you have to reach out to different people? Just curious about how the consolidation trend in the Utility industry, which we think, may be, will continue, might be impacting your business?", "Steve Kaniewski", "Okay, Jon. We've had very good relationships with virtually all of the major utilities that are in North America. And so we have also noticed how the mergers and acquisitions pipeline has really kicked in. What we tend to see is, is very different, each merger by merger. One may leave a unit to operate independently, and so therefore, we see no change in behavior. In other cases, they will consolidate the purchasing groups, and in some cases, we may have to rebid an alliance contract. But we've been successful in maintaining all of those through this process. And we've been competitive and be able to keep those customers. So it does vary. And we'll just keep an eye on it. And we know that we can be competitive, and if there really is a push to re-price, we feel we're capable of handling that.", "Jon Braatz", "Okay. Thank you, Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson.", "Brent Thielman", "Hi, good morning.", "Mogens Bay", "Good morning.", "Brent Thielman", "On ESS, you mentioned that was the 1 segment that grew this quarter, is your expectation you will see revenue grow there in the second half, albeit at lower margin?", "Mogens Bay", "Let me - I think the answer is yes. The answer is yes.", "Brent Thielman", "Okay. And then, the irrigation business is still under some pressure, how do you feel about the cost position today, assuming we're going to continue to see some pressure on revenue there, and, I guess, thoughts on implementing any additional restructuring initiatives in front of those declines?", "Mogens Bay", "Well, I think that the irrigation business over decades, because they've always been cyclical. And they have been very good at adjusting cost to market conditions without cutting off investments in the future. And I don't see us having any major restructuring as a result of a continued weakness in that market. We will - we are actually surviving through this downturn in much better shape that I have expressed my concerns about on previous calls, because even though pricing is competitive, we've been able to offset some of that competitiveness with better productivity, better supply chain management, and until now, also, lower steel cost.", "So I think, we'll continue to probably do a good job and doing that. And I don't see apart from constantly looking for cost takeouts through operations, I don't see any major restructuring coming.", "Operator", "We now have a follow-up question from Nathan Jones from Stifel.", "Nathan Jones", "Hi, guys. Couple of questions for Steve. Steve, I know we've had an absence of large projects for your business over the last couple of years, few years. There are a few large projects scheduled to potentially come to market in 2017. Can you comment on the outlook for those projects, and whether or not you have seen any RFQs or anything like that for those yet?", "Steve Kaniewski", "Yes, Nathan. We have seen a couple of the RFQs already come out. So we've already bid a number of those. There is expectations of awards later in the quarters, the third and fourth quarter. Then there is a couple of projects that are later in '17, and we\u2019ve not yet seen those RFQs come out, although there is a lot of discussion with those customers at this point.", "Nathan Jones", "And then, can you talk about Valmont's striking capacity out? Can you talk about how much in terms of, volume, tons of capacity you\u2019ve reduced, and what your understanding is of what capacity has been taken out elsewhere in the industry?", "Steve Kaniewski", "Well, as was mentioned on some earlier calls, one way to think our capacity is to adjust your shifts and the number of stands that you met. And so the combination of taking out the facilities last year as well as then adjusting shifts work really allowed us to tune in our capacity to match demand. And we continue to do that now as we add capacity back in to meet this increased production. It's really being done in the existing facilities by just changing shifts and adding people to the stands. From a competitive perspective, we've heard a number of our competitors basically doing the same thing, albeit, it lagged a little bit to our own activity.", "Operator", "We also have a follow-up question from Brian Drab from William Blair.", "Brian Drab", "I've got a few maybe for Steve here just on the Utility segment. First, following up on Nathan's question that he just asked, these large projects, if they hit or you're successful bidding on these, where does this fall on the spectrum of kind of - at the low end of the spectrum, this is business as usual, large projects, there are some large projects this year, and there'll be some next year to the high end of the spectrum where those wins would represent a material step function up in Utility revenue?", "Steve Kaniewski", "It's really just along the historical trend line. We always were successful in capturing a certain percentage of these large projects and then a certain percentage in the bid market as well. And so, they're nice to have projects, because you can tend to tune your capacity and your engineering and drafting resources towards those, so you get some efficiencies. But from a revenue perspective, if it's really at the historical trend, it would most likely be relatively flat.", "Brian Drab", "Okay. Got it. And then, Steve, you mentioned FERC 1000 in that order briefly at the Analyst Day, hasn't been mentioned really at all in any of the conference calls. Am I correct in concluding that this is really one of the major factors that will be affecting - that is affecting Utility business today and probably will for several years at least to come?", "And could you - I've been studying this, but [timestamp 42.21] my sense is that a lot of investors don't have all the details here and appreciate - appreciation for the nuances within this order. I wonder, if you want to take the opportunity to kind of explain how this - why it's driving smaller projects, what kind of happens, and how has it affected the bidding process, and who are the entities that are being affected and how it trickles down to you?", "Steve Kaniewski", "Okay. I'll just kind of answer it on a general pattern. FERC 1000 was intended to create a competitive market within the Utility transmission industry. And to that end, I believe it has been successful and really is now baked into the mentality of almost all of our customers. So even if a customer hasn't had a FERC project, their boards would have challenged them to go out and analyze their cost, benchmark it across the industry to make sure that if there was 1 in their service territory they wanted to go out and get it, that they could, they have the ability to do that.", "And so you saw all of the customers really take a hard look at cost, their engineering specifications, what kind of selection of product meant for construction cost, and so part of our broad array of products is to help address that market in any which way that, that customer believes they can be competitive in the marketplace.", "There was at least an initial movement towards lower voltage classes, as people kind of work through the idea of having to get competitive before going into some big projects. But I think, what you see now is really a settling down in the market and kind of a new normal that is just going to be a competitive marketplace, and you're going to have to provide value and good cost, and I think, we're in a good position to do that.", "Operator", "And there are no more questions at this time. I hand the call back over to you presenters.", "Mogens Bay", "Thank you, Kayla. This concludes our call, and we thank you for joining us today. The message will be available for playback on the Internet or by phone for the next week. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.

Good morning, good afternoon to all of you and welcome to our Q4 and full year 2015 presentation of WABCO's results. However, before we jump in the details of our performance, let me kind of take a step back and frame where we are. I would say first for 2015, as we do normally, the WABCO operations that I also call the WABCO machine continued to fire on all cylinders and this in spite of a global market that stayed very hard to predict and even extremely volatile actually.", "Looking at first this unique ability that we have had and continue to have to outperform our truck and bus market. In the fourth quarter, as you will see, we have grown double-digit, more than 10%, the top line of our company in spite of a continuous erosion by 1% for the quarter of our market. For the full year, WABCO increased the revenues by almost 7% in a global market where 7% less truck and buses were produced in the world.", "We also continued very strongly to drive our productivity. Last quarter, Q4, we actually broke a new record in percentage for material productivity, at 6.6%. For the full year, we also broke a new record across our factories for productivity. And this obviously contributed to continue to slow down this increase in revenue all the way to very strong profit at the bottom line. And on top of this, we transformed 98% of our net income into free cash flow.", "However, this now familiar picture of the company that provides very strong performance has been unexpectedly painted by what I would call a very surprising decision by the European Commission that was announced a month ago to actually declare a tax law established in Belgium more than 10 years ago as illegal because deemed as State Aid. Prashanth will drive you through all the details and the impact it will have or could have on WABCO. But I'd like to kind of make a few points here that I think are important to make up front.", "First and foremost, WABCO always strictly respected the laws in Belgium, like we do in all countries we operate in. Second, there are more than 35 other corporations apparently involved in this tax program and WABCO is one of them. However, we only participate in this program since 2012, even though the tax law was implemented back in 2004. And we have generated less, much less, benefit from it than most of other companies. That's what we understand at this point.", "And the third point is, as you can imagine, we have rapidly surrounded ourselves with advisors and experts to help us establish mitigating routes that would lower the impact of this decision on WABCO or even potentially cancel it totally. Indeed, we are contemplating the opportunity right now to appeal the decision for full annulment. It may be surprising for you, however it's not uncommon that decision of this sort by the European Commission be annulled by the European Court of Justice, and this is what we'd be looking for.", "Now, and again Prashanth will actually bring you through the details of how at this point this very fluid, because very new, situation is kind of perceived and kind of results in guidance for our tax rate for 2016 and a few years after. And Prashanth will bring you through that.", "So let's go rapidly through the results of our quarter and full years. In Q4, we increased our top line by 10.5% leading to an operating income of $87.8 million, i.e., an operating margin of 13.1% versus 13% a year ago. Performance EPS of $1.43 versus $1.38 a year ago and returning again $62.5 million of cash to shareholders through buybacks.", "For the full year, the top line grew by 6.6% in local currency, with an operating income of $354.4 million corresponding to a margin of 13.5% versus 13% a year ago, driving us to an EPS of $5.62 for the year versus $5.52 for 2014. Again, free cash flow of $321 million driving a conversion rate of 98% and we return very close to $250 million to our shareholders, as indicated at the beginning of the year.", "Going to next page and looking at the profile of our gross, as we do every quarter. First, by channel we grew the OE business by 13% in a market, again, that eroded by 1%, supported by a continuous increase of our content per vehicle and share of market gain. Aftermarket grew a very healthy 8%, with a remarkable growth of 17% from our Transics acquisition that we made close to two years ago.", "Now looking at all markets versus our revenue performance, actually we have been outperforming every one of them last quarter. Couple of highlights. In China, we outperformed by 22%. And in India we outperformed 58%, driven by the implementation of that mandate for ABS systems on all heavy duty trucks.", "Going to the next page and looking at this profile for the full year, our OE channel grew 5% in a market that has seen the number of trucks and buses built around the world decrease by 7%, through, again, continuous increase of our technology content per vehicle in every region as well as continuous improvement in our share of market. Aftermarket grew 7%. Now, looking at all the different regions, we outperformed everywhere except in Japan and Thailand. But to highlight South America, we are very proud to have actually outperformed a market that melted down by 44%, which is, I feel, remarkable achievement.", "Japan, Korea, as I said, we underperformed by 2% because, as we have indicated in previous quarters, our phasing out a wedge brake program on a truck model that is put out of production by one of our customer over there. China grew a very healthy 25% above market for the full year. And that's, again, some increase of ABS penetration and either important market share gains. India, overall for the full year grew, again, a very healthy 16% above market dynamics. And that's, again, all kinds of new technologies, including in the last quarter, the ABS mandate that was implemented.", "I'm going to let Prashanth drive you through the detail of our financial performance now. Prashanth?", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Jacques and good morning, everyone. Look, we can go to chart six. I'll talk you through Q4 2015, which was a solid quarter for us highlighted by the strong top-line growth. In the interest of time, I'm going to focus on the key elements only to allow for more Q&A at the end and, as usual, I'm going to focus on performance numbers. We define performance both back on slide two as well as in the Rec tables at the end.", "As Jacques mentioned, global truck and bus builds are down 1% year-over-year. But despite this headwind, we had strong sales growth of almost 11% in local currencies. Our WABCO operating framework continue to translate the sales growth into operating income by a strong productivity: 6.6% on materials and 6.5% on conversion.", "At a constant currency, our performance OpEx increased by about $14 million, and this was driven by higher non-cash pension expense of $5 million and $4 million of inflation. Our OpEx productivity program allowed us to further invest in R&D while containing the OpEx growth. And on a performance basis, our operating income for Q4 2015 was $88 million or 13.1% of sales. If we exclude the quarter's non-cash expense from the higher pension of $5 million, our incremental margin is accretive at 16%.", "The full-year performance tax rate dropped from the forecast we last gave you of 11.8% to 11.3% and that resulted in $0.03 of EPS impact for the quarter, which brought us to $1.43, up $0.05 year-over-year. And so to recap the quarter, strong top-line growth at 11%, strong market outperformance, as Jacques walked you through, and EPS at the high end of the guidance we gave you.", "If you can move to chart seven, I'll take you through 2015 full year and share how the productivity engine at WABCO continued to show EPS growth despite this down market. We grew sales by 6.6% in local currency despite a significant 7% decline in truck and bus production. We delivered $73 million of savings from productivity, 5.5% on material cost and 6.5% from conversion. This was equal to and thus offset the headwind we faced of about 1.4% of pricing as well as our labor and salary cost inflation. That resulted in a performance gross profit margin of 31.6%.", "At constant currency, our performance OpEx increased by about $44 million, driven by higher pension of $16 million and inflation of $15 million. We've talked with you in the past about our flex program and, in the year, it delivered $20 million, which allowed us to invest in R&D and strengthen the front end. On a performance basis, our operating income was $354 million or 13.5% of sales. And as a reminder, our Op income benefits from the stronger dollar, and that's about $18.5 million for the full year.", "If you take into account that we had to overcome the $18 million of non-cash expense from the higher pension cost, we delivered an impressive incremental margin above 20%, which well exceeds the operational framework that we communicate.", "Equity income, which primarily represents the profits from our unconsolidated joint venture with Meritor, grew $8 million compared to prior year. And as I mentioned in the previous slides, performance tax rate was down to 11.3%. So after excluding the non-performance items, you can see that our earnings per share was $5.62 for 2015, which is up $0.10. So despite 2015 being a very challenging year with down markets and currency headwind of $0.44, we were able to show EPS growth.", "If we can now move to chart eight, I'll take you through our cash flow for 2015. Excluding the impact of non-performance payments, our performance free cash flow was $321 million, convert performance net income into free cash flow at 98%. This was helped by the non-cash pension expense of $18 million, but still represents very strong performance.", "And finally, we continue to return cash to our shareholders through the buyback program. In 2015, we purchased nearly 2.2 million shares at a cost of $249 million.", "So that wraps up 2015 and let me hand it over to Jacques to take us through the market outlook for 2016.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Prashanth. So let's turn to page nine, starting with Europe. Very strong fourth quarter in terms of registration for heavy duty trucks in the western part of our Continent; 15% full year, 18% growth versus 2014. When you look at production including Russia, Q4 production was up 16% versus a year ago, and full year 6%, which brings the level of trucks and buses built in Europe still 21% actually short of its peak in 2008.", "Moving forward, we believe that driven by continuous slow but strong kind of continuous GDP growth of 1.7% forecasted, we see a continuous upside on registration, 5%, which leads all together for the Continent to a forecast of production between flat to plus 5%.", "Looking at the U.S., production in Q2, as expected, is down actually 2% versus a year before. One highlight, though, is actually whereas the GDP growth has been established at about 2.4% for the full year, it was only 0.7% for Q4, which is in line with the strong slowdown of production of commercial vehicles. For the total year, we still had a very strong 7% increase in overall production for the U.S. At this stage, we estimate that there is 20,000 trucks in inventory that will obviously impact the production level for next year that we forecast between minus 10% to minus 15%. Now, in our own view, if the GDP growth is confirmed to grow at 2.4% for 2016 as well, I think we should not be surprised to see some upside in the second half of the year compared to this forecast.", "Moving to China. As expected, Q4 production continued to slide down, driven by a weakness in the economy over there \u2013 or a weaker economy actually. Total year production was down 22% year-over-year and our estimate is in line with the current dynamics for a continuous erosion, flat to minus 5% for 2016.", "Moving to India; driven by a very strong growth of GDP at 7.5%, the full-year production was up 27% versus the previous year. And we think that pathe (18:18) will continue to drive growth in our industry, so we anticipate 2016 to provide another plus 5% to plus 10% increase in the production level versus 2015.", "Moving to the next page, Japan and Korea. Full year was down 6%, mostly impacted by a slowdown of production in Korea impacted by lower exports, particularly to Russia, as well as lower demand for commercial vehicles in Southeast Asia that impacts the Japanese manufacturers. We think that, moving forward, the production across all those regions will stay about flattish.", "Brazil, as we said, is very much of a disaster for the moment. Q4 saw another 47% meltdown versus a year before. So total decrease in production year-over-year established itself at minus 44% versus 2014. Now, looking forward, because we don't see much of an improvement in the situation with both the economy and the political situation, we believe that there will be some further erosion between flat to minus 10%.", "Aftermarket grew a healthy 7% in 2015 and we expect it to continue to grow a healthy 7% in 2016. And finally, trailers for the full year were down 4% year-over-year, impacted by both China and Brazil actually, with growth in Europe and North America. And we expect 2016 production of trailers to establish itself around flat to minus 5%.", "Moving to the following slide. And as we do every quarter, we kind of mention a few highlights along the three-pillars our strategy, starting with a new long-term agreement signed with one of the large heavy-duty truck manufacturer in China. As I mentioned before, the ABS mandate was implemented in October 2015 in India. And an interesting highlight also is that all local commercial vehicles had to rely rely on WABCO's test track to homologate their vehicles because WABCO's test track is basically the only accessible test track for them.", "New technologies. We were the first one to introduce and we are still the leading supplier of providing AEBS and Lane Departure Warning in Europe. And as you know, the mandate has been implemented in November of last year. We acquired a company, MICO, that I will present to you just thereafter. We launched a new brand in the world of aftermarket to address this segment of low-budget spare parts that was so far mostly occupied by suppliers from low-cost countries, particularly from China.", "And then we are providing to our fleets that are relying on our Fleet Management Solution from Transics, a new functionality of remote door-lock which is actually very valuable in many countries across our markets. And then in terms of execution, mentioning quite a few more awards we received in the fourth quarter, 19 all together, particularly in India and China, totaling in those two regions 28 awards from individual customers. And then as Prashanth mentioned, we continued to deliver very strong and healthy productivity, both at the sourcing and in our factory.", "Turing to next page, a couple of slides to introduce you to the world of MICO, which is the acquisition we closed a couple of weeks ago. MICO is a leading innovator and manufacturer of hydraulic braking systems for off-highway vehicles. It's a private company with revenues of $52 million in 2015, mostly addressing markets in North America, with some routes in Europe and Asia, cutting across all segments of the off-highway world with more, obviously, weight in construction and mining, material handling and agriculture. Sales evolution shows a fairly low actually level of cyclicality, with about 5% CAGR in the last 10 years or so.", "Turning to the following page describing the rationale of why we thought it was a very good value driver to integrate MICO as part of the WABCO family. First, there will be a mandate in Europe starting in 2018 for agricultural tractors to integrate ABS systems. We believe that we are at the low-end of the cycle for the off-highway segment, particularly related to agriculture and construction and mining. And we think it's the right point to enter into that market or actually further our presence into this market.", "Now looking at attributes on both sides and how we can create a very differentiating value out of them. First, MICO, as we said, is one of the leading hydraulic braking system suppliers in the world of off-highway, mostly footed in North America. WABCO, as we all know, is a top leading designer and supplier of pneumatic braking systems with a global presence in all markets for off-highway vehicles and with extensive presence in aftermarket. So the combination of these two differentiated companies I think will unlock a very, very strong value for our shareholders. And all together with this acquisition, WABCO is actually the only supplier in the world to provide both hydraulic and pneumatic braking systems for the world off-highway. (24:46)", "So now I'm going too let Prashanth drive you through the situation triggered by the decision from the European Commission on Belgium taxes. Prashanth?", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Jacques. So I'd like to give you some context on where we are and our guidance going forward. So if we can start on slide 14. Belgium is an important location for WABCO. It's not only our headquarters, but it's also the base of our European operations. We've been operating here since the 1990s. And as Jacques mentioned earlier, four years ago we joined a long-established tax incentive program. We did so by obtaining an official acceptance from the Finance Ministry, which is sort of equivalent to the Department of Treasury in a U.S. context. And as noted on the slide, the program has been a federal law in Belgium for more than a decade.", "But about a month ago, 12 years after the establishment of this law in Belgium, the European Commission decided that this program is illegal and has instructed the Belgian government to recover from all MNCs the benefits that they have received since this program was established in 2004. And I must say we find it a bit incredulous that the laws of a sovereign country can be overridden by the European Commission 12 years later.", "But nevertheless, WABCO joined the program relatively late, in 2012, and since that time we've accumulated about $85 million of benefits. And as we still have a significant amount of NOLs in Belgium, mostly from pre-spin, we do not expect to reimburse cash. However, this would likely eliminate all our remaining NOLs. So that's sort of the current status.", "And let's discuss what we can do now. We see a number of viable paths that can either minimize or eliminate the impact of the European Commission decision. First and foremost, we believe we have a credible path to get this decision annulled. Annulled means that the EPR program continues as before and we would not have to reimburse anything.", "We're optimistic that this could happen here as well. Recently, four State Aid cases that went to appeal were won: two from Spain, one from Ireland and one from Hungary, which gives us comfort that this is a possibility. And as we look at what is happening in Belgium, the Finance Minister has announced the intention for the country to appeal and, in our part, we're in discussion with outside council whether to do the same. Our first view of the device suggests our WABCO case has good merit relative to the principles of State Aid law. In the event the decision is annulled, our tax rate would remain in the mid-teens, aligned with our previous guidance.", "Another path we're pursuing is to have the amount of the clawback reduced. And there are a few ways we can do this, with the most probable being that we actually re-file all of our tax returns for the past few years and instead of taking the EPR deduction, we would use other available deductions. And remember that because we have losses that can be used, this would reduce the EPR benefit that we booked and, therefore, reduce the clawback, but it would also preserve some of these NOLs for use in future years, which would will allow us to keep our cash tax rate in the high-teens. And lastly, be assured that supported by experts from the Big Four, we're evaluating every possible options to preserve shareholder value.", "We understand that this EC decision creates uncertainty, so on slide 15 we want to give you our current view on how to think about our GAAP and performance tax rate going moving forward. Let's start with the performance tax rate. Right now, for 2016, the range is wide. Without the EPR and our NOLs, we would be at 25%, but our mitigation actions could bring us down to 16%. At this point, we believe a 20% rate would be realistic for guidance. And this would assume that some, but not all, of our mitigation actions are successful, but with the opportunity to improve. We will of course keep you updated as our confidence further strengthens.", "On a GAAP basis, our tax rate would be impacted by how the clawback will be accounted for. We're in discussion with our auditors on what the appropriate treatment is, particularly given our high conviction on some of our mitigation options. But if we presume that we would need to recognize this liability until we have more clarity, that would mean, a one-time non-cash expense of $85 million, which would increase our GAAP tax rate by 28 points. However, as mentioned previously, we do feel confident that we have solid leverage to reduce this amount. What remains uncertain is the timing.", "Beyond 2016, we have two key elements driving the rate. The first is the appeal process, which could take up to two years, and the second element is the benefit of alternative tax programs that we're pursuing and will be able to confirm later this year. We certainly remain optimistic that we will find a path to keep our performance rate in the high-teens, preserving shareholder value.", "I'd close by saying we are certainly frustrated that this creates uncertainty for both us and our investors, but are confident that we have strong levers to minimize or eliminate this disruption and want to emphasize our commitment to stay fully transparent on this matter.", "Now let me hand it back to Jacques for 2016 P&L guidance.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you, Prashanth. So looking again at the next 12 months, we estimate that our sales growth should reach a level between 6% to 11% in local currencies, leading to a range of $2.7 billion to $2.83 billion, with a performance operating margin between 13.8% and 14.3%, leading to a performance EPS of $5.33 to $5.80 and continuing to deliver healthy cash flow with conversion rates between $0.80 to $0.90.", "So on the right, actually we have built a very simple bridge to frame the impact of this tax increase. Starting at $5.62 in 2015, the performance of the WABCO core business provides $0.35 to $0.85 of upside with still a little bit of a headwind from FX predicted. And then $0.60, bringing our tax rate from this exceptional low level of 11.3% in 2015 all the way to 20%. As I remind you, the guidance that we had initially provided to you was kind of mid-teens 16%-typeish. So that additional 4% is, again, due to the potential impact of this decision from the European Commission are, leading to that $5.30 to $5.80 bracket.", "The main assumptions we make are a continuous price erosion in that bracket, 1.3% to 1.7%. We plan some tailwind from raw material, 0.4% for the year. And again assume a performance tax rate in the neighborhood of 20%.", "Going to the last page, I would summarize the situation by saying that, again, WABCO continued to deliver differentiating results in 2015 through our performance, strong incremental margin and cash flow conversion. And we plan to do the same thing, potentially, though, tainted in 2016 by the impact of this decision by the European Commission. However, again, the impact could be annulled moving forward if we are successful at appealing in the European Court of Justice against the Commission.", "So this is the end of the presentation. And I would like to open now for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey. So just on the different markets, maybe just North America. Within that down 10% to 15%, how are you thinking about Class 8? And then Europe, I think last quarter you had the same kind of range, but you were maybe feeling little biased to the high end. Just maybe update us on that view.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Actually, first, the U.S. Unfortunately, Class 8 will be more effective than the average, as we have shared with you previously, and it could be a few points more than the range that we have provided to you.", "In Europe, indeed, we ended 2015 on a very high note in terms of registration in the western part of Europe. And I think it's encouraging and we could believe that there is potentially some upside, so we could end up more on the right end of the range rather than the left, at this point as we see it.", "Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then, Jacques, the stock has kind of moved from $130 into the $80s here and it looks like you stepped up your buyback a little bit. But maybe just update your thoughts on maybe how you're thinking about not using or using leverage to buy back stock on dips like these?", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Jeff, we have an authorization until the end of this year to add another $250 million to our program. And I think we're going to operate within that framework. Think about the fact that we just acquired a company on top of this. So I think at this point, like we have actually communicated to you, we are not pursuing any kind of plan to further leverage our balance sheet to add to the $250 million committed.", "Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning and good afternoon, everyone.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Jerry.", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Jerry.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I'm wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing in Transics? You highlighted that the growth there accelerated, looks like in the 20%s on an organic basis. Can you talk about where penetration rates stand in Europe now for the telematics products? And are there opportunities to leverage the technology in other regions?", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The penetration is not very much increased in the last year or so, but we are very successful at actually bringing Transics beyond its traditional market, which is more around Benelux, Southern Europe rather than Northern Europe, particularly Germany. But this kind of strong increase in revenues is mostly driven by the synergies in the sales team and connectivity we have across the European fleet.", "And we continue to add value. As I said, we just acquired the opportunity and the capability of providing this OptiLock (37:43) remote locking system to fleets. And that's important in many countries in Europe where you are not able to open a trailer without remotely having this lock kind of operated through the FMS system. And we continue to enrich the \u2013 what I'm saying, the functionalities of this system.", "Now, what is more important in my opinion is that we continue to look at opportunities to bring these technologies, FMS technologies, beyond Europe. We have been focusing obviously on the U.S. and we are not yet in a position to make any decision or announcement. We are also in parallel looking at emerging markets that would demand an FMS system with a lot less sophistication and functionalities and obviously at less cost. But that's something that, again, we are focusing a lot on for the future years. So I'm telling you this acquisition has been superbly successful and a real piece of jewelry that we added to the WABCO world.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And, Jacques, on a similar note, the opportunity on MICO, how quickly do you think you can roll out the product into other regions using your existing relationships and channels? How should we think about the timing of that 10% revenue CAGR that you're talking about over the long term?", "And can you touch on the \u2013 a lot of the end markets that the company currently serves are in a very tough spot. Should we be thinking about 2016 as maybe a relative soft spot in MICO before the initiatives that you're working on to cross all the products kick in? Can you just frame that for us?", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Long question, Jerry. Let me kind of frame it. First, we are dealing, particularly in the U.S., with all very much leading providers of highway; that's the Caterpillar of this world, John Deere and on. But MICO is mostly focused on the U.S. right now. And we will, obviously as I said, bring all these product lines to other markets, Europe, but we are also contemplating opportunities in lower-cost countries, emerging markets, like potentially India and China.", "Now, let's be realistic. We're dealing with still fairly long cycle kind of industries. So, those sales synergies will take some time to take root and will not generate a superb sales growth upfront in 2016, even though we are obviously anxious to start driving growth through this combination of our two companies.", "What I think will be more prevailing in 2016 is already initiative taken at the operational level to find synergies in the world of manufacturing, world of OpEx, world of execution. And all together what we are saying is, looking forward we should be able to generate a CAGR in growth of 8% for this kind of combination around the MICO franchise and accompany this 8% CAGR with a 40% incremental margin, which is obviously a very strong generation of value for our shareholders.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Seth.", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Seth.", "Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "I was wondering if you could \u2013 in the very strong outperformance that we saw in China and in India for the quarter, I'm wondering is that \u2013 are that those types of outperformance numbers \u2013 do you expect those type of numbers to continue in 2016? We know you have the new Dongfeng relationship and the mandates rolling in as well. So can we expect that type of outperformance to continue going forward?", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Seth, what we said overall for the global business, outperformance in 2016 will be higher than what we have seen in 2015. And that's driven by all those key programs that we have listed several times, some of them actually being rooted in Europe.", "Actually, India will continue to be the highlight for sure. China, probably may slow down in outperformance because when you see such a slowdown in activities, it always has an impact on the overall ability to outperform. We still see it obviously nicely positive, but maybe not as high as what it was this year.", "But, again, this AMT penetrations in the U.S., further market share in Europe. I'd say, Daimler \u2013 this air disc brakes that we have started to manufacture at Daimler in January for 50% of the actuals being built in Europe. Hendrickson air disc brakes contract and many other things that we have listed before all drive to a pretty healthy forecast for outperformance in 2016.", "Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And then if I could ask a follow-up question on the cost side. The two plant closures that you've talked about for Europe, I think one of them was expected to be effective at 2016. Is that in your assumptions at this point or not yet?", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, you're right. And actually I can announce today that we have basically concluded the path to close those factories, as we had anticipated and shared with you as we were in the negotiation phase three months ago. So, again, we have gotten the green light to pursue our plan, both in the Netherlands and in France. The Netherlands factory will be closed this year and the French factory will take another year beyond that to be shut down. And all this productivity and cost savings has been obviously integrated into our plans.", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Chief Financial Officer", "So, Seth, there's a partial year for the Netherlands built into the guidance that we've given.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hey, guys. How's it going?", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Joel.", "Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good morning.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good.", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Joel.", "Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "I wonder if you can just give us a little update on Eastern Europe and Russia. I know that kind of part of the world has been a little bit dead for the last two years or three years, but maybe with oil getting to new lower levels and maybe Putin taken aback a little bit, maybe there's a chance for that to revive? Or just a little update on what's going on there.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's very hard to become a geopolitical specialist on this matter, which I think is surprising the world day after day. But I would say that from our industry standpoint, we lost another 26% in the volume of trucks and buses built in that part of Europe, which brings it down to kind of 66,000 for the full year, and remember the time not long ago when it was 150,000.", "What we are forecasting, if we can ever forecast what's going to happen in the coming months, is that this will continue potentially to erode the very beginning of the year, but starts the later part of the year maybe to stabilize and all together we believe that Russia should be flattish for this year.", "The good thing, though, is that we have, as you know, taking a very strong position in Russia with particularly both with KAMAZ, that is the largest heavy-duty truck provider, and GAZ, which is the largest truck provider all together, including medium-size trucks. And for us to get some good outperformance out of this more important, when the market will decide to come back up as we resolve these political issues, we will be really strongly benefiting from that part of our business.", "So we are just preparing the upside, very strongly positioned. But unfortunately right now watching things evolve without being able to predict much of it.", "Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay, thank you. And I just wondered if you can give us a sense on acquisitions, that you still have things in the pipeline or you think that 2016 is going to be more focused on the tax issue and resolving that versus looking for new partners?", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We will be able to do both in parallel. Actually, we have a pipeline that is actually probably richer than it has been in the past. We have some opportunities that we are really looking at as we speak. And we continue to look for opportunities to further enrich our firm size (47:26) and bring kind of spectacular value to the shareholders. We are still very demanding and screening very strongly these opportunities. Obviously, MICO is one that made it because we believe it's a very, very strong opportunity for us. And I would not be surprised if, in the coming months, we would finalize another one, or maybe more.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hello, everybody. Thanks very much for the detailed commentary on the tax rate. That was an uncertainty and you quantified a lot of it. Just so I can understand, under the event that the appeal is not successful, you could potentially re-file, preserve some of the NOLs and then use the NOLs up later. And at that time, would you have to move production or move headquarters or do something drastic in order to preserve a mid-teens and otherwise it'd be 25%?", "Maybe you don't want to go into detail, and I understand that. But I'm just trying to understand, if the appeal doesn't work, you can preserve it for a couple of years, but then does it revert to something higher unless you do something dramatic?", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, Rob, we have a number of different levers we're going around and one of them is the appeal process. There are others that would certainly allow us to maintain the tax rate in the high teens, as we guided on page 15, that are not disruptive to the business in any way.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just a quick one on North America. One of the things we've been wondering is if the long-haul segment has maybe a newer fleet than the overall truck fleet and would fall further. Your guidance doesn't really imply that that's happening. Are you seeing anything in the order book with a bifurcation on the long-haul where you have the higher AMT content or is it still sort of steady or are you just thinking the orders are reflecting an inventory position so you can't rely on them yet? Thanks.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "What we would say is, at this point, we don't see much of an indication in the order book that there could be an upside. That's why the industry is kind of planning and forecasting what I shared with you. And there are all kinds of way to rationalize this after the fact, by the way. One of them being that the trucking industry is becoming more efficient and all this.", "What I would say though is, again, we have to realize that we had a significant drop in demand for trucks. At the same time, we recognize that the GDP has very strongly slowed down, certainly. In my own view, it does not challenge the correlation that we have referred to in the past, because at 0.7% GDP growth in the U.S., you really don't expect any growth in demand for trucks.", "That's why, again, kind of contemplating a potential further 2.4% growth of GDP in 2016, it's hard for me to believe that we would not see some upside, maybe not in the coming months because we're going to have absorb this slowdown of orders that we are now right now witnessing, but I would say maybe a couple of quarters down the road I would not be surprised if we see a change of trend and potential upside on top of what we are just forecasting.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hello.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Joe.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Could you just outline what you anticipate for outperformance in 2016? And then when you think about that mix, you talked about India remaining strong, China maybe not as much outperformance. When you think about the mix effect through that, how do you think that overall impacts margin where you've previously talked about maybe a little bit of headwind in North America, but maybe you get acceleration in some of the outperformance in Europe? So just trying to think about what your outperformance expectation is and how the mix affects margin.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Again, Joe, we don't give a strict number of outperformance. We said that outperformance will fall again maybe nicer actually in 2016 than in 2015, into that range of 8% to 10% that we have shared with you many years ago. And we think we're going to be north of 8%, whereas this year we were slightly south of 8% when you look at the weighted average calculation.", "What I would say in terms of connecting profitability to growth, again, we are committed to respect this model that we have shared with you of incremental margin versus top-line growth. So you look at the mid-range, 8% top-line growth, you would looking at an 18%-ish type of incremental margin rate, will give you good connection between top line and bottom line at that mid-range of growth that, again, we have mentioned to you.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "That's helpful. Thank you. And then just one on strong free cash flow conversion this year. I think the range that you're targeting for 2016 is similar to the range that you targeted to start out 2015. It looks like inventory days are pretty low, but receivable days have moved up a little bit. So just curious whether or not there's some opportunity there and whether that could mean free cash flow conversion moves toward the higher end of the target range?", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Chief Financial Officer", "Joe, remember that our free cash flow conversion this year was a bit higher than normal, partly helped by the non-cash pension expense, the higher non-cash pension expense.", "As we go forward, you are right that receivables ticked up. Part of that was, frankly, due to two large customers missing the year-end payment as they managed their cash flow. So I wouldn't call that as much a trend as more just timing of how they did their payment. However, we would expect some improvement in the working capital as, in 2015, we did carry some safety stock related to some of the negotiations that were going on with a couple of our operations and now we can begin to address that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Baird. Your line is now open.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. This is Joe Vruwink for David.", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Chief Financial Officer", "Hey, Joe.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Joe. How are you?", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Good. I'm wondering if it's possible to break down your organic growth guidance in 2016 maybe by the growth related to regulatory events, you called out Europe and India, versus growth related to other, so new products being introduced or market share? And the reason I ask is it would seem like the growth in 2016 is tied more towards these tangible events and I would think that that growth is maybe a little more sturdy as opposed to recent years where you have seen some quarter-to-quarter variability in the rates of organic growth.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Joe, first, we don't have that breakdown because it's not really a way for us to drive our business. But I would say the two highlights of this kind of more regulation-driven approach is, one, ABS in India that will provide benefit for the next three quarters because we had one quarter last year. And then ABS mandate in Europe, which will do the same, so be it.", "But, again, we have a significant list of organic growth in our performance drivers that go way beyond these mandates. I just mentioned a few earlier. We have regularly in the past had the tailwind from mandates from governments in different countries. I remind you that we have not long ago implemented a mandate in Europe for ECS for stability control. We have implemented a mandate in Brazil for ABS, and that was both for trailers and tractors and trailers.", "So there is a significant amount of tailwind that we continuously get. I remind you that in 2017, there will be a mandate in the United States for the implementation of stability control, that they are discussing as we speak, a potential mandate for ABS systems in the United States as well.", "So I would say, yes, you have two nice tailwinds right now. I don't think it's exceptional. What I think is as we also have this very healthy list of other opportunities that we have created for ourselves by winning some very key markets in the past years.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Good morning, gentlemen. I was just wondering, in the context of the guidance on performance operating margins of 13.8% to 14.3%, could you maybe just handicap what are the variables that get you between the low and the high end? I mean, volume, obviously, could be one. When we think about the other variables, price cost, productivity metrics, SG&A, R&D, could you maybe just frame out how we should think about those a little more discretely and handicap what gets you high to low or in between?", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. Well, certainly volume is one. But I would say, even within volume, mix of where that volume comes from is another important element. Don't forget foreign exchange because as we do have transactional foreign exchange roll through, that can also move depending on where the dollar is headed. As you know, when the guidance was put out, this was based on $1.09 and we've already seen some movement from that since then.", "Probably the only other item that's quite relevant there is the timing of our productivity programs. We have a very aggressive productivity, both on materials side and on the factory side, but that can be a bit lumpy depending on the timing of when certain programs cut in. So you might see a shift in some of that between the quarters, but I would say those are the key elements to think about.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. And when we think about the productivity at both the material and conversion, very impressive results in 2015, could you just frame how we should think about what you're targeting anyway in 2016 on a relative basis?", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Chief Financial Officer", "I would say more of the same. If you actually look back at the Investor Relations discussion that we had last year, I think that was before you started coverage, we give some indication on our long-term targets for material productivity and conversion productivity. Certainly this year's conversion productivity will begin to see the benefits of the site actions or the site closures, not a full year's benefit, but you'll start to see some of that roll in as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is now open.", "Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.", "Thanks and good morning.", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Justin.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.", "So, clearly one of the big question marks with a lot of investors right now is the North American truck build rate and how low that could go. But this is also a geography where your content opportunity is significant. So I wanted to ask, from a high level, do you think you can still grow your North American revenue over the next couple of years in a market that is declining to a more normalized level?", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "If we are talking about minus 10% to minus 15% growth this year, I would doubt that we will be able to compensate this with just outperformance. So, if this actually stays the way it is, we probably will see a decline of revenues from that part of the world. But you're right, if the decrease would be lower, we certainly could have a positive contribution from the top line there because we have very strong opportunities there moving forward.", "As you know, we are actually opening a new factory in Charleston that will host the production of air disc brakes locally and particularly of a new design that we will introduce in the coming years that will be a breakthrough in weight, in costs and performance. And we are very, very confident that we should increase our market presence in that particular product. That will provide some nice tailwind in top-line growth.", "Also, the continuous growth in the AMT adoption. We are right now about 25% of the market having adopted this technology. I think there is still some good opportunities to further that percentage. And then just more of the share of market gain that we are pursuing right now in other product lines.", "So for me, it's a very important market to which we just added this opportunity on off-highway through this acquisition and we continue to invest, focus. And obviously this is with the objective to continue to drive nice outperformance here.", "Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, I wanted to follow-up on the earlier question on acquisitions. It sounds like the pipeline is fairly robust. So I wanted to ask about the size of deals in that pipeline and also get an update on where you would feel comfortable taking leverage for additional deals?", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "In terms of pipeline, yes, I will repeat that we have a pretty interesting pipeline right now that we are regularly reviewing and pursuing opportunities out of. The size, I will answer again the way I always answer it, is that I don't know. We are certainly more looking at incremental deals. Now, we have shared with you two important ones. One is Transics, the other one is MICO. Both of them were south of $100 million of revenues. It doesn't mean that we are not going to be in the future looking at something bigger, but at least those are two inputs that we provided to you.", "I remind you also that in 2009 we have acquired the majority of this company in India that was slightly bigger in revenues. So those are, I would say, three highlights of what we have done in the last five years, but I can't tell you more than that. The only thing is, again, we are not changing our philosophy of management in investment. We are pursuing opportunities to add value above what WABCO is driving. And our objective is not to help our top-line growth through acquisition. We have enough organic growth right now to satisfy our ability to outperform the market.", "Operator", "And this is our last question, from the line of Larry De Maria with William Blair. Your line is now open.", "Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Larry.", "Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning, Jacques. As it relates to the MICO acquisition, I know you talked about acquisitions a lot in this call, but is this in a space kind of a one-off or does this represent a shift in your strategy to diversify away from the cyclicality of trucks and bus? And, therefore, would we expect more of these types of acquisitions in other adjacent end markets away from truck and bus?", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's kind of close to truck and bus. To me, it's very, very connected and adjacent to our usual space. By the way, we already have some activity in the world of off-highway. Unfortunately, we are limited to selling pneumatic systems. And we are addressing a reduced range of opportunities within that space. It's, again, in our opinion, a very attractive space because it has eroded and suffered for the last years. I think that it's at the bottom of the cycle. And we think that, again, it's time to enhance our position in this market.", "There are also a couple of things on the horizon, one that I mentioned, the ABS mandate in 2018 for agricultural tractors in Europe that will provide some nice opportunities. But when you look at MICO, strategically, again, it makes a sense. I explained to you why we acquired it. Financially I think it makes a lot of sense as well.", "When you look at the gross profit margin of MICO, it's pretty nicely above our gross profit margin. Unfortunately, because it's a small company, the weight of their OpEx is making their overall margins below WABCO's operating margin. But the combination of both and the synergies that we can clearly establish because we're dealing with an adjacent market obviously provide us with a superb opportunity to enhance the overall financial equation of this company and generate future great value for our shareholders beyond the growth that we were mentioning before.", "So there will be some rationalization and all that to just take advantage of this very nice gross profit margin and make it more powerfully contributing to the bottom line of the company.", "Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. And then just secondly, obviously you moved into telematics with Transics a couple years ago, but you haven't done more there. Is valuation the issue? Can you still pursue stuff there, or is it just out of reach? And is Transics a big enough platform for you to expand without making further acquisitions at this point?", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Larry, in Europe, yes, we are strong enough because we are basically number one or number two. We are at the very top of the market \u2013 the positioning in market share. We are looking at other opportunities for expansion within Europe for sure, as I mentioned, but also outside of Europe and eventually potentially through acquisitions. But when you look at the market overall, particularly in the U.S, it's a very fragmented world, attractive from the revenue and growth standpoint, but also extremely expensive in acquisitions.", "So I think it's something that deserves more reflection, maybe letting those very high-tech and attractive franchise cool down in pricing. But we have made a move already by investing these $20 million into this SmartDrive company that provides us a very, very nice anchorage into the market and some nice functionalities to be added to our FMS system.", "And then, again, as I said, I think we should neglect the positioning in the emerging market at this time. It's certainly not as attractive in terms of growth, but it's attractive because it will grow in the coming years. And we want to be there. And I think Transics provides us with a very, very, very attractive platform in terms of capabilities that would be very interesting to bring to other markets.", "Operator", "I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like turn the call back to Mr. Esculier for any closing remarks.", "Jacques Esculier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you for attending this call. That was little bit longer than usual, but we wanted to really take the time to bring you through the current understanding and information that we have available related to this European Commission issue and obviously introduce you to our new piece of business that we are, as we speak, starting to integrate into the world of WABCO.", "On this, I'd like to thank you, wish you a wonderful and successful next quarter.

Thank you.", "At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Christian Fife, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin your conference.", "Christian Fife", "Thank you, Candice. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to WABCO's quarterly conference call. Today we'll present our First Quarter 2016 results. And with us we have Jacques Esculier, our Chairman and CEO; and Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, our CFO.

Also, as shown on chart 2 of the presentation, certain forward-looking statements we will make today are based on management's good faith expectations and beliefs concerning future development. As you know, actual results may differ materially from these expectations as a result of many factors. Examples of these factors can be found in our company's Form 10-Q, which was filed with the SEC this morning, and in our Quarterly Reports.", "Lastly, some of our remarks contain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP measurements to the most comparable GAAP measures are attached as an Appendix to this presentation and to our press release from this morning, both of which are posted on the Web site.", "I will now turn the call over to Jacques Esculier.", "Jacques Esculier", "Thank you, Christian. Good morning, good afternoon to all of you and welcome to our first quarter conference call. The highlight of the quarter, I would say, is a very strong growth of our top-line at 9.7%, of which 1.2% was the result of this acquisition that we announced to you during our last call of this company called MICO, which is a specialist of hydraulic braking systems for off-highway vehicles mostly rooted in North America.", "I want to take this opportunity to also remind you that a few days ago, we announced that we have actually acquired another nicely fitting company in the area of aerodynamics that very much complements what we already had built at WABCO, and we'll present more details for you later in the call. So this acquisition of MICO represents 1.2% of the 9.7%, which leaves a healthy 8.5% organic growth in a market that this quarter again has seen a further erosion of 2%. And I'm talking about the number of trucks and buses built worldwide.", "The other thing is the market actually is slightly calmer than what we had seen in the previous quarters, even though we had, as you will see later, to downgrade our forecast for the American market because the economic forecast has been further downgraded as well actually in the last six months, whereas we are planning something close to 3% GDP growth in the U.S., we are now closer to 2%. Almost offsetting this, we have upgraded our provision forecast of the engine market that is already benefiting actually from much a stronger GDP growth forecast at 7.5%.", "But overall for the year, we still anticipate a global volume erosion of 3% to 3.5%, slightly worse than what we had shared with you three months ago. So now looking at the results of the first quarter, we ended up at a top-line revenues of $688.7 million at 9.7% in local currency, leading to a gross profit of $217.7 million versus $215.8 million a year ago. Performance operating income of $96.5 million, sorry, or 14% versus $93.5 million or 14.3% margin a year ago. And as Prashanth will share with you, foreign exchange adverse FX has impacted the margin by almost 0.5% year-over-year.", "Performance EPS of $1.37 versus $1.41, which has been affected by the tax rate that we have effectively brought to 20% -- quite higher than what we had experienced a year ago. It is important to highlight that actually our reported EPS is a negative $0.24 covering a provision -- it's a tax rated provision, non-cash that we had to recognize this quarter. And again, Prashanth, will go through the details of that, but as related to what we shared with you a quarter ago related to this dispute with -- between Belgium and the European Commission on their tax laws and programs. Free cash flow of $68.3 million or 88% of conversion rate, of which we returned the vast majority through the repurchase of 682,000 shares and we maintained guidance for the full year.", "Moving to the next page and looking at the profile of our top-line growth of 97% at equal exchange rate. By channel, the OE business has grown 14% year-over-year again in the context of a market that has seen a volume drop of 2% year-over-year, and that's thanks to increased content per vehicle as well as gaining market share. Plus, out of the 14%, 1.6% is related to the MICO acquisition.", "Aftermarket continued to grow a healthy 7% in spite of headwinds in China and Brazil. Sales through JVs, which represents mostly our sales to the Meritor WABCO JV in the U.S., is down 15% while the market is down 12%, however, with a stronger decline in heavy-duty truck.", "Looking then at the evolution of our top-line revenues versus markets by region in the truck and bus business, starting with Europe, where we outperformed the market by a healthy 9% in an environment where the number of trucks and buses grew 5%. Our performance is obviously supported by the mandate of these autonomous emergency braking system that was in place since November of last year as well as some healthy gains in the world of ADB and AMT at Daimler.", "North America, the market is down 12%. We are down 14%, because we unfortunately are penalized by the mix -- actually the heavy-duty trucks that obviously have more content per vehicle for our products and systems is down 22% during the quarter, but still partially kind of offset by a higher penetration of our AMT technologies.", "South America went down another 34% year-over-year and we limited our decrease in revenues to 26% through further gain of content per vehicle through AMT penetration and share of markets in conventional products. Japan, Thailand, Korea was up a meager 3%. We did not outperform for mix issues that we will review later. China was down 5%; we were down 4%. However, when we look at last year first quarter, we outperformed a significant 20-plus-percent, so -- and there was an exceptional delivery of products at that time in first quarter. So, nothing surprising there. We continue to grow market share in content per vehicle.", "And in India, we outperformed the market by an incredibly healthy 54% on top of the market itself growing at a fast 24%. And that's driven in great extent by the introduction of the mandates that is in place since October of last year. So, overall a very strong quarter in terms of gross and outperformance for WABCO. So, Prashanth will now drive through the details of our financials as well as an update on our tax situation.", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah", "Thank you, Jacques.", "Good morning, everyone. We started off 2016 with a very solid quarter, good top-line growth, and a healthy profit conversion. If we can move to Slide 5, I'll walk you through the details.", "As a reminder, performance numbers are adjusted to exclude items that may cloud the underlying operating results, but the separation and streamlining items, acquisition-related costs, and most notably for this quarter, one-time tax items. In the first quarter of 2016, we had solid revenue growth of almost 10% in local currencies. This growth includes two months of revenue from our recent acquisition of MICO, which account for 1.2%.", "On a performance basis, our gross profit margin is at 31.6%. The operating income for the first quarter is at 14% of sales, up $3 million year-over-year. However, this includes $7 million of foreign exchange headwinds split equally between transactional and translational. Therefore, at constant FX, the operating income is up $10 million or 11%, and represents a solid 15.2% of incremental margin. But not quite at our operating model, and I'll address this momentarily.", "Pricing in the first quarter is at 1.8%, primarily driven higher by the impact of the ABS mandate in India. Before the introduction of the mandate, we sold ABS on a much more selective basis. After the mandate, volumes have grown by a factor of 10 with the obvious impact on pricing. We expect this pricing headwind to continue for a couple of quarters, and therefore, we might end up at the higher end of the pricing guidance we gave you in February.", "In addition, we've been gaining market share in air disc brakes, with volumes currently ramping up at a couple of customers. We've discussed on prior calls our wins at both Hendrickson and Daimler. And, as you know, our more mechanical products typically come with lower margins in OE, but are a good source of future aftermarket growth. So if we come back to the incremental margin framework, we have both the sales mix of higher OE growth versus aftermarket, and the strong share gains in ADB -- both good for the top-line, but they are putting pressure on our incremental margin framework in Q1. And we would expect to see this continue for a few more quarters.", "But once again, our productivity provides a strong offset, with 5.6% gross material productivity and 6.4% conversion productivity, delivering close to $20 million of savings. This includes as well the benefits of localizing some of the critical ABS components for India as well as some of the benefits from the designed cost momentum on the air disc brakes.", "Our OpEx reduction program is also on track to deliver about $15 million of cost reduction in 2016. Q1 saw a higher benefit due to timing and carryover savings, and this allowed us to offset additional investments as well as inflation for the quarter. The consolidation of MICO adds $2 million to our OpEx, resulting in a net OpEx increase of only $3 million.", "I'm pleased to report that our performance tax rate of 20.2% for the quarter is in line with our full year guidance. Our U.S. tax rate is 18%, if you exclude the one-time provision resulting from the European Commission decision on the excess profit ruling. We'll cover tax in more detail in a moment. So after you exclude the non-performance items, you can see that our earnings-per-share is $1.37 for the quarter. And on a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $0.24, mainly resulting from the recording of the non-cash tax provision of $86 million.", "If we can move to Slide 6, I'll provide you an update on our tax rate. As you may recall, in February, we advised that, due to the EC decision in January, our rate for 2016 would be in the range of 16% to 25%, and gave our best view that the full-year performance tax rate would be close to 20%. Our current rate is now in line with guidance. If we can look at the bullets on the slide, we booked a tax liability of $86 million related to the benefits that we had received over the past four years from Belgium's excess profit ruling. This will be essentially offset with our carryforward losses and is thus a non-cash expense. We understand that Belgium has appealed the European Commission State Aid decision, and we are waiting formal publication of the EC decision in order to make full evaluation regarding whether we will also appeal this decision.", "Since our last call, we have been actively exploring alternative tax programs. And in the quarter, we also concluded that we are eligible for an additional tax relief program, referred to as a Patent Income Deduction, or PID, in Belgium. This relief was available to us in prior years, but we did not claim it because of our participation in the excess profit ruling program. So with the combination of geographic mix of our profits, the benefit of the PID in 2016, and other tax planning initiatives, we have a 20% performance tax rate, and this would set the foundation for a high-teens tax rate for the next two years.", "However, we have to mention that there is clearly an increased focus on interest in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, to collect increased tax revenues from large multinational companies. And while we fully comply with all tax regulations, we do continue to monitor both government and debt-related programs.", "Now, if we can move to Slide 7, I'll cover the very strong cash flow generation for the quarter. And you'll see that we converted 88% of our performance net income into performance free cash flow. If you exclude the $5 million of non-performance payments, our performance free cash flow of $68.3 million was driven both by solid working capital management as well as some favorable timing on cash collections. This was partially offset by CapEx, but as we have previously said, our 2016 CapEx will be around 10% below prior-year, and we are maintaining that view.", "For the full year, we maintain our commitment to convert 80% to 90% of our performance net income into free cash flow. We also paid $63 million net of cash for acquisitions, the majority of which was for MICO. And finally, as Jacques mentioned, we continue to return cash to our shareholders through the buyback programs, and we purchased nearly 682,000 shares at a cost of $63 million.", "Let me now turn it over to Jacques, who will highlight the current market dynamics.", "Jacques Esculier", "Okay. Thanks, Prashanth.", "And turning to Page 8, we are going to drive you, as we do every quarter, through the way we perceive the market dynamics in every area of our world, starting with Europe. The good news is new registrations have started the year on a very high pace. For the first quarter, we are up 17% year-over-year. For the full year, we expect to end up up-6%, which is very healthy on top of the 18% we have seen last year. However, for the first quarter, production was only up 5% in the European region and down 14% sequentially versus Q4 of last year. And this is due mostly to a very strong production decrease -- further decrease in Russia, 10% for the first quarter year-over-year and 40% sequentially, due to the fact that they used to be up through the end of last year in incentives related to the purchase of new trucks that has been lifted and should restart in Q2.", "So altogether, our forecast is still to see the production level flat to 5% up versus a year ago, even though at this point, because of a slight degradation of GDP forecast for the Western part of our continent, we believe that we may go towards the flat more than the 5%.", "North America production, as I said, was down 12% in the quarter, 10% sequentially, with 22% decrease in Class A. Still some inventory at dealers. And we have to downgrade the production forecast for the full year through a range of minus 13% to minus 18%. And the Class A would be in the neighborhood of 25% down year-over-year, which obviously significantly impacts our revenue over there.", "In China, Q1 was further down 5% year-over-year and 14% versus the last quarter of last year. However, I was in China two weeks ago and there are some signs of optimism at the different OEs we visited, driven by some potential improvement in some economic sectors such as construction and mining. So we remain with the same outlook for the year -- flat to minus 5%, even though again, over there, the kind of consensus today would be more flat than minus 5%.", "India -- production was up again a solid 24% year-over-year and up 42% versus Q4 2015. Very strong GDP growth forecast for the year, so we upgraded our forecast to a range of plus 10% to plus 15%.", "Going to the next page, Japan and Korea together up 3% year-over-year for the quarter and 3% sequentially. Japan actually was up 5% in the quarter. However, Korea saw a level of production 10% below what it was a year ago because of the share of foreign truck manufacturers is growing -- has grown actually very rapidly lately, up to almost 1/3rd of the market, pushing back on the local brands. So, altogether, whereas we thought the production would be flattish, Korea is waiting and justifying that we revise our forecast down to flat to minus-5%.", "Brazil -- still down 34% year-over-year, but up almost 20% versus a quarter ago. Continued obviously weak economic environment as well as very still confusing and concerning political environment, so we don't see much of an improvement in the coming months. And we maintain our view of that part of the world for a flat to minus 10% production level year-over-year with a weaker first half. Obviously, there may be some path to an improvement in the political and stabilization of political environment, as we all know.", "Aftermarket was up 7% in the first quarter; continued to have a strong contribution from independent aftermarket channel. However, the revenue from that sector was penalized by a weaker environment in China and Brazil. Transics will continue to deliver double-digit growth in 2016, leading to a continuous expectation of 7% growth year-over-year for the full year.", "Trailers started the year with a production up 1% in the first quarter and 4% versus the last quarter of last year; growth in Europe and India offset by China and South America for the full year as it kind of will mirror the activities of the truck and bus sector. The expectation is flat to minus 5% with a negative impact coming from both declining regions in North America and China.", "Turning to the next page and highlighting a few achievements along the three pillars of our strategy, starting with the announcement we made a week ago of a nearly $1 million of new wins in the past four quarters. And those again are separate from replacement and renewal of existing contracts of this $1 billion, $612 million would generate revenue growth in the next five years.", "Daimler started production of their heavy duty trucks, equipped with our air disc brakes, represented about half of the market. And then, we signed a long-term agreement with Cummins, and we extended our joint venture in the U.S. to include business from emerging countries.", "We also delivered over 100,000 OnGuard collision mitigation systems in North America. So a very strong success. And it was reported by University actually that 87% of the rear-end accidents are now avoided as an average, obviously, by fleets that are equipped with these collision mitigation systems.", "We introduced our new system in our fleet management solution world called TX TrailerGuard, that allows the flow of real-time data related to truck-trailer and driver to the fleet management. And then, we have rolled out our new version of our lane departure warning system, called OnLane that is connected to the video-based driver performance management system SmartDrive, it's a company in which we have taken an equity investment.", "From the execution standpoint, we closed 2015 with another annual record of 31 supplier awards from customers. And as Prashanth reported to you, we are still driving very healthy productivity across our supply chain.", "Turning to the next page, we will give you a few information on this new acquisition. It's a company called Laydon Composites Ltd., LCL. They are involved in the design and manufacturing of aerodynamic devices for heavy duty trucks and trailers. And they are privately owned. Their 2015 revenues was CAD25 million, which is about $25 million; 50 employees.", "Sales evolution shows a CAGR of 36% in the last five years, and you have here an extract of the kind of products that they deal with. Its side skirts for trailers. It's kind of a fairing for the nose of the trailer and deflectors on top of the cabs.", "The following page gives a little rationale of why we are convinced this will bring great value to WABCO and obviously ultimately to its shareholders. We have to look at the regulation framework ahead of us with, by 2018, mandate by NHTSA to demand over 3% of fuel savings on the trailers manufactured, an incentive from EPA that will reward fleets that are capable of providing over 9% of fuel savings through aerodynamic products on the combination truck-trailers.", "And then we know that there are -- there is a reflection ongoing to further limit the CO2 emission in Europe. And obviously enhancing fuel saving through aerodynamics artifact on the combination truck-trailer is a good way to decrease CO2 emissions.", "Here is the two kind of value drivers of LCL and WABCO that combine, will generate, in our opinion, sales CAGR for the LCL acquisition over 20% CAGR in the next five years at 30% incremental margin. LCL is dealing with equipment that is very well-suited for the U.S. market related to trailer skirts, side skirts, again fairings on the front as well as equipment on the tractor to improve the aerodynamics. Very, very strongly and recognized and rooted in the North American market, WABCO has developed in the last years, very attractive solutions for the EU market. Very well-established in our region.", "And also having developed a design for the tail-end of the trailer that will be put in production in Europe and in the U.S. at LCL. So, very good synergies in the portfolio of technologies, as well as obviously expansion of our territory through the strong rootage of LCL in North America.", "Next page is similar to what we shared with you three months ago. We do not modify the guidance, so sales growth still plan to end up into that plus 6% to plus 11% range with reported sales between $2.7 billion and $2.83 billion. Performance operating margin in the 13.8% to 14.3% range leading to performance EPS between $5.03 and $5.08 per share with a conversion rate between 80% to 90%. The bridge is similar, still highlighting the significant impact of the tax rate being brought to 20%.", "The last slides kind of summarizes what we just said. Very strong top-line growth during the first quarter, which is paving the path to a strong outperformance here as we had announced earlier last year. Our incremental margin is still healthy and accretive; however, slightly impacted by the pricing erosion that we have seen as a result of these mandates, particularly of ABS in India. Conversion of cash of 88%; still extremely healthy. Continuing to return value through share buyback to our shareholders.", "I'd like to take maybe the opportunity here to kind of look at the market dynamics, because we again reported erosion of the global market, and we have done this for quite a few quarters. And looking at where we are in the volume of truck and bus built across the world, we have to go back to almost 10 years back in 2007 to see that same level. And when you look at the last five years, the evolution of the number of trucks and bus built has seen an erosion of close to 4% CAGR in the last five years; 3.8% to be accurate. In the meantime, by the way, WABCO has seen a growth -- a top-line growth CAGR above 5%. So that's further evidence of the strong ability to outperform the market.", "But after this kind of continuous erosion of the number of trucks and bus built, if one believes that the economy will rebound -- the global economy will rebound, I think we can anticipate that, in the coming quarters, we should see a change in trend to the industry. And just to make sure that we are convinced that WABCO will know how to fully take advantage of it.", "After the last page, there is a another page actually that kind of highlights the issuance of our Annual Report. There are two formats, as we did last year -- one for, I would say, the more traditional, maybe older people who are used to touching and reading out of paper; and the other one for the more contemporary 21st century, more attracted by digital, we have a full version of it on our Web site, as you can today visit it and experience it.", "So that closes our presentation and opens the session for Q&A. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Jerry Revich", "Hi, good morning, good afternoon, everyone.", "Jacques Esculier", "Good morning, Jerry.", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah", "Good morning, Jerry.", "Jerry Revich", "I'm wondering if you could talk about the pace of AMT penetration in North America? Where do you estimate industry penetration rate stands today? And then, can you just clarify what outgrowth you saw from AMT penetration in North America in the quarter? I realized that was masked by mix between heavy and medium-duty, but so perhaps you could clarify how much it added to your results in the quarter?", "Jacques Esculier", "I'm sorry, Jerry. The first part of the question is AMT penetration and today, we believe it's getting closer to 30% for the year 2016. I think it's up probably around 4% or 5% versus a year ago. And as a reminder, when you look back to five years ago, it was below 10%. So there is still some runway left, but obviously, feeling a lot of nice outperformance. I'm sorry -- can you repeat the second part of your question?", "Jerry Revich", "Sure. And how much did the increasing penetration in AMT add to your North America results on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter?", "Jacques Esculier", "I don't have the revenues and we don't usually share that, but I think you can probably figure out the math, if we had 4% or 5% of penetration, and you can take a good assumption on a few-hundred-dollars for the system and that will give you the result.", "Jerry Revich", "Okay. And so the difference between WABCO performance and industry estimated production is purely due to mix in North America? Has there been any change in any of the other products? Any impact from the Daimler Assurance product rollout that might be a slight headwind or anything like that, Jacques, in the quarter?", "Jacques Esculier", "Yes, we have -- we will see, obviously, the impact of what you're referring to, which actually is replacing our collision mitigation system that was covering the full range of products at Daimler to -- that were limited to the non-Daimler engines-equipped trucks, meaning the Cummins-equipped trucks. So that will be some headwinds. But again, there is a lot of good news related to air disc brakes at Hendrickson, to actually this AMT. I would say that really the only performance that we see this kind of couple-of-percent is really mostly driven, or at least impacted by, the heavy drop in Class A's production.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Long of Stephens. Your line is now open.", "Jacques Esculier", "Good morning, Justin", "Justin Long", "God morning. So first question I had was on the 2016 guidance. I was wondering if there's any color you can provide on the quarterly cadence of EPS you're expecting this year? And maybe walk through some of the key drivers to your quarter-to-quarter outlook.", "Jacques Esculier", "Well, we don't usually kind of guide by quarters, and I would anticipate that we, like last year, probably have a little more favorable kind of EPS towards the end of the year, if I would venture into kind of sharing something. But again, I don't want to give you much more information, because, to be fair, we certainly are not ready to guide for the second quarter or any as related other quarters.", "Justin Long", "Okay. Fair enough. And maybe to follow-up on the AMT question, could you discuss the progress you've made developing AMT for the medium-duty market? I believe this is something you're working on with the European OEM. I was just curious if you could provide an update on the potential size and timing of that opportunity?", "Jacques Esculier", "We have developed a version for Daimler. And we actually, in Europe, have covered all the medium-sized trucks that are equipped with AMT. What is still to be decided -- and obviously this is not our decision to make -- is whether those European manufacturers that are using -- or at least Daimler -- are using our medium-sized truck AMT. Whether they will carry eventually to the U.S., and that's a question you have to ask them. I don't feel empowered to make any comment on this. I'm looking forward to it, but that's, again, their decision to make. And that would represent a significant upside for us.", "Justin Long", "Okay, great. Thanks so much for the time.", "Jacques Esculier", "Okay. Thank you, Justin.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Jacques Esculier", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Hammond", "Hey, good morning, Jacques. So, Jacques, I'm just a little surprised by your caution on the European market. I mean, we're seeing upgrades in production forecasts, it looks like, from Daimler and Volvo today. And it just seems like that economy is kind of grinding, getting better. So just wanted to understand where you're coming from with kind of the guiding people or pushing towards the low end of that zero to five? And then, also just -- ", "Jacques Esculier", "I guess --", "Jeff Hammond", "No, go ahead.", "Jacques Esculier", "No, go ahead, finish. Sorry, Jeff.", "Jeff Hammond", "No, I guess you had really good outgrowth in Europe. It seems to be the ABS and maybe some of the Daimler. So maybe just talk about how you think that outgrowth continues in Europe relative to the market?", "Jacques Esculier", "Okay. So, the first part of the question, Jeff, rightfully, we are aligned with our customers looking at registration. It seems that we should be actually above 5%, because we are planning 6% and we started the year with 17% year-over-year increase in registration. However, there are two factors that are going against a more favorable and optimistic view. One is related to Russia, and that's something that we shared with you. We still see Russia heavily penalized and maybe more penalized than we had originally anticipated this year, even though they are at 60% down versus where they used to be.", "The second one is related to exports. We still see that the number of trucks and buses that our European customers export to countries outside of Europe should take another probably 5% decrease year-over-year. And I remind you that this represent about one-fourth to one-third of the production of their trucks in this part of the world. So those two combined, in our opinion, more than offset the very strong news. And that's why we would say -- first, we maintain the bracket where it is today at zero to plus five, but we are saying maybe more towards the left at this time than above average.", "Jeff Hammond", "Okay. And the outgrowth?", "Jacques Esculier", "And the outgrowth, the logic is that we are going to keep outgrowing Europe this year at least up until the fourth quarter at a fairly high pace because of this ABS mandate and the air disc brakes. The ABS we started during the last quarter. So we're going to outperform through that for three quarters. The rest -- AMT and ADB, it's going to go for the full year. So, overall, it should be a very, very healthy outperformance for 2016 in Europe.", "Jeff Hammond", "Okay. And then, I just wanted to go back to the guidance. So your guidance slide, I think the date is unchanged at February 11th, and all the numbers are unchanged. But it seems like we made some changes to market assumptions. FX has moved a little bit. You add LCL. So can you maybe just speak one quarter in and given some of those moving pieces, kind of where you're kind of shading within that original guidance?", "Jacques Esculier", "Yes. Obviously, I mentioned a few kind of adjustments to our view of the market, which results net-net in kind of a further erosion of the market, in our view. We kind of say this plus obviously the $20 million of additional revenues of which we obviously will only benefit what -- eight months; two quarters. That will be kind of offset by a tailwind from foreign exchange altogether. So that's why we are saying, all in all, we don't change, even though there is a little -- more headwind than we had planned on revenues. There is this basically $10 million of additional revenues, and then, there is this FX. So, all in all, we are saying, at this point, we would not change the guidance.", "Jeff Hammond", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Wertheimer of Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Robert Wertheimer", "Hi. Just one question on China real quick. I mean, there's been some positive signs there. You mentioned maybe a chance to be a little bit better. Do you think there's a chance of any real breakout revenue strength there in production growth? Are you just not hearing that from your customers? And you made a comment on it -- I'm just curious if you think there's at least a chance of higher growth, let's say?", "Jacques Esculier", "China is always kind of a -- prone to surprise us one way or the other. However, I would tell you that none of the CEOs that I have met were that optimistic. They were certainly more optimistic than they have been before, but more talking about probably flat to slight growth, potentially -- I have not heard anybody saying that there could be a potential breakthrough in the number of trucks built over there for 2016.", "Robert Wertheimer", "Yes, okay. And that's very helpful, Jacques. And this is maybe a little bit of a bigger picture question, but you've had such R&D and product strength in your core product suite over the years and longer. Do you feel like you're on a path to get the same kind of leadership and scale in some of the new segments -- automated driving, however, you want to define it? And do you feel like -- is there any encroachment from auto OEMs? Or -- it's sort of a newer technology. And I wonder how you feel about your technology glide path, let's say and your R&D spend, whether it's sufficient to sort of keep the kind of leadership that you have had in other segments?", "Jacques Esculier", "Boy, that's a very complicated question to answer in a few minutes, to be fair. But obviously, our objective is to stay at the leading edge of this path towards, ultimately, this vision that we all agree on, which is called autonomous driving, which I think will take quite a while. But in the -- between where we are and this autonomous driving, there are clear milestones of value driving improvements in technology and connectivity between all different systems and sensors. And we want to be leading that. Maybe not at the key global OEMs that may select to do it on their own, even though they will still utilize our systems, but they will connect them. But the vast majority of the other truck and bus manufacturers will need us to help them, because they don't have the engineering power, and they don't have the volume to amortize the significant cost it will drive. So, I think we have a very significant position to defend and actually grow in.", "The other aspect of your question, my opinion has to also address this new dimension that we are growing towards reaching more into the fleet world through the digitization of things. This kind of big data and whatnot. We are positioning ourselves in this new space. We certainly want to take as big a share as we can. But, the industry in that area is not yet well-firmed and identified. It's the rush of the pioneers and we want to take our share. And it's not in Europe only, it's not in the U.S. only; actually it may be even more attractive in some emerging markets at that time.", "And we acquired Transics to enable us to move into that space, and obviously, we are strategically reviewing all the different strategic alternatives that are not excessively costly. Because acquiring some of these companies, particularly in the U.S. right now, may be overly costly for us. But that will ultimately position ourselves firmly in this world, and drive significant growth and value for our shareholders.", "Robert Wertheimer", "Thank you very much.", "Jacques Esculier", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry De Maria of William Blair. Your line is now open.", "Jacques Esculier", "Good morning, Larry.", "Larry De Maria", "Hey, good morning, guys. Can you talk about the recent outperformance release? This was down obviously a fair amount year-over-year. Can you discuss some of the new wins in there and why, other than maybe a tough comp in Hendrickson, et cetera, it was down? Just a little more color on the release?", "Jacques Esculier", "Yes. Down -- first, there is a problem with exchange -- well, not a problem. There is a fact of life that exchange rate was less favorable, so that explains a piece of it. Also, we had a couple of heavy wins last year and we haven't had those kind of significant wins this year because, I mean, it happens sometimes, but not all the time.", "But I can guarantee you that, in our own view, this $1 billion, that kind of translate into $600 million for the next five years is sufficient to keep fueling our healthy outperformance of the market -- beyond the market.", "Now, we still have some obviously very clear and solid wins as part of this $1 billion, starting with a further opportunity in China as the mandate expands beyond where it is today to reach some new categories of trucks at different customers. Then, we have -- actually surprisingly from our car segment, we have won some very healthy businesses with ECAS, which is the Electronic Control Air Suspension on Audi's, BMW's, Tesla, and also one of the major U.S. car manufacturer that we're not yet allowed to mention or specify.", "We have won a good contract for AMT in Turkey. There will be a mandate in the second half of next year for stability control in the U.S., and that will bring us obviously great opportunity. We won some further air disc brakes business at Ford in China for GMC, because they are partners together.", "We won a good contract at Cummins for their new engines that we will equip with air compressor; some vacuum pumps at Volvo -- we won a major contract for vacuum pumps on the Volvo cars and Tata cars. And I'll stop here because this is already quite a few remarkable wins and highlights of that $1 billion. But, obviously, the list is quite longer than that.", "Larry De Maria", "That's great. I appreciate that. Thanks, Jacques. And then specifically with India, obviously, the outperformance was very big this quarter. What kind of cadence should we expect the rest of the year, deceleration into the second-half? Or could we keep up this kind of level?", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah", "Well, the -- remember that we talked about the mandate kicked-in in Q4 of last year? So, on an outperformance basis, you'll continue to see that, driven purely by the ABS mandate, for the next several quarters. And then Jacques already spoke to -- we are increasing our overall outlook for the market.", "Larry De Maria", "Got it. Okay.", "Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah", "We would expect to be healthy for essentially the next several quarters.", "Larry De Maria", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Jacques Esculier", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Gilardi of Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Ross Gilardi", "Yes. Thank you very much. I actually had a follow-up on that; that India question. The Indian market is going straight from, I guess, Euro 4 to Euro 6 now over the next four years and from an emissions standpoint. And while most of your products aren't necessarily emissions focused, I'm wondering if that transition drags -- pulls forward a lot of new product opportunities for WABCO? And do you ultimately view that as a good thing for your business?", "Jacques Esculier", "It will actually, because there will be a pre-buy; no question. And probably a pretty sizable pre-buy, because the jump in technology is definitely driving a jump in cost and i.e., price for the trucks. The introduction of the mandate is, however, at the beginning of the second quarter next year. And, at this point, we think the bulk of the pre-buy will be limited to the first quarter. However, in my opinion, it may actually even further affect the fourth quarter of this year, which would add some good news in terms of revenues.", "Now, these things are always welcome on the upside and always painful on the downside, so I never welcome them, to be fair. But that's the fact of life. We're going to have to go through it. It doesn't create additional demand. It's just kind of displaced kind of volume from one quarter to another, disturbs the supply chain. But again, we will go through it and probably benefit from it. It's not yet in our forecast, though.", "Ross Gilardi", "I was asking, Jacques, more from like a content per vehicle standpoint as opposed to just pulling forward market growth. Is there anything that would go along with emission standard changes that --?", "Jacques Esculier", "No.", "Ross Gilardi", "Okay.", "Jacques Esculier", "No. Content per vehicle -- except, though, but that's already true with Euro 4 that these kind of more demanding environments request that you equip your engines with electronically controlled units. And that is necessary for us to be able to equip those trucks and buses with AMTs. So the range of products that we will be able to reach with our AMT technology is actually growing as we speak, because we are kind of moving into Euro 4, and obviously, it will be further extended on the Euro 6. But that's the only real connection that we see to those Euro 4/Euro 6 mandates.", "Ross Gilardi", "Got it. And then, I just had a follow-up on Brazil -- obviously, it's a smaller part of your overall business, but you stuck with the market outlook for truck and bus to be flat to down 10%, after still a pretty tough first quarter. So are you actually seeing any green shoots in Brazil at all? The overall environment seems pretty brutal, but you also noted that you saw a 20% sequential pickup in Brazil. And any color there?", "Jacques Esculier", "Well, our current forecast is calling for a slight improvement in the second quarter. We also believe that, potentially, our OE customers may leverage the wide-open capacity there linked to a very attractive real value to leverage that base to build trucks going to other countries -- to exports. So, we are kind of seeing right now that market to maybe go up slightly in the second half versus the first half, but very funky. At the end of the day, [indiscernible] stays like 65% below the peak that had been reached in 2011, if I remember.", "Ross Gilardi", "So you're saying some of your customers are going to try to take advantage of the weak real and build capacity for export?", "Jacques Esculier", "That's what we anticipate at this point. Because obviously, those guys suffer tremendously of the open capacity over there. Obviously, a weak real, they could transfer some of the exports that are addressed from Europe to South America. And we say that because we have seen it before. It was not because the real was weak at that time; it was because they were at full capacity in the European factories, and they were basically complementing their capacity using and leveraging South America. Now the reason would be different, but it may also be a good reason to drive that movement.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question --", "Jacques Esculier", "By the way, we don't have much information on that from our customers. It's just, again, a pure anticipation that we are kind of going through.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from David Leiker of Baird. Your line is now open.", "Jacques Esculier", "Good morning, David.", "Joe Vruwink", "Hi, this is Joe Vruwink for David. Hi, Jacques.", "Jacques Esculier", "Hey, Joe Vruwink, how are you?", "Joe Vruwink", "Most of the questions have been asked, but just wanted to follow up on the idea of automated or autonomous driving trucks, particularly with the truck platooning challenge that happened by you this quarter. I'm just wondering, can you maybe give details on how WABCO might have indirectly participated? Any systems you supplied to the six manufacturers? And then, just maybe, over the mid-term, does platooning become more of a bigger driver for your business in Europe?", "Jacques Esculier", "Well, platooning is one of those milestones that I described on our path to autonomous driving. There are a lot of activities thinking from different players using different technology paths. And there are some countries that actually are probably not -- will not accept platooning. For example, we got from one of our customers that Germany is not in favor of platooning, but it doesn't mean that platooning will not be adopted by either countries that are potentially more adapted to this kind of concept.", "I would mention the U.S. that has obviously very wide-open areas to do it. And also, I was in Japan not long ago, and Japan is really pushing hard for this concept. Even though they have a very tight and busy road environment, they have to address the impact of aging population and shortage of drivers. So there are quite a bit of activities over there to kind of see how this concept could insert itself into the logic of today's traffic.", "We are connected to the key players in the different areas of the world, because those guys need us anyway, because you can't drive platooning without being fully connected to our products and systems. And anywhere we sense that there is credibility and opportunity to bring this concept on the road, which is obviously raising a significant number of questions related to safety, to the legal environment because some concepts even call for no drivers on the following trucks. Some are still putting a driver behind the wheel, but the driver doesn't drive actively, obviously. So all those kind of questions are still in the air. And we are reflecting, with those companies that we are working with, on validating the value proposition, connecting to fleets, and seeing how they perceive the positive impact it could have on their cost of operations. And then, again, kind of looking through the full value mode analysis to make sure that we are prepared and compelling when we approach the authorities to convince them that this is a concept that would not degrade the safety of our vehicles on the road.", "Joe Vruwink", "Okay. Very good. Thank you.", "Jacques Esculier", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Christian Fife", "Candice, we need to take our last question now.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.", "Neil Frohnapple", "Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in.", "Jacques Esculier", "Good morning, Neil.", "Neil Frohnapple", "I just wanted to go back to the underperformance in North America in the quarter, which you guys obviously cited as mix. But clearly, heavy duty is going to be down more than medium duty for the foreseeable future. So, just wondering if there was anything else -- we've been hearing of an inventory overhang in the dealer channel, particularly of trucks with these OEMs integrated powertrains, which contain WABCO content. So, yes, just curious if you guys can cite anything else or you would expect this underperformance to continue for the next -- for the foreseeable future? Thanks.", "Jacques Esculier", "Well, again, an environment that -- particularly in the U.S., but it's mostly true across the world -- when there is a significant decrease in demand for trucks, particularly double-digit, it always impacts heavy duty vehicles more than the lighter ones. And by the way, this is exactly the reverse on the up-trends. So we always strongly benefit -- and more than benefit. And you will look back at what happened in the first quarters of 2015; we significantly outperformed the market in that region because, at that time, the market was growing fast. So, that's a fact of life. And that is definitely explaining the vast majority, maybe even totally the underperformance. Because, in the meantime, we still continue to drive penetration of AMT that will actually include also air disc brakes as we grow the volume at Hendrickson.", "So there are all kinds of vectors that push more technology and more of our products to the U.S. But for the moment, as the market starts -- is actually decreasing double-digit, we suffer from that mix. I don't anticipate that the market will continue to drive double-digit decrease for many quarters.

Darcey Matthews - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Great. Thank you, Sonja, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to remind you that we are recording this call and that a replay will be available on our website, where you can also find our third quarter 2015 results press release and the Form 10-Q we also filed today. Also on the website is a presentation of our supplemental financial information that you can find in the Investor Relations section.", "Additionally, our comments today will include forward-looking statements and estimates. These forward-looking comments are subject to various risks, contingencies and uncertainties and reflect management's views as of today, November 9, 2015.", "Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website, including our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, which provide a discussion of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.", "I will now turn the call over to David Dickson, McDermott's President and Chief Executive Officer for opening remarks.", "David Dickson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Darcey, and good afternoon. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you can see by our results, McDermott reported another strong quarter of new awards and again demonstrated improved project execution. Key to building our backlog were the new contract awards we received in our Middle East area, including a lump-sum award in Saudi Arabia and awards with two repeat customers in Qatar.", "New work won for the quarter totaled over $2.1 billion and represented one of the company's strongest periods over the past several years. This quarter also represents the first time since the first quarter of 2012 that McDermott has substantially increased its backlog, which is now over $4.4 billion as we head into the fourth quarter. These awards and our ability to build backlog in a challenging macro environment are clear indications that the work the company has done on improving execution and enhanced customer engagement are continuing to generate tangible results.", "As you'll remember, in June McDermott was chosen by Saudi Aramco to by a participant in their new long-term agreement. In September McDermott was awarded the first contract under the new framework agreement, the largest contract in the history of our Middle East business. The lump-sum award is a full-scale EPCI project covering jackets, deck, pipelines and other works in four fields offshore Saudi Arabia and is expected to utilize our specialized shallow-water installation fleet and fabrication yards in Dammam and Jebel Ali. Work has already commenced on the project and is due to be completed in the second quarter of 2018.", "In addition to this lump-sum award, our Middle East area was also awarded two projects related to offshore fields in Qatar. The first award was for a sizable brownfield contract by Qatar Petroleum for the EPCI of four well head jackets in the Bul-Hanine field. The second award, which we announced today, relates to a large brownfield contract for RasGas for the EPCI of a pipeline project consisting of 74 miles of six-inch and eight-inch pipeline and topside modifications. These awards reflect McDermott's ability to meet our customer's critical production and project requirements in conjunction with our unique brownfield capabilities.", "Each of these new projects represents the second award from RasGas and Qatar Petroleum that McDermott has received during 2015. The project execution of the two Qatar contracts is expected to continue through third quarter of 2017. These three awards, in addition to the other new work that the company has been awarded in 2015, add meaningfully to building our backlog for 2016 and 2017.", "Now, I'd like to provide an update on the execution of some of our key projects. At our Altamira fabrication yard in Mexico, the work on a 7,200 ton PB Litoral deck was completed and loaded out on schedule at the end of the quarter. Offshore installation of the jacket and tripod structures was also finished in late September. The deck float-over installation was completed in early October, with the final hook-up, commissioning and start-up, now expected to be finalized during the first quarter of 2016.", "We have worked extremely hard and implemented a variety of changes to ensure this project is executed to McDermott's global quality and safety standards. And the PB Litoral project team has done just that, achieving 2.9 million man hours without a lost time injury and meeting the September load-out date that was set over a year ago. We are pleased to work with and be a strong partner to PEMEX as they and the country move forward with their plans for oil reform in the region. We believe McDermott, with our Altamira yard is well positioned to support the country in its local content requirements and we remain positive on the long-term market outlook in Mexico.", "In Asia, our Ichthys project continues to be on schedule, achieving all of its milestones during the quarter. We saw timely execution on the marine campaign from our third party subcontractor during the period. McDermott's construction support vessel 108 arrived in the field at the end of June and successfully completed its first campaign for the project and is expected to back in the field in December.", "On the fabrication side our yard in Batam has completed 90% of the approximately 27,000 tons of structures commissioned for the project. In addition, all of the in-line structures required for pipelay at Ichthys have also been completed. The engineering scope has been finished, as had 80% of the procurement activities. In addition, the Project HSE performance remains strong, achieving a milestone of over 14 million man hours without a lost time injury.", "As we have mentioned in previous calls, the national oil companies, in particular our customer base in the Middle East, continue to be public about maintaining their production levels and corresponding OPEC market share. A majority of this work is in existing fields and is what we term as brownfield, the enhancement modernization or improvement of existing fields. In today's lower commodity price environment, brownfield work represents one of the lowest cost ways to produce a new barrel of oil or cubic meter of gas. So as we evaluate our pipeline of potential projects that we anticipate moving forward to final investment decision over the next 6 to 12 months, we anticipate a majority of these projects will be in the Middle East and brownfield in nature.", "In the Middle East area, the company also has a long history of project execution and firsts in addition to local content capabilities and the appropriate fleet to support the required regional activity. So relative to where we anticipate the near-term capital spend to occur, we believe McDermott remains uniquely positioned to provide our clients with the right EPCI solution.", "Offsetting the near term opportunities we see in our core Middle East area, the overall macro commodity price environment continues to impact our broader client base. The current market outlook indicates that the commodity price levels through this cycle will remain at lower levels for longer than originally anticipated, resulting in even greater uncertainty about the timing of future projects.", "With capital plans for 2016 being finalized, customers continue to recycle, reprioritize and defer work as they evaluate project economics. Key for our customers to moving forward in this macro scenario is a combination of a new solution to drive down costs combined with increased confidence in project schedule and delivery. McDermott and its joint venture company, io consulting, remain focused on working with clients to find the right solution that can be executed, turned on schedule at a price that works in today's commodity price environment.", "Before I turn the call over to Stuart Spence, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for a review of our financials, I would like to highlight some of the additional health and safety milestones our people and our assets achieved during the quarter. While I have already mentioned a couple in my project updates, it is important to stress that health and safety is an ongoing focus for our company worldwide.", "High quality safety standards are critical for our employees, our customers and for the environments in which we operate. Additionally, I believe that a strong HSE performance is also a direct indication of how an organization is managing the execution and quality of its projects.", "In our Middle East area, our marine operations achieved a number of major safety milestones, with one of the company's key vessels, the DB27, achieving 12 million man-hours lost time injury free. This is an important but often overlooked aspect of our industry.", "McDermott is committed to making health and safety a priority for our people, clients and local business communities, and keeping our shareholders up-to-date on our continued execution success.", "And now I will turn the call over to Stuart.", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'm going to cover our third quarter financial results and the timing of our CapEx spend this year. Then I will discuss our backlog and current bid pipeline. Finally, I will conclude with an update on our cost saving initiatives and guidance.", "Before I get started today, I wanted to mention our new reporting measures. Going forward, in addition to our GAAP reporting, we'll also report certain of our adjusted financials, net of one-time items, to provide a clearer understanding of the underlying performance and drivers of our business.", "To support our new reporting structure, I would like to draw your attention to a press release and supplemental slide deck that detail the reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. Revenues for the third quarter were $805.9 million, up $391 million from Q3 2014 revenues of $414.6 million, and down $241 million from the extremely strong second quarter of 2015.", "The key projects driving revenue were in our Asia and Middle East areas, as well as the progress made on PB Litoral in Mexico. In Asia, at Ichthys, we saw steady productivity from our major subcontractor on the marine campaign. We also saw our vessel, the CSV 108 in field successfully executing its first job.", "For 2015, our subcontractor at Ichthys is the main driver of revenue recognition progress, and is on an identifiable lump-sum fixed price work scope. Also in our Asia area the DB30 and Emerald Sea completed the installation of approximately four miles of corrosion resistant alloy pipe link, 16 miles of carbon steel pipe link and three miles of umbilical installation at our BSP project. Pre-commissioning and tie-in activities also commenced in the field during the quarter. In addition, we had a strong quarter for revenue recognition from three of our larger projects in the Middle East, including a cable-lay project and operational improvements in Saudi Arabia.", "Adjusted operating income totaled $52.5 million during the quarter. Excluding $6.3 million of restructuring expenses and $16.7 million for the settlement of the outstanding legal claims on the AT1 dispute referenced in the last 10-Q. Operating income for the third quarter also was positively impacted by loss recovery in the PB Litoral project with a confirmed contract extension, as well as the successful negotiation and conclusion of certain weather related change orders in the Middle East and marine utilization during the quarter.", "Cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter was $20.7 million compared to a use of cash $7.5 million for the second quarter of 2015 and a use of cash of $19.4 million in the prior year comparable quarter. The improvement in the third quarter cash is mainly attributable to the final settlement and related collections on the Papa Terra project, a project in the AEA segment, which was completed in the second quarter of 2014.", "Net interest expense during the third quarter totaled $13 million. This included $18.6 million of gross interest expense, capitalization of $5.4 million of interest for our remaining vessel under construction, the DLV2000 and $0.2 million of interest income.", "Unabsorbed direct operating expenses totaled $4.6 million versus over absorbed direct operating expenses of $1.9 million during the second quarter. Detailed metrics on our asset utilization are included in the presentation provided in the Investor Relations section of our website. As a reminder, we measure asset utilization in actual days for our vessels and man hours for our fabrication yards, each has a percentage of the standard, which is set at the beginning of the year.", "At our fabrication yards, utilization in the Altamira yard declined over the quarter with the completion and sail-away of the PB Litoral deck. The offshore fleet utilization had its second quarter in a row of over recovery at 118%. As a majority of the offshore vessel fleet was active during the period. Our subsea vessel utilization remained stable quarter-over-quarter with only the North Ocean 105 inactive during the quarter.", "Going forward, utilization for the remainder of the year is expected to decrease as the Marine fleet enters the cyclone weather season in Asia, beginning of the high wind season in the Middle East, as well as the North Ocean 105 waiting to commence the LLOG Otis campaign which starts early next year. At the Altamira fabrication yard, following the sail-away of the PB Litoral structures, new project work is not scheduled to begin for the PEMEX Ayatsil-C jacket until the first quarter of 2016.", "Third quarter net income was $3.7 million or $0.01 per fully diluted share and adjusted net income was $26.7 million, or $0.09 per fully diluted share, excluding restructuring charges and one-time charges related to the legal settlement.", "In the prior year, the third quarter net loss was $30.3 million or $0.13 per fully diluted share loss, and the adjusted net loss was $25.5 million or $0.11 per fully diluted share, excluding restructuring charges. Depending on the stock price at the end of each period and our net income or loss, we have the potential to include an additional 33 million to 41 million shares to our diluted share count numbers related to our tangible equity unit, or TEUs. With the positive net income in the third quarter, the dilution for the TEUs was included in our fully diluted share count, adding an additional 41 million shares.", "Moving to the balance sheet, at the end of September, we reported $767 million in cash and restricted cash, a slight decline of approximately $4 million from the total cash balance in the second quarter. Letters of credit issued under our LC facility totaled $320 million and cash collateralized letters of credit totaled $115 million at quarter end.", "In October, we increased commitments under our letter of credit facility by an additional $120 million, increasing the capacity to $520 million. This was our first venture back into the capital markets since April of 2014 and we were very pleased to have the support of our key banks, as well as one new entrant into the facility. The additional capacity will support McDermott's future bidding as we continue to focus on building backlog.", "Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $18 million, which includes $5.4 million of capitalized interest. The key driver of our CapEx spend for 2015 is the timing of the delivery of our flagship vessel, the DLV2000. During the second quarter of 2015, the delivery of the vessel moved from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. This quarter the timing of several DLV2000 payments, including $22 million of planned 2015 CapEx spend also shifted into the first quarter of 2016, bringing the total DLV CapEx spend expected next year to approximately $180 million.", "In addition to the shift in CapEx in the DLV2000 there has also been $13 million of cost savings on the vessel, bringing the total expected spend on the vessel to approximately $432 million excluding capitalized interest. As a result, full year 2015 CapEx is expected to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million for the year, including maintenance and project CapEx of $30 million to $40 million.", "In addition to those figures, we expect approximately $22.6 million of capitalized interest to be reported as capital expenditures in 2015. Also during the quarter, we sanctioned the purchase of a vertical lay system for the CSV 108 for approximately $26 million. We anticipate spending $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the remainder in 2016. The additional spend for the new system has an expected payback of one year as we are able to utilize the CSV 108 in another phase of the Ichthys project, thereby displacing the planned sub-contracting to a third-party vessel. The additional spend for the lay system is included in the full-year CapEx guidance of $90 million to $100 million that I mentioned earlier.", "Now turning to order intake. We reported a backlog of approximately $4.4 billion at quarter end becoming more weighted toward our offshore operations as the subsea work at Ichthys progresses, and we continue to add shallow water brownfield work in the Middle East. The current split of our third quarter backlog is 73% offshore and 27% subsea.", "Bookings in the third quarter totaled $2.1 billion, driven by the lump-sum award for Saudi Aramco, two awards in Qatar as well as the $110 million of change orders on existing projects, bringing the year-to-date change orders to $451 million, representing 13% of the 2015 opening backlog. Of the $4.4 billion of backlog, $665 million is due to roll off in Q4 2015, $2.4 billion in 2016, $1 billion in 2017, and $400 million in 2018.", "Our legacy loss project portfolio remains at three active projects representing a backlog of $317 million, of which $93 million is scheduled to roll off in Q4 2015, $194 million is scheduled to roll off in 2016, and $30 million in 2017.", "We continue to aggressively manage the downside risk of the portfolio. As discussed earlier, we saw the scheduled completion of the fabrication work on the PB Litoral structure, one of the three active projects in a loss position, with the completion of the commissioning now expected to be finished in the first quarter of 2016.", "Our bids and change orders are standing at quarter end with $2.6 billion, compared to $7.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. Of these amounts, approximately 50% of our outstanding bids and change orders relate to offshore operations.", "The reduction of approximately $5 billion was driven primarily by the receipt of $2 billion of new awards, as well as the selection of our competitors on several major projects in the company's business development areas in the North Sea and Africa.", "Our list of target projects totaled $16.6 billion as of the end of September, increasing $3.1 billion with the addition of several major projects anticipated to be bid in the Middle East area over the next five quarters. We remain pricing disciplined in our bidding for new awards and, as a reminder, targets for those projects that we intend to bid on, and we expect will be awarded to McDermott or competitor in the next five quarters. McDermott's bids and target pipeline consists of those opportunities where we firmly believe that we have a convincing competitive position through our assets, local content or integrated EPCI solution. Approximately 63% of the value of our target projects relates to our offshore operations.", "As of the end of the quarter, the combination of our backlog, bids and change orders outstanding and target projects, our potential revenue pipeline totaled $23.6 billion, down slightly from the sequential quarter. We have provided additional information on the breakdown of our revenue pipeline by project type, area, work scope and other defining characteristics in our supplemental slide presentation located on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Moving on to our McDermott profitability initiative, we now expect to exceed the originally anticipated $50 million of in-year cash savings and generate over $100 million in 2015 excluding restructuring charges. The company has been able to implement the changes necessary to the overall cost structure and address both our fixed and variable costs while still maintaining the revenue and capacity potential of the company.", "Key to exceeding our original target has been the continued right-sizing of the organization, quicker returns on the centralization of functions, our strategic sourcing initiatives, hybrid crewing initiatives and other general policy changes the company has implemented. Specifically during the quarter, we rolled out a hybrid crewing model in which McDermott outsourced the non-technical marine crews on the majority of our vessel fleet. We also began the process of relocating our Canadian marine fleet office to Houston from Halifax and transferring the marine crews to international contracts based out of Dubai.", "Additionally, the company made the decision to relocate our Asia headquarters from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to take advantage of more favorable cost structure and to create a greater in country presence in Malaysia for some of our key customers. This move is expected to be completed during the first half of 2016. Several frame agreements were also negotiated with suppliers to leverage the company's global purchasing power. In addition to the 2015 in-year cash savings, McDermott expects to generate an additional $50 million of annualized savings in 2016. Our restructuring charges for the third quarter were $6.3 million.", "In 2014, the McDermott's leadership made the critical business decision ahead of the current macro environment to restructure our organization, and we believe that decision has positioned McDermott well to manage through the current cycle and ensure the company remains competitive.", "Finally, we've previously provided 2015 guidance on our August 8 earnings conference call and in our accompanying supplemental slide deck. Other than the year-end 2015 cap spend, which I've previously mentioned during the call and which subsequently increases our 2015 year-end cash numbers to $760 million to $780 million, the 2015 guidance given in connection with our second quarter call remains unchanged.", "Now I would like to turn the call back over to David for some closing remarks.", "David Dickson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Stuart. As I've said at the start of the call, it was a strong quarter for McDermott in terms of winning new awards and executing on our existing portfolio of projects. Our active engagement with our customers and our growing reputation continues to generate new awards and more importantly, repeat work from our existing clients. We have been able to significantly add to our 2016 backlog this quarter as well as start to build the foundation for the subsequent years.", "Internally we are actively managing our liquidity and costs, our MPI program has been a success, generating more than double our anticipated in-year cash savings for 2015. By combining right-sizing, centralization and a series of cost saving initiatives, we believe we have established a solid foundation from which McDermott can manage its business and compete successfully in the current environment.", "With that, I would now like to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS. Your line is now open.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good afternoon. I wonder, Stuart, maybe if you could just remind us what you're using for the year-to-date that compares to the $50 million to $70 million of full year operating income. It seems like with the strong performance that you had there in the quarter and year-to-date, you're pulling some losses in the fourth quarter. So I just want to confirm that I have those numbers right and to understand the dynamics a bit \u2013 I know you mentioned utilization slowing in the fourth quarter.", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, that's correct, Steven. We're using the GAAP measure or the unadjusted operating income as we give guidance. So it doesn't include the add-backs that we mentioned during the quarter. And because of that the fourth quarter we're looking at a loss position given the utilization profile of some of the fixed assets.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. So about $77.7 million, that's the number for year-to-date?", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, that's correct, Steven.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. David, this is the highest level of forward year backlog visibility you've had since around 2011. And with that in mind, do you feel that you've got visibility to achieving a normalized level of earnings at some point over the next 12 to 18 months? And I guess I'm using a definition of normalized, it would be somewhere around, say, $3 billion to $4 billion of revenues and 5% to 10% operating margins, which seems to be kind of a historical level that was pretty achievable.", "David Dickson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I would say, Steven, firstly the \u2013 I would say, it's been a good quarter in terms of the order intake, and also predominately it's being in the Middle East where I feel that we have made a lot of great progress in terms of relationships with those customers and getting our position \u2013 getting ourselves into a strong position. I think with the current macro environment and I talked about it earlier in the call is that whilst we have very good visibility of what's happening in the Middle East and not only with Aramco but very pleased today to announce another award with RasGas.", "It's very difficult to predict what else is happening in the other parts of the world. So too early to say, but what I would say is that from an operational and executional, execution aspect, I think we've also made significant progress with this organization, with the team that we have, with the additions that we've made to the team that we're certainly putting together a solid foundation that will allow us to compete in the market moving forward.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.", "Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hi, folks. Congratulations on the strong quarter.", "David Dickson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "First question given the amount you've booked and what you've indicated on your bond rate in the 10-Q, it seems like we should be moving to sort of flattish to growth on the revenue side into next year. Could you provide some more color on why that would not happen?", "David Dickson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Tahira, I'll start the answer and I'll let Stuart to add on. I think, obviously, it has been a very good quarter in terms of order intake, but I think as what we've said before, there's a lot of volatility and let's say lumpiness in terms of awards and even trying to predict when awards will occur. So I think it's early to say that growth \u2013 I think that what you can say is that we are getting ourselves back on track with what's happening in the Middle East, we're getting ourselves back on track and that we're seeing more awards coming from Aramco and Qatar with both QP and RasGas. But I think that whilst we're in this macro environment and I think I said it earlier, there isn't sufficient visibility to say that we're certainly moving into growth mode, but obviously we are very happy with what was awarded to us during the third quarter. Stuart?", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, David. Yes and, Tahira, I think we've still got Q4 to go to look for some bookings that will give us the final backlog for 2016. So I think it's a little bit early to indicate growth for next year. However, at our investor day that we're holding next week, we will be outlining our current thoughts on 2016.", "Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "All right. Okay. Thank you very much on that. And as a follow up if I look at the profile of where your targets and focus on this is, it seems that even though it's a little on the earlier side profile wise, it seems to be more economical, more brownfields, more sort of offshore versus subsea. Could you give us an idea of the competitive dynamics there going forward? Is this in your sweet spot? Or is this more in competitive areas versus what we've seen this year?", "David Dickson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think if we start in the Middle East obviously the agreement that we have with Aramco, it's public that there are four competitors. So as we bid we will compete against the other three, but obviously we feel amongst those four is that we do have a very good position both from our assets that we have there, the people that we have, the local content that we have. So we feel that we've got a lot of experience that we can fuel on to be successful.", "I think I spoke on the last call that we were anticipating an uptake in activity in Qatar, and again it's an area whereby if you look at the capabilities, you have to be capable to deliver full EPCI and predominately in shallow water. So the competitive landscape is different from what you would see certainly in the deepwater area. Now, the deepwater market obviously in this kind of macro environment is being heavily impacted and so the competitors we see there are different from what we see in the Middle East and obviously today a very competitive area.", "We have had, as you've seen, some successes and we continue to bid in that area with some prospects that will come up in the Gulf of Mexico in the subsea tieback area, some potential opportunities in Africa and in India and one or two in Asia. So we still see opportunities there, but clearly the market is impacted by this macro environment and we do live in a very competitive world.", "Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. This is Chad Dillard on for Vishal. Just want to dig into your cash generation capabilities in the second half of the year. Can you just talk about how much the Papa Terra collection contributed? And then how to think about the fourth quarter?", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, sure. So in the third quarter we did receive approximately $60 million for settlement for the Papa Terra project. And as we look into the fourth quarter, we are expecting some advanced progress payments on some of the new orders that we have booked in the third quarter, so we are expecting our cash flow from operations to be positive in the last quarter of the year.", "Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. That's helpful. And then just given some of the reports in the news about a slowdown in project awards in the Middle East, can you speak to what if any declines you're seeing in the bidding environment?", "David Dickson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean I also read the same press that you read and we read about slow down on awards. I'll be honest, from our side we haven't seen that and you can see what's happening in our third quarter in terms of awards in which we've been successful. But I would also add that today our level of bidding activity in the Middle East remains robust and certainly not seeing any slow down on any bidding activity.", "Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "That's helpful. I'll jump back in queue. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Good evening. I guess two questions. One, I guess as you look out \u2013 I guess in the more recent quarter as you look out to 2016 I guess the other side of being in this type of market where commodity prices are down and you're in a deflationary cost environment as a fixed price contractor, sometimes there are opportunities for you guys to benefit. So is there any of that that could potentially help boost your profitability? Or has it been on procurement or on labor? Or are customers getting whatever potential cost pressures on the downward side back?", "And then my second question, you did cite potential for you didn't want to answer the revenue question because you're waiting to see what bookings could be in the fourth quarter. Is there anything materially large in the fourth quarter that could potentially hit? And then \u2013 I guess that's it for right now.", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Jamie. It's Stuart.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi.", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "Let me take the supply chain question first. So today when we are bidding for new contracts, there's a significant focus by the customer on ensuring that the supply chain deflation is passed through to them. Likewise when we are negotiating any change orders on existing scope, there is a significant focus on supply chain deflation being passed to the customer. That being said, as we progress with our profitability initiative in setting up global agreements and leveraging and organizing our spend, we are trying to capture some of those savings for McDermott, albeit I would say that's a lower percentage versus the amount that's passed through to our customers.", "And then on the bookings, yes, we still have an active set of bids and change orders out there for the fourth quarter. I would say, like we've always said in 2015 the timing of those awards remains the most volatile part of our business and as we are confident in our value proposition on those orders, we are not yet in a position to estimate how much order intake we'll have in the fourth quarter.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "All righty. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Martin Malloy of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.", "Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Congratulations on the strong quarter. Wanted to ask kind of a big picture question, as you look out to 2016 with your discussions with customers, are you seeing them maybe begin to start to take a look at moving forward on development projects given the amount that the floating drilling rig rates have fallen, lower service and equipment costs? And I don't know if you can tie that in with what you're doing with the io venture?", "David Dickson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think there is any strong indication, Marty, that things are starting to change. Certainly there's a little bit more dialog around looking at projects of fairly early stage. And so with our io organization, we're having some dialog with certain customers. I think clearly offshore drill rig rates have come down over the last year, and generally, the supply chain has come down and costs.", "So there are some dialogs, but I wouldn't say there's been any significant change that would say we'll start to see a lot of projects moving forward. I was saying that, again, you've got to look at the market differently whether you're talking to the super majors, the independents and the national oil companies. And I would say out of the group, the most active at this time are the national oil companies that we're having dialog on certain prospects moving ahead at some point, although at early stages.", "But I would say to answer your question, haven't seen anything in the market that would indicate any change to the status that we've had through 2015 of the slowdown.", "Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Okay. And is there an update you can give us in terms of the customer interests in the DLV2000 and if you've started bidding it on projects?", "David Dickson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So the DLV2000, we're looking at the one opportunity of putting the vessel to work. I can also say that we have a number of bids that we're actively working on today. We have some bids where checks are already submitted, and which award or selection should be over this next coming months. Certainly, we've had an active period of bidding for this particular asset.", "Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.", "Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yeah, hi. Good afternoon.", "David Dickson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "A couple of questions. Just a point of clarification on the restructuring savings, so you have $100 million of cost saves this year. I assume you're not recognizing that entire $100 million this year; some of it will probably be more anniversaried next year. So I'm just trying to get clarity. Is there going to be some carry-over from the $100 million this year, and then you're expecting an additional $50 million on top of that, or is the $50 million carry \u2013 capsulating some of the carry-over from this year?", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Brian, it's Stuart. So the $100 million we mentioned for 2015 was cash savings are in year. Now not all of that is going to flow through to the profit and loss given some of it is subject to a percentage of completion in our projects. And then next year we are seeing that we will be able to generate an additional $50 million of in-year cash savings on top of the previous $100 million target.", "Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Understood. Great. And separately, on the capitalized interest components, can you kind of accurately tell how much incremental you're going to be recognizing in the P&L in 2016 at this point?", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, because the capitalized interest is occurring on the DLV2000, and we expect that to be delivered at the end of the first quarter. We are expecting quite a step up in the interest charge in the P&L next year. As you saw from the third quarter results today, we were capitalizing $5 million of interest; we had $18 million of gross. So after Q1 next year you would expect the $18 million of gross to stay in the P&L.", "Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And just one last one. Just on the balance sheet, the unbilled receivables actually were up quite a bit in the third quarter, up almost 40% year-to-date and up quite a bit sequentially even. Can you just talk to what is that reflecting? That would be helpful. Thanks.", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "Absolutely. When you look at our working capital in the balance sheet, on the asset side you're seeing quite an increase year-to-date on our contracts in-progress. That's really driven by our Middle East business and our BSP project in Asia. In the Middle East we are working through a number of change orders with the customers, and when those get agreed then we will be able to agree billings and also cash collection.", "BSP had a very, very active quarter in Q3, so we did a lot of kind of work there that we'll bill out and collect in the fourth quarter. And then on the other side of the balance sheet you also see a big drop off this year in our advanced billings. And those advanced billings really relate to our Ichthys project and also our PB Litoral project.", "Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "On the contracts in progress, are any of those being disputed or is that just fairly run rate business?", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "All of that is run rate business, and we do not recognize any potential change orders in our P&L and therefore our balance sheet unless we have a demonstrated track record with the customer and a sound contractual basis to recognize them. In the event there is a dispute on the presented change order, we would then move that to a formal claim. And at the end of the third quarter 2015, we only had $9 million of claims recognized on our balance sheet.", "Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rob Norfleet of Alembic Global. Your line is now open.", "Nicholas K. Chen - Alembic Global Advisors LLC", "Good afternoon. This is actually Nick Chen for Rob. Thanks for taking our question and congratulations on a great quarter. I was hoping you guys could give a little bit more detail, just an update into your head count reductions?", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, this is Stuart. So, absolutely. So on our head count reductions, there's really as you've seen our head count dropped this year really driven by two factors. Firstly, the project workload as we sequence within projects. Our variable work force, that would be our craft labor or some of our project-specific labor, we would release when the project is finished if there's not a new project to move on to. And then there's the profitability initiative head count reductions that we've made. We've made in excess of 1,000 head reductions this year with MPI related to rightsizing, centralization and other initiatives.", "Nicholas K. Chen - Alembic Global Advisors LLC", "Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a quick update. I know you touched on it a little bit before, but on the lost projects, could you just give a little bit more detail into gross margins for the year? And with change orders, have any of them been accretive at any point?", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. So at the end of the third quarter 2015 we have $317 million of backlog on the lost projects. Year-to-date 2015 on the three active projects that we have, they have been accretive to approximately $28 million to gross profit. So we've successfully either negotiated change orders or achieved other cost recovery or contract extension to approximately $28 million.", "Nicholas K. Chen - Alembic Global Advisors LLC", "That's very helpful. Thank you very much. I'll jump back into the queue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Blake Hutchinson of Howard Weil. Your line is now open.", "Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil", "Good afternoon, guys.", "David Dickson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil", "Just wanted to understand with Ichthys, mainly run off at this point in terms of fabrication yard utilization and where we stand today especially on the year-over-year comparison in terms of utilization, want to be wary. Is there anything within the system at these utilization levels where you start running into issues with managing strictly around variable cost and something in maybe one of the yards within the system bites a little bit harder. Just wanted to make sure there wasn't something we need to \u2013 kind of be a little more wary of at the yard level.", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "This is Stuart, Blake. So when we're specifically talking about Batam, yes, the Ichthys workload completes toward the end of the fourth quarter. However, you will notice in our supplemental deck we do include a fabrication only project that's going into Batam that was awarded in the third quarter of 2015 that is producing LNG modules for the Yamal project. So this is part of our fabrication only strategy that we started in the earlier part of the year where we're looking to try and provide certain of our yards base load work moving through this cycle. So we would hope that that would absorb a significant amount of our both fixed cost base going into 2016.", "Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil", "And with everything else you see at least today Batam would have been the one place that it was a little positively closer to challenging that \u2013 the ability to manage that cost base?", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "That's correct, yes.", "Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil", "You still get around \u2013 across the rest of the enterprise. That's another way of asking. Okay. And then just I apologize for coming in late here. Stuart, did you give an absorption number? Or I guess in this case perhaps a plus for the quarter on the vessel side?", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "We gave a total fixed cost net absorption number for the quarter and this quarter we were slightly under absorbed by about $5 million.", "Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil", "Thanks. I apologize for that. I'll turn it back. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Connors of Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey, guys. I sort of wanted to touch up \u2013 you got into it a little bit on the working capital discussion. But we've also been reading some stories out there that some of the Middle East NOCs have been clamping it a little bit down on their contractors in terms of terms and conditions. And can you just tell us what you're seeing and what you're hearing out there? Have down payment structures changed at all, particularly I guess the likes of Aramco if you can discuss?", "David Dickson - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me just \u2013 I'll just clear it, and I'll let Stuart to get into more of the details. But contrary to what we've also heard is that working in the Middle East is we haven't seen any structural change of how we are working with the customers both in terms of negotiating terms and conditions or negotiating change orders. So we haven't seen any significant change of what's been happening in the past. Stuart, you want to add to that?", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "Absolutely. So on working capital, specifically, in Saudi Arabia, in the new long-term agreement, there was a subtle change to the procurement payment schedule. And that is now driven by receipt of materials in country as opposed to our yard in Jebel Ali.", "However, we are allowed to receive advance payments if we post advance payment guarantees for that amount. So we're able to manage that change in contracting terms. In other parts of the Middle East, the working capital parts of the contract remain stable, as from the last couple of years.", "Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Great. I'm sorry, I missed it, but can you touch up on what the bids outstanding was again? Was it $2.6 billion? And if could ask a question related to the DLV2000. You mentioned you are bidding that vessel out already, but does it need to go through trials and a sort of commissioning phase before we see an actual award, and when you expect that to occur?", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, this is Stuart. Our bids outstanding at the end of the third quarter were slightly above $2 billion. With the DLV2000, we expect delivery at the end of the first quarter. That delivery includes the basic sea trials performed by the building contractor, which is Keppel.", "Post-receipt, we will put the vessel through pipe lay trials and some other operational aspects specific to the equipment, at which point we will deem it in service. As David has said, we've always actively looked to deploy the vessel, either in a contract that we have, or on a new contract that we're currently bidding.", "Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. But no timeline or you're not willing to discuss this post-receipt/pipe lay trials when those are complete?", "Stuart Spence - EVP and Chief Financial Officer", "So the vessel is due to go in service in the middle of the second quarter next year, and we are not yet in a position to release what the first project will be for the vessel.", "Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Darcey Matthews for any further remarks.", "K. Darcey Matthews - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Sonja, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

I would like to remind you that we are recording this call and that a replay will be available on our Web site, where you can find our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results press release and the Form 10-Q we filed today.

Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which are available on our Web site, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which provides a discussion of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations. Please note that except to the extent required by applicable law, McDermott undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn the call over to David Dickson, McDermott's President and Chief Executive Officer for opening remarks.", "David Dickson", "Thank you, Kathy and good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. From our results today, you can see we continue to make short-term progress driven by improved execution and our change in culture which is in turn building a stronger financial foundation as we manage through this current macro commodity cycle. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter results, and 2015 full year results, as they reflect the impact of all the initiatives we have worked on today and clearly demonstrate the operational and financial turnaround that began in early 2014.", "The Company has been significantly strengthened not only in terms of backlog and operating income, but also in terms of its capabilities and competencies in an extremely challenging market. Of special note this quarter, all areas were operationally profitable on an adjusted basis. In addition, by proactively managing the cost structure at the beginning of the downturn, we have not only performed well financially in 2015, but also have positioned ourselves to be competitive in all areas of our business.", "Our success in winning the ONGC Vashishta award in addition to a sizeable transportation and installation contract offshore Trinidad demonstrates continued focus on customer engagement and the realization of McDermott\u2019s strong brand reputation. It also demonstrates our ability to balance our geographic portfolio, while remaining a leader in the Middle East.", "McDermott\u2019s reputation as a partner-of-choice continues to grow as demonstrated by the recently announced long-term Consortium with Larsen & Toubro. This partnership strengthens our relationship for both clients with our combined capabilities and provides a unique solution for the offshore and deepwater India market. Our commitment to excellence and project execution was further evident during the quarter as our Marine campaign on INPEX\u2019s Ichthys remains on-schedule and we successfully completed the offshore installation and the hookup of the PB Litoral jacket and Topsides ahead of schedule.", "In addition, our dedication to health, safety, environment and security, continues with our outstanding performance in safety statistics throughout all areas of operation. We remain an industry-leader in this area. Furthermore, despite the current macro headwind, we hold greater than 80% of expected 2016 revenue and backlog. Our bidding activity remains high and we continue to anticipate a good revenue opportunity pipeline.", "Now I\u2019d like to provide an update on the execution of some of our key projects. In Americas, Europe and Africa area, the installation of the PB Litoral jacket and Topsides and the hookup marked the first years of the float-over method of installation in Mexico by McDermott and was successfully completed without incident and ahead of schedule. We are proud of the changes we have made to ensure that this project is executed to McDermott\u2019s global quality and safety standards. The PB Litoral team has done an outstanding job ensuring that the loss on the project has not deteriorated further over the past four quarters.", "Unfortunately PEMEX unilaterally extended payment terms to all the supply chain thus delaying some of our cash collections during the fourth quarter 2015. We do however expect to receive payment in the near-term and we continue to remain positive on the near and longer term market outlook in Mexico. We have demonstrated that we can deliver projects in Mexico with the appropriate blend of in-country assets and people along with developing a strong relationship with PEMEX.", "Our go forward Gulfport Mississippi spoolbase facility has been handed over to operations and has substantially completed the welding of the pipeline for the LLOG Otis project. We expect this drilling on to our North Ocean 105 vessel in the first quarter of 2016. We continue to focus on the Middle East area with the Aramco Karan 45 project progressing ahead of schedule and the Abu Ali cables project completed ahead of schedule, earning the project team\u2019s special commendations from the client. Execution of Lump Sum project awarded under the renewed Aramco Long Term agreement LTAII is now proceeding according to schedule. As mentioned last quarter the national oil companies in the region remain public about maintaining production and we continue to expect our pipeline of potential projects in the Middle East to be brownfield in nature. As a result our bidding activity remains high in the Middle East area.", "In our Asia Pacific area our INPEX Ichthys project achieved all of the agreed upon milestones during the quarter remaining on schedule. We are very pleased with the performance of the Aegir Heerema\u2019s vessel and the Heerema partnership on this project. Our partnership with Heerema is another example of our core strength in developing relationships which ultimately translates to improve project execution and performance. During that quarter Ichthys and the 16th stope of the Brunei Shell pipeline and replacement project was deferred 2017 by a customer as a result of the commodity price environment. We will continue to engage with the customer until they decide on their new project timeline.", "Also in the quarter fabrication weren\u2019t begin in the Batam yard for the 22,000 tonnes of modules for Yamal LNG. We will continue to focus on these types of fabrication opportunities as part of our new company-wide strategy for fixed cost absorption. I previously mentioned McDermott was awarded the ONGC Vashishta project in the fourth quarter 2015. We believe that meeting the end-market content requirements through partnering with Larsen & Toubro are demonstrating track-record in both shallow water and subsea and our newer competitive cost structure were the main drivers for winning the Vashishta award at a profitable margin.", "As we have just announced, we will conduct the naming ceremony of our new flagship Derrick Lay Vessel, the DLV 2000, at Keppels Singmarine Shipyard in Singapore on Thursday April 14, 2016. The DLV 2000 will add high-end capabilities and versatility to our existing fleet. As the new flagship of our fleet the DLV 2000 will allow us to utilize one vessel on projects requiring a combination of pipelay, heavy lift, back space restructures and offshore workforce accommodation that would normally have to be executed by multiple vessels. We also expect the DLV 2000 to provide us with a key asset for fuel development in remote locations through the combination of these versatile construction capabilities and fast transit speed.", "As part of our current work schedule, the DLV 2000 have secured over 80 days on a 2016 marine campaign on the INPEX Ichthys project. We expect to then perform its first pipelay work on the recently awarded Woodside Greater Western Flank Phase 2 transportation and installation project. We also continue to actively bid the DLV 2000 on prospective projects.", "Now I would like to discuss our legacy loss, mix and projects. As a result of our cost management our backlog of legacy loss projects has been reduced significantly from last quarter as a KGL hoots project is no longer in a loss position. Regarding the two remaining material legacy loss projects, we expect the PB Litoral project to complete in early 2016 and Agile charter to finish in early 2017.", "Looking forward, we continue to focus on the current macro environment and what it means to our clients. Many exploration and production companies have deferred or reduced our capital expenditures. However, as we look at our business expanding and targeted projects at December 31, 2015. We believe we are still well-positioned in markets where capital is available for investment. Additionally, we believe we are more competitive today than ever given our strong project execution, increased cost management, liquidity culture and increased organizational capabilities and competences.", "We do expect to continue our focus on our traditional area of excellence offshore EPCI projects until the subsea deepwater market recovers. We continue to have significant opportunities with national oil companies, which we believe are more likely to continue with fuel development project in today's market. With the Middle East area expected to be the greatest contributor to near-term order intake. We will also continue to position ourselves for when the micro environment recovers.", "With that I would like to turn over the call to Stuart Spence, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for a review of our financials.", "Stuart Spence", "Thanks, David and good afternoon everyone. Today I am going to cover our fourth quarter and full year financial results, then I\u2019ll discus our CapEx spend, followed by our backlog and current bid pipeline, then provide an update on our cost saving initiatives, finally I\u2019ll discuss our guidance for 2016 based on current market conditions.", "Before I get started today, I would like to remind you of the new reporting majors we introduced in the third quarter. As previously mentioned, in addition to our GAAP reporting, we will also report certain adjusted financials net of one-time items to provide a clear understanding of the underlying performance and drivers of our business. To support these efforts, I would like to draw your attention to our press release and supplement slide deck that detail the reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial majors.", "Now on to the fourth quarter of 2015 and year-end results, revenues for the fourth quarter were 67.4 million down 138.4 million or 17% over the sequential quarter and then 139 million from Q4 2014 revenues of 806.4 million. This decrease was driven by comparatively low activities on the INPEX Ichthys project during the fourth quarter of 2015. The key projects driving revenue were in our Asia and Middle East areas, as far as the continued progress made on PB Litoral in Mexico. In Asia the INPEX Ichthys and the Brunei Shell pipeline replacement projects drove revenue. In the Middle East to larger projects Aramco Safaniya Phase 2 and ADMA 4 GI projects drove revenue recognition.", "Our constant focus on improving our biding and execution during the past year has made a positive impact as our adjusted operating income totaled 48.2 million during the quarter, excluding 8.7 million of restructuring expenses and 26 million of mark-to-market non-cash pension charges. Operating income for the quarter was positively impacted by the successful negotiation and agreement of weather-related recoveries in the Middle East. A change order on the INPEX Ichthys contract, cost reductions as a result over the McDermott Profitability Initiative, reversal of liquidated damages related to a schedule extension on PB Litoral and better than expected utilization in the quarter. As David mentioned the KGL hoot project is no longer in a loss making position and our loss project portfolio contributed positively to gross profit during both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2015.", "Cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was 60.6 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of 20.7 million for the third quarter of 2015 and 119.3 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Improvement in the fourth quarter over the sequential quarter is attributable to advance payments on newly awarded projects and collections of weather-related recoveries both in the Middle East. However, these improvements were partially offset by PEMEX unilaterally extending payment terms to its suppliers, including McDermott.", "For the full year, the Company reported revenues of 3.1 billion compared to 2.3 billion for 2014. The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by the INPEX Ichthys project, the Brunei Shell pipeline replacement project and progress on the PB Litoral project. Our adjusted operating income for the year was 174.7 million in 2015 excluding restructuring charges of 40.8 million, a legal settlement of 16.7 million and non-cash mark-to-market pension charges of 26 million. This compares to an adjusted operating income for 2014 of 23.7 million, which excludes restructuring charges of 18.1 million and non-cash mark-to-market pension gains of 2.9 million.", "2014 adjusted operating income included gains on sale of assets of 46.2 million. Fourth quarter 2015 operating income includes overhead, under-absorption of approximately $21 million due to project sequencing and seasonality. Cash provided by operating activities for 2015 was 55.3 million compared to 7 million for the full year 2014. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by continued focus on project execution as well as cash savings resulting from MPI. As I previously mentioned the supplemental slide deck available on our Web site provides additional financial information.", "Moving to the balance sheet, at December 31, 2015, we reported 781.6 million in cash and restricted cash, an increase in total cash from the third quarter of 14.4 million. This is primarily driven by 60.6 million of cash flow from operations offset by 36.7 million of capital expenditures and debt repayment of 9 million. Restricted cash decreased this quarter as a result of the expiring of cash collateralized letters of credit. We have not had a structural change in our contracting terms and conditions during the quarter, related to working capital other than the previously mentioned PEMEX unilaterally extending vendor credit terms. Letters of credit issued under our LT facility totaled 384 million and cash collateralized letters of credit totaled 102 million at year-end 2015.", "Moving to CapEx, capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were 36.7 million, which includes 5.8 million of capitalized interest. During the fourth quarter, an additional 9 million of planned CapEx spend for our flagship vessel the DLV 2000 was deferred to 2016, bringing the total DLV CapEx spend expected in 2016 to approximately 189 million. There has been no change to the total expected spend on the vessel of approximately 432 million, excluding capitalized interest. Total CapEx expenditures for the full year of 2015 were 102.9 million, including 22.7 million of capitalized interest, 37.9 million of spend related to the DLV 2000, 12.3 million related to our CSV 108 vessel delivered in the first quarter and $4.8 million was spent for our vertical trig system upgrade on the CSV 108 currently under construction. The remaining amounts were associated with project related items and maintenance CapEx.", "Now turning to order intake, we reported a backlog of approximately 4.2 billion at year-end of which 69% is related to our offshore operations and 31% is related to our subsea operations. Bookings in the fourth quarter totaled 478.3 million driven primarily by a new profitable order from ONGC for their Vashishta field and a T&I award offshore Trinidad along with change orders on existing projects. Of the 4.2 billion of backlog, 2.4 billion is due to roll off in 2016, $1.3 billion in \u201917, and 0.5 billion in 2018.", "As I mentioned earlier, our legacy loss project portfolio has decreased from three material projects at the end of the third quarter to two material projects at the end of the year. The PB Litoral project and the Agile charter project are the only remaining material loss projects in the legacy portfolio. The PB Litoral project is expected to be finished in the first quarter of 2016, and the Agile charter project is expected to be complete in early 2017. For further details on the roll off of these projects please refer to the supplemental presentation.", "Our bids and change orders outstanding at year-end was 4.4 billion compared to 2.6 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2015. For the fourth quarter revenue pipeline approximately 72% of our outstanding bids and change orders relate to our offshore operations. Our list of target projects totaled 15.2 billion as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in target projects is primarily due to projects moving from targets to bids outstanding as well as the few projects slipping out of the five quarter time horizon due to the current macro environment. As a reminder, target for those projects that we intend to bid on and we expect would be awarded to us or our competitor in the next five quarters. Approximately 73% of the value of our target projects relate to offshore operations.", "As of December 31, 2015 the combination of our backlog, bids and change orders outstanding and target projects, which makes up our potential revenue pipeline, totaled 23.8 billion, up from 23.6 billion in the sequential quarter. Also, our bid pipeline increased by 400 million, primarily due to national oil companies maintaining a high level of bidding activity, especially in the Middle East. Once again, we have provided additional information on the breakdown by project type, region, and work scope of these various items in the supplemental presentation on our Web site.", "Moving to cost restructuring, as I mentioned in previous quarters, at the end of 2014, we embarked on a planned cost reduction exercise to improve our profitability and flexibility, called McDermott Profitability Initiative or MPI. The objective of the exercise was to bring a change to our overall cost structure and address our fixed costs, while still maintaining the revenue and capacity potential of the Company. We have now substantially completed MPI other than our move from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur and some final sourcing initiatives. We are pleased to report the Company realized approximately 150 million of annual cash savings in 2015, and expects to realize annual cash savings going-forward of approximately 150 million as compared to the 2014 benchmark.", "As part of our new cost culture, we proactively continued to look at new ways of improving our cost structure. As such, we initiated the additional overhead reduction program, or AOR, in the fourth quarter of 2015. This program will include headcount reductions affecting direct operating expenses, as well as SG&A. The program is expected to be substantially complete in the first quarter of 2016, and should generate greater than 20 million of end-year 2016 savings. We expect total restructuring cost to be approximately 10 million in 2016, of which approximately 5 million is associated with the AOR program.", "For the full year of 2016, the Company expects revenues to be approximately 2.9 billion and adjusted operating income to be approximately 115 million, which excludes the expected restructuring cost of 10 million. We also expect the adjusted operating income to be slightly weighted towards the first half of the year due to project sequencing. As previously highlighted, absorption of our asset-based cost structure in 2016 is a focus for us.", "For the full year of 2016, we expect gross interest expense of approximately 74 million and capitalized interest of approximately 10 million, and net interest expense of approximately 64 million. Of the expected 74 million in gross interest expense, we expect 60 million of that to be in cash and the other 14 million to be amortization. We also expect our taxes to be approximately 55 million for 2016. We expect full year of 2016 adjusted net income to be breakeven. Additionally, we expect adjusted street-EBITDA to be approximately 240 million and covenant EBITDA trailing 12-months to be approximately 285 million. Which we believe provides adequate coverage for our minimum required covenant EBITDA of 251 million with 28 million remaining for EBITDA add-back.", "With the CSV 108 completed in early 2015, our remaining capital expenditures to complete the DLV 2000 during 2016 are expected to be $189 million. We expect to spend approximately 20 million completing the CSV 108 vertical lay system and 48 million during the year on the other remaining maintenance and project-related expenditures, while maintaining the capabilities and reliability of our assets. In addition to those figures, we expect approximately 10 million of capitalized interest to be reported as capital expenditures in 2016. Also, we expect to have approximately 580 million of cash and restricted cash and 840 million in gross debt at the end of 2016, assuming contracting terms and industry norms and working capital remain stable and PEMEX returns to normal payment cycle.", "Furthermore, we expect our free cash flow to be approximately negative 160 million. The majority of this is due to the 189 million of CapEx related to the DLV 2000 in 2016. Adjusted for the DLV 2000 CapEx, our free cash flow is expected to be approximately 29 million. We expect our Middle East business to generate free cash flow in 2016, despite the fact that we expect assumption of working capital as a result of a normal ramp-up of project spend for recent awards.", "Our guidance is based on our view of the business outlook. However, given the macro commodity environment, we may see pressure from potential CapEx spending delays, stronger competitive pricing pressure due to contraction in certain markets and our own lower utilization. For now, McDermott will concentrate on what we have control on, which includes continued focus on our highest value proposition opportunities, strong execution of our existing backlog, customer alignment and focus on our utilization and cost management.", "Now, I would like to turn the call back over to David.", "David Dickson", "Thank you, Stuart. As we have discussed, McDermott made significant progress on its turnaround with 2015 being the year where we have executed and improved our operational performance. This has been demonstrated by improved operating income and an increase in backlog that McDermott has not achieved since 2012.", "In addition, our reputation in the marketplace continues to grow and our relationships with major customers and business partners continues to strengthen. This was demonstrated in winning the ONGC Vashishta project and entry back into the offshore market in India in consortium with Larsen & Toubro, as well as our continued successful partnership with Heerema on the INPEX Ichthys project.", "As for our organization, we will continue to focus on talent and strengthen the now significant core capabilities of the organization to further our operational and financial success in 2016 and beyond. In addition, we have added a Director position to our Board and welcome Erich Kaeser\u2019s experience and insights. His extensive executive management and operational experience in the global energy industry, particularly in the Middle East markets, will be an invaluable asset for the Company and will compliment the extensive experience of our current Board.", "So as we look to 2016, we will be focused on bidding new profitable work to secure 2017 and 2018 awards through the increased capabilities and competencies of our organization, as well as leveraging our relationships with customers and partners. We also expect to remain focused on maintaining our new standard of operational execution. Given the continued backdrop of a lower for longer oil price environment, our order intake focus remains centered around three core themes; firstly, the markets where capital is available for investment; secondly, the brand fuel and producing basins with the lowest production cost; and lastly, focusing on national oil companies who remain committed to their production levels.", "We also continue to concentrate on the items that we can control, including customer alignment, asset utilization, cost management and liquidity culture. As Stuart mentioned earlier, we commenced our McDermott profitability initiative before the current downturn. We have more recently enacted the additional overhead reduction program and with our new developed cost culture, we believe we are more cost competitive than ever and will continue to strive to remain so in the future, as we scale our business to match customer demand. We believe that McDermott has completed its turnaround phase started in 2014. And with a substantial portion of expected 2016 revenue in backlog, we look forward to a solid year despite the macro backdrop and continue to be focused on the long-term positioning and prospects through the cycle.", "With that, I would now like to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Jamie Cook", "First, congratulations on a nice quarter. I guess my question relates to, you talked about PEMEX and delayment in payment. I think you said you expected it in the near-term. Can you just sort of quantify how big that is and what risks do you see to delayed payments for some of your other customers, in particular, with your concentration in the Middle East? And then can you talk about as you\u2019re negotiating new projects or potentially new awards or any of the terms changing I think, in your prepared remarks you said you assume contract\u2019s terms don\u2019t change. I am just wondering how realistic that is? Thanks.", "Stuart Spence", "Thanks Jamie, it is Stuart. Just to answer the PEMEX question, first. We suffered approximately 116 million of delayed payments from PEMEX in the fourth quarter.", "Jamie Cook", "Okay.", "Stuart Spence", "We are actively working with them and we feel very comfortable that that cash will be forthcoming early 2016. In terms of working capital terms in our contracts, today on the bids that we are making, we see a stable environment and we would hope that that would continue. I think our prepared remarks just position ourselves for a potential lower for longer cycle and if that has any detrimental impact to working capital terms. Thirdly, on the Middle East market, we remain very comfortable with all of our working relationships with all clients in the Middle East and the payment terms and contractual working capital terms are being adhered too.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.", "Clay Rikard", "Thanks. This is actually Clay Rikard on for Steve, thanks for taking my question, just to follow-up on Jamie\u2019s question in the Middle East. Can you discuss maybe how this value messaging on pricing terms and timing have changed over the last few months if at all?", "David Dickson", "No with -- this is David Dickson. What I would say since certainly in the nearest short-term we haven\u2019t seen any changes in anything that we\u2019re doing particularly in Saudi as you know our agreement that we have with Saudi is they are long-term agreement which is an agreement with the terms and conditions have already been set and what we do is we\u2019re competing on a pricing basis. So we haven\u2019t seen any impact or any change whatsoever. Our bidding activity with Aramco remains high and we expect that to continue throughout 2016.", "Clay Rikard", "Great, thanks. And then just in terms of the guidance it looks like the revenues are now about flat with your initial range but the operating income is up a little bit and I know there are some adjustments in there. But I am just wondering if there has been any change in your expectations for profitability of the business, or some of the regional margins going into 2016?", "Stuart Spence", "Clay this is Stuart. We\u2019ve increased our guidance from the initial indication that we gave at our Investor Day in 2015, really for two factors, the first is that we are now showing our guidance on an adjusted basis, so we adjusted our restructuring costs, and the second element is around our additional overhead reduction program, we have upped our guidance to reflect some of the savings that we will see in the year associated to that program, which is approximately $20 million.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Rogers with D. A. Davidson. Your line is open.", "John Rogers", "Just first of all another follow-up just relative to the PEMEX situation, what are you expecting to work off in 2016 for PEMEX? In other words how much more work are you due to collect on this year and I guess my anticipation is there a risk on collections there?", "Stuart Spence", "John this is Stuart. We have two active projects with PEMEX at the moment. We have the completion of PB Litoral which we expect to handover the facility in the first quarter. And then the second contract we have is on Ayatsil-C which is at the early stages it's in the procurement stage. We work with PEMEX extremely closely on the collection side as you\u2019d have seen them in the -- proactively last year they delayed payments through their entire supply chain not just McDermott we are continually given assurances by PEMEX that it's a timing issue and certainly not an ultimate collection issue and we positively continue to work with them on that basis.", "John Rogers", "Okay. But I mean orders of magnitude revenue, what is -- how does that?", "Stuart Spence", "Sure, on the remaining scope of PB Litoral and the Ayatsil-C we would probably have around $80 million of exposure on those contracts.", "John Rogers", "Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Okay, and then secondly your comments relative to how did the year plays out due with the cash flow being more weighted towards the first half. I assume that\u2019s also true of the way you\u2019re thinking about operating earnings?", "Stuart Spence", "Yes, in our guidance we said that our operating income would be slightly weighted to the first half of the year. We would expect our cash profile to be similar, but obviously driven by our PEMEX collections that we\u2019re currently working on.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Martin Malloy with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.", "Martin Malloy", "I was wondering maybe if you could give us a little more help in terms of potential timing of the awards. As you look to the Middle East and there has been some in the press some significant projects that are, according to the press expected to be awarded first half of this year?", "David Dickson", "Yes, Martin we have -- as we look at our bid pipeline we have several outstanding bids which are in the Middle East. So that includes both Saudi and Qatar. And in discussion with our customer, we would expect some of these to be awarded to whoever successful in the first half of this year.", "Martin Malloy", "Okay. And then any update on the IO joint venture with GE?", "David Dickson", "Yes, we continue to develop IO. We more recently we just had an executive review of IO. IO is working on some study that as we have said many times before IO is looking at what I would call development and production solutions for our customers across a broad range of activity. So, it is just not subsea but also looking at how it can resolve in some areas gas compression issues for our customers so we\u2019re looking at a blend our studies which are ongoing at the moment. So we\u2019re very satisfied with the progress that IO has made today.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.", "Brian Konigsberg", "Can you expand a little bit more on your JV with L&T? Obviously you got the award national award in Q4, if their market has been described previously just very aggressive from a competitive standpoint. Just kind of you talk about, do these margin -- does the margin profile fit the traditional margins you see in those markets? And what can you do to protect yourself to the extent there is their collection which is just quite aggressive on pricing, maybe terms?", "David Dickson", "Yes, Brain if you look at the India market, particularly the ONGC is, that is a market which is forecasted to grow over the next few years. And as we looked at India, and we wanted to look at more from a long-term strategic point of view, McDermott had been in India for several years previously but this is obviously in the emerging market which includes both shallow and deepwater. And as we looked at this, we were respecting the fact of that is a move for local content in India, but we also know that local content in India also provides some benefits in terms of cost. So very early on before we actually submitted our bid, we started some dialogue with Larsen & Toubro to set up this joint venture should I say agreement between us, which we also announced today and that was very strategic as part of winning the Vashishta award. We also looked at our execution to ensure that a large piece of the work was executed in India, taking advantage of L&Ts facilities, and also taken advantage of what is lower cost execution. So we\u2019re very happy with this. And also positions a Company extremely well as we look at further bids which we expect will come through from -- as bids will come from ONGC through 2016.", "Brian Konigsberg", "Got it, thanks. And then just secondly, can you just touch a little bit more on the restructuring. So you are not spending a whole lot in getting quite a bit of savings riding well above 100% return. Can you just give me first of all more detail on exactly the plans you are intending to implement, and just why the savings are actually so strong?", "Stuart Spence", "Sure, Brain. This is Stuart. As our management team looks at our overall cost structure towards at the end of the fourth quarter, we still felt that we could make some more efficiency-based savings, predominantly driven by headcount, but also on some operational initiatives. So we made plans in very late, end of Q4 and we are now starting to execute those. We\u2019re also seeing that as you have noted that we\u2019re not incurring a significant amount of cost to generate return and we\u2019re also not in any way diminishing the competency capability, or capacity of the Company. So this is a purely efficiency led drive that we\u2019ll try and wrap-up as much as we can in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Alan Fleming ", "Hi this is Alan Fleming this afternoon, how are you?", "David Dickson", "Hi, Alan how are you doing?", "Alan Fleming", "Doing well, David, I guess I'll start off with a question on backlog and revenues. So you have about 2.4 billion in backlog it is set to roll-off in \u201916. I think that's mostly flattish first what you had last quarter. So maybe you could just talk about your confidence in getting to that 2.9 billion? It looks like maybe you even you took off the bottom-end of that range if you had at your Analyst Day. So are you going to -- do you think you can get there with just scope changes and maybe some book and burn work? Or do you need one or two more decent sized bookings in the first-half of the year to get there?", "David Dickson", "So, if I look at it, obviously, we look at it historically we are an organization that generates a certain percentage of revenue from change orders has been through our activities. And over that previous year, and that\u2019s the range between 7% and 14% of our existing revenues. We also have book and burn work, which traditionally run in places like Gulf of Mexico and in Asia. The other area is obviously new awards. And as you look at our pipeline revenue, you see a slight change from that was in Q3, so that\u2019s also reflective. But even in this current environment our bidding activity again particularly in the Middle East remains robust. And we would expect those projects to be awarded by the customers through this year. So as we think about our current 2.4 billion of revenue in the current backlog, and as we look at it and compared it to last year, I think we see that there is sufficient opportunities there to meet the guidance that we have given today.", "Alan Fleming", "Okay thanks David, I appreciate that. And then maybe Stuart a question for you on utilization, I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned that it remains kind of a focus for you guys. Are there any changes to the expectation you laid out in November in terms of how we should think about asset utilization in 2016? I think you had talked about under-absorption in fab being higher as you move through the year. Is that still the right way to think about it? And is there anything you guys can do to support vessel utilization levels in 2016 short of just winning new work?", "Stuart Spence", "Yes Alan so if you look at the utilization outlook for 2016, generally it is in line with the discussion that we had around our Investor Day. It\u2019s at a higher level, materially higher level than 2015, hence the focus within the Company. We are looking at specific strategies, as David mentioned earlier. We are looking at fabrication only strategies to absorb the fixed cost structure of our facilities. And we\u2019re also looking at various opportunities, either on the spot market or supporting existing contracts that we have with the vessel fleet that we have. So, we are continually looking at new ways and different ways of generating additional marine utilization as we move through 2016.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Matt Tucker", "I believe at your Investor Day oil was trading around $40 per barrel. It's obviously taking other your leg down since then. Based on your bids outstanding, your target list or guidance doesn\u2019t seem like a lot has changed. But could you comment on any kind of high level changes you are seeing in customer and/or competitor behavior just since your Analyst Day in reaction to this next leg lower-end prices?", "David Dickson", "Hi Matt, it's David Dickson here. I would say since our Investor Day, which was only some two months ago, we haven't seen any, what I would say our material changes. Obviously, we have had some success since then with the awards in India. And obviously we announced the award of the pipeline in Australia, the Greater Western Flank 2 project. So we\u2019re starting to see projects come. Clearly the macro environment is going to be with us for some time. And I am not going to go into dialogue about how long that is likely to last. But as I said that if you look at our pipeline of bids, you see there a split, of something like 70% is in our let's call it our traditional and conventional offshore business and that looks like to continue on this path, whilst we see some of the deepwater projects obviously being more challenged in this cost environment. So, a big focus again is on areas such as Middle East, such as Mexico, and some parts of Asia. So as I said earlier in my prepared remarks, I feel that as an organization we\u2019ve extremely well-positioned and with a new cost structure, even more competitive that this is hopefully are in a reasonable position as we bid work through 2016.", "Matt Tucker", "Thanks David that\u2019s very helpful. And then apologies if I missed this, but the execution schedule for Greater Western Frank I guess when does execution start to ramp-up there?", "Stuart Spence", "This is Stuart. The Greater Western Flank project will begin -- we will be doing engineering and some procurement this year and the main installation happens in 2017.", "Matt Tucker", "Great, thanks. And then just last one, just one up on the guidance. I just want to be clear that I kind of understand the moving pieces. It sounds like you were including about 5 million in restructuring in the initial guidance, that\u2019s now close to 10 million, and you have pulled that out of the adjusted guidance. And then there is 20 million improvement expected as a result of the most recent restructuring decision, is that accurate?", "Stuart Spence", "This is Stuart. That is an accurate description, yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.", "Kathy Murray", "Thank you very much. And thanks again for participating today.

In addition to focusing on project execution, we also continue to proactively manage our cost structure through existing initiatives to help ensure we stay competitive through the macro commodity cycle.", "During the quarter, we were pleased with our order intake given our recent award by Woodside for the Greater Western Flank Phase 2 project Western Australia which will utilize our new flagship vessel, the DLV 2000. In addition, we were awarded a large offshore fast-track pipeline related EPCI project in the Middle East. More recently, in April, we were awarded three separate projects as well as an increase in scope of work on an existing contract for a major national oil company in the Arabian Gulf. These awards demonstrate our extensive knowledge and experience in the Middle East where we continue to provide high efficient solutions that meet our customers production project needs.", "Our results also reflected excellence in project execution through the successful completion of the complex PB Litoral project during the quarter, ahead of the agreed upon schedule. And progress on the INPEX Ichthys project which continues to remain on schedule. With excellence in project execution demonstrated on Ichthys, coupled with the recent Woodside award, we expect to maintain our leadership position in the Australian subsea market.", "Regarding health, safety, environment and security, we continue to lead the industry throughout our operations with our injury rates at an all time low. We have achieved these results by implementing our taking the (03:59) HSCS program and continuing to build upon our longstanding safety culture. As we closed the quarter, we had close to 90% of our remaining 2016 expected revenue and backlog with continued bidding activity in our core markets and a steady level of opportunities in our revenue pipeline. Following the quarter, in April, we were very pleased to host a naming ceremony for our new world-class flagship vessel, the DLV 2000.", "We believe the DLV 2000's high end capabilities will allow us to undertake projects efficiently in remote areas with its versatile construction capabilities and fast transit speeds, therefore opening an even larger market for McDermott. Delivery of this vessel is anticipated in May 2016. The DLV 2000 has already secured work as part of the scope of the INPEX Ichthys project, as well as the new award, the Woodside Greater Western Flank Phase 2 project.", "In addition I had the pleasure of opening our new office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia last month, with many of our customers and local officials attending to support this important event. Our move from Singapore to Malaysia will help us to better align geographically with our established customers, suppliers and partners as we grow our presence in the Asian market.", "Now I'd like to provide an operational update. In Americas, Europe and Africa area the first gas an introduction of crude marked the successful operational completion of the PB Litoral project. Demonstrating to PEMEX and others our ability to deliver on complex projects in Mexico and positioning us to take a leadership role in that country as energy reform impacts the local market. The completion of this legacy project which improved its loss position approximately 35% since the end of 2014 is an important milestone for McDermott and exemplifies the culture change that the company has gone through over the last two years, both operationally and financially.", "Also in Mexico, fabrication continued on the PEMEX 7,500 ton Ayatsil C jacket, with significant progress on the build and assembly work. Unexpectedly in early April, PEMEX issued a notification to temporarily suspend the Ayatsil C project for 120 days to allow for assessment of the overall Ayatsil field infrastructure sequencing requirements. We are working with PEMEX to develop the best solution for the project, including timing of completion of the fabrication work as we also continue to further build upon our strong relationship with them.", "We are pleased to report that we successfully collected over $100 million in receivables from PEMEX during the first quarter of 2016, most of which was overdue as a result of PEMEX unilaterally extending its payment terms to suppliers in the fourth quarter of 2015. In Brazil the Agile charter has being continuing to deliver to Petrobras with over 3 million man-hours without a lost time incident. However, in April Petrobras notified us that it was terminating the contract effective in May of this year as a result of the non-renewal of the Charter Authorization Certificate.", "We are working with Petrobras now to close out the contract. With the completion of this contract in May and the successful completion of the PB Litoral this quarter, McDermott will no longer have any remaining legacy loss projects. You may remember that when I joined McDermott we had 10 legacy loss projects. We are extremely pleased to have the legacy loss portfolio behind us and marked the completion of the final chapter in our turnaround.", "In the Gulf of Mexico, we landed two new orders, both securing work for the DB50 deepwater heavy lift vessel which was also used to successfully and efficiently complete the installation work on the Exxon Julia project during the quarter. In addition we completed the inaugural pipe spilling from McDermott's new spill base in Gulfport, Mississippi for the LLOG Otis pipeline during the quarter and then April we completed the installation scope.", "We are pleased with the strong and efficient execution of the LLOG Otis project which we believe has positioned us for success for other future relay (09:14) projects and is the foundation for establishing a leadership position in the Gulf of Mexico subsea tieback market.", "In the Middle East, our bidding activity remains high, as we continue to focus on potential brownfield projects in an area where we see national oil companies with capital available to invest. The first quarter award of a large pipeline-related EPCI project that is scheduled to complete this year is another strong indicator of our competitive position in the Middle East market, drawing upon our end market fully integrated EPCI capabilities and assets to provide flexibility and schedule certainty.", "In addition, the Middle East operations continue to deliver industry leading safety performance, underpinned by our focus on injury prevention programs with over 34 million man-hours without a lost time incident. We continue performance excellence in our Middle East area is reflected in the Saudi Aramco lump sum project under the LTA II which achieved a fabrication start milestone ahead of schedule during the quarter. Our 12 jackets projects also with Saudi Aramco achieved the completion, load-out and installation of six jackets on schedule during the first quarter.", "The Middle East also continued operations on the Marjan project, with a record setting scope of laying 55 miles of unspliced cable utilizing two marine vessels simultaneously in opposite directions in varying depths. We expect to have significant activity in the Middle East going into 2017 with the recent award of three separate projects and additional scope of work to an existing contract also with a national oil company in the Arabian Gulf. With our order intake and extensive project portfolio, we continue to maintain our leading position in the Middle East.", "In our Asia-Pacific area, the INPEX Ichthys project continued to execute successfully throughout the quarter, completing daily operations, installing all the lifted subsea facilities and commencing on the installation of mooring chains with our subcontractor on the project Heerema. At the end of April, Heerema completed their work on the Ichthys project. This marks the end of their 18-month marine campaign on this project and we would like to recognize their exceptional performance in completing this challenging work. They have been a great partner and we look forward to working with them on future projects. In addition on Ichthys project, the CSV 108 worked steadily throughout the quarter on pipeline pre-commissioning activities and stabilization work, and we completed the major scope of fabrication activities in our Batam yard. Our work on this unparalleled subsea project also recently achieved 15 million man-hours, without a lost time incident.", "Focusing on utilization in Asia. Fabrication work continued to progress on schedule in the Batam yard for the 18,000 tons of modules for the Yamal LNG project. During the quarter, we began work on the ONGC Vashishta project, with engineering and orders for long lead items placed, as well as completion of the pre-engineering onshore survey. Also in the Asia-Pacific area, we were awarded a traditional transportation and installation contract in Malaysia for the Hess Petroleum Begarding project which began in the second quarter of 2016 and is utilizing the DB30. We were also very pleased with the award of a large transportation and installation contract during the quarter, the Woodside Greater Western Flank Phase 2 project. This award demonstrates how our vertically integrated operations can maximize quality and efficiency for our customers and is expected to utilize the capabilities of our new flagship vessel the DLV 2000.", "We have an established record in Australia for executing complex projects successfully. And with the Woodside award during the quarter we continue to maintain our leadership presence in the country's subsea market.", "Looking forward, we will continue to remain focused on our customer relationships. We believe we are well positioned to be resilient in this uncertain macro environment, given our anticipated steady revenue opportunity pipeline and our continued focus on brownfield offshore EPCI projects in markets where capital is available for investment. Moreover, we believe we are positioned for success given our excellence in project execution, strong balance sheet, new cost improvement culture and growing capabilities and competencies.", "With that, I would like to turn over the call to Stuart Spence, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for a review of our financials.", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone.", "Before I give you a detailed account of our financial results, I would like to provide some recent financial highlights. First our demonstrated operational excellence in the first quarter resulted in operational profitability on an adjusted basis for all of our areas. We were very pleased to successfully close out the PB Litoral project, thereby achieving a key derisking milestone for the company's project portfolio. Also in the quarter, Petrobras notified us that they intended to terminate the Agile vessel charter contract in May of this year. Given the lack of opportunities for this vessel and our current revenue pipeline we recorded an impairment loss of $32 million. The end of this contract, along with the successful completion of the PB Litoral project, will close out our legacy loss project portfolio.", "Also we completed an amendment of our credit facility which replaced the minimum EBITDA requirement with what we believe is a more conventional covenant package compromised (sic) [comprised] of two leverage ratios and a fixed charge coverage ratio and reduce certain reporting requirements to the credit agreement lenders. We are also seeking consent from our existing term lenders to extend the maturity date of the letter of credit facility, increase the baskets for purchased money indebtedness, acquisitions and the purchase of junior priority debt and also extend the window to mortgage the DLV 2000 by one year to allow the company to consider potential financing options.", "These terms would be effective only if we receive the necessary consent to satisfy the conditions to closing on or before June 30, 2016. And we are currently still in the negotiation process for those consents. Furthermore, in April, we were able to enter into an unsecured and uncommitted bilateral letter of credit agreement for approximately $100 million with a Middle East bank.", "Now turning to our detailed financial results. First I will start with our performance in the first quarter then I will go over our CapEx spend followed by our backlog and current bid pipeline, as well as an update on our cost savings initiative. Last, I will discuss our updated 2016 guidance. In addition to our GAAP reporting, we are also reporting certain adjusted financial information, net of what we believe to be onetime items but we believe these provide a helpful understanding of the underlying performance and drivers of our business.", "Regarding our first quarter 2016 results, revenues were $729 million, up $62 million or 9% over the sequential quarter and up $178 million or 32% from first quarter 2015 revenues of $551 million, driven by projects in both our Asia and Middle East areas. In Asia, the INPEX Ichthys project provided approximately $351 million of revenue with a significant level of activity occurring with our installation subcontractor, Heerema. In the Middle East, two large Saudi Aramco projects being 12 jackets and the Marjan power supply replacement were the primary contributors.", "Our continued efforts to concentrate on successful project execution and cost reductions have resulted in an operationally profitable quarter and a significant increase in operating margin year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Adjusted operating income totaled $75 million during the quarter with an adjusted operating margin of 10%, excluding the $32 million impairment of our Agile vessel and $6 million of restructuring expense. The continued improvement in our operating income was positively impacted by progress on the INPEX Ichthys project which continues to remain on schedule, the successful completion of the PB Litoral project ahead of the agreed upon schedule and the offshore operations progressing well on the Saudi Aramco 12 jackets project with the installation of six jackets this quarter. We also continue this quarter to execute profitably on projects throughout the overall company portfolio, driving the growth in our operating income.", "Operating income includes overhead under-absorption of approximately $26 million for the first quarter of 2016. This under-absorption is a result of project sequencing and is primarily driven by our Altamira yard in Mexico, as well as a number of specific vessels in our offshore and subsea fleet. Considering the continued challenging environment, utilization of our vessels and yards will remain an area of focus in 2016. And we will continue to pursue our fabrication-only strategy to maximize utilization of our yards.", "Cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2016 was $59 million, a slight reduction compared to cash provided by operating activities of $61 million in the sequential quarter and an increase of $78 million compared to cash used by operating activities of $19 million in the first quarter of 2016. We successfully collected over $100 million in receivables from PEMEX during the first quarter of 2016, most of which was overdue as a result of PEMEX unilaterally extending its payment terms to suppliers in the fourth quarter of 2015.", "As of the end of the first quarter 2016, we had approximately $22 million of overdue amounts form 2015 still outstanding from PEMEX which we expect to collect during the second quarter of 2016. There was an additional amount of approximately $46 million at the end of March for 2016 progress and change orders.", "Moving to the balance sheet. At March 31, 2016, we reported $798 million in cash and restricted cash, an increase in total cash from December 31, 2015, of $16 million. This is driven by $59 million of cash flow provided by operations offset by $32 million of capital expenditures and debt repayments of $5 million. The successful collection of our overdue PEMEX receivables also contributed to the improvement in our cash balance.", "Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $32 million which includes $7 million of capitalized interest. The key driver of our CapEx continues to be the DLV 2000. As David mentioned we hosted the naming ceremony for the DLV 2000 on April 14 and anticipate to receive delivery of the vessel later this month.", "We had approximately $15 million in CapEx payments for the DLV 2000 in first quarter of 2016. Our final payment to capital of $124 million will be made upon the expected delivery of the vessel. Also we plan for CapEx payments related to the DLV 2000 of $19 million in the second quarter and $31 million in the third quarter associated with payments to other vendors used in the construction of the vessel. We still anticipate our total expected spend on the vessel to be approximately $432 million excluding capitalized interest. The remaining amount of $10 million of CapEx was associated with the upgrade to the CSV 108 to install vertical lay and reel deployment systems and project-related items and maintenance.", "Before we move to our order intake results, I want to draw your attention to the additional category we recently created to describe our order size which we have termed substantial. The substantial category represents orders between $500 million and $750 million which were previously a part of our significant category. We believe this change will help to provide additional visibility for our order intake and revenue pipeline.", "Turning back to the quarter results. We reported a backlog of approximately $3.8 billion at the end of March; of which approximately 71% is related to our offshore operations and approximately 29% is related to our subsea operations. Bookings in the first quarter totaled $339 million, driven primarily by the Greater Western Flank Phase 2 award from Woodside and the fast-track pipeline-related EPCI award in the Middle East. These bookings were partially offset by $38 million related to the termination of the Agile charter by Petrobras. Of the $3.8 billion of backlog, we currently expect $1.8 billion to roll off in the remaining quarters in 2016, $1.5 billion in 2017, and $0.5 billion in 2018.", "The INPEX Ichthys project makes up approximately $550 million of our backlog. $470 million of which is expected to roll off in the remaining quarters of 2016 and the Saudi Aramco LTA II Lump Sum project makes up approximately $1.4 billion of backlog, $245 million expected to roll off in the remaining quarters of 2016 and $870 million in 2017. With the recent awards in April of the three separate projects and additional scope on an existing contract, we will add approximately $610 million to our backlog with $90 million backlog expected to roll off in the remaining quarters of 2016 and $520 million expected in 2017.", "Our bids and change orders outstanding at quarter end were $4.7 billion, an increase compared to $4.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter 2015. Of our March 31, 2016, revenue pipeline, approximately 85% of our outstanding bids and change orders relate to our offshore operations. Our list of target projects total $13.7 billion as of March 31, 2016, compared to $15.2 billion as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in target project is primarily due to the shift of some of our targets to bids without the immediate back-filling of the pipeline.", "As a reminder, targets of those projects that we intend to bid on and expect will be awarded to us or our competitor in the next five quarters. Approximately 69% of the value of our target projects relate to offshore operations. As of March 31, 2016, the combination of our backlog, bids and change orders outstanding and target projects which make up our potential revenue pipeline total $22.2 billion, a slight reduction from the $23.8 billion as of December 31, 2015. Bids and backlog remain relatively steady with the reduction in the revenue pipeline, driven by a decrease in targets. Additional information on the breakdown by project type, region and work scope of those various items has been provided in the supplemental presentation on our website.", "Turning to our cost restructuring programs. Our McDermott Profitability Initiative, or MPI program, which we initiated at the end of 2014 to reduce our overall cost structure and address our fixed cost, is expected to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of 2016, Upon the completion of the move of remaining resources from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur as well as some additional sourcing initiatives. We still anticipate gross annual cash savings in 2016 of $150 million as a result of MPI, consistent with our previous projections.", "As a reminder, we have been able to retain a portion of these savings within the business but have also passed a substantial portion on to our customers. Also we initiated the Additional Overhead Reduction, or AOR program, in the fourth quarter of 2015, in an effort to further address fixed costs, without impacting the capabilities and capacity potential of the company.", "During the first quarter of 2016, our continued cost focus generated additional opportunities within the AOR program, and we now expect the initiatives to be substantially complete by the end of the third quarter of 2016, resulting in expected in-year cash savings of $45 million for 2016 and a $35 million benefit to our current year income statement. This is an improvement from the $25 million of 2016 in-year cash savings we originally anticipated. We expect total restructuring cost to be approximately $15 million in 2016, for both MPI and AOR.", "During the yearend 2015 earnings call, we provided guidance related to several 2016 financial measures. We have updated this guidance to reflect the impacts of project sequencing, improvements in projects recently completed, additional saving from cost reduction programs, and the Agile charter termination, along with our overall view given current market conditions and the status of our operations. Our new guidance reflects expected revenues of approximately $2.7 billion for the full year 2016, slightly down from our initial guidance of approximately $2.9 billion.", "This decrease is primarily driven by customer-agreed project sequencing. As a result of various close-out improvements in some of our recently completed projects, as well as additional cost savings expected from our AOR program, we now anticipate operating income to be approximately $155 million on an adjusted basis, excluding a $32 million impairment loss and a $15 million of restructuring charges which includes an increase of $5 million from our initial guidance.", "Our adjusted operating income guidance is weighted towards the first three quarters with an expected decline in the fourth quarter due to anticipated project timing. Also we have updated our guidance to reflect a reclassification of our income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates excluding it from operating income. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $245 million and has been updated to reflect the expected increase in operating income, partially offset due to a decrease in depreciation expense not included in EBITDA and an increase in other expense items not included in operating income.", "For the full year 2016, we have decreased our estimated guidance for net interest expense to reflect the increase in capitalized interest related to the adjusted timing of the delivery of the DLV 2000 in the second quarter of 2016. We now anticipate approximately $73 million of gross interest expense with $60 million of that being in cash and the other $13 million to be debt issuance cost amortization. And we now expect capitalized interest of approximately $13 million which we will be including in our CapEx.", "We expect taxes to be $60 million which is slightly higher than our initial guidance given our expected increase in operating income in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result of the changes I just mentioned, we are increasing our expected adjusted net income and earnings per share to be approximately $18 million and $0.06 respectively. Capital expenditures to complete the DLV 2000 are still expected to be $189 million in 2016, excluding capitalized interest. We also expect to spend approximately $21 million completing the CSV 108 vertical lay and reel deployment systems in 2016 and approximately $42 million during the year for other remaining maintenance and project-related expenditures while maintaining the capabilities and reliability of our assets.", "We also anticipate having approximately $590 million in cash and restricted cash and $840 million in gross debt at the end of the 2016, with expected free cash flow to be approximately negative $150 million. A reminder that a majority of the negative cash flow is due to the $189 million of CapEx related to the DLV 2000 in 2016. Our guidance is based on our current view of the business outlook. However, given the challenges in the current macro commodity environment, we may see pressure from potential CapEx spending delays by our customers, increased pricing constraints given supply excess in certain markets and our own lower utilization. For now, we intend to concentrate on what we can control which includes continued focus on our highest value proposition opportunities, strong execution of our existing backlog, customer alignment and focus on our utilization and cost management. Also as a reminder the supplemental slide deck available on our website provides additional financial information.", "Now I would like to turn the call back over to David.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you Stuart.", "To recap McDermott has had a good quarter highlighted by quality operational performance and positive financial results. The successful completion of LLOG Otis project using our new spoolbase in Gulfport demonstrates the additional capabilities of our North Ocean 105 vessel. And we believe it positions us for success on other re-lay projects in the Gulf of Mexico. The LLOG Otis project is also another example of the new McDermott way of executing projects.", "While the pattern of awards can be uneven throughout the year, our strong customer relationships and focus on markets where capital is still being invested, gives us confidence to believe in our ability to secure a sufficient order intake over the balance of 2016.", "In addition, the incremental impact of our recent Q2 awards increases our expected 2017 backlog roll-off to over $2 billion. We also believe our core capabilities and competences will be further strengthened once our anticipated new flagship vessel, the DLV 2000, is placed into service. In closing while there is continued volatility in the market, we are still confident in our ability to navigate this complex macro environment given our ability to successfully execute projects and to secure additional order intake.", "With that, I would now like to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Tucker from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hi. Good evening and congrats on a nice quarter.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks Matt.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "I wanted ask about the guidance. And if you could comment on how your expectations for the balance of the year have changed versus the initial guidance? And would it be fair to say that the first quarter was a bit stronger than you expected but your outlook for the rest of the year is a bit lighter, or would I be misreading that?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Matt, our first quarter results exceeded our expectations based on the factors that we outlined which are really all centered around operational excellence. As we look at the balance of the year, due to the certain project sequencing, I think we're now looking at a lower fourth quarter than we had originally planned but we still see a very strong Q2 and Q3 leading through this year.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. And then could you just clarify on the reclassification of the $10 million in income loss from consolidated affiliates. Does that serve to increase or decrease the guidance?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That increased the guidance for our operating income, our original guidance but it's still a negative for the year so it really \u2013 it was unaffected. It did not affect the net income projections in the original guidance.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it, okay. And then on the Agile, could you provide a little more color on why the contract was terminated and then what are your plans for that vessel now?", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So as we said on the call, Matt \u2013 it is David here \u2013 so a little bit color. This was a charter agreement which was to continue until April of 2017 due to the situation in Brazil with Petrobras. It's clear that there is now an oversupply on that PLSV market. The Agile is one of the longer serving PLSVs and one which was not Brazilian flagged and you may have heard there was some talk in the market about priority to Brazilian flagged vessels which the Agile is not. So unexpectedly, Petrobras was then forced into position to terminate this contract earlier than scheduled. At this moment in time, we do not see opportunities within the current revenue pipeline prospects that we see ahead and hence we have decided to take the impairment on the asset at this time.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "I guess does that mean that you dry docked the vessel or could you still look to deploy it on projects even though you don't maybe see opportunities right now?", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So there could be opportunities to put them onto further projects, but at this time, our focus is to complete the scope for Petrobras, demobilize the asset from Brazil and take her to a port which we haven't decided yet. And during that time, we will obviously evaluate any opportunities to put her to work on where there is existing projects or where there are opportunities out there but because we can't see anything at this time, that's why we decided to take the impairment.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Understood. And then just last question. It seems that you're off to a great start in the second quarter in terms of these Middle Eastern awards and also adding to the backlog for 2017. Could you comment on the bidding pipeline: a, for adding to your haul here in the second quarter and then also just adding to the backlog for 2017 as you look throughout the rest of the year?", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "First, to give a general high level, we still have a good level of bidding activity particularly in the Middle East. And we've obviously said that for some time, but we do see opportunities outside the Middle East and we'd expect to be bidding on contracts in areas such as Mexico, India and some other locations as we get through 2016.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Martin Malloy from Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.", "Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good afternoon.", "Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Congratulations on the quarter. I want to ask maybe in the Middle East, it seems like a lot of the work that you've been winning is also Saudi Arabia. Could you talk about maybe opportunities for some other countries in the Middle East in particular for Qatar?", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, Marty, so I think we've said before is obviously there's always a lot of talk around Saudi Arabia but what we can see in some of the bids that we have outstanding today and some of the bids that we have ongoing are for Qatar mainly for \u2013 to bring on new infrastructure and new wells to support their existing LNG infrastructure. So we've seen some opportunities come up there. And we would expect both the national oil and gas companies in Qatar to move with some projects during 2016.", "Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then with respect to the io joint venture, could you maybe give us an update there and perhaps I don't know if you can provide any guidance in terms of timing of when there might be something press releasable in terms of an award there, or if you're bidding on projects right now?", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think so Martin, we had some news on io some few weeks ago regarding some activity that we have ongoing with a major customer. A lot of the work that we're working with io today with customers is very much on a confidential basis which limits obviously the amount of information we can put out to the market. Bearing in mind that io is a real front end consulting company, so it's working with our customers to help them develop concept and financial models that allow our customers to take projects to the next stage. So that prevents us from talking about some of the prospects that we're working with on io.", "Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Levine from Imperial Capital. Your line is now open.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Hey. Good afternoon, guys.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good afternoon.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "So with regards to this drop-off in the fourth quarter, I know you don't give quarterly guidance but it does seem like it's kind of level Q1 through Q3. Is the drop off in the fourth quarter associated with the projects sequencing that you referred to and would that also suggest that you \u2013 that is a revenue push effectively into early 2017 where you'd see a benefit or am I not understanding the change there correctly?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "This is Stuart. So as we look at the balance of the year and working with our customers on their project schedules, we have seen some sequencing that has pushed activity from the fourth quarter of this year out into 2017. So it's a kind of a slippage or a timing aspect for us. Additionally, in our markets, we do have some seasonality. In Australia, we have the cyclone season. And in the Middle East, we have the beginning of the high wind season. So there is also some seasonality factors that are impacting project sequencing.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got it, okay. So that pushes maybe into the early \u2013 is the $200 million reduction effectively expected to be recovered in 2017. Is that what you said?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, we would expect a portion of that, if not all of that, to be recovered during the year 2017.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got it, great. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, if you could just give us a sense of \u2013 I know we did your covenants as part of the amendments to your credit facility. Could you give where your credit statistics into the quarter relative to where the new covenants are set?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. If you look at our supplemental deck that we post on our website, we've included a page there that shows all of our new credit metrics and how we are performing against them, so for an example if we were to look at our senior debt to EBITDA, the maximum that we're allowed is 2x at the end of Q1, we were just under 1x. And that's a similar trend to all of our metrics. So I think we're performing very well against them. And I think we have substantial or significant headroom within these new covenants.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got it. Thanks, Stuart.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz, Citigroup. Your line is now open.", "Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, guys. Good evening. It's Alan Fleming. How are you?", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Alan.", "Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Stuart, maybe you can give us a little bit more detail on the types of opportunities that you're seeing to generate the additional savings under the AOR program. It seems like you've more than doubled the savings that really aren't spending that much more to capture the benefit. So I'm just curious, what are some of the examples of opportunities there? And is there the potential that you could kind of go after more?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Alan. So as we've gone through the quarter, we've kind of reexamined and we looked at some of the head count reductions that we're kind of forced to make in this environment. And we've been able to, I think, save more around those head count reductions. Additionally, we've also looked at some additional operational-type savings around some of our supply chain initiatives. And we're seeing some excess supply in our supply chain. And so we're pushing harder to make some more savings there. I think as we look at the balance of 2016, our supply chain is going to continue to be a significant focus area for us. We're under significant pressure from our customers to pass through supply chain deflation, and we're looking to structure new agreements, new ways of working with our supply chain, to access as many savings as we can and pass savings through to our customers but also try and generate some savings for the company.", "Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, David, maybe this one's for you. This is the third quarter in a row now that you've been able to deliver at least low double-digit operating margin in the Middle East. I guess my question is can this be the new normal for you in the region with the backlog that you have and the cadence of projects and the recent awards you've won. Why can't you continue to deliver low-double digit or low teens margins in the Middle East?", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think firstly to address the operational performance, I think today our operational performance in the region is excellent. One of the challenges in the Middle East is firstly, the volatility around the project awards and then what you have from, Stuart, is obviously sequencing and timing of when we're executing some of these projects which is the result of some of these sequencing \u2013 which also has a positive \u2013 because being there and being local, being close to the customer means that we can provide the customer lots of flexibility and also versatility. So longer term, obviously I don't want to give guidance but certainly, we see this part of the world for us being an area where we should see good results as we continue to perform good results as our reputation gets stronger and obviously it's an area where we still see customers investing in capital and also that's predominantly in the brownfield as customers look to replace and replenish existing infrastructure. So we are obviously very excited and also very happy in the position that we have ourselves today in the Middle East.", "Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then maybe just one last one from me. Will there be or is there expected to be any cash impact from the termination of the Agile contract, or is it all a non-cash impairment?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Alan, this is Stuart. As we sit here today, we're looking at a non-cash impairment of $32 million.", "Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "All right. Thank you guys. Nice quarter.", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Chad, if your phone is on mute, please unmute it this time. And our next question comes from the line of Blake Hutchinson from Howard Weil. Your line is now open.", "Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil", "Good afternoon.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good afternoon.", "Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil", "I want to understand, Stuart, your commentary around the MPI and the benefits of the savings accruing to the customer a bit more than you and juxtaposing that with what we see today. I think back at your Analyst Day, you mentioned that as we see a legacy contract like Ichthys dominate the revenue stream, the margins that are reflected \u2013 we are actually seeing some benefit of the MPI in some of these near-term projects or legacy projects and that will tend to dissipate as we switch over to something like the LTA II dominating the revenue stream. Is that still the appropriate way to look at \u2013 think about some of the margins differentials as we go forward?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Blake, that's broadly correct. There's obviously a different balance per contract. And as we take on new contracts, we're very careful to try and reduce our exposure to supply chain or commodity price fluctuations. So lot of orders are placed at the front of the contract. But as we're going through the contract, depending on the mix of third-party services or products that we have to use, we are working with our supply chain to capture as much deflation as we can but also additionally we are fundamentally transforming the way that we engage with our supply chain. We're looking at how we work closer with them, how we collaborate with them, how we work on a global basis as opposed to a project basis. And in that way, we're trying to find win-win for our supply chain for McDermott and also for our customer.", "Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil", "Great. That's helpful. And then just one point of clarification. The $4.7 billion figure for bids outstanding at the end of the quarter, that does include the two q awards or does not include the two q awards?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That number of $4.7 billion does include the two award \u2013 or the contract awards that we announced with this press release, yes.", "Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil", "Okay. That's very helpful. And I just wanted \u2013 a note of thanks. I think this iteration of overall disclosure was excellent this quarter, so thank you very much.", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", ". And I'm showing no further questions.

These forward-looking comments are subject to various risks, contingencies and uncertainties and reflect management's view as of today, July 26, 2016. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which provide a discussion of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations. Please note that, except to the extent required by applicable law, McDermott undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn the call over to David Dickson, McDermott's President and Chief Executive Officer, for opening remarks.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. As our results reflect, our excellence in project execution has resulted in a favorable quarter as demonstrated by our profitability and improvement in operating margins. Notably, we secured an exceptional order intake during the quarter, which drove substantial backlog growth and provided a solid foundation for 2017 revenue.", "We were pleased to be awarded the Abkatun-A2 project, which is our largest value and size to-date project with Pemex. The platform will be located in Mexico's Bay of Campeche in 124 feet of water, and is expected to provide replacement and expansion capabilities to existing facilities. This award is a result of our customer-centric strategy to build a vertically integrated local solution in Mexico, utilizing our local project management and engineering teams in our top-tier Altamira facility, and builds upon the success of the PB Litoral project.", "Also making a significant contribution to our backlog in the second quarter was the award of three large projects under our LTA II agreement with Saudi Aramco, which were previously announced. Our highly efficient, vertically integrated solution as well as our in-depth knowledge and experience in the Middle East played an important role in securing these awards.", "In June, we secured the 2017 scope under the multi-year transportation and installation contract with Brunei Shell Petroleum in our Asia area. The customer confidence built during our last year's campaign with BSP was important to winning additional work and continues to expand our position in the Brunei market.", "During the quarter, we took delivery of our flagship vessel, the DLV 2000, from Keppel, which was immediately mobilized on the INPEX Ichthys project. The vessel has executed exceptionally well so far, and recently lifted one of the industry's largest pipeline tie-in scopes. With the vessel now operational, we see the strength and flexibility she brings for us for the offshore and subsea market.", "Turning to health, safety, environment and security, I am pleased to report this quarter mark the achievement of 35 million man-hours lost time incident free in our Batam yard, and also 35 million man-hours lost time incident free in our Middle East area. Both of these demonstrate our continued focus on health and safety. Our Taking the Lead program builds upon our long-standing safety culture and has resulted in continued industry-leading health and safety metrics.", "Now, let me provide an operational update. In the Americas, Europe and Africa area, we resumed work during the quarter on the Ayatsil C project, which was previously suspended by Pemex to allow for assessment of the overall Ayatsil field infrastructure sequencing requirements. We are now focusing on fabrication of the jacket and plan for installation in fourth quarter of 2016. We believe our strong customer relationship will continue to position us to take a leadership role in Mexico, as energy reform continues to impact the country.", "In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we successfully completed the Jack/St. Malo Phase 2 project, utilizing our DB 50 and the North Ocean 102. We also completed the installation scope on the LLOG Otis project this quarter, with the first installation of a steel catenary riser by our North Ocean 105. Both of these projects utilized our spoolbase in Gulfport, Mississippi, demonstrating its capabilities and providing a foundation for future work. Building upon our recent successes, we continue to see pipeline subsea tieback opportunities in the area.", "In the Middle East area, the last remaining jacket on the Twelve Jackets project was completed during the quarter and is now ready for load-out and installation, which is expected to meet the customer's revised timing. Fabrication activity on the Saudi Aramco LTA-II Lump Sum project also continues ramping up. In addition, the fast-track pipeline related EPCI project that was awarded in the first quarter also continues to make progress offshore. The North Field Alpha jacket for Qatar Petroleum was installed this quarter along with the associated umbilical and final handover to the customer.", "Recently, we also entered into an exclusive co-operation agreement with N-KOM, a world-class fabrication facility in Qatar, to pursue EPCI projects within Qatari waters, utilizing MacDermott's proven experience and execution in the country. We believe this agreement will increase our ability to deliver local, integrated solutions in Qatar, and provide us with an even higher level of capacity and availability to address growth in the Middle East market.", "In Asia, the INPEX Ichthys project remains on schedule. Heerema completed their work on the project in April and the CSV 108 commenced her third campaign, carrying out various subsea construction activities in the month of June. Also on the Ichthys project, the DLV 2000 recently completed four major lifts.", "In the Batam fabrication yard, we expect the first set of modules on the Yamal LNG project to be ready for shipment on schedule in the third quarter of 2016 with fabrication on the FMC Jangkrik project in the same yard also expected to be on schedule.", "Our joint venture in China, QMW, recently completed fabrication of their largest LNG fabrication project to-date. The successful completion of this fast-track project demonstrates the first-class capabilities of the QMW fabrication facility.", "We have made significant progress in engineering and procurement on ONGC Vashishta project. Fabrication with our partner is now expected to commence ahead of schedule. We see substantial potential in the deepwater market in East India, and I believe that Vashishta project positions us for success.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart Spence, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for a review of our financials.", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share with you that we were again profitable this quarter, and our continued focus on customer relationships and operational effectiveness has paid off with a substantial growth in backlog this quarter. The backlog improvement was primarily due to the Pemex Abkatun-A2 award in Mexico, and the award of three large Saudi Aramco projects in the Middle East.", "Also, during the quarter, we completed all the conditions to the amendment of our credit agreement, resulting in an extension of the LC Facility maturity date from April 2017 to early 2019, and an increase in certain spending basket capacity in addition to the previously effective changes to our debt covenant ratios. As a part of obtaining term lender consents in this process, we also prepaid $75 million of our Term Loan B and increased the annual interest rate by 300 basis points. Completing these amendments has not only resulted in McDermott having, what we believe, a more conventional credit covenant, but it has also provided greater certainty around our debt and credit structure through early 2019.", "Turning back now to our more detailed financial results, I would like to remind you that, in addition to our GAAP reporting, we're also reporting certain adjusted financial information, net of, what we believe to be, one-time items, as we believe these provide a helpful understanding of the underlying performance and drivers of our business.", "Our second quarter 2016 results included revenues of $707 million, compared to $729 million for the first quarter of 2016, and $1 billion for the second quarter of 2015. Our Asia and Middle East areas continued to contribute significantly to revenue in the second quarter. The INPEX Ichthys project provided $236 million of revenue in Asia, while in the Middle East, the Saudi Aramco LTA II Lump Sum and Marjan GOSP projects resulted in a combined $107 million contribution to revenue. Year-over-year, significant marine activity on the Ichthys project in 2015 by our subcontractor Heerema that did not recur in the second quarter of 2016 drove the decrease.", "We continue to improve operating margins through successful project execution. Operating income was $57 million during the quarter, and adjusted operating income totaled $59 million, excluding $2 million of restructuring charges. Our operating margin, both on an unadjusted and adjusted basis, was 8%, an increase of 3% on an unadjusted basis, and 2% on an adjusted basis year-over-year. These increases primarily resulted from change orders and productivity improvements across several of our projects in all areas.", "Operating income includes a $21 million impact of overhead under-absorption in the second quarter of 2016. This under-absorption is primarily driven by the utilization in our fabrication yards, specifically Altamira and Batam. Looking forward, the Pemex Abkatun-A2 is expected to provide utilization for our Altamira yard, while we continue to focus on prospects for the Batam yard.", "Offshore and subsea vessel utilization both increased this quarter, primarily due to project sequencing, which resulted in active marine campaigns across all areas.", "Cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter of 2016 was $17 million, a reduction compared to cash provided by operating activities of $59 million in the sequential quarter and an increase compared to cash used by operating activities of $8 million in the second quarter of 2015. Positive operating cash flow was primarily due to steady collections in the Middle East. In the Americas, we continue to see delays in payments from Pemex. As of the end of the quarter, we still had approximately $20 million of unbilled amounts related to 2015 activities with Pemex. We continue to work diligently with Pemex on cash collections.", "For the first half of the year, the company reported revenues of $1.4 billion compared to $1.6 billion for the comparable period in 2015. Our operating income was $93 million with a related operating margin of 6% for the first six months of 2016. On an adjusted basis, our operating income and margin were $134 million, a 9% for the same period, excluding restructuring charges of $9 million and an impairment of our Agile vessel of $32 million recorded in the first quarter of 2016.", "Our increased operating margin year-over-year is primarily a result of improved project execution and the impact of our successful cost structure initiative. Cash provided by operating activities for the first half of 2016 was $76 million compared to $26 million used in operations for the first half of 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities year-over-year was primarily driven by payments of overdue receivables from Pemex in the first quarter of 2016 and steady collections in our Middle East area.", "Moving to the balance sheet, at June 30, 2016, we reported $583 million in cash and restricted cash, a reduction of $215 million from the sequential quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by $139 million of capital expenditures primarily related to the DLV 2000 and the prepayment of $75 million made to Term Loan B holders in connection with the amendment and extension of our credit facility, partially offset by the positive cash flow from operating activities I previously discussed.", "Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $139 million, including $6 million of capitalized interest. The most significant portion of the CapEx this quarter was related to the DLV 2000. We now expect the final cost of the vessel to be $427 million, excluding capitalized interest with remaining payments of $26 million expected during 2016. This is a $5 million improvement over the estimate we provided in the last quarter. The total amount for the DLV 2000 includes $407 million of CapEx and $20 million of capitalized foreign exchange costs, which have been recorded in equity. These foreign exchange costs will be amortized consistent with the depreciation of the vessel. The remaining amount of CapEx was related to the upgrade of the CS 108 (sic) [CSV 108] to install a vertical lay and reel deployment system, project-related items and maintenance CapEx.", "Now, turning to our backlog, we reported approximately $4.4 billion at June 30, 2016, an over $500 million improvement sequentially. Approximately 80% relates to offshore operations and approximately 20% relates to our subsea operations. We had a robust order intake of $1.2 billion, primarily resulting from the Pemex Aktatun-A2 project in Americas and the award of three large projects for Saudi Aramco in the Middle East.", "Of the $4.4 billion of backlog, we currently expect $1.1 billion to roll off in the remaining quarters of 2016, $2.4 billion in 2017 and $900 million in 2018. The Saudi Aramco LTA II Lump Sum project makes up approximately $1.4 billion of our second quarter backlog, with $200 million expected to roll off in the remaining quarters of 2016 and $775 million expected in 2017. The Pemex Abkatun-A2 added approximately $454 million to backlog with $27 million expected to roll off in 2016, $239 million expected in 2017 and $188 million expected in 2018.", "Our bids and change orders outstanding at quarter-end were $4.2 billion, a decrease compared to $4.7 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2016. The movement in bids is primarily due to the significant order intake this quarter without the immediate backfill from targets. Approximately 66% of our outstanding bids and change orders relates to our offshore operations as of June 30, 2016.", "Our list of target projects totaled $12.5 billion as of June 30, 2016, compared to $13.7 billion as of March 31, 2016. Customers continue to remain cautious about their spending decisions and, as a result, we have seen a delay in backfilling of our targets. We're still actively pursuing all opportunities, where our value proposition drives competitive advantage. As a reminder, targets for those projects that we intend to bid on and we expect will be awarded to us or a competitor in the next five quarters. Approximately 69% of the value of our target projects relate to offshore operations.", "As of June 30, 2016, the combination of our backlog, bids, change orders outstanding and target projects, which make up our potential revenue pipeline, totaled $21.1 billion, a slight reduction from the $22.2 billion as of March 31, 2016. The decrease in pipeline is driven by the timing and availability of target as we continue to steadily bid prospects. Additional information on the breakdown by project type, region and work scope of those various items has been provided in the supplemental presentation on our website.", "Moving on to our cost restructuring programs, our McDermott Profitability Initiative or MPI program has been substantially completed with the move of the resources from our Asia area headquarters from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur occurring during the quarter. We still anticipate gross annual cash savings in 2016 of $150 million as a result of MPI, consistent with our previous projections.", "Also, we initiated the Additional Overhead Reduction or AOR program in the fourth quarter of 2015, which is still expected to be completed at the end of the third quarter of 2016 and is still anticipated to result in expected in-year cash savings of $45 million and a $35 million benefit to our current year income statement in 2016. We now expect total restructuring costs to be approximately $12 million in 2016 for both MPI and AOR.", "Moving to 2016 guidance, we have updated our guidance to reflect the impacts of project sequencing and improvements in projects recently completed, along with our overall view, given current market conditions, and the status of our operations. We still expect 2016 revenues to be approximately $2.7 billion, consistent with our first quarter guidance.", "As a result of several close-out improvements in some of our recently completed projects, we now anticipate operating income to be approximately $126 million, and approximately $170 million, on an adjusted basis, excluding the $32 million Agile impairment loss and approximately $12 million of restructuring charges. We do, however, expect there will be a significant decline in operating income in the third quarter, with a slight improvement in fourth quarter due to updated project timing.", "2016 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $256 million and has been updated to reflect the expected increase in operating income. We expect interest expense to remain at approximately $60 million and capitalized interest of approximately $14 million. We also expect taxes to remain at approximately $60 million, reflecting a more efficient mix of pre-tax income jurisdictions.", "As a result of the changes I just mentioned, we are decreasing our expected net loss and loss per share to be approximately $8 million and $0.03 respectively, and adjusted net income and earnings per share to be approximately $35 million and $0.12 respectively for the full year 2016.", "We now expect CapEx to be $250 million, including the DLV 2000 impacts, as mentioned before. We also expect to spend approximately $21 million in completing the CS 108 (sic) [CSV 108] vertical lay and reel deployment system in 2016. We are increasing our estimate of maintenance and project-related expenditures to approximately $52 million, an increase of $10 million from last quarter, primarily due to the investment we are making in our Altamira facility to support the Abkatun-A2 project.", "We also anticipate having approximately $505 million of cash and restricted cash, and $765 million in gross debt at the end of 2016, with expected free cash flow to be approximately negative $145 million. The reduction in cash and debt is a result of the prepayment of $75 million related to the amendment and extension of our credit facility.", "Our guidance is based on our current view of the business outlook. However, given the challenges in the current macro commodity environment, we may see pressure from continued CapEx spending delays by our customers, increased pricing constraints given supply excess in certain markets and our own lower utilization. For now, we intend to concentrate on what we can control, which includes continued focus on our highest value proposition opportunities, strong execution of our existing backlog, customer alignment and focus on our utilization and cost management.", "Also, as a reminder, the supplemental slide deck available on our website provides additional financial information including reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to comparable financial measures.", "Now, I would like to turn the call back over to David.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Stuart. Our results today clearly demonstrate another quarter of positive operational and financial results. In addition, our focus on customer interaction and strategy to deliver local, vertically integrated solutions has led to substantial order intake. As Stuart highlighted, at the end of Q2 2016, we have approximately $2.4 billion of 2017 expected revenue in our backlog, which provides a good foundation for 2017.", "Looking to the future, clearly our customers remain cautious on capital spending and commodity prices look to remain more longer than the industry first anticipated. Given this current environment, we continue to remain in close dialogue with our customers and see opportunities developing in certain countries, particularly with the national oil companies, as demonstrated by our recent award in Mexico with Pemex.", "In addition to our focus on building backlog and working closer with our customers, we continue to focus on operational effectiveness, including our focus on HSE and quality, cost management, and continue to develop our organization and talent.", "With that, I would now like to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And our first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Good evening, and nice quarter. I guess, a couple questions. One, Stuart, I think you said in the prepared remarks with regards to the outlook that now the third quarter is expected to be weaker and the fourth quarter stronger and that's a change from what you guys had said last quarter where I think the fourth quarter was supposed to be weakest. So if you could just provide some context around that?", "And then, my second question, I guess, is two-fold. It's the fourth quarter in a row we've had double-digit margins in the Middle East. And given the backlog that you have in the Middle East, why wouldn't that be sustainable?", "And then, the third question is within \u2013 I mean you got the nice Pemex win, but within Asia and the Americas, are there any material awards that could happen within the next six months that could help 2017, because I know that'll also have an impact on profitability? Thanks.", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Jamie. I'll take the first of three questions. On the outlook for the third quarter and fourth quarter, yes, we've had a significant change in various marine campaigns in all three of our areas relating to different projects and different customers. And that's driven the substantial kind of sequencing change for the second half. So, as we noted on the last quarter call, we were looking at Q4 being a substantial loss. Now, that's moved up to third quarter, and the fourth quarter has recovered nicely.", "The second question around double-digit margins in our Middle East business, we are transitioning the portfolio of projects there from completing projects to new very large and complicated projects. So as we close out some of those projects, we are achieving a higher return than what we will recognize on the new projects as we go forward in that business unit.", "And then, the third question around backlog opportunities, maybe I'll hand over to David for a general discussion of the market.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Great. Thank you.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Jamie, in that area, I mean, difficult to say what's going to happen in the next three months or the next six months. As we said in the prepared remarks, what's difficult to predict is customer timing on certain awards. Now, what I would say is that in Asia, and we've said this before is, we are seeing some activity in places such as India.", "We met again with the energy administrator of India less than two weeks ago, to again re-emphasize what is in the public is that the ONGC anticipates to spend something like $25 billion on the deepwater on the east coast of India. And as you know, we are well-positioned there ongoing with the Vashishta project and also with our relationship with Larsen & Toubro. So, we see some potential opportunities there. And not with ONGC, but we would anticipate we start to see some bids coming from some other companies that are operating in India, and in particular, Reliance.", "The other area that we see activity is, and we've been successful just recently, is with Pemex. Having the Abkatun award is excellent and one which we had focused a lot of attention on following the lessons learned that we had from PB Litoral. But also we know that, with Altamira, we have a first-class facility. We see more activity occurring in Mexico, not necessarily just with Pemex, but we're now starting to see some activity. So with that, we see opportunities on both our Asia and AEA areas that, hopefully, over the next few years, will help to create a better balance for our portfolio.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. Great. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Tucker with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Good evening. Congrats on a nice quarter.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good evening.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Just to follow up on the outlook for, I guess, second half of the year, I guess, to what extent is the stronger guidance driven by the second quarter exceeding your expectations versus a change in your second half expectations?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Matt, this is Stuart. Really, the change in guidance is purely driven by the better-than-forecast performance for our second quarter related to the productivity improvements and some close-out and also some change orders on existing contracts, and then, the rescheduling of marine campaigns in conjunction with our customers for the second half of the year.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. So I mean with respect to the kind of the third quarter and the fourth quarter and the way things have kind of shifted around there, I mean, overall is it basically a wash in terms of how that affects the second half? I'm just trying to get a little more clarity there.", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, Matt. In terms of the second half with the resequencing, it is essentially a wash from what we were previously expecting for the second half.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. And that's largely \u2013 I mean with these awards you had here in the second quarter, which were pretty significant, I mean, it looks like those largely contribute to 2017 and pretty minimally into 2016. Is that accurate?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's absolutely correct, Matt. We did highlight in the earnings discussion there that on Abkatun-A2, for example, out of $454 million of a contract, we only expect about $26 million to be recognized in the second half of this year.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. So, pretty impressive haul in terms of the awards here in this quarter. I think that the concern that sometimes comes up in this type of environment is what did you have to do to win those contracts and what's maybe the margin or risk profile. So could you just talk a little bit about the factors that led you to being victorious on winning these contracts? And how confident are you that as you get to the end of these projects that you can generate the type of margins that we've been seeing here the past couple of quarters?", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Matt. This is David. Let me take that question. So I think, obviously, the awards with Saudi Aramco, all that is under our existing LTA II, and as you know, we've been there for a long time, so we certainly know and understand our cost basis there. So I would say nothing has materially changed on how we price our work there. We're well positioned. We often talk about being vertically integrated, and it's something which puts us in a strong position in the Middle East and, in particular, with Aramco.", "In terms of the award with Pemex, this was very strategic for us. And as you know, we came through a very painful lesson learned on the PB Litoral, which after we taken the initial write-down, the project was delivered in an excellent way and was able to recover some of that as the project progressed. That has now created the new benchmark in terms of internal costing and in terms of execution. So moving into this Abkatun is that, obviously, we had a lot of confidence in terms of having both our cost basis correct and our execution method, which has been obviously validated by the bid on PB Litoral.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for the color, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our new question comes from the line of Martin Malloy with Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.", "Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon. Congratulations on the quarter.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "I was wondering if you could talk maybe a little bit more about the agreement for the local fabrication content with Keppel in Qatar? Are there specific projects that you see out there that you're interested in bidding on?", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, Marty, this has been something that's \u2013 we've been in discussion with Keppel for some time. So N-KOM was created a couple of years ago as a new facility built in Qatar primarily on the ship building side, but also to participate in the offshore EPCI space. And as you know, we have a very good relationship with Keppel. We're obviously involved with them with other things, FloaTEC historically. Obviously, we worked with them at the DLV 2000, et cetera. And that led to a conversation, we said that if you look strategically at our business in the Middle East and where potential workload has been coming from Aramco is, we need to increase our fabrication capability for the area but also to have some presence in Qatar.", "And as we look at Qatar, although we're not seeing any immediate awards, there is a lot of long-term potential in what I would call three large fields. And where those projects are, customers are getting ready to move into more the FEED stage of those. So as we look at it longer term, we see this as a means of positioning us more strategically, so that we can really participate in what could be some significant bids coming out over this next couple of years.", "Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, I have a broader industry question. We're seeing the tie-ups between Technip, FMC, OneSubsea and Subsea 7 and then GE with NOV. Can you just talk about how that might impact you and, I guess, maybe touch on your relationship with GE through the io venture and how that might be impacted?", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, I mean, obviously, a lot of discussion in the market was happening really what's been created with Technip and FMC to create this large merger. I would say that where we are positioned today is that we do have obviously a very good relationship with GE. We obviously have the formal relationship through our io business, which both companies are very happy with at this stage. But also a reminder is that we're also working with GE in other opportunities, Ophir project in Equatorial Guinea, but also working with GE, looking at other areas across the globe, where we feel that, with their technology, their equipment supply enhanced with our services, would make a good combination on some of the bids. So we have a good working relationship with GE and look forward to that to continue.", "Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Good evening, guys. Nice quarter.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good evening.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "David, can you give a little more color about the bids outstanding and target projects, the $16.7 billion you have in your pipeline? Obviously, you had a strong quarter performance in terms of bookings and it took your bids outstanding down, but you did mention that you're having some trouble backfilling your pipeline. So how concerned are you about the difficulty to backfill at this point? And is this more of a 2018 issue, given the visibility that we already have into 2017 revenue?", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think, Andy, we give the color on our revenue pipeline and I think when you see the drop-off, that's obviously reflective of the current macro environment that we're living in. This is not just a high level generic number. We take a lot of time in building this up. And we are \u2013 as I said earlier in the call, we continue to be as close as we can with our customers, looking at specific projects, which we believe we can truly participate. So I think when you see the drop-off, I think that's a reflection of just the overall macro environment. And I think, if you look at the supplemental deck, you see again is that the smaller part of it is still really from the majors, and obviously the independents. But the majority still would be, the bids are going to be coming through the national oil companies.", "And then, there's current climate. We see more awards coming from national oil companies than the majors and independents at this stage. And so, if you look at our awards more recently, particularly in this last quarter coming from both Aramco and Pemex and us preparing for some large potential bids that are going to come out from India, which are in the public domain, so, yeah, while there is a drop-off, we feel there are some good opportunities out there.", "And going back to the second question is, yeah, I think, if you look at it with $2.4 billion of revenue in the backlog for 2017 is obviously we've got a lot of focus in terms of what we do for 2018. And a lot of the bids that we're going to be bidding in this next \u2013 even the bids that are outstanding today and the bids that we're anticipating over this next six months, most of that revenue results would be executed in 2018 and onward. So, yet, it's probably more of a 2018 issue than it is a 2017 issue today.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. So, look, you already have, as you mentioned, the $2.4 billion in expected revenue for 2017. Last year at this time, you only had $1.5 billion. And you don't have any more projects in loss position. So if I want to dream the dream, is it hard to start thinking about McDermott having a more normal year in 2017? I guess what I mean is a year where utilization is not as big a concern, you do something on the order of $3 billion plus in revenue and operating margins in the high-single digits. Is it hard to dream that dream yet, David?", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think, Andy, what I would say is that it's too early for us to start talking about guidance for 2017. Obviously, we are on \u2013 we have had good success for \u2013 in terms of building the backlog for 2017. But as we've said several times, timing of customer awards is uncertain. And that's one of the biggest challenges that we have today. So a bit early for guidance and maybe something that we talk about in the next quarter.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then one more for Stuart. Stuart, you substantially completed MPI and AOR very successfully. You've obviously talked about the uncertain timing of customer investments. So if investment is still a little lower than you'd like to see, what else can you do? Is there a sort of low hanging fruit already eaten or can you do more on the cost side, if you need to?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Andy, in general, I think McDermott has done \u2013 and I talk about the general management team \u2013 an outstanding job in right-sizing our cost structure. So we've become a far more efficient organization. We are currently structured with a cost base to execute our current backlog and an expected backlog going into 2017. Should we see a kind of a drop-off in expectation of what we would hope for 2017, there are still cost levers that we can prove within the company, more, I would say, on the variable cost side than on the fixed cost side.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Good evening.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good evening.", "Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "So, I just want to circle back to your comments on cost absorption. So for the first half of this year, there is about $47 million of cost absorption, but how do we think about that in the back half of the year? And then can you talk a little bit more about where that's coming from, from a regional as well as a business line perspective?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Chad, this is Stuart. I think as we give our original guidance for 2016 at the end of 2015, we did highlight that given the portfolio that we were expecting to build and some of the concentrations that we were having, we were going to have almost double the under-absorption in 2016 versus 2015. And as we worked through the first half and as we built into our guidance for the second half, that structure still remains for us. So we're still looking at a pretty heavy under-absorption for the second half of this year. As we highlighted in our prepared remarks, fabrication in Altamira and Batam was a drag and the main contributor to our under-absorption in the second quarter.", "As we move to the back half, the under-absorption in Altamira will ultimately be taken care of late in the second half with Abkatun. We're still looking for prospects in Batam, but we're also going to see, I think, some gaps appear some of the subsea vessel schedules for the second half. So it's a kind of a same but different mix on under-absorption for the second half.", "Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Got it. That's helpful. And then, it looks like you had some favorable changes and cost estimates have stepped up significantly over the last few quarters. How sustainable is this and how should we think about this going forward?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think the \u2013 what we've done over the last kind of two years, Chad, is focus the company on execution. So after we win a project, we are focused on how can we execute as a minimum to the as-bid, but hopefully, how can we execute on a more productive or better cost position. So I think we're starting to see some of those cultural aspects come through in the execution. But I think, as we've always said over the last, kind of, year, the competitive environment in which we now operate is more competitive given the overall supply and demand dynamics. And as such, it gets harder and harder to be competitive and then beat your as-bid estimates. So we're always very cautious, I would say, on being able to predict that we over-perform our as-bid margins.", "Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good afternoon. On cash flow, can you just clarify why the cash flow guidance from operations was reduced by $10 million?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Steve, this is Stuart. Yes, we just looked at the various impacts on working capital in the second half. We have a very structured bottom-up approach, and we just had some slight timing differences on milestones and when we would expect those to be received. That resulted in the very marginal downgrade to our cash flow from operations forecast.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And since you mentioned Pemex, what are they telling you now in terms of what it will take to get paid, I think you said it was $20 million?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. With Pemex, we worked with them on essentially two fronts. The first front is what is all of the documentation and approvals required to allow us to invoice. And that's what we're working through on that $20 million from 2015. And then, once we invoice, we are finding them pretty regular on meeting their kind of payment deadlines. So we work with Pemex on both fronts. We are still very confident of the ability for Pemex to meet their receivables, and we're still very confident of them as a customer for us going forward.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. I wonder if you could give a little more color on the Ichthys project. What's the expected completion timing at this point? It looked like, from your slide, it's around 80% to 90% complete. Are there still change order opportunities left there? And if you could kind of help fill in sort of the revenue, how that was tracking in the quarter, and what you expect for the rest of the year, that would be helpful.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Steve. This is David. So, as we said in the opening remarks, the project is progressing extremely well. So we still see completion sometime in the first half of 2017, which has been consistent for some time. Most of the equipment has been delivered. We're working with our customer. Obviously, there's two floating units to be delivered into the field which we eventually will connect up the final pipelines. Are there some future change order opportunities? I would say yes, but that would be subject just to logistics and timing and changes in sequence and things like that. But overall, we are very happy with the project, and the customer is very happy with McDermott.", "And, Stuart?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, Steve. On the backlog question, so at June 30, 2016, we had approximately $370 million of backlog for INPEX Ichthys. And we would expect approximately $220 million to roll off in the second half of this year, with the balance rolling off in the first half of 2017.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. And if I could just ask one more, with your guidance suggesting that sizable ramp-down of operating profit in the second half, to what extent do you still see any opportunities to fill in the gaps, like particularly in Q3, with any sort of short-term work?", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I mean, obviously, Steve, there is always opportunity. We may see what we call some [pick]-and-burn activity, and then, obviously, that's something very difficult for us to forecast. So there are some \u2013 we \u2013 potentially, there are some opportunities, but as I said, don't have the visibility on it. And as I said, that includes [pick]-and-burn items. Typically, you get the call the day before, [normalize] them the day after, so difficult for us to forecast them.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. Thanks a lot.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Norfleet with Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open.", "Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC", "Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered, but just a couple to throw out to you all. With the final spending for the DLV 2000 coming up, obviously, it looks like the kind of heavy capital spending, non-maintenance CapEx will largely be complete. So as we look into 2017, obviously, I would expect there to be a fairly material improvement in free cash flow. And if you look over the last few years, you guys have not had a lot of breathing room on the balance sheet; you clearly do now, as a result of less spending moving forward as well as the improvements with the amended credit facilities, et cetera.", "So can you kind of discuss a little bit around capital allocation as it relates to some of the things you're thinking about in 2017 and beyond, whether it's additional debt reduction, buybacks, small acquisitions, because we really haven't been in a position to discuss capital allocations for the last couple years?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Rob, this is Stuart. As we look at capital allocation or liquidity management, we still remain very, very conservative. The macro environment still has a lot of uncertainty out there. We talk a lot about the prospects on our revenue pipeline. So until there's a very clear path out and recovery from this cycle, we're going to remain very conservative on our liquidity. Because of that, we remain focused on costs, we remain focused on working capital, and we also take a very conservative view on our capital spending. We've been spending the minimum on maintenance-related items to make sure assets are in full working order. And then the additional CapEx is mainly related around to project-specific items. And I think that's going to be our stance until we see a firm recovery from this cycle.", "Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC", "Okay. But under that scenario, would you just let cash build, or would you look at, hypothetically, if there is a significant cash build over the next 18 months, would you likely look to reduce debt? Or just build the cash?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "In the short term, Rob, our focus is on to build the cash.", "Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC", "Okay. Fair. And quickly, Stuart, last quarter, you discussed some operational-type savings around supply chain initiatives. Can you kind of give us an update on that, and just what the opportunities are, and maybe give us a little bit more meat around that?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. We continue to advance a lot of our supply chain initiatives in our general operations. So those are outside of the McDermott Profitability Initiative. So we are still moving and setting up all the structure to go from a project procurement model to a global procurement model. So we're working around master service agreements, commodities management. We're actually investing in some new IT systems to allow us to interface and manage and collaborate with our supply chain on a more real time on efficient basis. So we're progressing on our plan there. We haven't given specific detailed numbers on our target for savings, but we are finding \u2013 I would say, we are finding far more efficient ways to work with our supply chain. And within our project cost estimates, we are still getting a benefit to the new relationships.", "Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC", "Okay. Great. And lastly, David, can you just discuss \u2013 look, I know the environment, from a bidding perspective, remains very competitive. But have you seen any changes over the last six months to nine months in terms of what customers are asking for you all to do, whether it's trying to push more risk off on the contractor, which I know is always the case, but has there been any real change in the mindset from a bidding perspective?", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, there hasn't been. From the customer side, there hasn't been really \u2013 there hasn't been any what I would say any significant change. I haven't seen any more of risk being pushed into the contractors. I think the main thing that has happened is, obviously, we live in a very competitive environment and whilst we will remain disciplined in our building up our costs and our pricing is that we could anticipate that maybe some players might not be as disciplined, as people become obviously very hungry for backlog. So that's one of the things that's potentially out there, but certainly from the customer side, I haven't really seen any material change.", "Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC", "Great. That's all I have. Thanks so much.", "David Dickson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Rogers with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.", "John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations as well. Just some clarification, if I could. In terms of your most recent Pemex award, have you changed the terms or addressed the contract structure so you avoid these delays in collection? Is there anything you can do there?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, John. This is Stuart. The actual structure for the contract in terms of the milestones and the documentation and the requirements for billing remain the same as our current contracts with Pemex. As you know, Pemex moved its standard payment terms from typically 30 days or 60 days to 180 days last year. So the whole industry is adjusting to that fact. We just continue to work with Pemex to ensure that there are no hurdles to receiving approval for billings and that we meet all of the documentation requirement under the contract.", "John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "So \u2013 I mean, can you \u2013 I assume you that \u2013 you knew what these terms were as you signed the contract, so presumably priced accordingly?", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, I think \u2013 going into Pemex opportunities at the moment, we look at all of the risks and rewards associated with the potential opportunity and we price accordingly. Yes.", "John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. And then, just in terms of the $150 million on MPI program, how much of that will be incremental beyond 2016? In other words, how much have you recognized of that already? Just trying to understand the impact as we think about 2017.", "Stuart A. Spence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. The bulk of the $150 million as a run rate is now in operation, so there's little incremental run rate going into 2017. And I think, as we've said consistently, we try and benefit McDermott with some of those savings, but given the macro environment, we are passing a lot of those benefits on to the customers in the form of reduced pricing in this very competitive environment.", "John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back to Kathy Murray for closing remarks.", "Kathy Murray - Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator.

I'm pleased to report that the third quarter was another profitable quarter, as we continue to deliver on schedule our key operational milestones. Profitability this quarter was due to strong project execution and cost management, driven by the One McDermott Way. The One McDermott Way emphasizes consistency in safety, process, quality and performance across the globe and was a driver behind our own schedule milestone completions in all of our areas this quarter.", "We believe this operational performance built over the last three years positions McDermott as one of the project leaders in the markets in which we participate. Additionally, it has been a year now since we have launched our Taking the Lead QHSE program and I am very pleased to say that this has become a successful part of how we operate at McDermott.", "We continue to deliver complex and challenging projects around the globe with industry leading safety performance and Taking the Lead gives us a united brand under which we can further our success. Key to McDermott's financial success we have made significant progress in our quality performance, and, in particular, with respect to a reduction in our cost of non-quality.", "As part of Taking the Lead, our Middle East area recently achieved a notable 40-million man-hours lost time incident free and we were recently presented with an award from INPEX for our leading HSE performance with the achievement of more than 50 million hours lost time incident free over the life of the Ichthys project.", "Whilst we experienced reduced order intake this quarter, our bidding activities remained robust, especially in our offshore business. We are pleased with our overall revenue pipeline of nearly $21 billion for the quarter. We continue to see demand from Saudi Aramco, who are issuing tenders at one of the highest levels seen in recent years.", "Since the award of the Saudi Aramco LTA II in June of 2015, McDermott has maintained its market leading position. We expect Saudi Aramco to award a significant amount of new orders in the near future as well as issue a number of new projects for tender. We remain committed to maintaining our leading position in Saudi Arabia and expect to continue to broaden our local capabilities, as we build upon our existing relationship with Saudi Aramco.", "Unlike the first three quarters of the year, we did not see many awards in the marketplace in the third quarter. This is to be expected as the pattern of awards is always unpredictable and uneven due to the uncertain timing of customer investment decisions, especially driven by the last two years of this macro cycle. However, McDermott has a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 0.8x, which we view as strong, especially given a significant revenue progress recognized on Ichthys this year.", "We believe the offshore market has bottomed in the markets which we participate, and there is potential for recovery in late 2017. Deepwater subsea is still challenged with recovery expected into 2018. Regardless of the shape of the recovery in the cycle, we have a strong foundation for 2017 with $2.4 billion of our outlook 2017 revenues already in backlog.", "Now let me provide an operational update. In Americas, Europe and Africa area, we completed the fabrication of the Ayatsil-C 7,500-ton jacket for Pemex ahead of schedule, with offshore installation of the jacket expected by the end of October. Also in Mexico this quarter, we cut the first steel for the Abkatun-A2 project on schedule. Abkatun-A2 will be the first project executed under our strategic build \u2013 our vertically (06:17) integrated capabilities in Mexico.", "This strategic focus is demonstrated by the hiring of a new country director, opening of an engineering project management office in Mexico City and the buildup of our marine capabilities in Mexico. We believe our locally integrated capabilities positions us well for the energy reform in Mexico, and we look forward to the potential projects that are expected to enter the pipeline in the near future.", "Moving to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, in September, the North Ocean 102 and the North Ocean 105 were engaged in the offshore execution of Caesar Tonga II, installing 67,000-feet of umbilicals and utilizing our Gulfport Spoolbase to reel 15,000 feet of Pipe-in-Pipe, and subsequently laying the flowlines to extend the field. This recent successful completion of the Anadarko Caesar Tonga II project in early Q4, along with our execution on the LLOG Otis project and our project in Trinidad and Tobago, represent a conclusion of our first season of successful subsea pipeline projects in AEA.", "These projects include fabrication and installation of our first steel catenary riser and first high pressure Pipe-in-Pipe flowlines at our recently constructed and highly competitive spoolbase in Gulfport, Mississippi. The successful completion and experience gained from these projects leaves our AEA region poised for further success in the subsea tied back market.", "In the Middle East area, the last of the 12 Aramco jackets was installed offshore and on schedule. Fabrication activity remained high, driven by the Saudi Aramco Lump Sum LTA II and the three EPCI projects awarded by Saudi Aramco last quarter. RasGas Flow Assurance and Looping project, Marjan power system replacement project, and the Bul Hanine jackets are also progressing well and on schedule.", "We are also pleased to report the first ever steel was cut at our new Dammam yard during a customer attended ceremony in Saudi Arabia. The Dammam yard will work cohesively with our Jebel Ali yard to deliver on time to the highest standards of quality, demonstrating our One McDermott Way. The opening of this fabrication capacity In-Kingdom and the recent opening of our new Project Management and Engineering office in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia, reflect our continued commitment to invest in local solutions for our customers and are examples of delivering on our commitment through programs, such as the Saudi Aramco In-Kingdom Total Value Add plan.", "In Asia, the INPEX Ichthys project continues to progress well and in line with agreed customer schedule. Our flagship vessel, the DLV 2000, recently completed her first campaign on Ichthys alongside the CSV 108. She executed flawlessly, lifting and placing one of the world's largest 42\" diameter subsea spools, with a lift weight of 550 tons. We are also pleased to report that she successfully completed her pipelay trials and is scheduled to mobilize back to Ichthys for a second campaign, where she will install spools and subsea structures and lay infield umbilicals.", "The ONGC Vashishta project continues to achieve significant progress with procured items now beginning to arrive at the fabrication yard in Kattupalli, India, which is owned and operated by our consortium partner, Larsen & Toubro. Production welding is scheduled to start at the end of November, with completion expected by the end of the year, and preparations are well underway for the DB30 pipelay scope due to commence in the fourth quarter.", "The Yamal LNG Project is progressing well and on schedule, with the recent sail-away of the last batch of three LNG fractionation modules from QMW, our joint venture yard in China and the sail-away of the first Electrical Sub Station modules from our Batam yard. Additionally in the quarter, it was mutually and amicably decided to end the joint venture with TH Heavy Engineering Berhad, THHE. Due to current market dynamics, both companies are better positioned to manage the current cycle independently. McDermott remains committed to operating in Malaysia, as we have for more than 30 years, demonstrated by the recent move of our Asia headquarters to Kuala Lumpur.", "Moving now to a global initiative, one of our 2016 priorities was to position our engineering capability as an enabler and a differentiator through pre-FEED and FEED work. I am pleased to say that McDermott has demonstrated successful market penetration, with over 200,000 man-hours of pre-FEED and FEED work recently completed and a 100,000 man-hours presently under execution. Work in this area includes the award and kick-off of a large pre-FEED for an Arabian Gulf client involving fixed facilities, pipelines and cables, and the award of a FEED and consortium with a shipyard for a semi-submersible facility in Australian waters.", "McDermott also completed a FEED for a Caribbean gas development and continued a FEED study for a SURF facility off the coast of East Africa. A number of operators have recognized McDermott's unique FEED offering, derived from its ability to incorporate its construction and installation knowledge and skills into the FEED, especially where the FEED involves a brownfield component, an area in which McDermott is acknowledged as a market leader in the Middle East. We believe this demonstrates that some of our customers are moving into a more integrated FEED and EPCI execution model for which McDermott is well-positioned to benefit.", "Additionally, on the same subject, McDermott continued to introduce its GE partner joint venture, io oil & gas consulting, whose particular focus is on portfolio valuation, field development studies, concept selection and bringing certainty into the development of oil and gas projects that resonate in today's challenging market.", "With that, I would like to turn over the call to Stuart Spence, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for a review of our financials.", "Stuart A. Spence - McDermott International, Inc.", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning now to our more detailed financial results. I would like to remind you that in addition to our GAAP reporting, we are also reporting certain adjusted financial information net of what we believe to be one-time items, as we believe these provide a helpful understanding of the underlying performance and drivers of our business.", "Our third quarter 2016 results included revenues of $559 million, compared to $707 million for the second quarter of 2016 and $806 million for the third quarter of 2015. Our Asia and Middle East areas continued to contribute significantly to revenue in the third quarter. The INPEX Ichthys project provided $103 million of revenue in Asia this quarter. The decrease of revenue from Ichthys was mainly driven by the completion of marine activity by our subcontractor Heerema early in the second quarter. In the Middle East, Saudi Aramco LTA II Lump Sum and RasGas Flow Assurance and Looping projects resulted in a combined $202 million contribution to revenue.", "This quarter, we reported a net income of $16.1 million, or $0.06 per fully diluted share, compared to a net income of $3.7 million, or $0.01 per fully diluted share, for the prior year third quarter. The company generated third quarter 2016 adjusted net income of $25.8 million, or $0.09 per adjusted fully diluted share, excluding restructuring charges of $1.8 million and an impairment loss of $11.8 million on certain ASA marine assets and a gain of $5 million from the exit of the joint venture with TH Heavy Engineering Berhad, or THHE, that David previously mentioned.", "We are extremely pleased with the sixth quarter of positive earnings per share on an adjusted basis, especially given the magnitude of the company turnaround, in addition to the challenging macro environment faced over the last two years.", "Operating income was $43.1 million during the quarter, and adjusted operating income totaled $56.6 million, excluding restructuring charges of $1.8 million and an impairment loss of $11.8 million on certain ASA marine assets. Our operating margin was 7.7% and our adjusted operating margin was 10.1%, which represent increases of approximately 400 basis points and approximately 300 basis points, respectively, year-over-year. These increases primarily resulted from successful project execution-driven improvements, change orders driven by close customer relationships, and the full impact of our cost restructuring programs.", "Operating income includes a $13.6 million impact of our direct overhead under absorption for the third quarter of 2016. This under absorption is an improvement from the $18.7 million impact last quarter, and is due to increased utilization in our Batam and Altamira yards and cost savings in Ali yards and marine fleet. However, both offshore and subsea vessel utilizations decreased this quarter, primarily due to low utilization of the DB30 in ASA. We continued to make cost conscious decisions by ready stacking our idle assets to lower costs while keeping them prepared for immediate deployment.", "Cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter 2016, $49.8 million, an increase compared to cash provided by operating activities of $16.5 million in the sequential quarter and $20.7 million in the third quarter of 2015. Positive operating cash flow was primarily driven by steady collections in the Middle East. Cash provided by operating activities less CapEx led to a positive free cash flow of $23 million for the quarter. This was positively impacted by the completion of the majority of our capital spend plan on the DLV 2000 and CSV 108 earlier in the year.", "In the Americas, we have received all previously overdue amounts from Pemex and are currently receiving payments based upon agreed payment terms.", "For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the company reported revenues of $2 billion compared to $2.4 billion for the comparable period in 2015. We reported net income of $34.6 million, or $0.12 per fully diluted share, compared to a net income of $0.7 million, or no per share earnings, for the first nine months of 2015. For the first nine months of 2016, adjusted net income was $84.9 million, or $0.30 per fully diluted share, excluding restructuring charges of $10.7 million, impairment losses of $44.1 million and a gain of $5 million from the exit of the joint venture with THHE.", "Our operating income was $136 million during the first nine months of 2016, and adjusted operating income totaled $190.8 million, excluding restructuring charges of $10.7 million and impairment charges of $44.1 million, $11.8 million of which was recorded in the third quarter of 2016 on certain ASA marine assets, as previously mentioned, and the remaining $32.3 million recorded in the first quarter of 2016 on our Agile vessel.", "Our operating margin was 6.8% and adjusted operating margin was 9.6%, which represent increase of approximately 300 basis points on both an unadjusted and adjusted basis year-over-year. Our increased operating margin year-over-year is primarily driven by marine activity on Ichthys, Saudi Aramco Lump Sum LTA II and the RasGas Flow Assurance and Looping projects, the result of execution-driven project improvements, final closeouts, change orders driven by strong execution and customer relationships, as well as the full impact of our cost restructuring program.", "Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $125.6 million, compared to the $5.3 million used in operations for the first nine months of 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities year-over-year was primarily driven by late payments received from Pemex during the first quarter of 2016 as well as steady collections in the Middle East.", "Moving to the balance sheet. At September 30, 2016, we reported $600 million in cash and restricted cash, an increase of $17 million from the sequential quarter. This increase is attributable to the $50 million of positive cash flow from operating activities that I previously discussed, partially offset by $27 million of capital expenditures and regular debt repayments of $5 million. Our net debt, which you will find broken down on page 12 of our supplemental presentation was $170 million at quarter end.", "Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $27 million, including $1 million of capitalized interest. The most significant portions of CapEx this quarter were related to maintenance and project CapEx, as well as some remaining vendor payments for the DLV 2000 with final payments of $15 million expected during the fourth quarter. The remaining amount of CapEx was related to the installation of a vertical lay system and reel drive system to upgrade the CSV108. As a reminder, this upgrade will enable McDermott to be more competitive by eliminating the near term need for a third party vessel on the Ichthys project and increasing the capability of the vessel for future projects.", "Now turning to our backlog. We reported approximately $3.9 billion at September 30, 2016, an approximately $500 million decrease sequentially. Order intake this quarter primarily resulted from change orders. Approximately 79% of the backlog relates to offshore operations and approximately 21% relates to our Subsea operations.", "Of the $3.9 billion of backlog, we currently expect approximately $500 million to roll off in the remaining quarter of 2016, approximately $2.4 billion in 2017, and approximately $1 billion thereafter. Our backlog is down quarter over quarter; the $3.9 billion of backlog at September 30, 2016 is consistent with the quarterly average over the past two years.", "Additionally, despite order intake levels this quarter, the year-to-date book-to-bill for our areas are sound, with a book-to-bill and AEA of over two, a book-to-bill approximately one in the Middle East, and while we have recognized $690 million in year-to-date revenue on the Ichthys project, the 0.5 book-to-bill in Asia represents the difficulty in replacing such a sizeable roll-off in the current market.", "Our bids and change orders outstanding at quarter-end were $4 billion, a minor decrease compared to $4.2 billion at the end of the second quarter 2016. Approximately 7% to 8% of our outstanding bids and change orders relate to our offshore operations, as of September 30, 2016. Our list of target projects totaled $13 billion as of September 30, 2016, compared to $12.5 billion as of June 30, 2016. Our revenue pipeline is five quarters, and as such, the pipeline horizon now includes full year of 2017. Approximately 76% of the value of our target projects relates to offshore operations.", "As of September 30, 2016, the combination of our backlog, bids, and change orders outstanding and target projects, which make up our potential revenue pipeline for the next five quarters, totaled $20.9 billion, a slight reduction from the $21.1 billion as of last quarter.", "Moving on to our cost restructuring programs. The McDermott Profitability Initiative or MPI is complete, and our Additional Overhead Reduction or AOR program was substantially complete as of the end of the third quarter. We still anticipate gross annual cash savings in 2016 of $150 million, as a result of MPI, and in-year cash savings, $45 million due to AOR. Both figures remain incorporated into our guidance. We now expect total restructuring cost to be approximately $11 million in 2016 for both MPI and the AOR.", "Consistent with previous quarters, we have updated our 2016 guidance to reflect the impacts of project sequencing, along with our overall market view and the status of our operations. Our updated full-year guidance reflects expected revenues of approximately $2.6 billion, slightly down from our second quarter guidance. As a result of final change orders, customer requested changes in work scope and cost savings associated with project completion and close outs that took place in Q3, we now anticipate operating income to be approximately $159 million and approximately $215 million on an adjusted basis, excluding the $44 million impairment loss and approximately $11 million of restructuring charges.", "While we expect change orders, closeouts and settlements as part of our normal business activities, we believe it is unlikely that the same level of change orders and cost improvements will repeat fourth quarter, given the expected portfolio position. 2016 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $300 million and has been updated to reflect the expected increase in operating income.", "As a result of the changes I just mentioned, we're now expecting our net income and earnings per share to be approximately $28 million and $0.10, respectively and adjusted net income and earnings per share to be approximately $78 million and $0.28, respectively, for the full-year 2016.", "We now expect CapEx to be $246 million which is a slight reduction from guidance provided in the second quarter due to some slippage into 2017. We anticipate having approximately $535 million of cash and restricted cash and $765 million in gross debt at the end of 2016 with a net debt of approximately $230 million.", "Free cash flow is expected to be approximately negative $111 million, with approximately $160 million of the CapEx driving the negative free cash flow, attributable to the capital build of the DLV 2000.", "We're also announcing an initial outlook for 2017. We expect a higher than 2016 revenue in the range of $2.7 billion to $3 billion for the full-year 2017. However, given expected lower margins due to potential market pricing impacts and forecasted lower utilization of Subsea vessels, we expect lower margins.", "We believe operating income will be in the range of $170 million to $190 million, and EBITDA in the range of $260 million to $290 million. We also expect earnings per share of $0.16 to $0.19 and a CapEx spend between $50 million and $70 million for 2017.", "Also as a reminder, the supplemental slide deck available on our website provides additional financial information including reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now I would like to turn the call back over to David.", "David Dickson - McDermott International, Inc.", "Thanks, Stuart. As I approach my third year anniversary, I am extremely proud of the progress that we have made as a company, both in executing the turnaround and navigating the cycle. The execution of projects, securing of new backlog, and generation of financial results is a testament to the capabilities of the new management team, our employees and the success of the One McDermott Way, reflecting a significant cultural shift within the organization.", "Our results this quarter further demonstrate our committed focus on customer relationships, excellence in execution and cost management, as we head into the fourth quarter with a good foundation for 2017 with approximately $2.4 billion of 2017 expected revenue in our backlog.", "Additionally, we have maintained a focus on driving our cost culture and managing our cash and capital structure, resulting in a strong balance sheet to manage working capital through the cycle. As I mentioned earlier, we believe the offshore market has bottomed in the areas in which we operate, albeit subsea remains challenging. While the current oil price continues to generate uncertainty around customer investment decisions and the pattern of awards, we will continue to focus on customer alignment as we have over the past three years. And we will continue to concentrate on the things that we can control, such as strong project execution, cost discipline, and efficient asset utilization.", "I am also very pleased with the progress we have made on our strategic decision to enter the pre-FEED and FEED market, an initiative strongly supported by our customers. And I am pleased to say that we remain active with high bidding activity. We'll continue to make customer relationships a priority, and focus on offering the same quality, safety and capabilities across the globe through our One McDermott Way.", "With that, I would now like to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your questions, please.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Good morning. Sorry, good evening. Nice quarter. I guess a couple of questions. One, on the guidance for 2017, I \u2013 the revenues are higher, the margins are obviously going to be lower. Can you provide a little color around what to expect in terms of segment margins and how much of the margin will be impacted by pricing versus utilization? Then I guess the other question is I'm assuming this is a GAAP number or a clean number, there's no restructuring anything in these numbers that we're talking about?", "And then my second question is with regards to the bid pipeline, which still seems to be robust based on the comments that you've made. When you think about the awards, can you talk about which geographies you are continuing to be most constructive on? And then when you think about awards that will hit, would they be more meaningful to 2017 EPS or 2018? Thanks.", "Stuart A. Spence - McDermott International, Inc.", "Jamie, this is Stuart. I'll take the first two questions and then pass back to David for a discussion on the revenue pipeline. In terms of the potential segment results for 2017, I think what we see at the moment is a very successful year in our Middle East business, a relatively kind of breakeven year in our Asia business and a loss in our Americas business, as we pivot that business to more of an offshore Mexico focused business.", "In terms of pricing versus utilization, I think we have an equal blend impacting our 2017 initial outlook. We will have a higher under-absorption on our subsea vessels. As David mentioned, the Subsea market remains more challenged in today's environment.", "In terms of restructuring in 2017 outlook, our current numbers do not include any element of restructuring. We believe we have the right asset base, capability base and resource base across the globe to address the challenges and the opportunities that we'll face during 2017.", "David Dickson - McDermott International, Inc.", "So, Jamie, on the second question on the market. So as we highlighted a lot of lumpiness quarter-to-quarter on the order intake, a big lump in Q2, lower in Q3. And I think that's expected in the current marketplace as our customers work through their decision making looking at oil price, gas price, et cetera.", "What we see today is across the areas, probably the largest area where we have a buildup of outstanding bids is in the Middle East, and a lot of it with Saudi Aramco. And we would expect them over the next few months to start to release some awards. We also expect to see some activity occurring in the Americas, and in particular areas such as Mexico and maybe in Trinidad in the Caribbean.", "Other area of activity we have ongoing is we have a bid ongoing on the East Coast of India and anticipating a significant bid to come in for another customer off the East Coast of India over this next matter of a few weeks. So as you look at our bid pipeline, our revenue pipeline, it's essentially flat quarter-on-quarter. That's also a reflection of the fact that there hasn't been a number of awards given out on Q3, and so we still remain confident that some of these awards will go ahead and that McDermott will participate in some of these projects.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your questions, please.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Good evening and congrats on another strong quarter. I guess we shouldn't be too surprised at this point by another beat and raise from you guys, but I still was kind of surprised by how strong the margins were in the quarter, particularly relative to kind of your qualitative commentary on the second quarter call when you seemed kind of concerned about utilization and talked about kind of a lack of positive closeout opportunities. So I'm just kind of curious for the last couple months of the quarter, what kind of changed so much to the positive there?", "Stuart A. Spence - McDermott International, Inc.", "Yep, Matt. This is Stuart. I think a couple of factors impacted us on the utilization side. A lot of our work is brownfield, so the schedules are relatively movable by the customer. And we did pick up more utilizations than we actually thought during the quarter as schedules changed. Also as well we did a very kind of company-wide focus on cost management. We got very tight on any discretionary spend and any spend going on in our projects, and we saw the benefit come from that.", "And then I think lastly the hardest part of our business to predict is always the closeout and the change order discussion with our customer. Those discussions are always better when the project execution is excellent, and we were somewhat surprised by the progress we made with various customers on the various projects during the quarter on those two elements. So I think it was a combination of all of those factors that drove the upside.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Well, I think it's always better to under-promise and over-deliver. And I guess that kind of brings me to my next question on the 2017 guidance. I mean it seems like a lot of the upside to your initial guidance this year has been driven by strong execution, so I guess the question is when you look at your commentary about margins being lower in 2017, do those, those positive closeout opportunities just truly not exist based on your current backlog? Or is it fair to assume that you're taking kind of a more conservative approach to those opportunities, similar to how you initially guided this year?", "Stuart A. Spence - McDermott International, Inc.", "Matt, I think there's kind of two factors at play there. If you look at our backlog today of projects, they're all relatively young in their percentage of completion. So we have a relatively young portfolio. We're going to have to work through some very large and complicated projects next year, the LTA II, Vashishta, Abkatun and others in the portfolio, and so I don't think they are going to be positioned towards the end of their POC where we see some of those kind of closeouts impact 2017.", "I would also say that as we approach the bottom of our general market, we're also approaching possibly the bottom of our supply chain savings as well. The supply chain deflation has been kind of passed through all of our suppliers and so I think next year there'll be less of an opportunity to improve on our projects based on supply chain savings. So I think it's a combination of those two factors.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks, Stuart. That's helpful. If I could just squeeze in one more, you know David, you mentioned that there just wasn't a lot of work awarded in the third quarter, and your point's well taken about kind of looking at the longer-term trailing book-to-bill as being a better indicator. I'm just curious; were there projects being delayed? Kind of what do you attribute the lack of awards to in the quarter? If you could add some more color there.", "David Dickson - McDermott International, Inc.", "I don't think there is a significant amount of projects being, I would say, delayed. I would say that our customers in this current market do take a little bit longer in getting to the \u2013 field (40:58) investment decision. Obviously our customers want to make sure they get the best price and sort of taking advantage of the market situation. So I think the \u2013 going from a point of submitting a tender to receiving an award is just a longer cycle.", "I would also say in areas such as the Middle East, I mean as I said earlier, we have quite a large number of tenders, which are now sitting with Aramco for them to award and I think Aramco as well as them looking at the capacity in the market are also getting a little bit stretched on their side in terms of getting through their process of awarding work. So I don't think there's anything in particular. As I said in the call I think certainly in the Offshore business is that indications that we see through the tenders that are coming the work that is starting to emerge in the FEED market is, Offshore, is probably at its bottom and bouncing around along the bottom. But I think that \u2013 I haven't seen anything, we haven't seen any major project that has been delayed.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.", "David Dickson - McDermott International, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Your questions, please.", "Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Good evening.", "Stuart A. Spence - McDermott International, Inc.", "Good evening.", "Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "So how do you think about operating cash flow for next year? The implied 4Q cash flow suggests a pretty decent amount of cash burn. Can you speak about that? And then does that have any read into 2017?", "Stuart A. Spence - McDermott International, Inc.", "Yeah. This is Stu. We haven't given any initial outlook on free cash flow for 2017 as yet. We're still assessing the composition of the backlog and what we might bring in, in the fourth quarter. And working capital terms have moved around slightly on us this year, some of the customers in the Middle East have changed their terms. But also Pemex in the Americas has significantly changed their terms. And so we're still sequencing through all of our milestones and potential collection timings and teeing that up with our supply chain timing. And so we're just not quite ready to give guidance or an initial outlook on free cash flow in 2017 just yet.", "Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Got it. And just help me \u2013 just reconcile this, a couple of opposing things. So you mentioned earlier that utilization surprised positively but you guided down revenues. Can you help me reconcile that?", "And then also can you just help me bridge the margin expectations in the second half? The run rate if I take out the change orders is about 4%. You're guiding to about 6.3% for 2017. It's a pretty big step up. So any additional color would be helpful.", "Stuart A. Spence - McDermott International, Inc.", "Sure. So I think if we take the first question around utilization. As we look into the fourth quarter one of the key drivers on our revenue and our utilization is obviously the marine campaign and those are always the most bearable in timing, whether they are a brownfield project or even a greenfield because we require customer supplied equipment, and we also fed into a sequence of facilities that the customer is managing. So we've seen a number of those schedules change over the progress of this quarter that impact 2017 \u2013 impact the last quarter of this year. So that gives you a slightly lower revenue and will also kind of impact the margin as well.", "I think generally on margin, as we've kind of stated, very successful Q3 around the customer change orders, cost management, schedule management. And as we look at the portfolio and where the projects are in the upcoming sequences, we don't see that same potential for those elements in the fourth quarter. And then also as we look to 2017, I think that we are reflecting a lower pricing environment, some of it that's been built into recent awards and some that we might think coming forward until the market recovers. And also the combination of subsea vessels having less utilization next year. And then lastly, just around the amount of savings that we can generate in our cost structure and supply chain. All of those elements, I think, are holding back margin performance in 2017.", "Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your questions, please.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Good evening, guys.", "Stuart A. Spence - McDermott International, Inc.", "Hey, Rick (45:58).", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "David, you mentioned that you think this quarter, Q3 2016, will be the bottom for your markets, but you also said in your frequently asked questions that NOC CapEx could stay at current levels, maybe through 2019. So how does that translate into thinking about your backlog and your revenue guidance moving forward? Do you think that backlog at $3.9 billion is now close to a bottom? And are you trying to say that your total revenue could stay relatively close to the $3 billion range over the next few years? And if so, if markets are relatively flattish for a while, where could you get market share to grow revenue?", "David Dickson - McDermott International, Inc.", "So as you know, Andy, we never disclose the order intake, and obviously try never \u2013 or never forecast backlog. As we look at it, I think we said earlier is if you look at today, 79% of our business is now driven by what's happening in the offshore and moving forward. And again, that's a reflection of a market where it's typically shallower water and typically areas where the costs to recover a barrel of oil is obviously less than some of the deepwater. If you look at our supplemental deck you'll see that also reflects the largest part of our revenue pipeline is still coming from NOCs and that reflects the activity that obviously we see in places like Middle East and also parts of the Americas, which is predominately Mexico and Caribbean. So we see that continuing and the bidding activity on that to remain steady.", "Areas of opportunity for us so if we talk in the Offshore is that obviously we're still not made any penetration in either West Africa or East Africa. So we see that as being an opportunity for us, as well as some of the activity that's ongoing in the North Sea, and again, we're taking a look at that at this time. And over a period of time, hopefully, we can evolve into those areas. Longer-term growth is that we have shown this year by both we've done in Ichthys in Australia, but also with the three, I'd call the pipeline subsea tied backs, plus the other projects that we executed on, Jack, St. Malo for Chevron and Julia for Exxon Mobil is that we are poised as a company to really take advantage of the deepwater subsea business.", "The issue there is that seems to be a little bit further away in terms of the \u2013 in terms of horizon of when that comes back. And so, we are looking at \u2013 not seeing a lot of activity in that area until 2018 onwards. But what is clear from the work that was done on Ichthys and with the projects that were executed in the deepwater subsea is that McDermott is more than capable to compete in these markets, but also compete strong commercially. I feel that with the execution model that we have with the spoolbase, with the assets that we have is that McDermott is in a good position today in terms of its ability to compete against our peers from a commercial basis.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful, David. Your total potential revenue pipeline was relatively stable. Sequentially, you mentioned I think $21 billion approximately, but the backlog obviously was down in the quarter and you didn't add to your $2.4 billion in expected revenue for next year. So, can you talk about the risk inherent in reaching your 2017 revenue expectations? Are there still larger projects, that you mentioned some of them that you really just need to win in the fourth quarter or first quarter of next year to make your forecast? Or can you get there really just through scope changes and/or small booking brown jobs at this point?", "David Dickson - McDermott International, Inc.", "Yeah. So I think if you look at it, I mean, what obviously gives us a lot of confidence is the fact that at the end of Q3, we're at $2.4 billion of revenue in the backlog. And if you compare that to our revenues that we've had in 2016 is that we are in \u2013 this year in a stronger position moving into 2017 than what we've been in previous years at this time of the calendar.", "If you consider also the bids that are outstanding, and some of these have been outstanding for a period of time, is that we would expect some of our customers to move ahead with some of these awards before year end. Now none of that is obviously guaranteed, because obviously our customers are currently and constantly evaluating pricing, but we would expect that certainly one major and probably one other customer to move ahead with awards before the year end, or certainly no later than early next year.", "So as you look at $2.4 million into the year, it gives us more confidence than what we've had in the previous two years. And as I said, if you go back to who's our largest customer and the customer that we have, the largest market share is that we still have a large bid \u2013 a large backlog of outstanding bids, which is sitting with that customer at this time. So, we're sitting here today what we feel is a reasonable position moving into 2017.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks, David. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Rogers with D. A. Davidson. Your questions, please.", "John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Hi, good afternoon and congratulations as well.", "David Dickson - McDermott International, Inc.", "Good afternoon.", "John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "I guess just a couple of follow-up questions, I think it was to Jamie's question earlier. When you look at the segments for 2017, you gave us some color there, and it's still the Middle East that looks like it's driving all your \u2013 or much of your profitability in 2017. And is that continues to be brownfield-type projects I assume there?", "David Dickson - McDermott International, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean, the majority of the work that we're bidding with Aramco today is brownfield. Now, brownfield is where we are either modifying, enhancing or expanding existing facilities. So a lot of the bids today are on the famous fields such as Safaniya and Marjan and Berri. So, we would expect that to continue in the same path moving forward.", "John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "And I guess as you think about this cycle and your comments that hopefully or you expect this to be the bottom here. And I don't know exactly what kind of recovery you're thinking about. But how many more years of this brownfield-type work is there before we really may see an opportunity in the larger greenfield new offshore projects? And just some thoughts there on how the timing of this recovery might look?", "David Dickson - McDermott International, Inc.", "I would expect next year is that you will see some greenfield awards in the market. I'm not saying it'll come to McDermott, but there will be some...", "John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Right.", "David Dickson - McDermott International, Inc.", "...awards. I mean, there are some areas offshore where particularly the major operators need to move to, and a lot of them will actually \u2013 could be in the deepwater. But I think over this next 12 months, I would anticipate that the most of our bids will continue still in a shallow water and more of that brownfield type, and again, in areas such as Middle East, Americas, and maybe some slight activity starting to evolve in Asia.", "John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. And then lastly, just in terms of CapEx levels, the $50 million to $70 million that you're looking at next year. Is that a good maintenance level now at this point for the next three years? Is that what you're saying?", "Stuart A. Spence - McDermott International, Inc.", "John, this is Stuart.", "John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Hey, yeah.", "Stuart A. Spence - McDermott International, Inc.", "We've been very CapEx-disciplined over the last two years, really kind of holding back to that $40 million to $50 million maintenance at project level. We look forward into 2017, we would say we would see that $50 million level continuing, but we also see some maybe some tactical moves to add to our capabilities or just putting in some additional growth CapEx there.", "John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. But presumably, Stuart, that's beyond 2017 at this point, unless something just you can't pass up comes along?", "Stuart A. Spence - McDermott International, Inc.", "That's correct. That's correct, and we've kind of finished our capital build program on the vessel side, so we don't see a significant new capital build program at this point in the cycle.", "John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay, great. Thank you, and congratulations on the quarter.", "Stuart A. Spence - McDermott International, Inc.", "Thank you.", "David Dickson - McDermott International, Inc.", "Thanks, Stuart.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your questions, please.", "Cleveland D. Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. This is Cleve on for Steve. Stuart, just going back to cash flow, when do you think McDermott might be sustainably cash flow positive? I mean, is the volatility in cash flow just a function of the business environment, or does McDermott really need to get bigger for a lot of those changes in working capital and stuff having such a big impact?", "David Dickson - McDermott International, Inc.", "Yeah. Cleve, I think if you look at Q3, we demonstrated a very successful quarter from an earnings and free cash flow perspective. Our CapEx level was the lowest it's been in the last few years, given the completion of the DLV 2000, the majority of it. So I think that's a very good reflection of the capability of this business.", "As I cautioned around 2017 initial outlook, we get to kind of tie-down with our projects and our final backlog, where the potential working capital goes. So I think at this point in the cycle, the only real variable that McDermott's looking at is on the working capital side. But with that said, we feel comfortable given the discipline around cash so far and the large gross cash balance that we're maintaining at this point.", "Cleveland D. Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, thanks. And then, David, just coming back to India. How quickly do you think India can ramp up? I mean, some of the projects that you're pursuing there now, are these going to start in 2017? Or is that really like an 2018 and beyond type market?", "David Dickson - McDermott International, Inc.", "So I think with what we're looking at today is that you can expect at least to what I'd call one large project and one you would put in the major (57:10) category to get kicked off during 2017.", "Cleveland D. Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Nice job in the quarter, guys. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.", "David Dickson - McDermott International, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Stuart A. Spence - McDermott International, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today.
