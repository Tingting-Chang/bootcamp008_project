Fiscal 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Chief Financial Officer, Jon Marten. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Abigail, and good morning to everyone, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's second quarter FY 2016 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks.", "Today's presentation slides together with the audio webcast replay will be accessible on the company's Investor Information website at phstock.com for one year following today's call.", "On slide number two, you'll find the company's Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and are posted on Parker's website at phstock.com.", "On slide number three for the agenda, to begin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, will provide highlights for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Following Tom's comments, I will provide a review of the company's second quarter FY 2016 performance together with the revised guidance for FY 2016. Tom will provide a few summary comments, and then we'll open the call for a Q&A session.", "At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to slide number four.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation today. To start, let me make a few summary comments.", "It continues to be a very tough environment in many of our end markets and regions. We have responded decisively to adjust to these conditions and delivered impressive margin return on sales. We have tightened control of discretionary spending, reduced employment levels across all regions in our company and implemented reduced work schedules where necessary. This is in addition to the previously announced actions we have underway to restructure our fixed costs and simplification efforts designed to streamline our operations. On both of those fronts, we made excellent progress in the second quarter.", "Given the current headwinds, we are very pleased with the way our teams have responded, as evidenced by the strong margin performance and our ability to control decremental margin on return on sales for the past three quarters. We expect strong decremental margin return on sales to continue through our fiscal year-end.", "Moving on to specifics for the second quarter, sales declined 14% as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by approximately 4% and organic sales declined 10%, reflecting end market weakness.", "Total order rates for the second quarter declined 12% compared with the same quarter last year. Despite this downturn, I am very pleased we delivered total segment operating margins of 12.2% or 13.5% on an adjusted basis.", "During the second quarter, we delivered decremental margin return on sales of 17.2% adjusted, which represents excellent performance in this current business climate. This is really a testament to the way we are fundamentally changing Parker's operating structure.", "In previous downturns, in which we've experienced such a significant reduction in sales volume, we would not have been able to maintain such strong margin performance. The primary drivers of our margin performance include: savings from restructuring we have done in prior periods; immediate and decisive actions on cost containment; and the benefits of a range of simplification initiatives that we have implemented.", "Regarding simplification, we have announced a total of 28 division consolidations. We continue to review our organization and process to reduce overhead costs and simplify processes. This has also helped us to reduce corporate G&A costs.", "Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33 or $1.52 adjusted for business realignment expenses. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 9.8%.", "During the second quarter, we repurchased $90 million in Parker shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $400 million. We have now repurchased $1.74 billion under our previously announced $2 billion to $3 billion Parker share repurchase plan over two years, which began in October 2014.", "Moving on to the discussion on key market trends, as projected in the second quarter, we saw continued pressure on natural resource markets, such as oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, as the prices of commodities continued to move lower. Our distribution channel remained affected by these markets, particularly those with exposure to oil and gas.", "We continued to experience general industrial activity weakening due to the knock-on effect from natural resource markets. These challenging markets outweighed positive growth in other markets such as power generation, air conditioning, lawn and turf, rail, and heavy-duty truck.", "In summary, our second quarter sales were in line with our October guidance. And Lee will provide some more color on our end markets in the Q&A portion of the call.", "Now switching to our outlook; for fiscal year 2016, we are narrowing the range of our guidance for earnings to $5.90 to $6.30 per share on an adjusted basis, which maintains the earnings midpoint of $6.10 per share. It also means that our implied guidance for the second-half of the fiscal year has been adjusted downward for sales and earnings to reflect weaker order entry levels that we experienced in the second quarter.", "We will continue to aggressively manage costs in this challenging environment. Our primary focus will be on maintaining strong decremental margin performance and positioning Parker to weather this downturn and emerge stronger as conditions improve. We are also continuing with actions to execute the many growth opportunities we have identified under the new Win Strategy.", "So just to reinforce, our long-term financial objectives to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2020 are: targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production; we're also targeting 17% segment operating margins; and progress towards these goals is expected to deliver a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period.", "We are excited about opportunities we have to position Parker as a top quartile company, compared with our proxy peers. Growth initiatives are underway to further expand our distribution network, commercialize new products and systems, improve the customer experience, expand our service offerings, and to leverage e-Business and Internet of Things capabilities.", "During the second quarter, we developed a comprehensive long-term plan to accelerate our e-Business capabilities. We see opportunity to leverage our distribution channel as part of our strategy, grow our business and create a better customer experience. Parker's Internet of Things initiative gained significant momentum in the quarter. We hosted a global Connectathon that garnered dozens of rich Internet of Things application ideas.", "In summary, execution of the new Win Strategy is expected to deliver top quartile performance versus our proxy peers. So for now, I'll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Tom.", "And at this time, please refer to slide number five. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.33 versus $1.80 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.19 and compares to $0.04 for the same quarter last year.", "On slide number six, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.84 for the second quarter FY 2015 to $1.52 for the second quarter of this year. The impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.11 per share.", "Increases to adjusted per-share income include lower corporate G&A expense equating to $0.11 due to reduction in long-term incentive accruals as well as our simplification efforts, as Tom mentioned. A reduced tax rate for the quarter contributed $0.02, driven by the passage of the U.S. extenders from which the company recognized R&D credit.", "Reductions to adjusted per-share income include lower adjusted segment operating income of $0.39 per share due to the impact of foreign currency and the continued weakening of end market demand and increased interest and other expense that totaled $0.18 per share as compared to the prior year in which various one-time favorable adjustments were recognized.", "Moving to slide number seven, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the second quarter, total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 9.6% over the same quarter last year; there was a modest 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than plan, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $139 million or 4.4% in the quarter.", "Total company segment operating margins for the second quarter adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 13.5% versus 14% for the same quarter last year. Restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were $35 million versus $9 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $366 million versus $439 million last year reflects the impact of reduced volume and unfavorable mix from the continued weakening of several industrial end markets.", "Moving to slide number eight, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the second quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 15.2% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact in currency of 1.3% in the quarter.", "Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15% of sales versus 16.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred totaled $20 million as compared to a nominal spend in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $174 million as compared to $227 million, driven by reduced volume as a result of softening trends in key end markets.", "I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on slide number nine. Organic sales for the second quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 7.1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 10%.", "Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 11% of sales versus 12.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $14 million as compared to $9 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $109 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of the foreign currencies as well as weaker end markets.", "I'll now move to slide number 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased nominally at 0.7% for the second quarter. Currency posed a modest negative impact of about 0.4%. Sales for the period were maintained as a result of higher aftermarket sales volume, which offset modest year-over-year declines in OEM sales.", "Operating margins for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 14.8% of sales versus 12% in the prior year. Nominal realignment expenses were incurred for the period, adjusted operating income was $82 million as compared to $67 million, reflecting the favorable mix of higher aftermarket sales volume this quarter combined with reduced development costs as a percentage of sales.", "Moving to slide number 11, with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency.", "The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders were a negative 12% for the quarter-end, reflecting the further softening of the Industrial's segments stemming from natural resource related end markets, as Tom mentioned.", "Diversified Industrial North American orders decreased to negative 15%. Diversified Industrial International orders decreased to negative 10% for the quarter. Aerospace Systems orders improved to a negative 11% for the quarter, which continues to be impacted by lumpy prior-year comparables.", "On slide number 12, we report cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $347 million, but when adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was 9.8% of sales. This compares to 8.4% of sales for the same period last year.", "In addition to the pension contribution, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $572 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $172 million. $68 million was expended for acquisitions closed during the first quarter. No acquisitions were announced in the second quarter, and we have $75 million for CapEx equating to approximately 1.4% of sales year-to-date.", "Slide number 13, provides for FY 2016 guidance as outlined. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of approximately $100 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2016. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 12.6% to negative 9.3% or negative 9.9% at the midpoint as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is negative 7.9%.", "Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 3.4%, which is nearly all attributable to the International Industrial segment. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of December 31, 2015, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the balance of FY 2016.", "For total Parker, adjustment segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.4% and 14.6%. This compares to 14.9% for FY 2015 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to this level of adjusted segment operating margins, given the magnitude of the end market softness and order decline. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and our category other is $484 million for the year at the midpoint. Our full-year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full-year guidance is 137.1 million shares.", "For the full-year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is $5.90 to $6.30, or $6.10 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $100 million to be incurred in FY 2016. Savings from these business realignment initiatives continue to be projected in the amount of $70 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins.", "Some additional key assumptions for full-year 2016 guidance are: sales are divided 49%, first-half, 51% second-half; adjustment segment operating income is divided 49% first-half, 51% second-half; adjusted EPS is $3.04 in the first-half and $3.06 in the second-half; Q3 FY 2016 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.40 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.17 of business realignment expenses.", "On slide number 14, you'll find the reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.10 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY 2016 EPS guidance. Increases include $0.12 from reduced tax rate, $0.13 from reduced corporate G&A, interest, and other, and $0.05 from fewer shares outstanding. This is fully offset by a decrease of $0.30 reduction in segment operating income, reflecting further reduced volume and unfavorable mix forecasted within key industrial end markets.", "Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions or divestitures that might be closed during FY 2016. For consistency, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates.", "This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jon. We expect the difficult environment to continue through the rest of our fiscal year. As our margins here today indicate, we are responding well. We are making meaningful progress with our restructuring initiatives, which remain on track for the year. We also continue to find opportunities to streamline operations through our simplification initiatives.", "I am very encouraged by the response of our partner team members. It has been just about one year since Lee and I took full responsibility for the company. It's certainly been a challenging year from a market perspective. However, our teams have not only adapted quickly to the challenges before them, but they have also embraced a new path forward for Parker, and are working hard to build a stronger and better Parker for the future under the direction of the Win Strategy.", "I look forward to sharing more with you on our progress throughout this year. At this time, we are ready to take questions. So, Abigail, if you would like to get us started?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey, guys. This is James Picariello filling in for Jeff. Just a quick question on order trends. Can you speak to maybe the pace of what you're seeing through January and how that maybe compares to, in December and November?", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "This is Jon. I think, James, the pattern is consistent with what we saw during Q2. I think what we're seeing in January is consistent with what we're seeing in guidance. January is, of course \u2013 the first two weeks of January are a little bit \u2013 very difficult to judge, but I think from what we can tell so far that we're consistent with the guidance that we've got together for Q3. So, nothing really remarkable to give you an answer on there.", "James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And just to follow-up. On Aerospace, what's the visibility in terms of the mix between OE and aftermarket for the back half? Just trying to get a better understanding for the margins?", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, it would be, in general, we have good visibility for the OE, and the question is always in the aftermarket. What is included in our guidance is 65% OE, 35% aftermarket. That's what we've been running consistently for the last several quarters. There's a little bit of variation periodically, but that's what we're projecting here for the balance of the year.", "James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks, guys.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Deblase with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Nicole.", "Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "So, I guess, I'll ask the question that someone's bound to ask is, can you guys go through your usual spiel on how the end markets progressed during the quarter?", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure.", "Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Nicole, this is Lee. Like I've done before in the past, I'll just kind of walk around the regions, and I'll make some comments on the end markets and I'll also comment on our distribution channel.", "I think one common thread that hasn't changed is the whole natural resource driven markets, ag, mining, construction equipment, oil and gas, they really by and large continue to be challenging everywhere around the world.", "So, starting off with North America, I think, oil and gas, in terms of distribution continues to be the big story when you think about distribution in aggregate. Having said that, if I focus on distribution that doesn't have heavy content in oil and gas, we've got positive year-over-year growth. But what's happened with oil and gas and its pervasiveness through the distribution base that is still very difficult.", "Looking at, really, air conditioning, refrigeration markets in North America, we've seen good North America residential air conditioning growth. This is a result, obviously, of the continued strengthening in the housing market. We've seen share gains on our behalf and then really an increase in product content which has to do with the SEER efficiency changes that incurred last year. So, we're really happy what's happening in those markets.", "Commercial air-conditioning and refrigeration markets really have been down year-over-year, but we are expecting growth in the balance of calendar 2016 and moving into 2017.", "And then lastly, if I look at the aftermarket channel in this segment, which would be different than the industrial distribution, we really remain solid year-to-date growth and this is really based on the markets but also a big part of some new products and some smart service toolkits that we've introduced into that market segment. So, very positive there.", "Touching back on North America oil and gas, as I mentioned in my distribution comments, we continue to see extreme weakness, double-digit declines across all of our end customers. Our customers, and I've had plenty of these conversations, are not signaling any significant improvement until the end of calendar year 2016 or early 2017. And all of them have very active restructuring plans to be profitable in today's oil prices.", "Turning to agriculture, we continue to see topline declines, which is consistent I think in contraction and production schedules at our major customers. So, very weak on the agricultural equipment side.", "On energy, wind and energy storage business for us remains robust with major customers maintaining a healthy backlog. And then the decommissioning of U.S. coal and oil-fired plants continues at a fairly brisk pace and has brought some good opportunity for us on natural gas conversion projects.", "On heavy-duty truck, Class 8 truck, this market has been very good and growing for us. And it was excellent, but consistent with industry forecasts, we are lowering our forecast by at least 20% from the 2015 levels going forward.", "On the mobile side, mobile equipment, the traditional construction equipment markets continue to be soft in North America. A highlight here has been some really nice wins in the turf business; the market is up and has been a bright spot as we continue to win new business there.", "And then lastly, I'll just talk about in-plant automotive, our key North American distribution that covers in-plant automotive is up year-over-year versus \u2013 Q2 versus prior. But we are expecting a slowing of CapEx spending in this area, which will have an impact on the machine tool builders who cover this area. So that's North America.", "In Europe, there's \u2013 well, I'll comment on Europe. So, if I talk about distribution, weak overall with Q2 down versus last year. But, I think, what I have to highlight here is if you pull out distribution that's tied to oil and gas, which is really UK, Norway \u2013 it's up year-over-year. And we have seen steady progress outside oil and gas-related distribution.", "We continue to see strong distribution growth in emerging regions and this is a highlight; if I look at Germany, it's ahead of last year to-date. It obviously has much less oil and gas exposure than other countries.", "Oil and gas for the region, investment in North Sea is almost at a standstill, looking at the UK capital investment, North Sea has dropped significantly. But, we are still finding opportunities. We've had some nice wins in point of use for clean diesel wins in some emerging markets. Really systems that eliminating high water content using our fluid conveyance and filtration technologies.", "Agriculture is still pretty much the same as North America, production rate is low. In energy, very excited about some recent wins for energy grid tie systems and it really is a complement to our growth and the Renewable Energy segments.", "Class 8 truck continues to remain strong. I was looking at this, I think this is the fifth consecutive quarter of growth in that area, so we're very positive about that. And then the mobile construction equipment markets, we actually have seen some stability there with a little bit of modest growth from Q1 to Q2.", "Turning to Asia, distribution as a total is flat to moderately down year-over-year. And I attribute some of that to our continued expansion, which we highlighted in our Win Strategy, of expanding our distribution points around the world. And we are doing that in the region.", "Oil and gas, again, is a contraction across the region. It's of note that we do see some positive success with some project builds in China and I think with a lot of these state-owned oil and gas companies, they still continue to invest, maybe at somewhat of a reduced rate.", "On energy, in the region, really I'm speaking to China mostly, renewable, wind, solar and hydro is growing rapidly, but traditional thermal powers, coal, gas, nuclear is still taking a major share.", "On rail, and this really speaks to China, we continue to be very bullish on the rail market; the Chinese government is making significant investments in this area. We've had \u2013 there is a strong focus on the export markets of high-speed rail, technology in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia and they continue to win business there. And for us, we've had a very good market participation in that segment, we continue to have strong participation across that rail market in China.", "On mobile construction, I can't say anything has progressed positive, since the last time we talked, there continues to be a slowing rate of growth in China's construction industry and really has been a key driving factor in the deceleration in many parts of Asia-Pacific. But our customers there continue to have really tons of idle capacity and inventory on hand.", "And then lastly, just talking to Latin America, it's really about Brazil. I won't go into the details. I think everybody knows, but Brazil continues to be just in very dire condition and we've seen softness in all our end markets, mining, PowerGen, oil and gas, heavy-duty truck, et cetera.", "Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Lee, that was really, really helpful.", "Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you.", "Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "So, just one quick follow-up, if you guys don't mind. So, on 3Q, you're guiding for $1.40 EPS at the midpoint. Typically, EPS steps up Q-on-Q. I know there were some below line puts and takes within the second quarter that are probably messing up that seasonality a bit. But I'm just curious are you guys embedding a deterioration in organic growth in 3Q compared to 2Q?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me start, Nicole. This is Tom. And I'll let Jon add on. What we did for the second half is basically we took the order entry that we saw that Lee described all the regions of the markets in the second quarter, which really, Aerospace orders got better, less negative, and Industrial North America got worse by three points and International got worse by two points. So, we took that order entry and basically translated that into the second half on an organic growth standpoint. So, our second-half organic growth from our previous guide used to be minus 5% and now it's minus 7.5%. So, we dropped it 2.5 points organically and then we have the second half coming at a minus 15% decremental MROS and that's how you get the second half EPS numbers.", "Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, Tom. I'll pass it on.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Your line is open.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "Let me just follow-up on Nicole's question and just clarify. As a clarification, what was the adjusted tax rate in the second quarter? And is the big difference between the third quarter and second quarter is a little bit of seasonality upturn being offset by a 28% tax rate assumption?", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, first of all, the effective tax rate for the three months in Q2 was 20.3% and that's related to the passage of the extenders. Going forward into Q3, our run rate going forward is 28%, although it's just slightly higher in our Q3 that we've built in here due to a couple of items that we will account for it in the quarter, Eli.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "Yeah. But that 28% versus the 20.3% is sort of like $0.12 to $0.15 or some number like that of the...", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "...difference in earnings and that almost accounts the difference between $1.52 and $1.40 that you're sort of forecasting for us.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. We are not \u2013 we are down \u2013 are down in the top line versus our old guidance in Q3 and we're also down commensurately at the operating income. But I've got, like I said, a slightly higher rate in Q3 due to some discrete items that we're accounting for in our tax rate there.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "All right. And can we talk a little bit about the profitability, the lower profitability you're forecasting for the year? Most of that, I assume, is volume. Is there any changes in pricing going on in the marketplace? Are you able to hold pricing? I mean, we assume cost will continue to trend downward just because of the lower input costs. But can you a little bit, talk a little bit about what's going on in the \u2013 I assume the drop in margins that sort of are embedded it's like drop is a little volume related and that pricing looks like it's relatively stable in the industry?", "Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Eli, this is Lee. I think the drop is all volume-related. Pricing has been flat. We forecasted it to be flat going forward.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "And input costs are still trending downward?", "Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer", "They've been favorable.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "Yeah. All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Andy.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "A couple of questions related to your guidance. First, if we look back on Q2, can you give us the components of \u2013 there was quite a bit of difference between the initial $1.16 midpoint guidance and the reported $1.52. Understand tax was part of it. But what else changed?", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I mean, I think at the SG&A level for the quarter as Tom said, we've got some positive variance in the corporate G&A of about $18 million versus the prior guide. And that's due to the simplification efforts and a couple one-time adjustments that won't repeat. We've also got as compared to the prior guide, a small settlement of about $4 million for a contractual issue that we had in the other expense. That's about $4 million and that accounts for about $0.02.", "And, of course, Eli talked about the tax rate. And we had guided to a higher tax rate and again we did not know that the extenders was going to pass; and so of course, that turned out to be good news for us and that gave us $0.15 versus the prior guide.", "And then at the operating income level, even with the reduced \u2013 projected reduced revenues, we were able to get approximately $15 million in additional operating income versus the prior guide on a slight beat in revenues.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Jon. And then on that $15 million, is that repeatable \u2013 that should carry through going forward?", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Well, that is built into our guidance going forward and we feel very good about our cost structure and with the simplification efforts and our restructuring efforts are bringing for us and built into our guidance is additional savings that we're going to get from the restructuring efforts that we've been going through here in the first half of this year and at the end of last year.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And then a couple detail, I guess. First, on North American Industrial, did you see inventory destocking change during the quarter, meaning did it intensify, moderate or kind of stay the same versus the prior quarter?", "Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Andy, it's Lee. I would say it just stayed about the same. I mean at the end of the day it's really hard for us to get a gauge on that. But it certainly didn't get worse.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Lee. And then real quick on the last one, Aerospace outlook. Are you embedding the same sort of fourth-quarter bump up that you've seen in the last couple of years?", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Andy, we really are not. What we've embedded in there is the continuation of the 35% MRO, 65% OEM at around the same relative profitability that we see right now. These last couple of years we've seen these one-time settlements get agreed to. And they have impacted the number so I understand completely your question. But that's not something that we would project in our guidance going forward here and so I don't really have any context for you on that point.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Morning, Ann.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Morning. You know, Don used to talk about the 3-12 and the 12-12. I'm just curious about the end markets that are really weak. Are you seeing any kind of an inflection point looking at your 3-12s and your 12-12s? Anything bottoming out there, particularly in North America?", "Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Ann, in all candor, I don't have my 3-12 and 12-12s in front of me. I can bring those back in the future. But, I would say the comps are going to start getting easier in some of those numbers, so it's just a matter of time. I mean obviously oil and gas, just from memory it is still decelerating. But, I would just be winging it here if I tried to give you any more context than that.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Ann, it's Tom. I think our assumption is there's really no meaningful recovery in the second half and what you see if you do the comparables it's just really easier comparables for us in the second half.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful, I appreciate it. And then you did comment on customers talking about how weak the end markets are. Were you talking about distribution customers, particularly in oil and gas, or were you talking about OEMs? If you just could tell us what are the conversations like between OEMs versus your distribution?", "Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer", "They are the same, quite frankly. Our distribution is involved with MRO but also with some projects, and handling it's very, very much the same. It's the same conversation.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. I'll leave it there and let somebody else take it over. Thanks.", "Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Good morning. I guess a couple questions. One, I know someone asked before on material costs and you said it was a benefit, but could you quantify what you're assuming for material costs and your guidance versus when you initially guided? Because I'm just trying to understand the decrementals that you guys are putting up, which have been much better than expected. I get that it's the simplification initiatives and restructuring as well.", "And then also, Tom, if you could just comment on the sustainability of sort of mid-to-high teen decremental margins. We haven't seen that before from Parker?", "And then my last question is just balance sheet; given the depressed markets you're seeing, are any \u2013 I know when we spoke last, you said valuations on acquisitions were still quite elevated. Has there been any change in the market? Thank you.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, Jamie. This is Tom. So, I'll start with the material costs side. I would say compared to our previous guidance, we're seeing a consistent gap between pricing and the material side, that our ability to maintain the decrementals is driven by the simplification and the restructuring actions. And remember that the bulk of our savings is in the second half, so that is going to help carry us.", "And we feel good about this fiscal year, I'm not going to go beyond this fiscal year in trying to tell you what the margin return on sales are going to be. But for this fiscal year, we feel very good about sustainability.", "We've done it three quarters in a row, and I think for everybody on the phone to help remind everybody, the way we achieved that is it was prior year restructuring that we did; all of the teams moved out very rapidly to get on top of the market adjustment. Then we launched the simplification plan which really was more strategic restructuring, in addition to the footprint restructuring we were doing that enabled us to keep these very nice basically half of what we historically have done.", "And as a bit of a history lesson, if you go back to the 2001 reduction \u2013 we were \u2013 the recession, it was a minus 60% MROS. The great recession was around minus 40% and here we are in that minus 15% to minus 20% range on an adjusted basis and low-20%s even reported all in. So, I think it's sustainable and that's what we have in the plan for the next two quarters.", "On the balance sheet, the acquisitions \u2013 the pipeline is active, but valuations are still high and I think what you're seeing is a delay in the reality from seller's expectations to buyers like us as far as setting a new revenue target as far as what they think for the business. That's the key valuation difference. I think everybody knows we're disciplined buyers and we buy things that are in our space, so we understand what the growth rates are. And I think the time is on our side with that. I think as time goes on and people see the new reality that they \u2013 it's maybe not going to grow what they thought it was the previous decade, but those valuations will come in more line and I think our pipeline will become more actionable at that point. So, it's lumpy, it's hard for us to predict output, but we're still working on it.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Sorry, Tom. One just quick follow-up on the simplification initiatives. Because as you look to 2017 there could be very high probability that things don't improve or that sales could decline. Based on what you're seeing with sort of the simplification initiatives, do you feel like you guys perhaps there's more there to do or you're realizing greater savings than you initially thought that again the sustainability of the decrementals could be better than what you originally thought?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think that is possible. I don't want to get above my skis for 2017. We'll talk about that in August. But, yes, I mean, what we've seen with sustainability for simplification so far is that the payback is more rapid and has a better payback than traditional restructuring.", "The good thing about it, and just to remind people, there is four areas we're looking at: revenue profile complexity so that's that tail of the revenue; we're looking at the bottom tail, that density of part numbers and (44:25) activity, just the cost to sustain that. We're very early days of getting into that. I mean that's a little more difficult for us to work but very early days of that.", "And then the whole organization and process optimization is the second part. We still see lots of opportunities on that, so that's more strategic restructuring geared at the overhead structure of the company. The division consolidations was the third leg of it, so we're at 28 divisions so far that we're working on. We'll do more. I don't think you'll see another 28 in the next fiscal year, but you'll see us continue to work that.", "And then just good old-fashioned bureaucracy. We're looking at our planning process, approvals, reports, you name it. All the things that just slows things down, and that obviously carries cost and creates better service opportunities for our customers. So early days, and I feel very good about where \u2013 what this could mean for us. And I think most everybody has seen the walk on taking us to 17% operating margins, simplification is the biggest bar on the walk. So, we clearly think there's more there.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "All righty, thanks. I'll get back in queue.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Morning, Joe.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Tom, maybe staying on the simplification and restructuring spend for a second, it looks like the first couple of quarters, the spend is coming a little bit lighter than we anticipated. And so, I guess, my question is really just around your confidence on your ability to complete the actions this year and to get the roughly $70 million in benefits that you are expecting to receive from those actions. Any color there would be great.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Joe. It's Tom. So, our restructuring year-to-date is right on the money. So, we've forecasted 60% of the $100 million and we're at $57 million. So, we're very, very close to that number. And our savings are tracking and so I am very confident we're going to deliver both the cost that we had planned, the $100 million of cost and deliver the savings. And the savings is indicative of that is the marginal return on sales. We could not be delivering these kind of returns without the actions that we've taken, simplification being one of them that's helping us.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. So, yeah, maybe my numbers are off a little bit in the first half. I can follow up after the call. But, maybe one other key point is I noticed the free cash flow thus far has been pretty impressive and looks like this quarter working capital was a source of cash. I was wondering was there anything one-time or anything special \u2013 like I saw both the receivables and the inventory line down? Just curious what's driving the strong free cash flow.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Jon, here, Joe. We are very much focused on cash flow every single day here in the company here and watching as the top lines moves, what's going on there. All of our operating metrics are very good, nothing is deteriorating. We remain focused on the simplification efforts and our company is doing everything we can from a lean standpoint to improve every single process that we've got throughout the company. And we're seeing it in the cash flow statement. So, we're very proud of that.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones, Stifel. Your line is open.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good morning, Tom, Jon, Lee.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Morning, Nathan.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Lee, in some of your comments about the end markets, you said that North American distribution was positive ex-oil and gas. I think our checks had indicated your North American distribution overall was down about 3%. Is that pretty close to right?", "Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Total North American distribution?", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah.", "Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. It would be down single-digits year-over-year.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So, I think that implies that the direct channel from 2Q to \u2013 I'm sorry from 1Q to 2Q saw a fairly significant decline in the comp. Can you talk about any specific end markets that might have driven that?", "Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer", "I want to make sure I understand your question. You're talking about our direct customers?", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Direct or OEM, the non-distribution channel.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Nathan, it's Tom. I'll chime in. What we saw in distribution in Q2 was primarily North America took a step down, but outside of North America it held up pretty well, Europe, Asia held up pretty nicely.", "So, the step down in North America really was indicative of the same step down we saw OEMs, which was the natural resource markets, a little bit of a knock-on into the general industrial space that knocked both distribution and the OEMs down. But, in general, OEMs have been down about two times what distribution has been down if you were to characterize the difference.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That helps. And then with nine months to go on the original plan for $2 billion to $3 billion of share repurchase, it looks like you're kind of gliding into more of the low end of that. Is that keeping powder dry for some expected correction in the pricing in the M&A market for you and with an eye to getting perhaps more aggressive as we go forward on M&A?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Nathan, this is Tom. Good question. I'm sure this is on top of everybody's mind. So, we feel very good about what we've done so far. We're 87% of the way through to the low end of the $2 billion to $3 billion range.", "And maybe if I could just give a little color to the process that we \u2013 so every quarter, we sit down and it's really a cash allocation discussion. We look at cash generation capabilities, you know what do we think we're going to generate at closed-loop model taking a look at that. Where is the cash generated? What access do we have to the cash? And also with our goal that we'd like to maintain an A-rating as we go through this for a lot of good reasons.", "But on the deployment side, we look at the best opportunities to yield the best long-term value for our shareholders comparing \u2013 recognizing, hey, we're going to do the dividends first. We're not going to move off of that, we're going to fund organic growth, but then we're going to look at the balance of share repurchase versus acquisitions to try to make that best decision.", "So, it's hard for me to give you a specific number that will land on the share repurchase, because it's really an opportunistic look weighing those various tugs and pulls every quarter as we go through that closed-loop model.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Fair enough. And if I could just go off the beaten path a little bit here, you talked about 2Q developing a comprehensive e-Business plan. And also talked a little bit more about development of the Internet of Things plan. Could you give us a little bit more color on where you are with that, how long the rollout looks to take and where the benefits come from that?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, Nathan, this is Tom again. So, I'm going to start on e-Business and I'm going to be a little bit coy with you here, because I'm not going to give you the kind of color that I might normally would, because I would be giving competitively sensitive information to our competitors in trying to help them be successful. Let me just suffice it to say that what we want on the e-Business side is we want a Google like experience for our customers and for our distributors when they come to that website.", "And we've launched a number of things that we think will get us there, it's not going to happen overnight. We've made progress we think over the last couple of years and as we talked to our customers and distributors they see that, but we clearly recognize we're not there.", "So, we see this as a potential additional growth channel, leveraging the great distribution channel that we have already. And just remembering that about 60% of the relationship between a customer and a supplier nowadays happens via that website and happens before they even talk to you. So, that's why we want this to be so important, we're investing in it, we made some organizational design changes to add some resources and add leadership to that. That was the change we made in August last year.", "On the Internet of Things, that Connectathon, in case people are not familiar with what that is, it's basically an ideation process, where you gather ideas from around the company. And that coupled with the fact that we made that equity investment in Exosite, which gives us a software backbone to help all of the applications throughout the company, has really given us a program for ideas. So, we've taken that ideation process to Connectathon. We have narrowed it down to about 10 of what we think are the best most commercial actionable projects. And we think that has got multimillion-dollar type of look \u2013 tens of millions of dollars of revenue over the next three years. Most of that's not going to cut into probably towards the end of FY 2017 and FY 2018, it's probably going to take a year-and-a-half incubation here.", "We do have two good examples, and Lee highlighted one of them that the smart service kit, which is helping us in the refrigeration primarily the air-conditioning market, so if you take an air-conditioning contractor today, they have a lot of mechanical tools they have to utilize to measure pressure, humidity, temperatures and so this is a patented sensor that we have. It allows you to diagnose and troubleshoot the conditions of that air-conditioning unit much more rapid, so the value for the contractors as many more calls happens during the call, they can get a print out right on their smartphone or visual on their smartphones and print it out if they want it for the customer, so they can see what's going on with their unit. So, we launched that. We've been very pleased with the initial sales.", "And that's a really good example of taking a traditional market and using Internet of Things to make it even better. It makes our expansion valves and things we go in \u2013 our check valves very sticky, but then our contractors absolutely love the new toolkit. I think if you go to our website you can probably find a video of one of our contractors, a testimonial talking about it as well.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great. That's helpful. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with BoA. Your line is open.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, guys.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Morning, Andrew.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Can I just ask first just a very simple question? Did I hear it right that you highlighted automotive slowing or did I misheard that?", "Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Andrew, I was talking about in-plant automotive, so CapEx going into the plants.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So, is that related to new platforms at OEs?", "Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer", "I think there's been a \u2013 I'm not going to be that specific. But, what I've noticed is, there's been a lot of retooling activity with a lot of plants and some of that we're being told is going to start to slow down.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got you. So, let's not count this question. But, are you guys getting any transaction benefit? I think a year-ago, you were talking about that it takes about a year to recertify some of the plants to ship stuff from Europe to the U.S. Are you doing it? Are you being able to do it? Are we seeing any benefit from this?", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, Andrew, you know we are constantly trying to make sure that we're producing the right parts at the right locations and the right plants. And so we are not, from a transactional standpoint, getting hurt as bad as we would have been say this time last year in terms of the margins. So that is one piece of progress that we've been making, it is not \u2013 that's one of about 10 or 15 things that are going our way that are helping us with our margins and our decrementals.", "So, we don't see that getting bad. We're adjusting. It was this time last year where the euro and the Swiss franc decoupled and also when the dollar was really getting stronger. And so, we have adjusted to that where we stand right now today and that's what's built into our guidance going forward.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And just a question on capital allocation, given where the high-yield markets are, given that PE can no longer play, given where the stock prices are, how do you guys feel about your M&A funnel?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Andrew, it's Tom again. Same comments that I mentioned earlier about acquisitions that the valuations right now are still a little bit high. I think it's a little bit of a delayed effect as the seller's expectations on revenue hasn't come down to earth yet. But, time is on our side. They will come down and we continue those discussions. And what we've seen over time is eventually we come to the terms with better revenue forecast.", "We haven't taken action on some deals in the past mainly because of the difference in pricing and that pricing difference is primarily geared by differences in what we thought the revenue expectation was going to be for that business.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Abigail, if I could ask you please, if we could just have one more question, I see we're getting ready to run out of time here. So, thank you.", "Operator", "Certainly. Our last question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is open.", "Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi. How's it going?", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Good, Joel.", "Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "That's good. I'll make it quick. Is the run rate in your corporate G&A, is that the new level that we should be using going forward or is that a moving target that either got a benefit this quarter and is going to rise again or is it going to continue to structurally lower as we go forward?", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "We're structurally going to be down slightly from our past run rate, but it was more of a couple one-time things in the corporate G&A. We're focused on about between $45 million to $48 million going forward here in the corporate G&A going forward as compared to in the mid-$50 million in Q1 and in prior years. So, this has some structural benefits from the simplification, but it would be wrong for me to not mention that there were some one-time items in Q2 for our G&A expense.", "Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. And is there a big target on the business simplification? I think you used to have 240 divisions and now you mentioned it's down by 28. Is there any sort of a goal or is it just \u2013 it's going to end up where it naturally ought to be?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Joel, just to \u2013 it's Tom. To clarify, the number of divisions that we have operating divisions is 115. So, the 28 is in the 115. So, both Lee and I, the message we've left with the group presidents is we're looking for natural combinations that helps us just be more efficient, give us the scale that we need to better grow synergies and better cost synergies. We have some divisions that I think if we looked at it in hindsight had too much technology or product charter overlap, and it made more sense to put them together. So, it's not going to be one division. We still believe in a decentralized model. We still believe in driving that P&L ownership closest to our team members. But, I think you'll continue to see us do more in 2017 not at the rate that you saw us do in 2016.", "Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "And is there a lot of other \u2013 this is the last one, sorry to take so long. Is there a lot of product line simplification underneath those business combinations or is that the next stage that you haven't dug into as deeply yet?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, that's what I was referring to that revenue profile \u2013 again, it's Tom, that revenue profile complexity. That is where we're very, very early days. And I think that's where the real juice and the tank here is. And that will help us in multi-years going forward.", "Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "All right. Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Abigail, I made my closing remarks already. So, I think we can conclude the call.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, this concludes our call.

Following Tom's comments, I will provide a review of the company's third quarter FY 2016 performance together with the revised guidance for FY 2016. Tom will provide a few summary comments and then we'll open the call for a Q&A.", "At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to slide number four.", "Thomas L. Williams", "Thanks Jon, good morning and welcome everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation. So today we are going to cover four key topics with you. First, I'll summarize the third quarter results. Second, some commentary on key market trends, give an update on the revised full-year guidance and finally I'll highlight some of the progress we're making on the key initiatives under New Win Strategy.", "So beginning with the third quarter results, sales declined 10.6% as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by 1.5% and organic sales declined approximately by 9.4%. Total order rates for the third quarter declined 6% compared with the same quarter last year. This is a sequential improvement from the second quarter.", "Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.37 or $1.51 adjusted for business realignment, which was ahead of our expectations. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 10.5%.", "During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $450 million. We have now repurchased $1.8 billion in shares since October 2014. However, the most impressive accomplishment of the third quarter was our margin performance. I\u2019m very pleased to be delivered total segment operating margins of 13.8% or 14.7% on adjusted basis. This represents a 30 basis points improvement year-over-year in adjusted margins which is a significant accomplishment given the difficult economic conditions we are facing.", "During the third quarter, we delivered decrementals margin return on sales of 17% or 11.8% adjusted for business realignment expenses. This demonstrates excellent performance by our team. This quarter remarks the 5", "Year-to-date we have also held SG&A flat at 12.1% of the sales despite of $1.2 billion drop in sales, another significant accomplishment by our team. Our performance during such a sustained period of lower sales and order rates is unprecedented. It demonstrates Parker\u2019s ability to create a more adaptable cost structure and deliver less difficult financial performance.", "So now a few brief comments on key end-markets, so reflecting on the order rates over the past year, we are encouraged with a point of moderating with the decline. More specifically from Q2 to Q3, we saw number of end-markets moved from what we would classify as accelerating decline to decelerating decline, which is a good sign.", "We will continue to monitor additional data points in the coming months to help solidify our interpretation of the direction of the macroeconomic trends, we will provide you an update in our August call. As usual we will provide more details on our specific end-market during the Q&A portion of this call.", "Switching to the outlook. For fiscal year 2016, we\u2019re increasing our guidance for earnings to the range $6.20, $6.40 per share on an adjusted basis, which resulted in earnings midpoint of $6.30 per share. Adjusted guidance represents $0.20 increase from our previous estimate at the midpoint, increase can be attributed third quarter - and incremental savings we\u2019re now seeing from the realignment actions we\u2019ve taken year-to-date.", "We also now anticipate higher business realignment expenses, which for the full-year will go from a $100 million to $120 million or $0.63 per share. As we move deeper into the New Win Strategy initiatives our global teams have identified additional near-term actions that will generate attractive front on investment. These actions will position us well for future growth and profitability.", "Now let me give you some highlights from the New Win Strategy, we continue to make meaningful progress with our one strategy initiatives to increase team member engagement, deliver premier customer experience and drive over all growth and financial performance.", "Let me take a moment to update you on progress in a couple of select areas. Starting with safety, we\u2019ve a 29% reduction in reportable injuries comparing to the third quarter of fiscal 2016 with the same period a year-ago on our rolling 12-month basis. This reflects safety engagement across the organization and the progress of our safety focused high performance teams.", "Our goal is to reach zero accidents, the significance for our shareholders is that safe operations are productive operations, which translate to excellent financial results. Our simplification initiative is gaining tremendous momentum throughout the organization. The focus is on four key areas, revenue complexity, organization structure and process, division consolidations and bureaucracy. It\u2019s a strategic revenue of our over head but also strategy review of our organization and process to improve our customers experience with Parker and also to only drive growth.", "I\u2019ll give you few examples with that. Our division consolidations have yielded cost savings and will generate technology and products introduced for future growth. Our sales force organization we designed is providing more effective alignment between our customers, distributors and divisions. An another example, normally at this time of the year, we\u2019re working through an extensive annual planning process.", "This year, we greatly simplified that process and dramatically reduced the amount of time that goes into developing our annual plan. what used to five-months, now takes eight-weeks. In August we will share the output from this process in the form of our guidance for fiscal year 2017.", "Innovation activity continues to be strong and will position us well when the macro conditions stabilize, I\u2019ll give you a three examples on innovation front. Several years-ago, we commercialized a series of thermally conductive sensible gels to help cool delicate electronic components and mobile devices and automotive applications, such as closed room avoidance. That product series continues to do well for us today in these fast growing markets. During the third quarter, we were particularly pleased to receive the FDA approval of our groundbreaking exoskeleton technology Indego.", "Indego was approved for clinical and personal use by individuals for spinal cord injury which allows them to walk again. With approvals now in the U.S. and Europe, we\u2019re positioned for a full commercial launch of Indego. Remarkably, we went from an idea to launch in less than three-years an already generate initial sales in FY 2016.", "Plan for launch next year is a C&G fuel regulator modular, which optimizes fuel emissions for class five to eight trucks. This module is a one-piece design that increases multiple products into a central compact system. We\u2019re optimistic about the commercial viability of this important product. These examples showcases just some of the highlights from the past, present and future innovations that creates vitality and growth from new products and technologies.", "So in summary, by executing the New Win Strategy we are confident we\u2019ll achieve our key financial objective by end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of a 150 basis points higher and the rate of global industrial production. We\u2019re also targeting [17%] (Ph) segment operating margins and progress total towards these goals is expected to drive in compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period.", "I am very pleased at how far we have come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future as we strive to make Parker top cortile performing company as compared to our proxy peers.", "So for now, I\u2019ll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter.", "Jon P. Marten", "Thanks Tom and at this time please refer to slide number five, I\u2019ll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $151 versus $2.06 for the same quarter and year-ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.14 and comparison $0.04 for the same quarter last year.", "On the slide number six, you will find a significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $2.60 for the third quarter FY 2015 to a $51 for the third quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted per share income include the impact of fewer shares outstanding equating to an increase of $0.05 per share and lower corporate G&A and interest equating to $0.04 due to reduction of long-term incentive accruals and our simplification efforts.", "Reductions to adjusted per share income include other expense that total $0.33 per share as compared to the prior year in which last year sizeable one-time favorable currency adjustments were recognized lower adjustment segment operating income of $0.21 per share due to the impact of the weakened end-market and $0.10 from increase effective tax rate driven by various discrete items booked in the quarter.", "Moving to slide number seven, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the third quarter. Total company organic sales in the third quarter decreased by 9.4% over the same quarter last year, there was a 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was relatively in line with our guidance equating to a negative impact of reported sales of 1.5% in the quarter.", "Total company\u2019s segment operating margins for the third quarter adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 14.7% versus 14.4% for the same quarter last year. We are especially pleased with this performance given the end-market softness. Realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $8 million last year. As forecasted previously, the lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $417 million versus $456 million last year reflects the impact of a reduced volume and the unfavorable mix from the weakening of industrial end-markets.", "Moving to slide number eight, I\u2019ll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the third quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 12.7% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact in currency of 0.8% in the quarter.", "Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was an impressive 16.9% of sales versus 16.4% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred totaled $9 million as compared to $1 million in prior year. Adjusted operating income was $211 million as compared to $236 million driven by reduced volume as a result of the weakening in our key end-markets.", "On slide number nine, I\u2019ll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on this slide. Organic sales for the third quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 8.7%, currency negative impacted sales by 3.1%. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs was 11.9% of sales versus 12.7% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $16 million as compared to $7 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $121 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of weaker end-markets.", "I\u2019ll now move to slide number 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased 2% for the quarter. Currency impact was negligible, sales for the period was impacted by some softness in helicopter and business jets. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15.1% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $85 million as compared to $74 million last year reflecting a combination of higher aftermarket sales volume mix, reduced development costs as a percent of sales and implementation of the New Win Strategy.", "Moving to slide number 11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represented trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders were a negative 6% for the quarter-end, reflecting less negative quarter rates and Industrial segments and Aerospace segment or orders turning positive. Diversified Industrial North American orders improved to negative 9%. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to negative 6% for the quarter. Aerospace Systems orders improved to a positive 1% for the quarter.", "Now turning to slide number 12 on cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $681 million, when adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was $81 million or 10.5% of sales. This compares to 8.3% of sales for the same period last year.", "In addition to the pension contribution discussed earlier, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $707 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases of dividends, $68 million for acquisitions closed during Q1. No acquisitions were announced in the Q3, $111 million for CapEx equating to 1.3% of sales year-to-date.", "The revised full-year earnings guidance for FY 2016 is outlined on slide number 13. Guidance is being provided on in adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share excluded expected business realignment charges or approximately $120 million, the balance of which are forecasted to be incurred in Q4 of FY 2016. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 11.9 to negative 9.9 or negative 10.9 at the midpoint as compared to last year.", "Adjusted organic growth as in midpoint is negative 8.2. Currency in the guidance negatively impacted sales by three, the majority of which is attributed to the industrial international segment. We have calculated the impact of currency the stock range as of March 31, 2016. And we have held those rates steady as we estimate the result in year-over-year impact for the balance of 2016.", "For total Parker, adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.7% and 14.9% or 14.8% at the midpoint, this compares to 14.9% for FY 2015 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to those level of adjusted segment operating margins, given the magnitude of the end-market declines.", "The guidance for below the line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and other is $478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full-year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in our full-year guidance is $137 million.", "And for the full-year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis has been increased to $6.20 to $6.40 or $6.30 at the midpoint. The guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $120 million to be incurred in FY 2016. Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected in the amount of $85 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins.", "Slide number 14, you will find the reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY 2016 as reported EPS guidance of $5.67 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY 2016 EPS of $5.60 per share. Increases includes $0.18 in segment operating income as a result of simplification efforts, an increased savings from restructuring actions taken to-date and $0.08 from reduced corporate G&A, interest and share count.", "The company's decision to increase full-year realignment cost to $120 million results in an additional expense of $0.13 per share. Income taxes and other expense projected comprise additional expense of $0.06, reflecting discrete items in current projections.", "On slide number 15, you will find a reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 per share at the midpoint from prior FY 2016 EPS of $6.10. As previously detailed, increases included $0.18 and segment operating income and $0.08 from reduce corporate G&A, interest and share count.", "This is partially offset by $0.06 increased in other expense and taxes. Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions, divestitures that might be closed during FY 2016. For consistency purposes, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates. This concludes my prepared comments.", "Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments.", "Thomas L. Williams", "Thanks Jon. I\u2019m very encouraged by the response of our Parker team members around the world. We are well in the challenges of our end-markets and delivering impressive performance. Our team is embracing changes design to improve Parker and positions for the future under the framework of the New Win Strategy. Together we are building a stronger and better Parker, I look forward to sharing more with you on our progress.", "And at this time, we are going to take questions. So Brian, if you could just get us started.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "My pleasure [Operator Instruction] We ask an interest of time that you please limit yourself to one preliminary question and one follow-up [Operator Instruction] Our first question is from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Jamie Cook", "Good morning. I guess a couple questions. One, Tom, I guess everyone is interested in sort of the order sales trends that you saw throughout the first quarter and potentially what you are seeing in the month of April. Are there any markets that you sort of see bottoming or perhaps even seeing some green shoots without being too optimistic? And then I guess just my second question to you is, with one quarter left - in the year, you upped your restructuring again. As we are thinking about 2017, do we think we've done enough restructuring given your view on the markets that we just have to execute on what's already out there, or could there be potential for more as we think about 2017? Thanks.", "Thomas L. Williams", "Okay Jamie this is Tom. So I\u2019ll start first with order trends. So orders during the quarter sequentially got better as we saw January going through March, and obviously what we saw in April is consistent with the guidance that we gave you. As far as the markets go, I finish all my comment and will let Lee give you some deeper color, but I made the comment about that we saw a number of markets move from accelerating declined to decelerating declined.", "So I think the theme of what we are seeing is this moderation of decline and the movers from accelerating to decelerating have really lead to charge or distribution general industrial ag, mining and similar account and you asked for some of a positive markets. The positive markets are refrigeration and air conditioning, rail, turf, aerospace, commercial MRO and powergen. and now I'll let Lee go into more details in a minute on all the market color.", "On the restructuring we moved to from a $100 million and $120 million and just to clear the year for people listening on the phone, this isn\u2019t because we saw some market change or worsening of orders that we felt we need to do this. It really was we saw more opportunities as we started unpeel the New Win Strategy being implemented within the company, there were just more opportunities that our team members around the world identified in traditional restructuring and simplification and et cetera, that we thought would be a very good to take now and that will put us in good position in FY 2017.", "But you asked about 2017, now in my opening comments I talked about we moved this to an eight-week process, we are only three-weeks into it, so I won't comment about 2017, as you might imagine commenting about 2017 in April is harder than commenting about it in August. However, I will you give some color on the restructuring.", "So restructuring is year I would call a high watermark, $120 million and if you looked at us traditionally before kind of the restructuring we've done over the last several years, we are more in that $20 million $25 million range. Now well the restructuring is not finalized, what we think next year and we are only about half way through our reviews, I think we are looking at something that\u2019s in between the traditional $20 million to $25 million and $120 million that we did this year. So that\u2019s my take in your comments Jamie, if it\u2019s okay, I'll let Lee take over with giving you a lot more color on the markets which I'm sure other people on the phone have questions as well.", "Jamie Cook", "Okay great.", "Lee C. Banks", "Okay, hi Jamie. So as Tom talked about sequentially total Parker organic growth moved to a better direction during the quarter. if you look at it, it was widely a result of North America followed by EMEA. I\u2019m going to walk you through the different regions and try and give you as much color as I can.", "So starting with North America industrial distribution, total North American distribution still is annualizing at a high single-digit year-over-year decline for FY 2016. Now this is mostly as we've talked about in past impacted by oil and gas, so we continue to see tightening of CapEx and OpEx budgets which has really been a drag for distribution, its most aligned with those end-markets. If you get away from that we continue to see real positive growth out of distribution in the Great Lakes. Mid West areas and cover auto plants, Tier-1 machines all these et cetera. So it\u2019s certainly a couple of different tails depending to the story depending on where you are in the country.", "Tom mentioned air conditioning and refrigeration that\u2019s really a bright spot for us, we continue to experience really strong residential air conditioning growth much of that growth can be attributed to some product introduction we've done, it's really given us a strong market participation. Our commercial air conditioning refrigeration businesses that\u2019s up low single-digits and our aftermarket business organically with the market with some new product introductions that continues to be real strong.", "The story around oil and gas, I guess major OEMs really continue to indicating no significant improvement until the end of calendar 2016 early 2017 and this is really massive and I'm sure you have covered this restructuring plans taking place. It looks like everybody is trying to restructure and look to be profitable around $40 per barrel.", "And we looked at some of those different segments, the consensus appears that really the offshore rig markets for new builds could take years to recover. I think the land base will come back sooner, but on the positive side you have heard us talk about this, we continue increase demand for some of our aftermarket service capability such as our Parker Tracking System that enables asset integrity management of field and we've had good traction with that.", "On agriculture, we expect sales of farm equipment down industry wide and our demand continues to be consistent with that. By focusing on energy, we continue to increase our market position with large frame turbine OEMs and this has been a plus because there continues to be a strong conversion of power plants from coal to natural gas in the U.S. so it has allowed us to participate in that. And we did see benefits from our wind and solar business, it did get a boos with the production tax credits and investment tax grants that were extended so that was a positive for us in the quarter.", "Turning to heavy truck in North America, current forecast, ACT forecast is now 275,000 units, which is really up from the November forecast and our North America transportation business is down high single-digits better than industry build rate declines and I would attribute this to some new product introduction. And really our aftermarket exposures there kind of softens some of that down turn.", "On the mobile markets, I think a real positive Tom mentioned turf, its North American central market but continues to be a real strong highlight for us and then with all the major construction equipment that continues to experience top-line decline. But there does seem to be a lot of industry commentary about finding a bottom here, which I'll comment more later on. And the in plant automotive, really this is a key North American distribution that covers that and we're up Q3 versus prior and continue to do well there.", "Just touching on Europe distribution trends are consistent with really last quarter distribution side, the industrial MRO automotive markets continue to be flat to slightly positive and then anything tied to oil and gas as I mentioned before continues to be weak. I think one of the bright spots for us really contained in our Win Strategy initiatives is distribution is up in emerging markets Eastern Europe, Africa. These are high single-digits, combination of organic growth within the region, but cost effective increased market participation by us.", "Oil and gas demand across all those related markets continue to contract. We've talked about North Sea investment and that really still is a bit of a standstill, but then again this is another area where we've had some really decent experience with our aftermarket integrity management initiatives offsetting some of the contraction that we see at a first fit level. And then on Ag, we have seen sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, still flat year-over-year, but the production we're seeing now I would call an increase in normal seasonality.", "On heavy truck stronger demand continues in the quarter and this is really following a strong fiscal Q2, we saw demand sequentially from Q2 to Q3. And mobile demand is stabilized at current activity level. We did have a large exhibitive at the recent [indiscernible] show and I think all of us were encouraged by one of the attendance, but also the favorable settlement taking place at the show. So may it gives us some freedom to do somewhat positive going forward.", "Turning to Asia now, really distribution then is flat to moderately down year-over-year, China is the biggest issue, it\u2019s the most sluggish it\u2019s down high single-digits year-over-year. If I take that out, we\u2019re up across the region, I give this a lot of credit to what our guys are doing on expansion and we've talked to you about such as [indiscernible] in some of these developing markets. So we continue to expand there.", "Energy across the region, we still seeing increased activity and renewable which wind solar and hydro and traditional thermal energy, coal, gas and nuclear store taking the major share and we are participating in those. We always talked about, Tom mentioned that is an accelerating growth, it continues to be great story, we've commented for some time on the strengths of this in market in China. And China has really become a preferred builder, we\u2019ve recently signed high speed rail contracts with Laos, Thailand and Indonesia and we continue to have strong exposure to build rails.", "And then on mobile construction, we have seen some modest growth in China and I have heard some industry comments regarding that. I will tell you that for the most part, the OEM inventory is still extremely high, so I think it will take some time for us to see that but our business has stabilized in current levels. And then lastly, just touching on Latin America, I think it\u2019s really dominative by the Brazil story, our construction equipment, Ag markets, etcetera is still very soft.", "But there is decent activity if you get outside Brazil, but the whole story in Latin America is really dwarfed by Brazil. So taking all together total Parker organic growth sequentially moved in a better direction, largely as resulted of I mentioned North America and EMEA. And I think moderately declining and the words that keep coming to our minds to describe what we\u2019re seeing on a year-over-year basis.", "Jamie Cook", "Okay, thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open please go ahead.", "Joseph Ritchie", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess my first question is around the restructuring actions. I know it's hard to comment much at this point on 2017, but it seems like the payback that you got on these actions, the additional realignment actions, is really good. I guess my question is how are you thinking about - when you are thinking about the magnitude of restructuring for next year, how are you thinking about the potential payback and is it going to be mostly headcount-related?", "Thomas L. Williams", "Jo, this is Tom. So, on the restructuring I would just say in general, we\u2019re really pleased with our team, team around the world. The execution has been timely, we've been thoughtful on how we've done it and I'm just very proud of how the team has performed on the restructuring and that\u2019s been a big part of the timeliness and that has been a big part of what's helped our margins perform this year.", "As far as next year, we\u2019re going through, I still think my characterization would be somewhere between the $120 million to $120 million to $125 million, is probably a good indicator. I still think that for the most part as restructuring is a pretty good payback from a time period standpoint, usually the 12-month indicator obviously it\u2019s in a more traditional or international orientated type of restructuring, will take longer, probably 18-month to 24-months. But in general it would still be aimed at the more strategic restructuring that we've been talking about which is at the forehead of the company, but we\u2019ll continue to look at as we just traditionally have the footprint optimization as it makes sense.", "Joseph Ritchie", "Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, Tom, your comments earlier about going from an accelerating to a decelerating decline, I'm just curious within that context what's going on with the pricing environment? Are you seeing any pressure across the portfolio today? Have you started to see stabilization there as well, just curious? Any color there would be helpful.", "Lee C. Banks", "Joe this is Lee, I\u2019ll just give you some comments on that. So I would characterize price realization is very tough candidly. We did raise prices to distribution in this past January, its mostly around non-core and late lifecycle type of products, but we did realize price there. But one thing we do track and you\u2019ve heard us talk about this in the past, we have an SPI Index which tracks year-over-year pricing by partner. And we have a PPI which tracks our input costs. And we do have a positive spread here and we look at continuously. So I would say if you had to characterizes overall, it\u2019s pretty much flat.", "Joseph Ritchie", "And Lee, is that spread mostly being driven by the denominator? Is it just because the cost environment has remained favorable and could that potentially reverse itself as we progress through the year??", "Lee C. Banks", "I would say top-line, the SPI number is flat, as I talked about, but the PPI is giving us the spread, yes.", "Joseph Ritchie", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.", "Jeffrey Hammond", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "Thomas L. Williams", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Hammond", "Just on the buyback, it looks like it slowed here a little bit and M&A has kind of been weak. I just thought as we come on the deadline for this $2 billion to $3 billion, we would be tracking more towards the high end. Maybe just update us on how you are thinking about buyback?", "Thomas L. Williams", "Jeff, this is Tom. So in the buyback, we continue to look at that on a dynamic basis, looking at what makes the most sense for our shareholders and obviously, we\u2019ll update you every quarter. But some things to just keep in mind from consideration. When you look at our cash that\u2019s on the balance sheet 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. It\u2019s important to us to maintain A rating, so that\u2019s a factor that we consider. And then when we rolled out $2 billion to $3 million initiatives that was in October 2014, we were a $13 billion company then and now we were $11.3 billion.", "So a number of things have changed. Our cash flow as a percent of sales continues to do very well at 10.5%. We\u2019re going to continue to deploy cash as efficiently as we can, we look at the best ways to deploy it and what gives the long-term value creation to our shareholders. On the acquisition side, the pipeline is active, but it\u2019s always hard to predict the output there, it tends to be lumpy.", "But I would say valuations are still challenging at this point with pricing probably starting to moderate a little bit, but we\u2019re disciplined buyers and we buy things that are in spaces that we understand. And we understand the growth rates, so we\u2019ll continue to be that way. But I think you\u2019ll look to see us be as efficient and aggressive with our deployment of cash as we possibly can weighing all the variables to try to do the best thing we can on the long-term behalf of the shareholders.", "Jeffrey Hammond", "Okay. That's helpful. And then it looks like the guide is mostly North America feeling a little bit better and I think you mentioned some of the restructuring. But just go into a little more detail on what is surprising you to the upside in the North America business?", "Thomas L. Williams", "Well, Jeff, I think Lee probably did a pretty good job of taking you all through that, but in North America, when you look at it sequentially, almost everything was positive in North America. Some of that we get just from the calendar helping us, but in particular the part that I like is that when you look at - in case people don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m talking about these market phases, so you have got accelerating growth and decelerating growth and you have got accelerating decline and decelerating decline. And if I was to show you this dot map of our end-markets in these four phases and if you look at it in Q2, you could see a lot of dots in the accelerating decline.", "And what\u2019s moved and I would say in particular in North America, it\u2019s been distribution, Ag, semicon, mining, general industrial, but I think the thing we are cautious about is that I think we are getting help from comps for the most part and that at this point still too early, I think to say that there is a general market shifts. So we\u2019re going to continue to look at that data, we need a few more months and another quarter or two to help confirm that.", "But in the healing process of order entry, step one is to have a decelerating or moderation of decline, so that\u2019s the good thing we are very happy about that. And to put up the kind of numbers we are putting up in this kind of climate I think if you look at us historically is remarkable. And I\u2019ve told a lot of people, when we get to flat, you are going to love the numbers, because flat will be the new high and then we\u2019ll continue to grow from there.", "Jeffrey Hammond", "Yes, but on the margin front, is that just greater traction on some of the restructuring, or what really drove the guidance or vision on North America margins??", "Thomas L. Williams", "I\u2019m sorry, Jeff. I thought you were talking about sales, but, yes, on margins, it was clearly the return on the restructuring and the simplification actions. We\u2019ve seen faster return and just more effective cost savings.", "Jeffrey Hammond", "Okay thanks a lot Tom.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open, please go ahead.", "Ann Duignan", "Good morning. Can I touch back on the share repurchases? Traditionally you have always talked about having your own internal model, which you use to determine how much shares you think you should buy back or not. With the $50 million buyback, was your model telling you that Parker shares were fairly valued in the quarter?", "Thomas L. Williams", "Ann, it's Tom. It's always a good time to buy Parker shares. We just looked at - again it's fair to looking at all the opportunities and opportunities we can't share all opportunities with it. When we look at all the opportunities we thought the amount that we did was the right amount. We will continue to look at every quarter, we wave obviously dividends first, investment for organic growth.", "And if you look at the balance between acquisitions and share repurchase i.e. For the reasons I talked about earlier would be an indicator why we are going to be at the low end of that range because the dynamics of the world have changed once we announce that proposal. We are absolutely committed to the low end of that range, I don\u2019t want anybody to misunderstand me, but things have changed as far as we look at to the top end of the range. The balance above that is all depending on what is the best use of cash for our shareholders.", "Ann Duignan", "Right. That's very helpful clarification. And then my follow-up is back to some of the comments you made about restructuring the sales force. We get nervous when we hear other companies talking about restructuring the sales force. It doesn't always work out very well. Could you just give us a little bit more detail on what you are doing there and how comfortable you feel about the progress you are making?", "Thomas L. Williams", "Yes Ann, this is Tom again. We are very, very happy with what we are doing there. I can understand your reservations, but this was done with a lot of thought and here they change, so our groups are organized with exception Aerospace organized around technology and products. And it's easier alignment for our division that they can find the people that own those income products and technologies.", "So in Europe as an example, we went from a sales force that was maybe heavily dominated on alignment at the markets to being more products centric was still not giving at the markets having that they have lesser concentration or more concentration on technologies and markets, so that we can have a real good technology discussion with our customers. The other part we did to help simplify interface with the global OEMs with our regional OEMs is in Europe as we now have a 10 Europe OEM teams, which is very similar to what we had in North America, which had someone to access.", "So we had that two, because it didn\u2019t make sense to be calling on OEMs country-by-country that span the entire Europe. So that\u2019s been in place, in probably six-months to nine-months and we are very incurred with the kind of market share actions that we are seeing coming out of that from that team. And then just in Japan that was the other example that comes in my mind when I made that comment.", "In Japan if you look at us historically, we had a very fragmented sales force, we now have a sales force that is all aligned that is kind of because of the combination of acquisitions that we had in joint ventures years-ago. Now we have a one Japan sales force with a much better alignment on the operating side and we are seeing the results that Japan is doing very well for us. So the organization changes to give you comfort are showing in the numbers and in the market concentrations, so we go account-by-account in various regions.", "Ann Duignan", "Okay. Thank you so much. I will leave it there and get back in line. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "David Raso", "Apologies in advance. I've been hopping between a few calls. But quite simply, looking at the rate of businesses that you have right now and their various growth rates and not thinking of any change, but incorporating seasonality, when would you expect your organic sales to be back to flat?", "Thomas L. Williams", "Dave it's Tom again. So that is of course the question everybody would like to know and at this point it's difficult for me to predict. And I won't try to predict that I mean at this point our guidance for the fourth quarter is a minus seven organically, so that\u2019s was a improvement from the minus 9.4 we had in Q3. So that\u2019s the first good sign and like I said in these market phase is when we look at all the markets, we went from a concentration in accelerating decline to now more than move decelerating decline.", "We would hope to keep moving kind of clockwise around these phases and start to moving to some kind of growth. But I think it's too early to - honestly we haven\u2019t given indicator of that we would tell you when. Few more data points, couple more months and couple more quarters obviously we are going to be in much better position to tell you, but I would say this with the first step in the hilling.", "David Raso", "Okay. That's fine. Just wanted to get your perspective on that. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow. Your line is now open, please ahead.", "Eli Lustgarten", "Good morning, everyone. Can we talk a little bit about where inventory levels are both in the distribution sense and the OEM the best you can [indiscernible]. Are we really passed all the inventory organization, or is there still some going on? And with the pricing, you raised prices at distribution, but we keep hearing distribution people are having trouble passing anything on. Are they taking the price increase and absorbing it, or are they able to pass it through?", "Lee C. Banks", "Eli it\u2019s Lee. I was expecting this inventory destocking, so I researched this 10 times before this call. So here is the consensus when I checked this not only from our guys and then I just go out and cal our contacts. If you are involved in oil and gas and you had a lot of OEM exposure, you are still sitting on a lot of inventory. If you get away from that inventory is pretty much normalized at this point in time. I think some of the guys may have gotten hit a little bit by some side effects from oil and gas, but that\u2019s fairly normalized.", "I would say on OEM inventory where I still see this kind of construction equipment, mining markets especially Asia comes to mind. If you tour some of the equipment yards, I mean there is just excavators and wheel loaders that go on for miles so. But our North American distribution, I'm most comfortable that outside of oil and gas, it\u2019s not a big issue.", "And then your second question on pricing, I can\u2019t really comment on that. What we did there was really non-core, so I can\u2019t really comment too much on that. I have not had any feedback that it\u2019s been a big issue. If anything, it\u2019s been positive with our [indiscernible].", "Eli Lustgarten", "Alright. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski", "Hi. Good morning guys.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Good morning, Josh.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski", "Just maybe to ask Raso's question a little differently. On the orders front, you guys can obviously see the comp getting easier there, orders quarterly down a little bit more than maybe the comp was, got easier this quarter. Is there a potential for orders to get back to flat in June, understanding that it may be a while longer before sales quite get there?", "Jon P. Marten", "Josh, Jon here just to be responsive to your question. Of course, we are not calling for that in our guidance going forward. When you take a look at the orders overall for Parker, we are just looking at - we were at this time last year down four and we were down nine, down 11, down 12, now we are down six. So the question is what is the rate of the incline in the reduction of the orders for the company.", "We don\u2019t have that forecasted or we\u2019re going to be looking at that very closely, it\u2019s going to be fully aligned with the end market progress that Lee and Tom have been making. And we are gaining market share, we are launching the end markets. And as Tom said, I think our best characterization is that it\u2019s a moderately decline and obviously moderating. But we\u2019ll coming out with that answer when we do our guidance in August. But right now in April, it\u2019s a little too early to give you a very detailed answer to that.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski", "Okay. And then just to revisit the buyback discussion. It sounded like maybe there were some mitigating factors in the quarter that stayed your hand, but is there a period of time that passes when some of those other opportunities go away or aren't actionable, or are actionable and you guys are left with buyback, or is this something that is a little bit more structural in nature? Just trying to get the overall strategy there maybe versus like a one-quarter event.", "Thomas L. Williams", "Yes. Well, the overall strategy hasn\u2019t change. We want to be great generators of cash and great deployers of cash. And I think the generators of cash, the Win Strategy continue to work that aggressively with the changes that we\u2019ve made we are 10.5% now. We like being that and we would like to work that even higher. And we are going to do that through continue to grow our operating earnings and continue to working capital down.", "On the deployment, it\u2019s the same priorities that I\u2019ve mentioned. It\u2019s just trying to make the businesses and I wouldn\u2019t read one thing to aggressively into one quarter on this. The buyback announcement is going to expire and my preferences to tell you every quarter what we are doing as appose to making some big announcements what we are going to do from the period going forward.", "There are some natural considerations given the amount of cash that\u2019s permanently invested overseas, our desire to keep an A rating and the fact this program was rolled out two-years ago, and a lot has changed two-years, or approximately two-years ago. But we like all those avenues and we want to be as deploying cash as we are great at generating the cash, and I would look for us to do that. And I can\u2019t show you everything that we see, but we\u2019ll continue to do the best we can on behalf of the shareholders for what we think is best long-term.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski", "Alright. Thanks again.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Casey", "Thanks. Good morning, everybody. You mentioned mining as showing decelerating declines. Can you help us on whether that was related to shipments into OEMs or an MRO comment?", "Thomas L. Williams", "I think on the mining, what we saw in generals that probably a little bit more help on the, I would say it would be both. OEM in general comparing Q2 to Q3 got a little bit better distribution got a little better as well, but for the most part it\u2019s probably more the comps that are helping us at this point. We\u2019re not ready to declare a victory in any of these areas, get a couple of more quarters and we see this move then I think we already say it\u2019s more than markets, at this point it\u2019s probably the comps helping us more than anything.", "Andrew Casey", "Okay thank you Tom and then if you cover this, I missed it I apologize on the incremental $85 million benefit you expect during this year from restructuring in simplification, how much have you realized year to data and if you can give it in the quarter?", "Jon P. Marten", "Yes Andy of the $85 million that is we are expecting $40 million of that in our Q4 so $65 million for the second half, $85 million for the year of the second half $42 million in Q4.", "Andrew Casey", "Okay and then thank you Jon and that should that step up, kind of continue into the next fiscal year or would you expect with the additional restructuring that you kind alluded to it have even more it\u2019s step up kind of back half loaded next year?", "Jon P. Marten", "Yes there is no doubt that the savings that we\u2019re getting from this year we\u2019re carefully carry through for a period of time into next year and it\u2019s too early for me to give you too much color on the numbers that the Tom was referring to early in his comments about the restructuring and the savings that we get for next year. So I don\u2019t want to give you an answer to that would be misleading, I just wanted to kind of tell you that clearly we are not going to taking a step back for saving that we\u2019re getting on, its permanent that is going to be a very helpful tailwind for us for next year.", "Andrew Casey", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Jon P. Marten", "Thank you Andy.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from lines of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is now open. please go ahead.", "Nathan Jones", "Good morning, everyone. Can we just clarify on that last point, $40 million restructuring savings in 4Q. So is $160 million annually the new run rate that you are looking at from the $120 million, or should it be a little bit higher than that?", "Jon P. Marten", "I do not think it\u2019s going be higher than that. It\u2019s not going to be $40 million for quarter going forward here Nathan. So I want to research that one further here but that\u2019s just the way that we calculate the savings here based on the restructuring that we\u2019ve done year-to-date and that would - be most of the restructuring of course that we\u2019re doing in Q4 the actual restructuring is going to give us savings next year.", "Nathan Jones", "Okay. If I could get into North American margins from a different angle here, on a year-over-year basis for the quarter you just reported, organically, you lost about $200 million of revenue. All else equal, I would think the decrementals on that should be somewhere in the vicinity of 25%. So you started about $50 million in the hole on operating income and you are up about $25 million. So from other avenues, you gained about $75 million of operating income. Could you bucket the main places that that came from, where the savings came from, what is improved execution, what is productivity, those kinds of things?", "Jon P. Marten", "Well certainly I can\u2019t detail it down to you for dollar, but as Tom and Lee had talked about the productivity that we\u2019re saying from the New Win Strategy is a significant portion of that number Nathan and as we apply the techniques that we've known for years and the ones that we\u2019re really focusing on here with the New Win Strategy, we\u2019re seeing margins in a declining environment that we\u2019ve never seen before.", "And so what gratified by that as significant portion is just additional incremental productivity that\u2019s not necessarily you know to take the place of the savings that I\u2019ve been taking about when we do those simplification efforts or the restructuring efforts that we've done in the company.", "So I can\u2019t detail it down to you, dollar-by-dollar, but what is happening with the margins and the reason why our decrementals are so impressive is because of the dedication of our employees to rebuild our efforts on productivity in the company and our ability to get savings from the restructuring that we\u2019ve done you know in the past year.", "Nathan Jones", "Yes, they were really very impressive. Just one for Lee. Lee, you talked about mobile OEM China inventory. This is an issue we've been dealing with for probably going on five years from the overstimulation coming out of the last recession in China. Any attempt at guessing when that inventory may clear?", "Lee C. Banks", "You know to be clear with you, there does seem to be some positive sentiment with some of the stimulus that the Chinese government is trying to use, but it\u2019s way too early to tell on that.", "Nathan Jones", "Okay. That's fair. Thanks very much.", "Thomas L. Williams", "Brian, I see that we are at the top of the hour, so we could just take one more question, please.", "Operator", "My pleasure. Our last question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is now open.", "Joseph Giordano", "Thanks for sneaking me in here. Quick on the decrementals, kind of like what Nathan hinted at, when I'm comparing North America to international and granted both are - decrementals have been great on both pieces of those businesses - but we are seeing more pronounced organic declines on a year-on-year basis in North America, but margin is actually going up, so can you walk us through what maybe the different types of initiatives going on, on the restructuring side between the two segments as to what might be driving even more pronounced decremental reductions in North America?", "Jon P. Marten", "Yes. Joe sure, just real quick on a top level, although we\u2019re down higher organically and you are absolutely right, in the North America than we are in international, our decremental MROS on an adjusted basis is 13 for North America versus about 19. Now in any environment that 19 in our history, in our company is a very impressive number. But it is distinguished from North America, I believe it has something to do with the level and depth of some of the restructuring that we\u2019re doing a little bit of the quicker payback in restructuring in North America versus internationally. But in both cases, we\u2019re making great progress and we\u2019re kind of - we are seeing a little bit of difference, but this historically in North America and in our industrial businesses.", "The best we\u2019ve ever done in the downturn like this especially considering the magnitude of this downturn that we\u2019re talking of a negative nine, 9.5 for the quarter and our guidance of negative seven here coming up. So the short answer is very quick actions, quick recovery, dedication on the part of our management teams both in internationally and in North America and our ability to be resilient and adaptable as a company today versus maybe in some of the prior downturns in the past periods.", "Joseph Giordano", "Great. And then just last for me, in terms of scale, maybe you could put this in the appropriate context for us on the simplification efforts and removing of divisions, things like that. How many SKUs have you guys gotten rid of on a percentage basis or something just to give us a sense of how much this has really changed??", "Thomas L. Williams", "Yes, this is Tom. That will be very difficult to answer. I couldn\u2019t even hazard I could guess. But just recognize that we are working at last couple of percent of revenue. It does carry a disproportionate amount of costs and part numbers and quote activity and that\u2019s the focus. But I couldn\u2019t you give you a guess on that amount.", "Joseph Giordano", "Alright good enough. Thanks guys.", "Thomas L. Williams", "Okay.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. This is all the time we have for questions and answers today. Thank you for your participation on today\u2019s call.

And, again, good morning, everybody, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's fourth quarter FY 2016 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom Williams and President and Chief Operating Officer Lee Banks.

Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 performance, together with the guidance for FY 2017. Tom will then provide a few summary comments, and then we'll open the call for a Q&A session.", "At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to slides number 4 and 5.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everybody on the call. We appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I'd like to cover the following key topics: our fourth quarter results, review our fiscal year 2017 guidance, and finally I'll highlight the progress we are making with the new Win Strategy.", "Let me start with the fourth quarter and full-year results, which demonstrate the progress we are making in a difficult growth environment. Fourth quarter sales were $2.96 billion or a 6% decline compared with the same quarter a year ago. This represents the second consecutive quarter that we saw a sequential improvement in sales and a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis.", "Total order rates for the fourth quarter declined 1% compared with the same quarter last year, and represented a sequential improvement from the third quarter level. By segment, North America is still weak, but our Aerospace Systems segment and international business order rates were positive on a year-over-year basis.", "Net income for the fourth quarter increased 35% to $242 million on an as-reported basis, or a 29% increase to $260 million on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.77 as reported, or $1.90 on an adjusted basis. That represents a 33% increase compared to the same quarter last year on an adjusted basis.", "Despite ongoing weakness in our end markets this quarter, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 14.8%, or 15.6% adjusted. This is tremendous performance and represents a 70 basis point improvement year over year in adjusted segment operating margins. Our adjusted decremental MROS was 2.9% for the fourth quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that our adjusted decrementals have been below 25%, which is the best level of performance I can remember in any previous downturn.", "Just a few other full-year highlights that I'd like to note. Cash flow was strong in the quarter and also the year, with cash flow from operations, excluding the discretionary pension contribution, exceeding 12% of sales, reflecting the stability of our cash generation during a downturn. We also held inventories as a percent of sales essentially flat at 10.3% in fiscal 2016 versus 10.2% in the prior year. We executed very efficiently on the $109 million worth of business realignment. Even including this restructuring, our as-reported decremental MROS was 19.5% for the full year. And, notably, we accomplished all this while sales dropped $1.35 billion, which is very difficult to do.", "Moving on to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we've repurchased $108 million in Parker's shares, bringing our total share repurchases for the fiscal year to $558 million. As we have now purchased $1.9 billion of Parker's shares since our share repurchase plan was announced in October 2014, we are on track to meet our commitments on capital deployment.", "Regarding FY 2017 guidance, we are forecasting a year of sales being flat compared with fiscal 2016. Our expectation is that organic growth will be soft in the first quarter, becoming essentially flat in quarter two, with the second half showing 1% to 2% organic growth on a year-over-year basis. For fiscal year 2017, we're issuing guidance for as-reported earnings in a range of $6.15 to $6.95 per share, or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10, for a midpoint of $6.75. Business realignment expenses are anticipated to be approximately $48 million or $0.25 per share.", "So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress with the initiatives across our four broad goals: engage people, premier customer experience, profitable growth, and financial performance.", "Regarding our first goal, engage people. During this past year, we saw a 33% reduction in recordable injuries. We continue to target a zero-accident safety goal, not only because it's our responsibility to our team members, but also because improved safety performance can be a leading indicator of improved financial performance. Our high-performance teams are driving this improvement in safety as well as quality, cost, and delivery.", "Now on the second goal, premier customer experience. On July 1 of this year, we launched our Likely to Recommend (6:33) initiative, which is designed to get direct feedback from customers and distributors on areas where we can improve. Importantly, we are gathering this feedback in a way that every site at Parker can understand and track their performance and make improvements. This is a significant initiative, because a better customer experience will drive faster organic growth for Parker. We're also making good progress in building our e-business capabilities that will deliver a best-in-class online experience for customers. And we are making progress developing our pipeline of Internet of Things applications across groups and product lines to enhance the value we bring to customers.", "Now, moving to the third goal, profitable growth. We continue to drive innovative products and systems, expand distribution, and build our service business as part of our sales growth strategy. Acquisitions will play a role in our growth plans. We recently closed a transaction in Europe to acquire certain businesses of the J\u00e4ger group to strengthen our position in worldwide sealing markets as part of our Engineered Materials Group.", "And lastly, our financial performance goal. Profitability in Aerospace is improving as we benefit from lower non-reoccurring engineering costs that were associated with some of the large program wins that we had, and improved operational efficiencies. Our simplification initiative is also gaining momentum across the company, as we discover more ways to streamline operations and better serve our customers. The best way to illustrate this is to look at our employment trends. The total number of Parker team members employed at the end of FY 2016 is at 2004 levels, or approximately 48,000 people. In fiscal 2004, our reported sales were $6.9 billion, whereas today, our sales are $11.3 billion with the same number of team members.", "This is a tribute to our global team members who are working together to find better and more efficient ways to accomplish their jobs and serve our customers. The combination of our simplification and Lean enterprise initiatives is amplifying our ability to improve processes and make significant structural cost improvements. In addition, our strategic supply chain and value pricing initiatives give us sufficient horsepower to propel us to our profit margin goals in the future.", "So, in summary, by executing the new Win Strategy, we are confident we will achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020. And this includes targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production. We're also targeting 17% segment operating margins. And progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate and earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period. I am very pleased at how far we've come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future as we strive to make Parker a top-quartile performing company as compared to our proxy peers. (9:30)", "So for now I'm going to hand things back to Jon, let him give you more details on the quarter, the full year, and 2017 guidance.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Tom. And at this time please refer to slide number 6. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.", "Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.90 versus $1.43 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.47. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.13, which compares to $0.16 for the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 were $6.46 versus $7.25 for the full year 2015. Total realignment expenses and pension termination costs were $0.57 for the full year 2016, and that compares to adjustments for business realignment and voluntary retirement expenses of $0.28 for the full year 2015.", "On slide number 7, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.43 for the fourth quarter of 2015 to $1.90 for the fourth quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted per-share income include a reduction of corporate G&A; interest and other expense equating to $0.14 per share, which is a result of savings realized from FY 2016 simplification efforts, as Tom just mentioned; one-time credits booked in Q4 FY 2016; and the comparison to a higher expense in Q4 2015 from early retirement expenses incurred, and a lower effective tax rate in FY 2016 of 28% versus 40.9% in Q4 of 2015. This all contributed to $0.30 per share. The impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company's share repurchase activity equated to an increase of $0.05 per share. A reduction of $0.02 in adjusted per-share income was a result of lower adjusted segment operating income, which was driven by the strengthened U.S. dollar currency translation and weakened end markets, which approximates a little bit more than $200 million quarter to quarter.", "On slide number 8, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 for the full year 2015 to $6.46 for the full year 2016. For the full year 2016, increases to adjusted earnings per share include reduced corporate G&A expense equating to $0.20 per share; $0.13 per share due to a lower effective tax rate of 27.6% in FY 2016 versus 29.3% in FY 2015, which is due to favorable discrete benefits booked during FY 2016; and $0.36 from fewer shares outstanding, reflecting the full-year impact of Parker's enhanced share repurchase program. Decreases to adjusted earnings per share for FY 2016 were lower segment operating income of $1 per share due to the impact of the weakened end markets and higher interest and other expense equating to $0.48 per share, which compares to a sizable one-time favorable currency adjustment recognized in FY 2015 and the full-year impact of interest expense on incremental debt issued in November of 2014.", "Moving to slide number 9, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year, total company organic sales in the fourth quarter decreased by 5.3% over the same quarter last year. There was minimal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than our guide, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $31 million or 1% in the quarter.", "Total segment operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 15.6% versus 14.9% for the same quarter last year. Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $27 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $462 million versus $468 million last year reflects the meaningful impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from our very large simplification and restructuring actions taken throughout the year.", "For the full year, organic sales in fiscal year 2017 (sic) [2016] decreased by 7.7%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The effect of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $404 million or 3.2% of sales for the full year. Total company segment operating margin for fiscal year 2016, adjusted for realignment cost incurred during the year, was 14.8% versus 14.9% in fiscal year 2015. Business realignment expenses incurred in FY 2016 was $107 million.", "Slide number 10 discusses the business segments. And I'll start first with the Diversified Industrial North America segment. For the fourth quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 10.3% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a nominal impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 0.6% in the quarter. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 18% of sales versus 17.3% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $5 million, as compared to $15 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $226 million, as compared to $244 million, which was driven by the reduced volume as a result of the key industrial weak markets.", "For the full year, organic sales for the fiscal year 2016 decreased by 12.4%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $60 million or 1% of sales for the full year. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment cost was 16.8% of sales versus 17% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $42 million as compared to $16 million in fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2016 was $832 million as compared to $972 million in the prior year.", "Now, turning to slide number 11, I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segments. Organic sales for the Diversified Industrial International segment \u2013 organic sales for the fourth quarter in the segment decreased by 3%. Currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for business realignment costs, was 12.6% of sales versus 10.9% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $18 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $137 million as compared to $124 million, which, despite the weakened top line, reflects the offsetting savings resulting from realignment actions taken in the current year as well as the prior fiscal years.", "For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year 2016 decreased by 6%. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $339 million or a negative 7.1% of sales for the year. For the full year 2016, operating margin, adjusted for realignment costs, was 12.3% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses totaled $61 million as compared to $27 million in fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2016 was $509 million as compared to $611 million last year.", "And I'll now move to slide number 12 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 2.2% for the quarter. Neither acquisitions nor currency really impacted revenues. Strong growth in military OEM and military aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance. Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 16.4% of sales versus 16.9% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $1 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was flat at $99 million for both Q4 2016 and the prior year, reflecting the impact of the reduced commercial sales volume in the quarter, albeit partially offset by reduced development costs as a percentage of sales.", "For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year 2016 increased by 0.5% of sales. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 15.1% of sales versus 13.5% in prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $4 million as compared to $6 million related in the prior year. And adjusted operating income for the fiscal year was $341 million as compared to $305 million last year, which was largely attributed to the reduction of development cost to slightly less than 8% of sales, together with the savings from the business realignment activities.", "Going to slide number 13. Moving to that slide is a detail about order changes by segment. As a reminder, our orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year over year excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders improved to a negative 1% for the quarter-end, reflecting a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets, including oil and gas, construction, and agricultural. Diversified Industrial North America orders decreased to a negative 10%. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to a positive 3% for the quarter. Aerospace System orders increased to plus 14% for the quarter.", "Looking at slide number 14, we report the cash flow from operations. For the fourth quarter, cash from operating activities was very strong at $488 million or 16.5% of sales. This compares to 16.2% of sales for the same period last year. For the full year, cash flow from operating activities for fiscal 2016 was $1.170 billion or 10.3% of sales, as compared to 10.2% last year. When adjusted for the $200 million voluntary pension contribution made during the year, adjusted cash flow from operating activities was $1.370 billion or 12.1% of sales as compared to 10.2% in fiscal 2015. There was no pension contribution made during FY 2015. The significant uses of cash during the year included $158 million for the company's repurchase of common shares and $342 million for the payment of shareholders' dividends. And there was $149 million for CapEx, equating to 1.3% of sales for FY 2016.", "Now, turning to guidance for FY 2017. The full-year earnings guidance for FY 2017 is outlined here. Guidance is provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2017. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to positive 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is flat. Currency in the guidance is not forecasted to impact sales. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of June 30, 2016, and we hold those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming FY 2017.", "Total Parker adjusted segment operating are margins forecast to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. This compares to 14.8% for FY 2016 on an adjusted basis. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest, and other expense, is $469 million for the year at the midpoint. The full-year tax rate is projected at 29%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full-year guidance is 135.5 million. And for the full-year guidance, on an adjusted earnings per share, is $6.40 to $7.10, or $6.75 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be included in FY 2017. This is the only adjustments that we make to our guidance. It's just realignment expenses. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25 savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million and are fully reflected in the adjusted operating margin guidance range.", "Some additional key assumptions for the fiscal year guidance are sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half, which is a normal distribution split for a year for us. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 46% in the first half, 54% in the second half. EPS in the first half versus the second half is $2.93 and $3.82 for the second half. Q1 FY 2017 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.52 at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.09 of business realignment expenses.", "On slide number 16, just some influences on EPS for 2017 as compared to 2016. On slide 16, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY 2016 EPS of $6.46 per share. Increases include $0.40 from an increased segment operating income and $0.11 from fewer shares outstanding and reduced interest expense.", "Key components of the decrease include a $0.13 per share reduction from taxes, reflecting a rate from continuing operations of 29%, and $0.09 per share reduction from increased corporate G&A and other expense as a result of normalized levels, not including one-time favorable settlements realized in the prior year, primarily in Q4, in part by reduced pension expense due to the company's adoption of the spot rate methodology for calculating annual pension expense. This has a total impact of $0.11 for FY 2017. Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisition and divestitures that might close during FY 2017. For consistency, we ask that you exclude only the restructuring expenses from your published estimates.", "This concludes my prepared remarks. Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you for your summary comments.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jon. We are very proud of the fiscal 2016 results. I'd like to thank Parker team members around the world for their efforts. These accomplishments carry even greater significance given the $1.35 billion drop in sales that occurred during the year. While we still have much more to achieve, we are positioned well for fiscal 2017 and beyond under the framework provided by the Win Strategy. Together, we are building a stronger and better Parker. I look forward to sharing more with you as the year progress.", "So at this time, Candace, we're ready to take questions if you want to go ahead and open the lines.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Good morning. I guess a couple questions on the guidance. One of the things that struck me is generally when you guys guide for the fiscal year you come in well below consensus and you're sort of at the midpoint, which struck me. So any comment on that? But specifically, I'm trying to get comfortable with \u2013 can you give color on the orders in North America, which I think were down in the 10% range, which I guess surprised me. So I'm trying to bridge that with your sales guidance in North America, which seems more optimistic. And then at the same time, on a down sales year over year, you're expecting margin improvement on an adjusted basis. So if you could address those issues, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Jamie, it's Tom. Let me just \u2013 the topics are kind of interwoven, so I'll start with the guide, what was behind it. And I'll start with, in case those of you that were on the phone didn't hear my opening comments, this is going to be year of sales leveling off, which after the sharp reduction that we had last year is going to be a very refreshing change for all of our people around the world. But the way we forecasted this is Q1's going to be soft, moving to essentially flat in Q2 with 1% to 2% sales growth in the second half.", "So our thoughts behind the numbers. The natural resource related end markets \u2013 so construction, ag, mining, and oil and gas \u2013 are moderating. Now, they're going to continue to be, year over year when we finish 2017, negative. But they're going to get to be less and less of a drag, especially in the second half. When you look at order entry that we had in Q4, in particular what drove our thoughts with international is that we had a positive international, plus 3%, and that was made up of Europe being basically flat, minus 1% in that area; Asia, plus 6%; and Latin America, plus 19%. So what's really driving our international sales forecast is a forecast of Europe being relatively flat and Asia-Pacific and Latin America being up a little bit, driving an international forecast of plus 2%.", "Now, you talk about North America. Now, what we saw in Q4 I characterized as continued choppiness around what we saw from Q3 to Q4. I mean, during the quarter, April started off a little bit softer than we would've liked. And then May and June were a little bit better. What we're seeing for North America for the full year, to give you some context as to the negative 3% that we have out there, is that we have a first half of minus 5% and a second half of minus 1%. And what's driving that is if you look at the natural resource related end markets that I described, they really bottomed the North America in our second half of the year.", "So we're not really anticipating any new catalysts \u2013 any new activity that's going to drive growth or sustainability beyond our current levels for natural resources. But what you're seeing in North America is easier comps in the second half, and we do have growth in North America in non-natural resource related markets like machine tools, telecom, life sciences, turf, refrigeration, that is going to now help to offset some of that \u2013 not completely because we're still end the North America at a minus 3%.", "Now, if I could, I'm just going to give you context \u2013 our view for the total end markets for the whole fiscal 2017, and I want to put an asterisk by this. I'm not trying to describe the entire end market. I'm just trying to describe our performance in that end market. So I have them in three buckets, positive, neutral, and negative. So on the positive side, what makes up our forecast is aerospace, lawn and turf, passenger rail, refrigeration and air conditioning, semicon, and telecom. In the neutral area is automotive, distribution, and life sciences, and power generation. Now, of significance is distribution in neutral now. Well, that's not an end market, it's a big channel for us, and the fact that distribution moves to neutral helps the year stabilize quite a bit. And then under negative is construction, farm and ag, forestry, general industrial, heavy-duty truck, marine, mining, and oil and gas.", "So that's the landscape, and I probably gave you more than you wanted to know, but that's what we think for 2017.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "That's helpful on the top line. Sorry, just to clarify, though, because I'm trying to understand the margin story.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, all right.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Like if you could tell me the incremental savings from restructuring actions taken in 2016 that help 2017, and then the $48 million of charges in 2017, how much of that do we realize? The $48 million in cost, how much of that do we realize in savings? And I'm assuming most of that's in North America. And then I'll get back in queue. Thank you.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Jamie, Jon here. Just for the restructuring in FY 2017, of the $48 million, we're expecting $30 million in savings in FY 2017. And the restructuring savings that would have been incurred based on FY 2016 actions rolling into FY 2017 is about $25 million. So that is obviously helping our margins going forward, and it's a big driver to our future health, as Tom outlined earlier. So those are the details there. They are about half North America, half international. And one other way to describe them is that they're about one-half simplification efforts and one-half traditional restructuring, which would include some plant closures.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue. I appreciate the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Josh.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Yeah. Just maybe to follow up on Jamie's question a little bit. Can you talk about some of the mix dynamics that you're seeing in North America that could maybe support a bit of a margin lift here? Maybe ex restructuring, how should we think about the underlying incrementals and decrementals and the progression through the year, and maybe what you saw in the fourth quarter that gives you the confidence in that launch pad?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I mean, if I take Q4 sequentially, I was talking about there's really kind of two things that we saw: the natural resource related end markets \u2013 Josh, this is Tom, by the way, sorry. We still saw those in that minus 10% to minus 15% range, mining, oil and gas, ag, and the distribution that had exposure to that. But what gives us confidence is when you look at the non-natural resource related end markets in Q4, those saw anywhere from flat to a plus 15%, so distribution being up mid-single digits, which is a big part of North America. Machine tools, telecom, life sciences, turf, refrigeration and air conditioning has been very strong for us and automotive about flat, slightly positive. So that was really the mix that felt us good about the North America forecast.", "The other part is that we do know that the natural resource comps in those particular end markets gets much easier in the second half, which is why our first quarter for North America, we're not anticipating anything much differently than what we saw in the current quarter. Maybe a hair better because the comps get easier in the second half, is why we forecasted a better comp in the second half.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Is it fair to say that of the \u2013 and I'm sorry, Jon, I missed all the numbers that you gave for restructuring, plus carry-over restructuring. Sounded like something around $40 million, $45 million. If I take those and maybe the gap in your guidance is another $30 million or so to get to the midpoint for segment op income, fair to say that that other $30 million is mix? I mean, I guess there's really not a lot of revenue growth. Presumably, price-cost isn't an inordinate benefit this fiscal year. Just trying to bridge that extra little piece to get to the midpoint.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I mean, Josh, altogether I think you've got it. I mean, it's going to be mix. It's going to be further productivity that we're going to realize. It's going to be Lean. It's going to be the normal Parker operating protocols that we use. And we are expecting, without regard to the realignment that we did in FY 2016 and we plan to do in FY 2017, to become even more productive in FY 2017. And so, yes, that's how we bridge that gap internally here.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. So, there's not a scenario, though, where on an underlying volume basis when things are still tough, decrementals kind of ex all the productivity in Lean and restructuring are very low and then you still expect them to accelerate. It sounds like volume is neutral-ish, but there's just a lot of heavy lifting that's going on behind the scenes doing most of that op improvement.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I would say that that's correct. I mean, the volume being flat, as Tom described, in North America, maybe getting a little bit better as the year goes on, and FY 2017 is going to help us from a marginal standpoint in North America and internationally. We are seeing good productivity gains that we've made from the restructurings that we've done in FY 2016 and really, frankly, for FY 2015 also. So we feel like we are very well-positioned from a cost structure standpoint, and we are poised with any tailwinds at all at the high level to really be able to generate some impressive incremental margins, once the volume turns around.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "All right. Thanks for the color, guys. I'll get back in queue.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Morning, everyone.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Hey, Nathan.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So, I think, Jon, you're talking a little bit here about volume in natural resource markets being essentially flat and the comps get easier as the year goes on. I think we kind of entered last year with a similar expectation of some improvement in the back half of the year, which obviously didn't materialize. Could you talk about the differences between what you're seeing in the market now versus 12 months ago that gives you that confidence that you are going to see a potential uptick in the second half?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Nathan, it's Tom. I think the confidence would be, if you just took oil and gas as an example. Nobody could've anticipated going back 12 months ago the rig count reduction that happened, but now the rig counts have stabilized, and the last several weeks, minus maybe a week or two, have actually improved. We're not forecasting them to get any better, but just by the comps, and the fact that they've decelerated or are starting to hold that level, it makes our second half naturally a little bit better. I don't think we're out on a limb with North America at a minus 1% in the second half, given that we normally have a second half a little bit better, and the fact that I think we've seen the worst behind us in the natural resource areas, and those non-natural resource areas that I mentioned starting to show some growth for us. So I think that's why we picked what we did. And at this point, we're as confident as we can be. Of course, every quarter we'll update you as that changes.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Is it possible for you to parse out what you think the impact might be on North American orders from the natural resource markets? I mean, you had a nice plus 3% in international and still minus 10% in North America. How much do you think natural resource markets are impacting that in North America versus international?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Nathan, it's Tom again. It's hard to do on an order basis. I'll give you what we saw sequentially on sales. This is what I was mentioning earlier. We saw natural resources in that minus 10% to minus 15% range, including the distribution related to natural resources. And then the non-natural resources were all zero to plus 15%, depending on \u2013 refrigeration and air conditioning being the strongest given this time of year. So that's the mix. And the natural resource areas \u2013 again, that's about where we've been, give or take a little bit. And as we look to the second half of the year, those comps just get easier for us, and that becomes less of a drag. And the positive end markets start to get us to the minus 1% second half that we forecasted.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And just one on how to think about the incremental margins, Tom, you mentioned in your prepared comments that you've had historically low decrementals during this down cycle, which is obviously a tribute to the business. Does it also change the profile of the incremental margins that we should be thinking about when volume returns? Is the cost structure structurally changed to the point where you would expect higher incremental margins on volume as volume comes back?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Nathan, it's Tom. I think we would. I mean, historically, when we've come out of a downturn, we would be maybe at plus 40%, and then start to \u2013 every quarter that went from the initial uptick, we start to glide down to a plus 30%, and then as you get deeper into a growth segment (42:19) you're in the 20s, potentially probably bottoming out in the upper teens. But I think what we've done structurally, and the fact that we are simpler, leaner, and have a much better cost structure, we would never been able to put up the MROSes that we put up without doing the actions that we've taken.", "And just \u2013 it's worth repeating again, the all-in reported MROS, 19.5% \u2013 so that's all the restructuring \u2013 $109 million, which is the highest restructuring we've done in the history of the company. Even with all that, we put up a 19.5% MROS. So, yes, I think it can be higher. Could I peg a number? No, that would be difficult to do, but I would expect it to be higher than we've done historically.", "Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "All right. Thanks very much for the help.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And nice job on the cost control this quarter.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Joe.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "My first question is really around just distribution. So, Tom, your comments that distribution's going to be neutral \u2013 or your (43:25) expectation is neutral in 2017. Can you give us some thoughts there? I mean, clearly as we ended the quarter, the data points that we got from the industrial markets were pretty weak. We got a slightly more positive data point today from Fastenal. And so maybe just comment on what you're seeing in distribution that will give you the confidence that it actually can be neutral in 2017.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Joe. This is Tom. I'll start off, and I'd like Lee to just tag-team. I mean, the confidence here is that when we look at how the quarter came out, sequentially distribution was basically flat, and those non-natural resource related areas that we've talked about in the past in the various regions are growing mid-single digits. And we have a really on-purpose program to add distribution, especially in the emerging areas in Asia, in Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America. And our teams are working very hard at that. And when we look at the emerging markets, they're showing some positive growth in distribution. So I think that combination of all those gives us confidence that we can come in at a neutral for distribution. I don't know if Lee has anything else to add.", "Lee C. Banks - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "No, Joe, I'd just say commenting on North America, and I've spent quite a bit of time with these guys. There's just no doubt that there's still a big hangover from the natural resource markets, oil and gas being a big one. But have we seen that, (44:54) you do get this impression that things are flattening out. We do see some signs of MRO spend taking place, and it's really a lack of cannibalization of idle rigs that are out there. So we see activity there. And then I think there's just general encouragement through the channel that with the continued strength in the automotive end markets and continued positive PMI data that they are cautiously optimistic that there's some positive signs going forward.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So, Lee, is it your sense that from an inventory standpoint, we've now gotten to levels that we need to be in order for your growth rates to reflect end market demand?", "Lee C. Banks - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah. I mean, I would say in general that the whole destocking question, I don't see big evidence of that in place. That's not to say there may not be a pocket here or there. But in general I would say inventories are in line with the current activity.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And then maybe one follow-on question for Jon. Can you maybe talk a little bit about your cash bridge for next year? So specifically I'm interested in your pension-funded status, whether there's going to be an additional contribution in 2017, and then any other puts and takes that you could talk about from a cash flow perspective for next year? Thank you.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Joe. I think, first, on the pension contribution, that is possible. I don't want to say that we are doing it or we're not. We're going to have to really look at that very hard, but that is possible. And, if we do it, it would be in the normal range that we've done it over the last several years, other than in FY 2015, which we didn't do anything. And I think that, from a capital standpoint here, from a CapEx, we would be at about 2% of sales. And those are the kind of the big drivers here for us. Our pension expense for next year, as I tried to mention in my comments, was going to be impacted positively in total, all together, by $0.11 impacting FY 2017 due to the spot rate methodology that we've adopted, as well as many other puts and takes that go into making those estimates and doing the accounting for that.", "So the CapEx of 2%, we never forecast acquisitions, of course, and from a pension expense standpoint, it's quite possible that we would have a normal contribution there, and that's about what I can give you right now. Is there any more color that you would want at this point?", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I guess just what the funded status of your pension is today and whether you expect working capital to be positive or negative next year.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I think working capital is going to be positive. Now, we're going to show sales growth in Q4, so that will be a slight drag. But we are making tremendous progress on our cost controls, as well as our inventory management. Our inventories are, with this kind of a decline in sales, are at a historic low as a percent of sales. We expect our ability to manage through inventories to more than offset the drag that we might have from the AR as our Q4 shows a little bit better.", "Our funded status right now for our pension plans is at 65%, which is a little bit lower than we would want it to be, and that's pure assets to liabilities. Of course, regulatorily, we're well over 100% required, but there would be an argument to make that from a voluntary contribution standpoint that it would make sense given our assets and liability funded status at 65% right now.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from David Raso of Evercore. Your line is now open.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Hi. A quick clarification first before my question. The savings, the carryover plus the incremental from this year, what's the exact number again?", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. The savings carryover into FY 2017, $25 million. The savings related to the FY 2017 restructuring, $30 million.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Okay. So basically the segment profit for the year, total company, has guided up about $72 million, $55 from savings and $21 million from pension. Is that essentially the number you have? (49:56)", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, those are the numbers. I hate to draw a straight line between the restructuring and the savings and our increased guidance, because there's a lot of other factors, as you well know, Dave, that go into that. But, yeah, that would be one way to look at it.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "That's a generic flat revenues, keep profit flat ideally on it, at $20 million plus for pension and $55 million for save, and that's the generic framework.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "My question was the international growth cadence. Can you walk us through \u2013 and you said it earlier, I apologize \u2013 I know you said it for North America, but I might have missed it internationally. The up 3% for the year, 3.2% to be exact \u2013 how do we get there from the down 3% we're exiting the year? Comps get easier, orders are up, but if you can help us with the cadence.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "David, it's Tom. So international, up 3%, 1 point of that is acquisitions; that's the J\u00e4ger acquisition for the year. So it's 2 points of growth for international, and our forecast is that that's Europe at flat, Asia plus 4%, and Latin America plus 15%. Now, recognize Latin America is a small number, and it's balancing off a very sharp decline. And what's supporting that is the orders that we saw in Q4 and has continued into July is that of the international orders, we saw Europe around flat. We've seen Asia orders plus 6%, and Latin America orders plus 19%. So we see some opportunities in Asia and Latin America in particular, and we see Europe as neutral. That's what's making up the plus 2% for international.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "And the cadence of that then? Could we be positive by fiscal 2Q? How quickly do we get positive to get the full year to 2%?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "At the end of the first half.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "End of first half. Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.", "Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey. So you mentioned capital allocation, you'd be kind of within your range of targets for buyback. And just with six months to go from kind of completing that, can you just update us on as we look past that how you may be thinking about capital allocation, the same or different, or do we get some formal multiyear announcement? Just flesh that out. And maybe while you're at it, touch on acquisition pipeline.", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, Jeff. It's Tom. So let me start with just a clarification. We only have one more quarter left in the share repurchase plan. It was October to October, 2014 to 2016. So we'll come in at the $2 billion level of that range that we said. And what's really kind of \u2013 the factors that we've considered of what that is that 99% of our cash is permanently invested overseas. We do have a desire to maintain that A rating, and our debt to total cap is at around almost 40%. And when we started the program, we were at $13 billion company; now we're $11.4 billion. Now, we're very proud of the double-digit cash flow that we've been able to generate, but it's double digits off of a smaller number. So that's what is kind of framing why we're going to come in at the low end of the range.", "Now, going forward, our desire \u2013 let me first state that we want to be great generators of cash, and I think we've done a great job there. We're going to continue to do an even better job, and we want to be known as a company that really spins off a lot of cash. On the flip side, we want to be known as a company that deploys it very effectively on behalf of the shareholders, and you've heard me say this before, but those maybe have not, I'll repeat it. First and foremost, as far as our priorities, is to continue our dividend track record. Then we're going to fund organic growth because it's the most efficient growth that you can fund. And then really it's a dynamic review on a case-by-case basis between share repurchase and acquisitions, and really with the goal of generating the best long-term value for our shareholders.", "On the share repurchase, you won't see us do another announcement type of process. I think what's better for shareholders is to be active, to have a muscular balance sheet, but to tell you after the fact, because when we announce in advance, we're buying into our own wind, and I don't think that helps shareholders. I think we want to do it after the fact. That's the most effective way to use our cash and to help shareholders.", "Regarding acquisitions, the pipeline is active. But I talked last quarter, and the valuations continue to be, I would call it, historically high. But I do think time is on our side here because we buy properties in spaces that we understand. So we understand the growth rates. I think sellers' expectations on growth rates is going to start to temper as they recognize that the growth rates that they think their business is going to do is not going to actually come to fruition. And I think you'll see our pipeline become more actionable. We've always been disciplined buyers. And we'll always continue to buy properties that we know we can deliver on for our shareholders. So we'll look at all that. And, again, the goal is to have a muscular balance sheet and do what's best for our shareholders.", "Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Then just as a follow-on on international. Can you speak to what's inflecting in Asia to drive that plus 6%, and then conversely in Europe, any kind of near-term signals of deterioration around Brexit?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Jeff, I'll start on Asia. I'm going to let Jon make some comments on Brexit. But what we saw on Asia, we actually had positive sales in Asia for June and with the positive order entry that we had in Q4 and will continue into July. We saw plusses in life sciences \u2013 I'm speaking about Asia in general \u2013 passenger rail, power gen, machine tools, and probably of significance, because for the many years we've been talking about this, we've started to see some signs of life in mobile construction, in particular India and Japan, but the good thing is China has finally flattened out, and we've actually saw some new incremental orders in China. And we have all the countries across Asia growing, with the exception of Korea, and Korea just has a little more exposure to some of those global OEMs, and so that will to start to recover as well. So that's what behind our thoughts on Asia, and I'll let Jon talk about Brexit.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Just a quick comment on the Brexit impact, Jeff. We're in a position where we manufacture and ship out of the UK more than we buy into the UK. And so, since we export more than we import, we don't see that really having an impact on our near-term financials. Now, to the extent that the Brexit impact long term starts to impact the economics there, we'll be watching that very closely, but the UK overall, in terms of our sales there, will not meaningfully drive our top line numbers in any event.", "Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks a lot, guys.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Volkmann of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Good morning, guys, for two more minutes. Can I just follow up? I think, Tom, you made some initial comments about simplification plans. And I'm curious if there's kind of more to come in that area in terms of things like SKU reduction, or business unit consolidation, or maybe even have some more divestitures. I know you've done a couple of small ones here and there. Can you just talk a little bit about what that's going to look like over the next couple years?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Steve, it's Tom. I think there's really been great momentum for us across the company on simplification. I think I mentioned in my opening comments, the combination of putting simplification with our Lean enterprise efforts is really giving us an amplification of being able to look at costs and processes differently than maybe we have in the past. But, as I've mentioned before, and I'll kind of give you some comments as to where I think we can go on these, there's four big areas that we're focused on.", "The first is that whole revenue complexity, or maybe another way of saying it is that product line simplification, the tail of revenue, the last couple percent of revenue. We are in very early days on that. That is probably our biggest opportunity going forward, and that will be a multiyear journey as we continue to find more efficient ways to service that tail, take care of our customers, but work on the SG&A, the speed at which we can handle those type of orders, speed at which we can service customers. A lot of organization design activity will happen related to that. So that will be a net win for our customers as well as us, but very early days on that. That's the harder part because there's thousands and thousands of part numbers to go through. That's the more complicated part of it.", "We've done a lot of work organizationally and process-wise; that's the second bullet. And I still see lots of opportunities there. I think you'll see a focus on the number of levels within the company, span of controls, just putting together an organization design that is the most effective design for our customers and for our people.", "On the division consolidations, I think we've taken a pretty big step already on that piece. We had 28 divisions, so basically a quarter of all of our divisions going through some kind of consolidation, down to 14. So that dropped our total count of divisions from 115 to 101. Lee is working with the presidents on that. And we don't have anything to announce because, in fairness to our people, we would not announce that in a public forum like this. But we've already taken a big step there. I think you'll see just more fine-tuning on that as we go.", "And then on bureaucracy, there's lots and lots of opportunities within the company. The whole annual plan process that we redid was a huge upside for people as far as being able to free up their time to do other things. So I would say we're very pleased with where we've come so far, but there's a lot more to go on that. And if you have anything else, Steve, I'd be happy to answer any more.", "Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC", "Just on potential divestitures going forward?", "Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Oh. Yeah, so we continue to look at the divestitures. That's an ongoing basis. But we like the portfolio as a whole. And you look at our nine motion control technologies, and you look at the seven operating groups. 60% of our customers buy from four or more of those seven groups. So our customers see the power of the systems we can do, the synergies that we can do, across those technologies. That being said, we still look at properties that we think potentially weren't strategic to us or where we weren't the best corporate owner. We'll continue to do that, but I would characterize that as very small, trimming around the edges type of divestitures.", "Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC", "Great. I appreciate it. Thanks.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. And Candace, I see that we're running up against it here. Could we just take one last phone call here, please?", "Operator", "Absolutely. Our final question comes from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Hey, Andy.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got a question on Aerospace, one backward-looking and then a little bit forward-looking. The first \u2013 can you give a little more color about the relative performance of commercial versus military, if you want to break it OE versus aftermarket in the quarter? And then also, a little more color behind what drove the 50 basis point margin decline versus last year?", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. On the margin decline, basically, last year, there were a few contractual settlements in the Aerospace numbers. They did not repeat for this year. Of course, those are lumpy, and they can come sporadically. And so that's really the driver there, Andy. Now, from breaking those numbers down a little bit in terms of the sales, we are basically essentially flat in the commercial market. That's being kind of impacted by the ability for us to be in a position where our bizjet reduction is being overcome by our normal commercial increase. There's not been a significant change in the aftermarket there, and it's been basically flat for us.", "From a military standpoint, both OE and commercial, that has been up low double digits for us in the quarter, and that would be reflected not only in our sales but in our orders, and again all of these data that I give to you, because it's such a long-term business, it tends to be very lumpy. Our perfect world, we would be 50% commercial, 50% military. We're not now. I mean, we are 65% commercial, and the balance military right now. And in a perfect world, we'd be 50%-50% OEM versus aftermarket, and we're at 66% OEM right now.", "So that would be indicative of further aftermarket revenues to come as we are successful in our entry into service for all the commercial aircraft, and as the military ramps up over the next several years on some of the key programs that we're on. And so we have a lot of very high expectations for our performance and our growth there in Aerospace, and it's been a key to our successful FY 2016, and key to our guidance in FY 2017, too. So I hope that gives you some color there, Andy.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "It does, Jon. Thank you. And then I guess two more \u2013 I'm sorry to belabor it. But on Aerospace, on the guidance, modest growth, kind of flattish to modest growth, and margins flat to up 40 basis points. Is the margin growth or the potential expansion really mix driven, or are there other factors that are driving that?", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I think it's going to be efficiency. It's going to be the same adherence to all the programs that Tom has outlined before in our Aerospace segment. And it is going to be a natural mix, a positive for us here into FY 2017. Our growth on our new programs is going to be in the low single digits, and our growth in the repairs and aftermarket is going to be in the low single digits for FY 2017. And we also would expect to see our normal growth in our military aftermarket in FY 2017. So there's no one segment of the Aerospace that is driving the growth, and there's no one answer for you on the margins. It's more mix, and it's our ability to just continue to be productive in Aerospace on the margins, and it's across-the-board increases at each one of the major segments there in FY 2017, too.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And I'll follow up on that offline. On the diversified international, if I strip out \u2013 take kind of 50/50 split on the savings literally, if I strip that out, it looks like the core incrementals are somewhere around mid-20% range. Is that just application of what you'd expect in year one of some sort of recovery after the downdraft we've seen? Or is there upside opportunity given the Lean operations relative to the past?", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I think that it is a reflection of our ability to implement Lean. There is an uptick in of course the incremental returns they're going to get, because as Tom and Lee have kind of described, we're going to see an upturn in sequential revenues as the year goes on, especially in Industrial international. That's our best estimate right now. And so we will see some marginal returns there. That 20% number, it seems, off the top of my head, reasonable, but I don't want to give you the impression that there's not also a lot of favorable disposition in our international Industrial margins because of our ability to continue to penetrate markets, gain market share, and grow in ways that are really quite favorable for the company here and helping us with our guidance in 2017.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. Thank you. And I think this will be the balance of our call here today. I appreciate everybody's questions. I want to thank everybody for joining us.

To begin our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams will provide highlights for the first quarter of fiscal year '17. Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's first quarter, FY '17 performance together with the guidance for FY '17.

We appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I'd like to share highlights of our first quarter results, comment on our fiscal year 2017 guidance. And finally share progress we are making with the new win strategy.", "Before I get into the financial highlights of the quarter first I\u2019d like to talk about the safety. Keeping people safe is our first priority and as such we start our meetings at Parker with the discussion on safety. So I thought I\u2019d start our earnings call with safety as well.", "During the first quarter of 2017 we are able to reduce our recordable injuries by 35% compared to the prior year. This builds upon a 33% year over year improvement we posted comparing 2016 versus 2015. And actually we have a long way to go, to reach our goal of zero accidents. But I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. Safety is important because, not only does it protect our people but also because great safety performance typically leads to great financial performance. ", "Now to the financial highlights of our first quarter results. First quarter sales were 2.74 billion, a 4% declined compared with the same quarter year ago. This represents the third consecutive quarter we saw a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis. Nearly all the decline in sales this quarter was organic.", "Total order rates in the first quarter increased 2% compared with the same last year on easier comparisons. This represented the first quarterly increase in order since December 2014. By segment, North America is still weak but slowly recovering and our aerospace systems segment and international business order rates were positive. These order rates reinforced our previously communicated view that we\u2019re progressing towards stabilization in many of our key markets.", "However we will continue to monitor order trends closely to ensure that this outlook is holding up. Net income for the first quarter increased 8% to 2010 million on an as reported basis or $218 million on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share were $1.55 as reported or $1.61 on an adjusted basis. A 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share, compared with the same quarter last year. Despite soft market conditions, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 15.0% or 15.4% adjusted. ", "This is another quarter of solid performance and represents a 10 base point improvement, year-over-year in the adjusted segment operating margins. Our decremented margin return on sales or MROS was 3.9% for the first quarter or 12.7% on an adjusted basis. This really is outstanding performance and marks the seventh consecutive quarter. That our adjusted decremented have been below 30%.", "It was another strong quarter for cash flow, cash flow from operations, excluding a discretionary pension contribution, was 12% of sales, reflecting our ability to be a consistent generator of cash through economic cycles. During the quarter we've repurchased $115 million in Parker's stock, this completes the previous announced commitment to buyback a minimum of $2 billion in Parker\u2019s shares of October 2016. Going forward our plan is to be a great generator of cash and a great deplorer of cash, in a way that generates increased long term returns for our shareholders.", "Now regarding FY17 guidance. We continue to forecasting a year of flat sales compared with 2016. For 2017 we are maintaining guidance or as-reported earnings in the range of $6.15 to $6.85 per share or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10, or middle point at $6.75. Business realignment expenses are still anticipated to be approximately $0.25 per share in fiscal 2017. ", "So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We will continue to make meaningful progress across initiatives across four broad goals, engaging people, premier customer experience, profitable growth, and financial performance.", "Our ongoing execution with new Win Strategy through its first full year implementation gives me even more confidence that we can achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of our 150 basis points. Higher then a rate of global industrial products. We\u2019re also targeting 17% segment operating margins and progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compounding of growth rate and earnings per share of 8% over this 5 year period. These performance targets will allow us to deliver sustainable, long term value of Parker team members, our customers and our shareholders.", "I\u2019ll now hand things back Jon to review more details on the quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance.", "Jon Marten", "Thanks, Tom. And at this time please refer to Slide 5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.", "Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.61 versus $1.52 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.09. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.06, which compares to $0.11 for the same quarter last year. On Slide 6 we review the influences on the adjusted earnings per share for Q1 versus Q1 of FY '16. We had earnings per share of $1.52 for the first quarter FY '16 and $1.61 for first quarter of this year, increase to adjusted earnings per share include a reduction of corporate G&A expense which totaled $0.11 per share.", "A lower effective tax rate of 28.1% versus 29.2% in Q1 of FY '16, lower interest expense and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company share re-purchase activity which equated to an increase of $0.07 per share, a reduction of $0.08 per share and income was a result of the lower adjusted segment operating income driven by weakened end market topline demand as projected while higher other expense equated to a reduction of $0.01 per share.", "Moving to Slide 7, with the review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the first quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 4.6% over the same quarter last year. There was nominal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions and minimal currency impact. Total company segment operating margins for the first quarter adjusted for realignment cost incurred in the quarter was 15.4% versus 15.3% for the same quarter last year.", "Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $11 million versus $22 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $422 million versus $438 million last year reflects the impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from the company's simplification and restructuring actions.", "Moving to Slide 8, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the first quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 9% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was no impact from acquisitions and nominal impact from currency in the quarter.", "Operating margin for the first quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 17.5% of sales versus 17.2% in the prior year. Business realignment expense incurred totaled $4 million, as compared to $8 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $205 million, as compared to $221 million, driven by the reduced volume as a result of those same key industrial end markets.", "I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial Segment on Slide 9. Organic sales for the first quarter in the industrial international segment decreased by 3.2%, acquisition positively impacted sales by 0.9%, while there was no impact from currency. Operating margins for the first quarter adjusted for business, realignment cost was 14.2% of sales versus 13.6% in the prior year.", "Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled 7 million as compared to 12 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was 144 million as compared to 141 million which despite the weakened topline reflects the offsetting savings resulting from the realignment actions taken in the current and prior fiscal years.", "I\u2019ll now move to Slide 10 to review the Aerospace System segment. Organic revenues increased 3.1% for the quarter, neither acquisitions nor currency impacted revenues, growth in military OEM, commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance as compared to the prior year.", "Operating margin for the first quarter adjusted for realignment cost was 13.1% of sales versus 13.9% in the prior year. No business realignment expenses were incurred in the quarter, compared to 2 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was 73 million as compared to 76 million reflecting the timing impact of higher development cost during the quarter.", "Moving to Slide 11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The diversified industrial segment report on a three month rolling average while aerospace systems are based on a 12 month rolling average. Total orders improved to positive 2% for the quarter end reflecting easing year ago comparisons and a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets.", "Diversified industrial North America orders decrease year-over-year to negative four, diversified industrial international orders increased modestly year-over-year to a positive three and Aerospace Systems orders increased year-over-year to a positive 14%.", "On Slide 12, we report cash flow from operations. For the first quarter cash flow from operating activities was 114 million or 4.2% of sales, this compares to 0.7% of sales with the same period last year. When adjusted with $220 million discretionary pension contribution we made in the quarter cash for operating activities was 12.2% of sales. This compares to 7.7% of sales for the same period last year, adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution in May last year.", "The significant uses of cash during the quarter were the $220 million for the discretionary pension plan contribution, $150 million for the Company's repurchase of common shares, and 85 million for the payment of shareholder dividends. 33 million for CapEx, equating to 1.2% of sales for the quarter is also called out.", "Turning to Slide 13, the full year earnings guidance for '17 is outlined. The guidance has been provided on both an as reported and an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of 48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY17. This is the only item for which we are adjusting. ", "Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Organic growth at the midpoint is nearly flat and acquisitions and the guidance are expected to positively impact sales by 8.4% currency and guidance is expected to have a modestly positive 0.3% impact on sales. We have calculated the impact on currency to spot rates as of September 30, 2016, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming balance FY17.", "For Total Parker as reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.8% and 15.2%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be 15.2 -- to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. The guided midpoint on each range compares favorably to FY16 margins, 13.9% on an as reported basis and 14.8% on an adjusted basis in FY16.", "The guidance for below the line items, which includes corporate G&A interest in other expense is 478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at 28.5%, the average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 135.5 million. ", "For the full year, the guidance range on an as reported earnings per share basis is $6.15 to $6.85 or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is $6.40 to $7.10 or $6.75 at the midpoint. This as reported EPS guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be incurred in FY17.", "The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25. Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be 30 million and are fully reflected in both the as reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges. We would ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for proposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison.", "Some additional key assumptions for fiscal year 2017 guidance are sales divided 48% first half, 52% second half. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 45% first half, 55% second half. EPS first half is $2.96 and $3.79 and the midpoint, that\u2019s first half versus second half. And Q2 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be a $1.36 per share at the midpoint and this excludes $0.10 of business realignment expenses expected to be incurred in our Q2.", "On Slide 14, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY17 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY17 EPS of $6.75 per share, increases include $0.05 from lower corporate G&A and $0.05 from the lower tax rate.", "The key component of the decrease includes a $0.10 per share reduction from higher other and interest expense, please remember that this forecast excludes any acquisitions and divestitures that might close during FY17.", "This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you for our summary comments.", "Tom Williams", "Thanks, Jon. I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve started 2017 on such a positive note. I would like to thank the appropriate team members around the world for their efforts. Not only have we made meaningful progress with initiatives designed to improve margins, but we\u2019ve also taken great strides to strengthen and sustain our business and better serve our customers. We\u2019re positioned well for the rest of this year and beyond under the framework provided by the Win Strategy. I look forward to sharing more with you as always as the progresses.", "And at this time, we are ready to take questions. So Andrew if you could help to get started.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Nathan Jones", "I think I would like to talk a little bit about cash generation and cash usage today, very, very strong cash flow quarter in what I don't think is normally an overly strong cash flow quarter. I think for as long as I have followed Parker your target has been 10% of sales converted into free cash flow. Is the new Win Strategy an execution of that structurally changing that target and should we think about cash generation being some number higher than 10 going forward?", "Tom Williams", "Nathan, this is Tom. 10% has been our historical target, it\u2019s still the target. But what we\u2019ve done as far as determining that target is what\u2019s top quartile against our peer group. And it happened to be when we set that goal years ago 10% was top quartile and as we benchmark it today 10% is still top quartile. Now obviously as we continue to raise margins, which is our goal, we should continue to be even better performing, but the goal is to be top quartile, we happen to be a pretty consistent performer in being top quartile on cash and I think you look forward for us continue to do that.", "Nathan Jones", "Okay, fair enough. And then the $2 billion share repurchase is complete. The commitment that Don made a couple of years ago there is complete. The balance sheet is still pretty robust, you've still got plenty of capacity there. How should we think about your approach to M&A versus share repurchase going forward from here?", "Tom Williams", "Hey, Nathan, it\u2019s Tom again. So we obviously look at both of those all the time on a dynamic basis with the goal of making the best long term value creation decision for our shareholders. So I would characterize the pipeline right now as far as acquisitions you know being fairly active, as always acquisitions are lumpy and hard to product as far as the [technical difficulty].", "And I think what is normally -- what historically in the last couple of years has slowed us down as far as converting more acquisitions has been the price valuation gap and what we are seeing now and I hope would hope over the next couple of years we\u2019ll continue to see this even more is, I think sellers expectations coming closer to reality and I think that price gap that we experienced will become closer and I think properties will become more actionable.", "So we will continue to look at share repurchase and acquisitions and make the best decision every quarter on behalf of our shareholders. On the share repurchase, just as opposed to pre-announcing we\u2019ll continue to be active and as I\u2019ve said before on these calls what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll communicate after the fact. We think that\u2019s the best value creating for our shareholders. We won\u2019t be buying into our own wind and you\u2019ll see us be active.", "Like I mentioned in my opening comments, our goal is to be great generator of cash and we will continue to be even better at that, but we want to be great deployers of cash and put into work. Now the $2 billion that you mentioned Nathan that\u2019s sitting there, just to would remind I think most people realize this, is that 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. And so there is certain constrains or factors that you have the weigh when you think about how to deploy that and trying to deployed it in a most tax efficient manner on the benefit of our shareholders.", "So we will look at that, we obviously want to put it to work but there is factors you have to consider on that cash that is sitting overseas.", "Nathan Jones", "Okay, thanks very much. I'll pass it on.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Andrew Obin", "Just a question, we are seeing improvement in energy prices and I was just wondering if you could give us some more color if you guys are seeing any impact on backlog or discussions with your customers?", "Lee Banks", "Andrew this is Lee Banks here. I would characterize the oil and gas pretty much as we characterized it last call. So year-over-year it's still down. There is certainly is an increase in rig counts taking place, but I would characterized it as almost basically at the bottom with a lot of choppiness taken place in the market. So there is no real catalyst for a significant change at this point in time.", "Andrew Obin", "And just a follow-up on M&A, I have literally had discussions where people are using negative interest rates for a cost of funding for deals. What is the equation between the prices and cost of capital is working in this environment? Are people getting more reasonable given where macro is and how does it balance the fact that you can borrow at almost nothing?", "Tom Williams", "Andrew, its Tom. I think the gap I was refereeing to on valuation has been more of sellers continue to use whatever crop pre 2008 mentality as far as forecasting sales based on, we buy properties that we know and understand, we buy things within our space and we have divisions that are in the same space. So we see what the market and our growth rates are and typically there has been disconnect in that.", "I see that disconnect getting closer which allows things to be more actionable, now your point as far as how we decide to look at the financing side of things, we\u2019re disciplined, we do a disconnect cash flow, we have a certain discount rate that we look at. We have returned criteria's that we considered. And this is all to the benefit of creating value for our shareholders and how we look at that analysis. I think we are very contemporary, we try to look at that in the current environment, so it will be reflective of what's going on in the real world. So I think we will continue to do that robust review.", "Andrew Obin", "Thank you, very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Jamie Cook", "Nice quarter. Two questions. One, Tom or Jon, I'm just trying to one, get a better understanding of the margin guidance in International given the performance that you put up in the first quarter given that you actually had a sales decline and your sales for the year are assuming positive growth. So I would assume you would get more leverage there. So if you could just give a little color there.", "And then my second question is just on the order front, I guess I was pleasantly surprised that North American declines are lessening and we saw another positive order number out of international on a tougher comp. So can you give a sense of your comfort level that the OE channel is clear or when North American orders should start to inflict positively? Is that in the second half of the year? And then whether you expect the strength in international to continue or when that starts to inflect even better? Thanks.", "Jon Marten", "Yes, Jamie. A quick answer from me, this is Jon on the margin guidance here for international. We did it up 10 basis points, we are showing as we made in commentary, a little bit of a better overview in the Q1 and guidance going forward there. We see great progress as a result of our restructuring actions and our simplification ability here in the company wide internationally also. And so we found it was prudent to just move that up 10 basis points and we are really pleased with how we are performing there.", "Jamie Cook", "But, Jon, your margins in the remaining nine months of the year implied margins are lower than the first quarter, but we\u2019ll get sales growth?", "Jon Marten", "Well, what we are going to do there is that as we look at the mix as the year goes on Jamie, we have a very slight change in the mix going forward here. So we are trying to make sure that we get the best guidance out there. Please keep in mind that there are some seasonal impacts here for going forward here that we are going to see in our Q2, that\u2019s kind of indicated in our guidance too. And that one have an impact on the international margins in our Q2 and as typical in that beginning up our Q3 also.", "Jamie Cook", "I'm sorry. What is the mix issue? Is it just more OE or can you just give color on that?", "Jon Marten", "Well, it would be more of an ability as we look at some of the in rows that we are making and some of our businesses in Asia as well as in Europe making new wins getting more business and we are seeing good increases in our sales there for as -- much better than we had projected and that is really helping us to get more business and -- but that OE versus the aftermarket mix here is having a very, very slight impact.", "Jamie Cook", "Okay sorry, then just a question on the order inflections for North American International?", "Lee Banks", "Yes Jamie, it's Lee. I am going to answer your question and pivot on that too, and just give some color on the markets around the world. I think it's important too, for just everybody on the call to just go back a quarter and how we characterize the micro environment as we gave guidance in FY17. And what we talked about was basically we figured this to be a year where most of our market declines that we saw when we decelerate and eventually make it back or close to the flat.", "And we forecasted growth to be soft in Q1 as you remember, essentially flat in Q2. And then we\u2019d see some small organic growth in year-over-year basis in the second half of the year. And we gave guidance last quarter, we put the markets in three buckets positive which would be positive year-over-year growth for our FY17, neutral and then -- which would be neutral and then negative.", "So it really hasn\u2019t been much change from any of that. When I think about positive, we\u2019re still bullish on aerospace, we talked about refrigeration, air conditioning, semicon, and telecom. We continue to see strong activity in all those areas.", "On a neutral front, we talked about automotive, we talked about power generation in rail. And I think the one thing that we talked about, which it really was a positive in our mind that we saw distribution moving to neutral, and what we see, we\u2019re on track to do that. And I\u2019ll comment on North America too for you when. And then negative year over year, which is consistent, it is decelerating for sure.", "But whole natural resource and markets construction, farm and ag, forestry, marine, mining, and oil and gas. All have -- still have headwinds to them and then heavy duty truck, which we talked about. So having said that the organic growth for the quarter really largely moved in the direction as we expected from the last call.", "Just touching on North America and distribution. We saw it\u2019s down low single digits, it\u2019s really in line with the expectations that saw. It\u2019s definitely reaching all those people impacted by natural resource end markets are still suffering and there are still some tough comps, if you remember back Q1 last year, this time for some of these people. What I was encouraged about, is roughly every 4 years we hold a channel meeting in North America with our filed power channel. ", "And I just came back from a meeting with 400 principals representing this channel across North America. And I have to tell you, I spent two days just going from top to bottom networking, with everybody there and I left mildly encouraged, certainly not depressed about prospects moving forward. As you would expect areas like the great lakes regions are having positive year-on-year growth. People in the oil patch were still suffering, but it\u2019s not that accelerating rate of decline there is more talk about some positive trends possibly happening here in FY17, so that was good.", "If I talked about industrial markets in North America, you have to talk about oil and gas. And I would say major OEMs continue to indicate no significant investment, but do get a sense of there if there is a little bit a light at the end of tunnel and there are some talks about some projects happening going forward.", "Energy markets is another one that we like, overall the large frame turbines was flat year over year but, I\u2019ve talked about this in the past, that we\u2019ve had some good specifications wins there, our content is up, so we\u2019ve seen some strong numbers from that sector for us.", "And then in the mobile markets in North America, we continue to see year over year declines in off-highway construction, equipment off-highway farming and ag, industrial trucks, material handling and railroad equipment. ", "I\u2019d say one market that was a little worse then we forecasted was heavy trucks and trailers. That was a little bit of a headwind for us. And then I would say the automotive market is a little worse and really I\u2019m talking about light truck there. And I think a lot of it has to do with there was some extended summer shutdowns in some of those sectors that impacted us. But when we look at it going forward, we still feel very positive about it for the year.", "I\u2019m going to get to international orders, Jamie. I haven't forgotten you\u2019re here. So when I talk about EMEA distribution, I would say again it\u2019s a same story. If you talk about oil and gas regions, if they have a large negative year over year impact. We continue to see great growth in some of the emerging regions, but I\u2019ll say a little bit of headwinds in some of the political unrest in Turkey, which cost us in the quarter, we see that coming back. And then oil and gas still tough year-over-year comps, but we are seeing some positive activity on some project business outside of Western Europe.", "General Industrial, Middle East has been strong for us. There is a lot of projects going on, result of their economic diversification efforts. So we\u2019ve had some great project wins there and then in the mobile sector, we are seeing some positive news in Europe and with off-highway construction equipment and heavy trucks and just getting some positive year-over-year input from our customers. So Europe largely for international order standpoint largely moved in the direction that we thought it would for the quarter.", "For Asia-Pacific we were encouraged by another strong quarter of year-over-year entry. So it accelerated from last quarter moved in the direction that we thought. Distribution was strong, we\u2019ve got a big footprint expansion going on as part of our new win strategy and we like what\u2019s happening there. And we\u2019ve really seen very strong growth in India and Southeast Asia.", "Industrially we are up in almost all end markets. So if I highlight machinery product power generation semiconductor, telecom all grew positive in Asia-Pacific. And then in mobile, I\u2019ve highlighted this before in the past, but high-speed rail continues to be a bright spot for us. Through some specification wins. We are doing very well there. And really increases in most segments in mobile off-highway construction again very low levels obviously, heavy duty truck farm and ag.", "And then Latin America, another international component, again another second quarter of strong order entry year-over-year from an extremely depressed level, but we\u2019re encouraged by what\u2019s happening there it\u2019s been the first positive movement sometime. So when we think about countries like Brazil, coming back that\u2019s a positive for us.", "So international order entry accelerated stayed relatively in line, but if we thought in Europe accelerated in Asia, accelerated Latin America.", "Jamie Cook", "Okay. Thank you. That was very helpful. I will get back in queue.", "Lee Banks", "Thanks, Jamie.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Ann Duignan", "Can we just take a step back for a moment. I missed what you said about Turkey. Did you say Turkey was improving or Turkey was a bit of a headwind? You were talking about political activity.", "Lee Banks", "I was a little bit of disruptive there when all the political unrest was taking place, but it appears to us to be getting back in line and it was really some distribution business that went soft on us for a period of time.", "Ann Duignan", "Okay, that is helpful. And then Lat-Am orders accelerating. Can you just talk about where exactly you are seeing the demand? Is it distribution? Is it truck? Just a little bit of color in terms of specifically by market or by region?", "Tom Williams", "Yeah, I mean these are all very low level. So I don\u2019t want to mischaracterize what\u2019s happening there, but truck has been positive, construction equipment and really farm and ag has been the positive.", "Ann Duignan", "Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on your guidance. The dollar has strengthened against the euro by 4% since the end of the quarter. And I know you said you expect your outlook based on September 30 exchange rates. If you were to do your exchange rates as of today, would you have changed your revenue guidance?", "Jon Marten", "Ann this is Jon. I think yes I mean given that track and we have a pattern of a going through and using September 30. We will see how that kind of plays itself out for the balance of the year, but with the strengthening the dollar today I think that it would have an impact on the guidance very slightly.", "Ann Duignan", "Okay, I appreciate it. I will get back in line. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Joe Ritchie", "First, I guess my first question, there has been a lot of concern especially as we have been exiting September that things in Industrial have started to get a little bit worse. And so I'm just curious whether you can provide any color on how things trended in the quarter and specifically that back half of September which has been a hot topic of conversation with folks?", "Tom Williams", "Joe its Tom. So through the quarter what we saw was that North America orders get less negative, which is a good thing and seeing it progress sequentially that way to the quarter. Internationally and aerospace we are relatively consistent through the quarter. In October we haven\u2019t seen I think that\u2019s unusual and October is consistent with what we\u2019ve put in the guidance.", "Joe Ritchie", "Okay. Helpful, Tom. And then maybe just given that the earnings number came in a little bit better than expected, Tom, you kind of kept the guidance range wide for the year. I think historically you guys have kind of narrowed in the first quarter. Just curious what your thoughts were around that especially just given the fact that order trends have gotten a little bit better?", "Tom Williams", "Yes, two things. One and maybe I will talk about the width of guidance, maybe people didn't pick up. We start -- we did this year in August different than what we have done historically. If you go back and look at our August guidance typically had a much wider range, so we started off the year with a more narrower than traditional range in August and we just kept that the same for the third quarter.", "So that part of it is really the starting point. And as far as keeping it consistent, when you look at what happened to the quarter, so we met the guide at the operating income level and the good thing about what happened in the quarters is we had slightly less sales, but we had better operating margins so we ended up delivering the operating income to our guide which was a testament really to the team around the world doing a fantastic job on that. We got some help below the line with some discrete one off things that are not going to repeat.", "So we felt that with the mix holding it flat made sense and holding it flat especially in today's environment with the macro environment being I would still say fairly uncertain, but we are encouraged with the fact that our orders turned positive. I would like to see a little bit more data before we get too far ahead of ourselves.", "Joe Ritchie", "Got it. That makes sense. Maybe one last follow-up and this is specifically on the below the line items in the guide. I know you guys made a voluntary pension contribution. I assume that was going to be a little bit of a tailwind to your earnings number for this year, but it looks like your corporate number has gone up. And so what is the natural offset there?", "Jon Marten", "Yes I think the -- first of all it\u2019s not a big tailwind, but it is a slight few cent tailwind there with that additional contribution that we made. Going on below the line, what would be going the other way as Tom has talked about and many of our different venues over the last several quarters. Our investments in R&D, our investments in ecommerce, our investments in IOT, and the kinds of things that we needed to in order to improve on our well customer experience is really driving the additional expenses here that are helping to offset that $0.05 or so impact that were getting from the additional pension contribution that we made. So I hope that helps you Jon.", "Joe Ritchie", "It's helpful Jon. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Andy Casey", "On the quarter could you give a little bit more color on the benefit to operating profit from restructuring and simplification?", "Tom Williams", "Andy, this is Tom. Maybe I will start strategically and I will let Jon add with the details in the quarter. But with simplification, the strategy here is really there is four elements of it and we\u2019ve have a focus I would say initially, if you would envision simplification as kind of being an iceberg, the tip of iceberg was division consolidations that was kind of the natural thing out of the gate that we have did. But the bigger part of simplification was underneath that, it's going to product line complex, revenue complexity, organization design work, process changes that we\u2019ll do related to that revenue complexity and there is good old-fashioned bureaucracy.", "So we are very encouraged because if you remember simplification is geared more at the strategic SG&A type of restructuring. So we made a lot of progress, but I think this is very early days and that\u2019s a part of why you have seen from an operating margin standpoint why we perform so efficiently in the last several quarters, and why our decrementals have held up so well. But specifically within the quarter Jon has something more to add on that.", "Jon Marten", "Well the only thing that I would say on specifically in the quarter here is, we had $0.06 in restructuring that we actually book. We are going to see about -- we are maintaining our right guidance for the year and we are maintaining our saving that we have projected when we put our guidance together which is about 20% of the savings that we are going to get in the first half for the year.", "So it kind of came right in along with our expectations, our actual restructuring that we booked in the quarter was a little bit lighter, few cents lighter than what we have projected in the guidance, it's actually $0.03 lighter than what we have projected in that guidance. But we are very pleased with our progress and we are maintaining that projection through the balance of the year.", "Andy Casey", "Okay, thanks, Jon and Tom. If I step back a little bit from the quarter and look at the 2020 goals, you have mentioned confidence in achieving those. If I just isolate the 17% operating margin goal, can you comment on whether you can get there if the market stabilization happens but the markets kind of stay flat after that? Or do you need some end market growth in addition to the 150 basis point outgrowth that you are targeting?", "Tom Williams", "It's Tom again. So what we project including the 150 bips greater than the market is a 1.5% CAGR. Now remember the CAGR starts in \u201915, so it went down from \u201915 to \u201816 which is why that doesn\u2019t sound like a really big number. So we go down because \u201915 all the natural resource that dollar but then \u201915 to \u201916 flatting from \u201916 to \u201917 and starting grow by -- this time we get to FY20. Our expectation is to grow 150 basis point faster in the market based on FY20 as an exit rate.", "When you do the CAGR through that period of time it's 1.5%. So as a background, as long as the CAGR from \u201915 to \u201920 is a 100% CAGR we think we can get there 17% operating margin. Obviously if it\u2019s lower than that, that\u2019s does going to put challenges on it.", "But I think that\u2019s a reasonable expectation given the macro environment, and our goal to gain share and all the other strategies we got around, the Win Strategy to grow fast in a market. So I think that\u2019s fairly reasonable and we feel very comfortable that we can pull that off.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.", "Joe Giordano", "We have kind of touched on this but with the orders in North American Industrial getting slightly better on a comp basis, but the revenue was touched a little bit lower like 40 bps, did the order patterns even though it improved come in a little bit lighter than you might have thought?", "Tom Williams", "Joe, this is Tom so the sale gap that we have, which is very slight impacted, our guide around $40 million was pretty much equally dispersed between the three reporting segments, aerospace North America and international. So for Aerospace, it was little bit of biz jets softness helicopters, for North America a little softer, and heavy duty truck, automotive and little bit in the general industrial. Then international is mainly a little bit lighter in the Europe, then we had thought. But when you put it all together and based on their order trends that we\u2019ve see and in fact that order trends are moving in the path we had thought they were going to go, we are encouraged, which is why we left the sales guidance flat for the full year.", "Joe Giordano", "I guess I was just referring to just on the sales guidance for North America, was touched down a little bit from prior. And orders seem to be getting a little bit better so I didn't know if that specifically -- if the cadence there was a little bit different than you might have thought? ", "Tom Williams", "Now these are only slight differences, Joe. We are only down a total of -- for the time period of 19 million for the year going forward were not down, all that much. And so this is us going through each one of our end markets, each one of our business pulling them all together and then coming up with some guidance that makes sense. But I would not read anything into that. Our orders are trending, just the way that we thought that they would. And so therefore we are making just very slight change in the sales as we\u2019re projecting here in the guidance.", "Joe Giordano", "Fair enough. If I could just switch quickly to Aerospace for a bit, you mentioned the margins suffered a little bit from development costs. Can you maybe go into a little detail there? And then just two quarters in a row there 14% order growth and how much would you attribute that to comps getting progressively easier or are you seeing some real strength there?", "Tom Williams", "Well first on the development cost, I think from time to time, it\u2019s very hard to project these quarter by quarter here and so these are more timing issues than they are anything else. Now on the 14% for two quarters in a row. I want to again -- as you know and everybody on the call knows, we are reporting these numbers because it\u2019s long cycle business at a rolling 12 months average.", "Now the long term growth rate that we can expect is what we\u2019ve seen almost in the Q1 from aerospace there sales up 3.1%, and our long term growth rate with them is going forward is going to be in the 4% range. And that is something that overall a next 3 or 4 or 5 year timeframe, we feel very confident in saying. So I want to just caution you that to not expect a 14% increase going forward. This has to do with the lumpiness of the orders and how they come in from our military and commercial customers. And the long term prospects are fantastic, but they are not at translating to sales at a 14% per year annum rate.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Stephen Volkmann", "Just a couple of quick follow-ups. I think, Lee, when you sort of went around the horn on all the end markets, I didn't hear you mention anything regarding distributor inventory levels and maybe stocking is kind of waning or something, but I don't want to put words in your mouth. Anything to comment on there?", "Lee Banks", "Steve, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big issue, I mean I\u2019m sure there are some pockets out there, that aren\u2019t apparent to me. But by and large that\u2019s not something when I talk to the channel people that we\u2019re worried about. I think a lot of that has worked its way out.", "Stephen Volkmann", "Okay, great. Maybe for Jon, it feels like we are sort of tweaking down the guidance I guess for fiscal second-quarter a little bit. Correct me if you disagree, but is there anything to call out for modeling purposes, any kind of below the line item stuff that maybe bounces back or how do we think about that?", "Jon Marten", "No, you\u2019re right. I mean I think if there are some onetime events that Tom was talking about that happened in Q1, that was kind of good news for us, that are not going to repeat in Q2. You\u2019re right, your observation is correct, it\u2019s been tweak down just slightly. And there are no other new in different types of activities that are occurring here that would want to call out in a call like this. I think it\u2019s a normal cost structure. Our cost structure is getting better, our volume is following a long our orders. Our orders are coming in the way that we had projected and so we are just a slight adjustments here for the slight bits of a good news here that we got in Q1, especially below the line.", "Stephen Volkmann", "Great. That is all I have got. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Hammond", "Just back on simplification and the division consolidation, I mean you guys have done a great job early on. But Tom, you mentioned a lot of runway ahead. Can you maybe just speak to what are the really big opportunities as you go forward? And maybe along those lines just, Lee, you touched on international distribution maybe just expand on what you are doing there?", "Tom Williams", "So Jeff, its Tom. I\u2019ll start with the simplification and Lee can talk about international distribution. For us I think the biggest pull in the tent on simplification is the whole revenue of complexity and when you look at our divisions and you do a histogram of their sales and you look at that last couple of percent of revenue it has a significant, and I would underlying significant amount of part numbers, quote activity and SG&A that\u2019s tied up in a relatively small percent of revenue.", "Now, we don\u2019t want to walk away from that, we want to do it significantly more efficiently. So that\u2019s a big element and because of the size of the company and then just the sheer magnitude of part numbers, that is something that will take time, but it\u2019s going to be probably the biggest contributor to savings in the future on simplification. And we just now started scratching the surface of that.", "Related to that is organization design and process. So as we go through their product line complexity and simplify it, its old 80:20 type of concept. We are going to change organization design and processes associated and there will be speed, efficiencies, cost, et cetera. And in general an improvement in the ability to serve customers and ease of doing business with us, that\u2019s the other big part of the simplification is, is to make it easier to business with Parker.", "We\u2019ll look at traditional things in organization design like span of controls, number of layers, all those type of things then we will look at good old fashioned bureaucracy which Lee and I talked about it in the past, if you were to do our -- what used to be called internally in the Company, the Black Book of process which is our annual planning process. It was a process that would take 5 months, 20 financial schedules and literally thousands and thousands of people hours tied up in that process and we drove that down to eight weeks, eight schedules and significantly freed up time for people.", "So those are just an examples and color on that. We\u2019re early days in this, but I think I would say it's got great momentum in the Company. So I\u2019ll let Lee take over on what we\u2019re doing on distribution internationally?", "Lee Banks", "We have talked I mean many times that our distribution network is our greatest off-balance sheet asset that the company has and we have talked about North America being the gold standard in terms of how we compete and how we get to market. And when we\u2019re putting the new Win Strategy together, although we had done a lot, we were cognizant that we still had not built this network out at the rate that we wanted to throughout the rest of the world. So as we rolled up the new Win Strategy we put a team of senior executives that know how to get this done, focusing on emerging regions in Europe and focusing on Asia Pacific. And we are really encouraged by the progress we are making 12 moths to 15 months into it right now. So very positive.", "Jeffrey Hammond", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Just a couple of questions of clarification first. I just wanted to make sure I had straight what Jon said about restructuring. You made a comment about 20%. I don't know Jon if you were saying 20% of a restructuring benefits are in the first half. If you could clarify that and then just a couple of follow-ups.", "Jon Marten", "No you got that right, 20% of the savings that we get from the restructuring that we\u2019re incurring for this year we will get in the first half, so yes.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "And then on Aerospace, obviously with these wins and orders you do have this development cost bubble. I\u2019m wonder if you could just give us some sense of how elevated your R&D or E&D is today versus where you expect to see it say in that 2020 horizon?", "Jon Marten", "We are at the round numbers at about the 8% level today. We have as you know moved it down from 11% a few years ago. So the 7% to 8% range is the range that historically is a number that we are the most comfortable with. But overall our level of development cost are aligned with what our expectations are of our customers. If there is new and different types of requirements where we are the technical experts then we will be in many cases the designer of choice and that so will fluctuate, but for right now given today's environment 7% to 8% seems to be a right level for us and we are at about 8 right now.", "So if in could just have one more question and we will wrap it up for today. I hope that answers your question, Jeff.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. Your line is open.", "Alex Blanton", "Just a question on the CapEx. The first quarter you had $32.5 million which is about 1.2% sales. That is about half of what you normally do which in turn is half as a percent of sales of what it was 10 years ago. What do you expect CapEx to be for the year? What percentage of sales?", "Jon Marten", "It will be in the range of 1.6 to 2.0 for the year. So 1.6 to 2.0 CapEx as a percent of sales.", "Alex Blanton", "Okay, so that is going to be a pretty low figure compared with what you were 10 years ago.", "Jon Marten", "We are not nowhere near as required capital that we did 10 years ago Alex, and that 1.6 to 2.0 includes a lot of reinvestments into the company, but no you are right we are nowhere near where we five years ago, let alone 10.", "Alex Blanton", "And that is mainly due to the lean efforts, correct?", "Jon Marten", "Yes, it's hard to articulate on the phone call like this, how much lean has transformed our company. And when you add on to that all these affords that we are going through from a business simplification standpoint and how that\u2019s impacting our CapEx plans, we are just seeing a lot of great momentum from that. And so yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Alex Blanton", "So is it just a matter of raising your margins, [indiscernible] profits, the higher profits [indiscernible], when it comes to allocating it to CapEx and [indiscernible] acquisitions?", "Jon Marten", "Yes, we are from a CapEx standpoint we feel very good about our positioning there and of course we are discipline, we are using in a IRR approach on that just as we do on the DCS from an acquisition standpoint. And we remain disciplined on all of our right capital allocation plans. And that\u2019s our goal, as Tom said we want to be great deployers of the cash going forward. So I hope that helps you out, Alex.", "Alex Blanton", "I just have one suggestion on the slide that you list your cash flow -- I guess it is slide number -- cash flow from operating activities, Slide 12. I would give a simplified cash flow statement actually there. You are not presenting the individual components, the major components of cash flow and I realize that is in the cash flow statement in the operating statements, but it would be very helpful to have it right here on this slide so people could see it and wouldn't have to refer back to the cash flow statement. Just a simplified one showing the CapEx, showing changes in inventory and the working capital and so on.", "Jon Marten", "Okay, well that\u2019s a [multiple speakers] yes, no good suggestion Alex, we will definitely take that one on and take a real hard look at that for you and all of our investors. So I think with that. ", "Alex Blanton", "You gave the number when you were talking but they are not on the slide.", "Jon Marten", "Okay, all right. We\u2019ll try to be a little bit clearer next time. Thanks Alex and with that I think this concludes our Q&A earnings call. I want to thank everybody for joining us today; I want to just to be assure everybody that Robin and Ryan and will be available throughout the day, to take your calls, should you have any further questions.

Mike?", "Mike Lamach", "Great. Thanks Janet. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, we exceeded our EPS forecast, improved operating performance and delivered profitable growth through solid execution, that more than offset headwinds from the global economic environment.", "Our operating income and operating margin percent were both all time records. Particularly good performance in the face of a slowdown in the industrial segment, and in the Asian and Latin American regions. Our team responded well to the challenges. We were able to over deliver on our commitments, despite lower than forecasted revenues.", "Adjusted earnings per share were $1.21, that's up 10% versus the third quarter of 2014. That compares to our guidance range of $1.15 to $1.19, so adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.04 better [ph] than our guidance midpoint.", "Revenues were approximately $50 million lower than the midpoint of our guidance forecast. About half of that from more unfavorable FX and about half from lower volume. That translates to a couple of cents headwinds versus our earnings guidance. The tax rate was also a little higher, and that was another $0.02 of headwind. These headwinds were more than compensated for by higher productivity and lower spending, as well as a slightly lower share count driving the $0.04 earnings outperformance.", "Organic revenue growth was 6%, led by strength in the U.S. and European transport and commercial HVAC businesses, as well as residential HVAC. Europe and the Middle East, excluding currency remain strong. Ex-currency, Latin America was down low single digits, with strong results in Mexico, partially offset weakness in Brazil. Excluding currency in Asia, revenues were down 3%, reflecting continued weakness in China and emerging markets.", "Climate organic growth was 8%. Industrial markets were weaker in the quarter, organic revenue and industrial was down 2%. As you will see when I get to the forecast, we adjust our fourth quarter down slightly to reflect slower industrial markets and currency.", "Organic orders in the third quarter were up 1%, impacted by tough comparisons in transport against record orders in 2014, as well as a slowdown in industrial. Commercial HVAC bookings, excluding foreign exchange were up low single digits and were up mid-single digits in North America.", "Adjusted operating margins increased one full percentage point, a stronger productivity and pricing combined with deflation, more than offset negative currency, investments and other inflation. We repurchased about 4 million shares in the quarter, and have completed our announced 250 million of share repurchase in early October.", "And I will turn it over to Sue, and then I will come back to take you through the fourth quarter outlook.", "Sue Carter", "Thanks Mike. Let's go to slide 4 please; orders for the third quarter of 2015 were down 2% on a reported basis, and up 3% excluding currencies, on an organic basis which excludes both currency and acquisitions, orders were up 1%. Climate orders were up 3% excluding currency.", "Commercial HVAC bookings were up low single digits, and residential HVAC bookings were up mid-teens. Transport orders were down, primarily due to difficult comparisons with record 2014 bookings in North American transport and in marine. Organic orders for industrial were down 4%. Organic orders decreased by mid-single digits in air and industrial products, and improved by low single digits in Club Car.", "Please go to slide 5; just a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, third quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis, and up 6% on an organic basis, which excludes both foreign exchange and acquisitions. Climate revenues increased 8% on an organic basis. Industrial revenues were down 2% organically. I will give more color on each segment in just a few slides.", "The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis, as reported and organic. Organic revenues were up 7% in the Americas, up 10% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, both led by strong HVAC and transport performance, and Asia was down 3%.", "Let's go to slide 6 please; this chart shows the change in operating margin from third quarter 2014, of 13% to third quarter of 2015, which was 13.6% on a reported basis and 14% on an adjusted basis. Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were a 20 basis point headwind to operating margin versus prior year. Within that, about 40 points negative was from currency and 20 points positive from volume mix.", "Price and direct material inflation contributed 60 basis points to margin with positive price and direct material deflation. This is consistent with the expectations we gave you in July, as the positive gap widens in the second half of the year, from material deflation. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 90 basis points, driven by strong productivity and cost containments. Year-over-year investments and other items were 70 basis points.", "That breaks into three pieces. This is the first year in which Cameron is included in results, and impacted margins by 20 basis points due to intangible amortization. In the box, you can see 20 basis points of headwind from investments and 30 basis points from higher restructuring costs. In the grey box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 45%. Backing out currency and acquisition, organic leverage was 41%. That is better leverage than our July guidance, as lower revenues were more than offset by productivity and spend control.", "Let's go to slide 7 please; the climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC, and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the third quarter were $2.8 billion. That is up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and up 8%, ex-currency.", "Third quarter organic commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. Excluding currency, commercial HVAC revenues in North America increased by mid-single digits compared with last year, and increased by high teens percentage in Europe and Middle East, and HVAC revenues in Asia were flat.", "The North American residential HVAC market continued in orderly transition to the new regional SEER standards. Residential HVAC revenues were up low-teens. Thermo King revenues were up low teens, ex-currency, with strong gains in North America. In Europe, organic revenues were up low teens.", "Climate's margin performance was strong. Adjusted operating margin for climate was 15.8% in the quarter, 150 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2014, due to productivity and volume/mix, partially offset by other inflation, currency and higher investment spending.", "Please go to slide 8; third quarter revenues for the industrial segments were $729 million, down 2% on a reported basis and also 2% organically, as revenues from the Cameron acquisition offset the negative impact of currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and material management organic revenues were down mid-single digits versus last year. Organic revenues were down low single digits in the Americas, up low single digits in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and down in Asia. Third quarter organic revenues from parts and service increased mid-single digits. Club Car revenues, excluding currency, were up high single digits.", "Industrial's adjusted operating margin performance was strong in the face of volume challenges. Adjusted operating margin was 14.4%, down 40 basis points when compared with 14.8% last year. However, the Cameron acquisition, including known purchase accounting impact and negative currency, account for 190 basis points of downward pressure on industrial margin. On lower volume, the team delivered pricing and strong productivity and cost savings initiatives to more than offset inflation and investment.", "Please go to slide 9; for the third quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.4%. The increase versus prior year is primarily inventory. This includes some incremental inventory to support Q4 air compressor shipments and some pre-build of inventories prior to ERP system go lives, which went live in October, without event.", "Also the lower growth forecast puts pressure on inventory, which will probably end the year higher than our prior forecast. We had good collections in the quarter, and our DSO improved year-over-year.", "Our balance sheet remained very strong. We have no debt maturities this year. We expect adjusted free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $950 million, which excludes the IRS payments and restructuring. That would be within a couple of points of our 100% of net income targets for cash generation.", "And with that, I will turn it back to Mike.", "Mike Lamach", "Great. Thanks Sue and please go to slide 10; North American institutional markets continued the recovery in the third quarter. There is no change to our revenue forecast there. We also continue to see growth in commercial and industrial buildings and retrofit. We still expect mid to high single digit growth for 2015 in North America and commercial HVAC markets.", "The regional standards change in residential HVAC is going as planned. We expect motor bearing unit shipments for the year to be flat, up low single digits in 2015, reflecting the [indiscernible] that occurred in the back part of 2014.", "To [Indiscernible] North American climate segment markets, we expect North American transport market to be up double digits in 2015, reflecting good trends in trailer, truck and APUs for most of the year. North American industrial markets have remained fairly weak. Gulf markets are expected to be up low-single digits.", "We expect Latin American, Asian, European and Middle East HVAC equipment markets in the aggregate to be up low to mid single digits at constant currency, from flat to down, after considering currency. Within those regions, Europe and the Middle East have been relatively strong for us, excluding currency. Asia has slowed since July, and we now expect Asian markets to be down for the year.", "We expect European transport markets to be down, including FX, but up at constant currency. Industrial markets in Europe and the Middle East, Latin America and Asia are more challenging, and we expect these markets to be down for the full year.", "Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2015 to be up about 3% versus 2014. Our prior range was 4% to 5%. So in total, we are reducing the back half revenue forecast by about $140 million. As I said, really $50 million of that happened in the third quarter.", "Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about four percentage points, which reflects the deterioration of several currencies since July, when the expected impact was 3% to 4% negative. We expect acquisitions to add about three points for the year. Organic growth, ex-currency and acquisitions remains at the same 4% to 5% range we gave in July.", "We expect climate revenues to be up about 3% on a reported basis and approximately 6% organically. There was very little change to climate revenue outlook, only about $25 million or $30 million, and its mainly a reflection of softer FX rates than in July, and reflects continued weakness in China.", "For the industrial segment, revenues are now forecast in the range of up approximately 3% on a reported basis; which compares to an anticipated growth of 6% to 7% in July. In dollar terms, the full year industrial forecast was lower by about $120 million. Its almost all from lower volumes, that short cycle markets have not recovered, as well as allowing for some shipment pushouts on larger machines. You might recall, that our July forecast needed about 2% organic growth in industrial in the second half, the new forecast reflects about 2% contraction in organic growth in the second half and industrial.", "Within the industrial segment, organic revenues are now forecast to be down 1% for the full year compared to our July view of up 1% to 2%, reflecting the softness we saw in the third quarter, and a continued weakness in overseas markets. For operating margins, we still expect climate margins to be in the range of 13%, identical to our prior guidance. We expect industrial adjusted margin to be approximately 14%, also identical to our prior guidance. This higher productivity and the continued spending controls are offsetting the impact of lower volume.", "Please go to slide 11; our adjusted earnings per share guidance range has been tightened to $3.69 to $3.74, an increase of 11% to 12% versus 2014. That excludes acquisition step-up, restructuring, the Venezuelan currency devaluation and the IRS agreement. It slightly moves the midpoint for the year, down by $0.02, which reflects lower revenue backdrop that we are entering the fourth quarter with and partially offset by the cost actions that are taken and that will continue. The range for reported or GAAP [indiscernible] EPS is $2.57 to $2.62. Fourth quarter revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 3% on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Currency impact offsets the impact of acquisition.", "Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share is forecast to be $0.90 to $0.95. We expect about $0.02 restructuring costs and $0.01 related to taxes for Venezuela, including these, the reported EPS range is $0.87 to $0.92.", "We have provided an EPS bridge for the fourth quarter and the appendix to give you the walk from year-to-year. The fourth quarter forecast will put leverage, excluding currency and acquisition, so organic leverage, at about 75%, at about 2.5 percentage points of growth. That higher normal leverage is driven by strong productivity, material deflation in the quarter, and includes $15 million lower corporate expense than last year.", "Before we go to questions, you might have seen the announcement we made this morning, naming Todd Wyman as the President of our Compressed Air Systems and Services business. Many of you have had the opportunity to meet Todd since he joined us six years ago. He has been instrumental in our value stream transformation and in the development of the company's first operating system, which is the foundation for the company's birth in operational excellence strategies. Todd's global business experience and demonstrated success and strategy implementation makes them highly qualified and serve as the compressed air system and services business President.", "Keith Sultana was named to succeed Todd as Senior Vice President of Operations and Integrated Supply Chain for the company, including leading our operational excellence strategy. Keith joined Ingersoll-Rand seven years ago, and most recently served as Vice President of Global Procurement. Before that, Keith led the global integrated supply chain for the company's commercial heating, ventilating and air conditioning business in North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Before that, he led the climate solutions and industrial technology sectors. So our commitment to our business operating system remains as strong as ever. At one point or another, Keith has had direct manufacturing and supply chain responsibility for every IR business, which makes him an ideal successor to Todd.", "These changes reflect our commitment to premier performance, aligning capabilities with business opportunities and market conditions, and they are consistent with our organizational leadership development plans.", "So in conclusion, our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a five year trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. They remain the right strategies for the future. This quarter's performance, will be a demonstration of our focus on meeting or exceeding our commitments to you. Our focus remains to grow earnings and cash flow, with a further implementation of our strategies. We have already taken and will continue to take actions to generate growth and earnings, as needed to respond to market conditions.", "And so with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Nigel Coe", "Good morning.", "Mike Lamach", "Good morning Nigel.", "Sue Carter", "Good morning.", "Nigel Coe", "So let me start off with the change amendments for the industrial segment. Congratulations to Todd and Keith in their new roles. I am just wondering, what if anything changes in terms of the [indiscernible] for industrial tech, and to [indiscernible] the question Mike, is that -- the margins, the trickle of investor retention [ph] and I am just wondering, is that a recognition, given all the background that perhaps there should be a sharp focus on productivity and cost containment there?", "Mike Lamach", "Well looking at the opportunities, Nigel, and we are dead committed to the 70% and 90% operating margins that we have communicated in the past. We want to accelerate that as quickly as possible, and for the segment to achieve that, we have got to achieve that [indiscernible] that business, first and foremost. So the effort here would be certainly on all of the growth and operational excellence activities in the company. We see great opportunity in the value stream work, and reaccelerating that. So its really -- I think, a tribute to Todd's leadership, but also to a commitment to being on-track and getting ourselves on track for that business.", "Nigel Coe", "Okay. Fair enough. And just a quick follow-on there, Mike. The 50 bips of price cost benefit this quarter, consistent with commentary, but I think probably a little bit better than certainly what we expected. As that continues to get better, as the hedges start to roll off on the copper and aluminum, or is this a pretty good run rate from here?", "Sue Carter", "Nigel, let's think about the cost or the price and material from a longer term perspective. So what we would have is a -- we'd have a total average spread between direct material inflation and price of about 20 to 30 basis points for the year. What we said when we talked in July, was that in the second half of 2015, we would see wider spreads, because the material deflation was really kicking in, which is exactly what we saw in that 60 bips spread.", "But in general, we are still targeting about 30 percentage points of spread for the year, then as we look at, going forward, we'd hang on to that goal of having a positive spread of 20 to 30 basis points. So I don't think that edge moves up forward, at least in the near term, that 2016 commodities are going to increase. We have got about 50% of our copper for 2016 locked in. However, I think its more realistic to think about the overall spread being 20 to 30 basis points, rather than a 60 basis point spread being a normal. I don't think that works [ph].", "Nigel Coe", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Mike Lamach", "I think Nigel, more than we though really, but we kind of thought 50, it was 60. So its pretty close to the number that we had thought.", "Nigel Coe", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Thank you. Good morning guys and ladies. Just quickly on Cameron and just the M&A impact. Just wanted to check my math, it sounds like you've actually held your Cameron forecast? If I am assuming a 3% acquisition contribution, that would imply about $380 million in revenues and back out [indiscernible], it was like 340-ish for Cameron. It sounds like no change there, but then Mike, you also made a comment about de-risking Cameron a little bit. So can you just reconcile that or am I missing something in that math?", "Mike Lamach", "Jeff, great question. Let me walk through. So I talked about the fact that we reduced the back half for you in total for the company by $140 million. $50 million of that would have happened in Q3, so $90 million relating to Q4. Also [indiscernible], there was regular change to the climate, really the top $30 million, leaving $60 million in the industrial businesses. We think about the Cameron piece of large machines, and we took a $20 million to $25 million view of risk on that, saying that, we know of some instances and perhaps will know some more delays for oftentimes customer acceptance or readiness on those sides. So think about $20 million, $25 million being associated with big machines.", "The balance of that could be split 50-50 between all of what the short cycle replenishment is in industrial and FX again. So if you look at sort of the Cameron piece of this, on the large machine exposure, 20-25, and then if you look at just short cycle of recovery, some of that would be plant there, for both Ingersoll-Rand legacy and Cameron, it would be the normal smaller plant there. We are not seeing the order rates returning there, we are seeing some slowdown of capital spending from industrial customers in Q3 and Q4, and so there is a bit of that in there as well.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Okay. And then, just shifting gears on TK, orders down on tough comps, but the comps are going to stay tough, right, in North America, in particular in trailer. How do you see things playing out? Should we still be thinking about double digit type decline or more in trailer in North America in 2016?", "Sue Carter", "So Jeff, let me give that a shot. So you're right, as we look at the order rates for North America for trailer in the third quarter, they declined. Again, we expected that, we talked about some of those orders being roughly at peak in the second quarter, and it really is a tough compare to 2014. So when we look at the fourth quarter, so first I will take fourth quarter, we expect the trailer orders again to show negative year-over-year comparisons, again, based on really strong 2014, actually record order levels last year.", "So what we are looking at is, the tough comparisons on TK in total, orders for the third quarter and overseas markets were actually down, and ex-currency were roughly flat. But you also asked a question about 2016. So if we look at what's out there in terms of ACT data. So we are not telling you about your forecast. So we are looking at ACT data. We still are seeing forecast for that to come down in the ranges of probably some of those double digits. But we are closely assessing the markets, especially in trailer and in looking at the record volume. So not really a precise answer, but the tough comps are really the big part of the story, and in 2016, ACT doesn't see much change from the prior outlooks.", "Mike Lamach", "Jeff, if you took that kind of 15% kind of the -- sort of the market for North American trailer. I recognize, it\u2019s a little bit less than 25% of our business. We are probably going to see pretty good markets in Europe and Middle East. We are seeing probably good markets for marines, rail, bus and for our air, refrigeration businesses that we talked about a scenario last time that, a 10% to 15% decline in North American trailer, is something that we think we could still grow margins, in the TK business, and potentially, actually grow the top line. But that's not to be concluded until we finalize the plan.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is now open.", "Steven Winoker", "Thanks and good morning all. Just to clarify that answer for Jeff. On the Cameron deal, you had originally promised $0.8 to $0.10 of gross accretion for 2015. So bottom line like, where is that -- what number it looks like you are going to achieve this year on that?", "Mike Lamach", "So cash accretion so at about $0.08 -- maybe a little bit better, but about $0.08.", "Steven Winoker", "Okay, great. And then on the restocking impact in resi and destocking across industrial. What are you seeing -- what kind of impact do you think that's having on the business?", "Mike Lamach", "Well residential is lumpy. You know Steve, it's hard for a quarter-to-quarter compare with all that's happened with the change in [indiscernible] regulations. Our global residential business was up mid-teens, but our North American residential bookings were up high teens. I wouldn't put a lot of stock into the booking numbers, and some of the anomalies from quarter-to-quarter.", "The industrial restocking, is just more of an indication of slowing industrial markets, and as a fact that companies like ours are probably pulling in a bit on CapEx and we see our service businesses growing. So one thing you see in a typically mild pull back in your commercial-industrial phase, is that service business should grow. And our service business grew mid-single digits and mid single digits in industrial, which is a pretty good performance.", "Steven Winoker", "Okay. And then just following up your point about 30 basis points ongoing prices versus raws, and if I think about same growth rate maybe next year as this year for the overall business, if that were to be the case. Do you think you can hold these kinds of mid-40s organic incrementals?", "Sue Carter", "I think if we look at really more along the lines of what we have said longer term, which is -- we are comfortable with looking at incrementals that are -- and our gross margin levels, as opposed to trying to project what happens to all of those. And I understand the comment on deflation and the productivity that we have had, but I think there is going to be some other areas that are going to have even tougher comps in 2016 going forward. So I think, the price spread of 20 to 30 bips and our incremental leverage being at gross margin levels, have probably got a longer term weight of just thinking about the business.", "Steven Winoker", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Deane Dray", "Thank you. Good morning everyone. I was hoping Sue could clarify the comment on expectations for -- did you say inventory increasing in the fourth quarter, and its impact on your free cash flow conversion?", "Sue Carter", "Right. So I am hoping that our inventory does not increase in the fourth quarter. What I meant, and hopefully what I said is, right now, our inventory levels are higher than what we would have seen a year ago. Part of that is, because of the build-up of the air compressor inventory for Q4 shipment. Part of that is the pre-build for the ERP go-live and some other impacts from -- actually the revenue decreasing.", "But what I expect to see in the fourth quarter, is I expect to see the inventory come down, but the comment is that I don't really expect it to get back to the previous levels, or year ago levels at the end of 2015. So we will continue to work all of that off, it doesn't mean it's an issue, it just means its going to be slightly heavier. And what we have done, to answer your question, on a free cash flow basis, is that we did -- our original range was $950 million to $1 billion, we said roughly $950 million at this point in time, and what we are doing from a free cash flow perspective, is that everything that you might expect us to do, which is, we are overdriving performance on receivables. We are looking at all the things that make sense, in terms of being tight on all the other elements of free cash flow to make up for the fact that we have got a little more inventory than what we had a year ago.", "So I don't think any of this is an issue. I think our free cash flow, being at 98% and sort of projected net income is running in line with where we'd like it to be. So I don't think it\u2019s a problem, I think its just going to be a little higher than it was a year ago.", "Deane Dray", "Sue, I appreciate the clarity. And Mike, I was hoping you could comment on the European strength in climate. Did that surprise you at all? How much is fix a factor there, and it looks like you could be getting some share gains?", "Mike Lamach", "Well it is surprising us for a couple of years in terms of just the success I think we have had. But as I said in the past, we have got an excellent team, bringing new business and a lot of new products and services being launched into the marketplace. So continued good performance there.", "Deane Dray", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell, with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thank you. Just a question on industrial. I think you're guiding for Q4 organically to be down about the same degree in revenues as Q3, so maybe down about 2% year-on-year. But the orders progression has got worse, Q3 versus Q2 and the organic sales hurdle is higher in Q4. So maybe just confirm is that's really the case, and maybe talk a little bit about how you are seeing industrial demand trending kind of within the quarter and in the last couple of months, specifically?", "Mike Lamach", "The [indiscernible] Julian that we have really is in China, which really runs a pretty wide range of worst case, best case. And so, we are taking something out of a more conservative range in China at this point, and that's really the wildcard. The balance of it really is just sort of the book in turn that we know of and conservative views now on restocking into some of the stock businesses.", "Sue Carter", "And I would say Julian, you are right. When we talked in July, we have seen some short cycle markets recover in June. Some, but its not all certainly, and that reacceleration didn't continue in the third quarter, as we had anticipated, and we did lower our industrial growth outlook for the second half from plus 2% to minus 2%. So you are absolutely right.", "Julian Mitchell", "Got it. I guess, you are not expecting the decline to get worse in Q4, even though you have a tougher comp in industrial?", "Mike Lamach", "We had a little bit of a surprise favorability in bookings in Latin America in the compressor business, a bit of a surprise. And again, we think, we have taken a conservative view and China team has a roadmap on some larger orders that could close. But I think we have got this tackled with the 90 million in the back half, 60 million of it really being attributed to -- I am sorry, the fourth quarter, $90 million for the company, $60 million in industrial. We think we have got it covered here with what we know today.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on Trane in Asia. I think obviously, the trends, even back in July, were pretty unsteady in China. Maybe just talk a little bit about how you have seen the order intake in the backlog moving there?", "Sue Carter", "So let's just kind of talk about china in general. So obviously, economic growth rate, significantly below the historic rates, with the government attempting to rebalance the economy and all of those different pieces. Some of that is not smooth, some of it is lumpy and so some of the comparisons get a little bit volatile, if you just go from quarter-to-quarter. But if we look at HVAC bookings in China for the quarter, they were actually up low single digits versus last year. And for the quarter, HVAC revenues in China -- for the fourth quarter, the HVAC revenues in China are expected to be down low single digits, and part of that is applied systems and the growth there being more than offset by lower unitary revenues and currency. And so, there is a lot of different pieces that are moving around. If we just look at non-residential construction markets start in the fourth quarter last year, some of that continued into the second half of 2015. Some of the areas of strength or verticals, where we do see some growth would be data centers, healthcare, and mix development opportunity.", "Mike Lamach", "Good news there Julian, was the fourth quarter positive bookings and HVAC in China.", "Julian Mitchell", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is now open.", "Shannon O'Callaghan", "Good morning.", "Mike Lamach", "Hey Shannon.", "Shannon O'Callaghan", "Mike, so just on the -- to clarify the leverage point in the fourth quarter. I think you said corporate going down $15 million to $60 million. Is there some other maybe offset below the line and other income or anything that we should be aware of? It just seems like, I end up a little high, if corporate goes down $15 million?", "Sue Carter", "Well so when you think about the fourth quarter leverage and the different pieces, in the spot where you are going to look at and what's happening, if organic growth is going to be in the range of 2% to 3%, so you have got $75 million to $80 million of revenue. If you have got productivity and direct material inflation, we are still continuing to get price, and if those are the primary drivers of productivity in the fourth quarter, and you have lower corporate. To your point, the math does work out to be in the 75% to 80% range for the fourth quarter.", "Mike Lamach", "Shannon, another way to look at it, $75 million of revenue at the midpoint, $40 million NOI on that, take $15 million off that for corporate, now you are talking about nearly $25 million on $75 million. You have got 33% leverage and look at the price deflation spread, look at the productivity of our other inflation spread, and its really a doable number.", "Shannon O'Callaghan", "Okay. And there is nothing -- I know your other line moves around, there is nothing different going on there. It has been bouncing all over the place, something I had to model, [indiscernible] currency, but do you have anything moving significantly down the other line?", "Sue Carter", "No. So the fourth quarter should be relatively flat. So not really a lot of movement there that we are looking at.", "Shannon O'Callaghan", "Just on the commercial HVAC bookings, up mid-single digits in the Americas, do you have sort of the North America split of that? I think you used to give, and is there any parts of North America you see getting better or worse?", "Mike Lamach", "Applied is trending, as we said, applied, mid single, its sort of the institutional piece of that large unitary that applied to institutional is -- in fact, the larger unitary is doing really well. The open backlog [ph] sort of matches what the booking trends looks like, which gives us some sense that -- to think about open quote [ph] got predating bookings by three to six months. The rates stay fairly consistent going into 2016. So I think that its shaping up like the though, which is this mid-single digit institutional recovery that should last a few years. That state is still quite a bit more aggressive, and that you are showing institutional put in place 2016 versus 2015, 14%, starts at 10%. But I think as you all know, historically been fairly high, it comes down throughout the year.", "Shannon O'Callaghan", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.", "Steve Tusa", "Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just following up on Shannon's question. Can you just kind of give us the approximate margins? There are some rounding dynamics here, and you guys got some squiggly lines next to the numbers annually, and so I am just having a little bit of trouble again getting kind of low enough for the fourth quarter. Can you just give us more rough approximation of what the 4Q is for the segments? Margin-wise?", "Sue Carter", "So if we are looking at the total year for industrial being in the range of 13% or roughly 14%. So you are right, we have got a little bit of a squiggle in there. What that would imply for the fourth quarter on industrial, is margins in sort of the 15.5-ish type of range. And part of that gets driven by the compressor shipments in the fourth quarter, as well as continued productivity and lower inflationary type environment.", "Steve Tusa", "Okay. And then for climate, I think we are backing it into something around 13.5%? Is that about right?", "Sue Carter", "So climate, with the sort of 13 that we are looking at for the full year, would be -- if you backed into a -- that climate midpoint would be just a smidge under the 13 range for the fourth quarter?", "Steve Tusa", "Okay. Then that makes more sense. And last question, just on the resi dynamics, what will mix contribute this year? I don't think you guys had great mix in the second quarter, like maybe some others did? There maybe different timing dynamics around how much 14-SEER you are now selling? How much of that 14-SEER transition is booked this year, and then how much is kind of still yet to come for next year?", "Mike Lamach", "We have some negative mix, Steve, in the year with 14-SEER, which works itself out this year. But we think that generally 14 is accretive [ph] to 13 and we are seeing really good margin expansion in the res business. So in spite of the mix down of 14 for us, good absorption, good expansion, and work itself through in 2015.", "Steve Tusa", "And then for 2016, is there still some benefit to come in [ph]?", "Mike Lamach", "I think there is better -- I don't think have got the issue of mixing down in 2016. I mean, there could be a quarter, four or five months that -- you have to take with -- these dynamics of the change this year, in terms of stocking 13-SEER. For the most part, I think we should be having a pretty clean year, next year, in terms of mix.", "Steve Tusa", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Mike Lamach", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Robert McCarthy", "Good morning everyone. I guess the first question I would have, is just, taking into account some of the comments around state of the U.S. non-resi and the limited visibility on the industrial side. I mean, how do you think about directionally about 2016 in terms of EPS growth, and what can you provide in addition, maybe for CapEx or -- you have provided some incremental margins. So what can you provide about 2016, how we should be thinking about it?", "Mike Lamach", "I mean, first of all, remember, we will do it from February, so I will give just some general sense of where things are going. But before I do that, step back for a minute and we look at 75% of the companies being in the climate segment. Of that, really 60% of the company is HVAC and more than 60% of that is in North America. So you have got, really 40% of the company, with pretty strong growth dynamics going into 2016.", "I think HVAC in Europe, Eastern Europe, even potentially the Middle East will be growth organically for us, probably not the same rate of course as North America. But you have got that growing. So in essence, a large part of the business is growing for us.", "When you think about industrial; I think that Asia, Latin America, continue to be a bit of a struggle and maybe some currency headwind coming at us. But net-net, we see that even with low growth next year, we will expand margins nicely. I am not going to give you an EPS number today, but we certainly feel like there is an opportunity with the pockets we are seeing at growth in 2015 [indiscernible].", "Robert McCarthy", "Okay. And then just one follow-up; in terms of just capital allocation and then just reinvestment in the business, given the prevailing environment. Certain change or nuance of the margin in terms of M&A or other forms of capital redeployment or internal reinvestment?", "Sue Carter", "No. When we look at it, we expect to continue the balance capital allocation that we have got. We have investment in our businesses. We can expect continue having a strong dividend payout. So in the 30% to 35% range, we will continue to, at a minimum, offset dilution with share repurchase activities. And then, the remainder of it, we will basically continue to toggle between value accretive M&A and additional share repurchase and just evaluate what makes the most sense at any given point in time.", "Now, you had also asked about CapEx, and so generally speaking, our CapEx is usually in the range of about $250 million, which is roughly equal to depreciation, and we don't expect that to change going forward either.", "Mike Lamach", "The CapEx and investments are a number, that Robert, we can work with during the -- depending on what we see in terms of the environment. There is some flexibility for us to spend less, if we need to -- to help us on the EPS commitments that we will make.", "Robert McCarthy", "Thanks for your time.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.", "Josh Pokrzywinski", "Hi good morning.", "Mike Lamach", "Hey Josh.", "Josh Pokrzywinski", "Just a couple of questions, first on Cameron; obviously backlog is typically weighted to the fourth quarter, but can you give us maybe an indication on how order trends and visibility or coverage into next year looks, maybe versus what normal seasonality should look like? They are obviously [indiscernible] to the year yet, but just kind of any color on orders would be helpful?", "Sue Carter", "Sure Josh. One of the interesting things about the history and what happened in that engineered compressor business, is that not only are shipments back half loaded, but generally, orders in the launch engineered compressors are also back half loaded. So we are seeing real time, what's happening in the different places in the market. So let me give you a little color on what I think we are seeing, and how that translates into what we see for 2016.", "So in general, you are going to look at this space being negatively impacted by all of the oil and gas majors are going to put [ph] in capital, 20% to 30%. There is industry consolidation. EPC activity is slowed, and so when you think about projects, there is probably, in general, fewer projects. Same number of competitors, which means that you need to be really sharp, you need to be really focused, and really work at the orders.", "Now, having said that, if I break down the different pieces of the business. So on processed gas, which is roughly a quarter of the business; there is still some growth from the natural gas side of things, and LNG. There are some Middle East project delays. However, you have got petrochemical doing okay. Power-gen, particularly in Europe being an area where, there are some projects and things that we can look at, and so, when we think about the processed gas, one of the things that you can start to think about, is on the chemical side or petrochemicals, is the lower gas price, give you a lower feedstock price and that could change some of those dynamics. I don't know.", "But its still a tough environment, as I said fewer projects and some things happening. Engineer, air, so another quarter of the business, you have still got air separation, particularly in the China market, that to be honest, I don't see changing any time soon. There is going to be some activity, but there is going to be a lot lower activity, and if you looked in just, what's happening from, industrial gas businesses and activity, you'd see lower activity in the first half versus 2014 and 2015, and I am not sure that that changes. And again, that industry, looking at projects where we might take place with some of that engineered air product, with air separation, you have got over capacity, lower steel demand and all of that.", "In plant there, which is -- we can turn pieces of business. Its roughly flat versus 2014. There are still some good markets out there, with auto, food and beverage. Europe is a little slower on that side and Asia is down, and then the aftermarket for the business is where opportunity still exists. And so in general, you have got softer markets, still some projects moving forward. But we are in the period, when a lot of the orders take place. So we have got our eye on what happens in 2016 with all the different pieces.", "Mike Lamach", "Synergy-wise too Josh, we are really on track with -- as an example, just sort of the plant there, the rent synergies and the cost synergies, and if anything over the last few months, we have gotten a sort of even more conviction around the opportunity for the engineering, supply chain and manufacturing synergies that could exist in the business.", "So I think that we will continue to make the business accretive and in 2016, we will make sure that if we got the weakness. [Indiscernible] who is talking about, that we have got a response to keep the margins at or better than when they were this year. And we got a roadmap to do that.", "Sue Carter", "And I think the bottom line of all of that is, its still a great business and its still a great product for us. And like I said, in spite of all of the things that I said about the market, its accretive in 2015, and we are getting the synergies. So more to come on this one.", "Josh Pokrzywinski", "That's great detail. And if I could just ask a follow-up on TK, I have heard that some of the trailer guys have opened up the order books, maybe a month or so early than they normally would for the following year. Is that something you guys have seen, and is any of the strength in North America this quarter, and maybe a month or so [indiscernible] had from what you might normally have seasonally?", "Mike Lamach", "Well, clearly [indiscernible] which customers opened up their order books and whose customers they are. So you could take the top 10 customers, they are going to order at different points in time. But I would say that, in the third quarter, you had some customers that open up their order books, and we have seen the same thing happen in the past, where there is a little bit of an anomaly between who is ordering. So we are -- whose order and who is left to order, and I don't think you're seeing a lot of dynamic shift in that. But you will see differences in book rates and revenue rates depending on when that occurs. Some of these guys will buy 1,000 to 2,000 to 3,000 units, and so it makes a difference when you are looking at 6,000 to 8,000 unit month, which we is what we have been saying the last few months.", "Josh Pokrzywinski", "Got you. All right. Appreciate. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Andrew Obin", "Yeah, good morning guys.", "Mike Lamach", "Good morning Andrew.", "Andrew Obin", "Nice quarter in this doom and gloom environment. Just a question; there was some debate inside the company about how to look at the value stream process, and at the Analyst Day, you have indicated that you are reassessing your approach, because you have sort of touched a lot of low hanging fruit. And then, we seemed to have had a pause in execution last quarter and this quarter operating leverage just seemed to have come through very nicely. Can you describe to us what internal operating changes you have been implementing over the past six months to address this next level of operating improvement.", "Mike Lamach", "Yeah, a lot Andrew. I am not sure I will cover it here, it would be a great discussion that we could have when we get together for our review this spring, in general. But we have used this product growth team as a basis to expand the effort across the company. We have continued to now touch really all of the business with the value streams. Sourcing has become, I think, mature across the company. We have got really good productivity last three quarters, really in general. If you look past Q2 and kind of look at the last three quarters, we are seeing productivity accelerate.", "Its never really that linear. I know we'd all like for it to be, but its not. We have projects and ideas that, at a certain point in time, kick in a quarter, and those make a difference. Higher volumes would make even a more positive difference of course. So we are doing this all with actually quite sort of low volumes than some of our businesses. So we are excited, as volumes do return, we'd see even better productivity and the change that we have made.", "And so, look, I think that we haven't really changed the operating system in five years, we have just really looked across as product growth teams, and now have touched most or all the companies in one way shape or form.", "Andrew Obin", "And just a follow-up question, I apologize if you have answered it already. But can you comment on cadence of industrial orders throughout the quarter?", "Mike Lamach", "Cadence throughout the quarter, there really weren't any sort of high spots in the quarter to say. They were choppy, they were just sort of low in the entire quarter. We had pretty good growth in our fleet management business, obviously which was a highlight for us. It was kind of a double digit grower there, it's a good sign. But material handling, which is really our only oil exposed business, significant declines of 50% in bookings in that business from prior year. So inside industrial, when you move the compressor business out of the way and you look at some of the smaller businesses, there are some high and low points, that generally speaking, pretty explainable if you look at material handling as a good example of that.", "Andrew Obin", "Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Joe Ritchie", "Thanks and good morning.", "Mike Lamach", "Hi Joe.", "Joe Ritchie", "So a quick clarification. Mike, you mentioned earlier the dodge [ph] data on the institutional side, and your expectations for next year. But there is not a lot of noise in the data, especially on the commercial side. I am just curious, what if anything you're seeing and what you're making of that noise on the unitary side of your business?", "Mike Lamach", "Well, I think that the large unitary business continues to do well, because, there is also a lot of large unitary that's split into more of the institutional environment. So that continues.", "Actually the commercial activity has been fairly strong. If you split up commercial-industrial, industrial has probably been just a little bit weaker in North America. But not a bad environment frankly at all for us. So we continue to think it\u2019s a pretty good North American market, for both institutional and industrial. But in terms of strength going forward, its really institutional than commercial, and then industrial HVAC kind of trending in that direction.", "Joe Ritchie", "Okay. That's helpful. And maybe following up on that, how do you think about mix then, as you head into next year? Clearly, we talked a little bit about some North America headwinds on TK. But some of the mix headwinds on resi sits aside. How are you guys thinking about mix? Particularly, in light of the climate margin target of 13% to 14% for 2016?", "Mike Lamach", "Well I mean, on track in a nutshell, Joe. I mean, TK still gives us really good volumes from a profitability perspective, working with pretty high volumes across the board. Even though the year-over-year decrease in the market will be there, we have got plenty of gas left there and grow parts of the business that we didn't have last time around. So we feel pretty good about being able to hold their head up on the TK business. As you look at a climate, great expansion in margins, in the res business. I have said before, I will say again, mid-teens, mid-teens plus EBITDA. The commercial business, particularly in Europe is doing well, and we are hitting some critical mass there, and I think we will begin to contribute more to that margins across the business.", "And then in general, North America just does a really good job in terms of share and consistent margin expansion there. So feel pretty good about that. The wildcards are really Latin America and Asia for us, as it relates to HVAC businesses.", "And here, we talk about pricing in China, but its not sort of an environment that's impossible, its just more difficult for us. So we are persevering in China, and again, we feel good at least about the quarter, bookings going in the right direction. We'd love to see next couple of quarters, look the same way before we feel more constructive about China -- about Asia in general.", "Joe Ritchie", "Okay, thanks. I will get back in queue.", "Operator", "Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back to Janet Pfeffer, for any closing remarks.", "Janet Pfeffer", "Thank you, everyone.

This morning, I'll spend a few minutes recapping our full year 2015 results and our progress in the transformation we've been working on in the company since 2010. Then, Sue will take you through the fourth quarter results, and I'll end up with our outlook for 2016 before we open it up to your questions.", "Starting with full year 2015, it was a year that I can characterize best by one word and that word is volatility; volatility in energy markets, in foreign exchange rates, in industrial markets, in emerging markets and, of course, in the stock market.", "During this period of volatility, while the individual pieces might not each of it ended exactly how we had forecast some 12 months ago, our headline results were essentially right on the forecast we gave you a year ago.", "The 2015 forecast we gave you a year ago was for 4% to 5% organic growth, and we came in at 5%. Our adjusted EPS forecast was a midpoint of $3.74; our actual is $3.73. That performance was with significantly more FX headwind. We had included a $0.17 earnings headwind for currency in guidance, it ended up being over $0.30. Our free cash flow forecast was $950 million to $1 billion, and we delivered $985 million.", "We focused on executing within our business operating system and on the things that we can control while doing our best to anticipate the things we couldn't control and we made adjustments accordingly.", "2015 demonstrated continued progress in the implementation of our multi-year strategy for growth, operational excellence and shareholder value. We invested in core businesses, mature and key strategic capabilities and delivered on our financial commitments, all while navigating shifts and challenges in global markets.", "We have consistently delivered on our commitments even in volatile times, and we hope that you'd agree that there are very few companies in your coverage that have done this. I'm very proud of our team and the great people in our company that delivered another solid year. If I look back over a longer horizon over the last, say, 24 months, it's a similar story. With the exception of a single quarter almost five years ago, we've met or exceeded our earnings commitments regardless of market conditions.", "For the year, our organic revenues, which excludes FX and acquisitions, were up 5%. Markets were uneven around the globe. Growth in North America was in the mid-single digits while revenues overseas, taken collectively, increased low-single digits.", "Adjusted earnings per share were $3.73, a year-over-year increase of 12%. In a fairly diversified industrial peer group, we achieved top quartile performance in EPS growth again in 2015.", "We grew adjusted operating margins 40 basis points in 2015. Our organic operating leverage, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and M&A, was 35%, which is above our target range of 25% to 30%. And Climate margins improved 60 basis points.", "We generated $985 million of cash flow. Our capital allocation strategy remains focused on maximizing shareholder value, and it's consistent with our overall financial strategy. We continued to increase our dividend with a 16% increase in 2015 and we announced an additional 10% increase of dividend last week.", "We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $250 million in 2015. And more recently, we took advantage of some of the volatility in the stock market and accelerated our share repurchases this year, repurchasing 4.9 million shares for $250 million in January of this year. We finalized an agreement with the IRS for the years 2002 through 2011.", "In December, we announced an agreement to sell our remaining stake in Hussman, and we expect that to close in April. Our performance in 2015 gives further conviction to our strategy and positions us well as we go into a challenging global economic backdrop in 2016.", "Please go to slide 4. We delivered steady improvements in operating margins. As shown here, the last five years, our operating margins were up 270 basis points since 2011 despite tough years in Industrial in 2014 and 2015.

And our first question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Morning, Steve.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Just a couple of questions. On the first quarter dynamics, you have a decent organic growth rate but it doesn't look like there's much contribution from operations on EPS. What's going on there?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So, Steve, good morning, first of all. As we start to look at the first quarter bridge that you can actually see in the slides, what we're looking at is we've got restructuring costs that are in the first quarter. Our operating results are really going to be in the range of \u2013 and this includes the restructuring \u2013 negative $0.01 to a positive $0.04. We've got a little bit of lower share count. But when you think about what's happening in the headwinds, the first quarter is going to be part of that currency headwind that we talked about, particularly on the Industrial business. And the revenues we expect in the first quarter and margins for Industrial, we expect to be even lower than where we ended the year.", "So in other words, we're looking at a low revenue base. We're looking at headwinds from currency. And so, I think the first quarter is just going to be a tough compares and then I think we get better as we go through the remainder of the year.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. So in Industrial, that makes a bit of a sense. On this gain you guys are going to take, Mike, given the environment has clearly gotten worse over the course of the last year, you guys are doing some degree of restructuring, and you don't typically do this over time like other companies, but any thoughts to maybe using this gain to perhaps take a bigger swipe at things and get out in front of some restructuring that you may have planned for a couple of years into the future, just to kind of solidify that ability to kind of execute and deliver, like you've been doing over the last year? Is there a bigger restructuring out there, I guess, a potential for that?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think, Steve, when you go back to 2009, we've been really consistent about particularly the factory footprint, and that's at a place right now where I think it's very productive, it's well utilized. And when we looked at ideas around us coming into 2016, paybacks were in the range of, say, five years to eight years, which is just outside the range of what we thought in this environment was doable.", "That being said, when you look at areas of the business particularly around Compression Technologies, there is restructuring taking place there. And largely, it's in the areas of head count and things that we can do on a non-qualified way. So, tremendous focus on both corporate and costs within each of the businesses. So, there is a sort of drumbeat over time of doing that, but it's an effective and efficient \u2013 relatively effective and efficient footprint.", "One of the things that we find is the better we've gotten at lean, the further we've gotten into that, the longer and harder it is to get a payback on a closure, which is a good thing. So we remain I think open-minded, Steve. If in fact things deteriorated further, if in fact we saw an opportunity, we certainly would look at that. We'll keep an open mind on that. But rather than putting a big placeholder out there with no specifics, we wanted to just keep it to the known actions and the announcements that we've made internally inside the company to this point.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah, thanks. Good morning. First of all, congratulations on a great second half. The execution is certainly a lot better than many of your so-called high-quality peers. So, well done on 3Q, 4Q.", "I just wondered if I could maybe pick up on Steve's point about \u2013 very clear answer on restructuring, but I guess the two areas that pushed back for 2016 plan would be flat Industrial and maybe flat TK. So, I'm wondering if those come in weaker through the year, to what extent do you have contingency plans in place to mitigate the deleverage that you'd see if those do come in weaker.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Nigel, listen, again, I'll pick it up from the point of Steve, this is where investments would be metered down. A lot of investments we're making are not only in product but in channel, and also letting attrition at times work for you. So, we will continue to work that down.", "We certainly have a plan to sustain a lower revenue outlook if we see that. It's baked within the guidance we've provided \u2013 the range that we've provided. And our focus really is on the Industrial segment and it's fundamentally on the Compression Technologies piece. Todd's all over it. He's well into several months now into the role. I think he's got his eyes wide open around the opportunities. He's optimistic around what he's doing and I've got confidence in Todd and the team that they've got the plans hardwired for lots of different scenarios at this point.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Well, I'll pick up offline. And secondly, obviously you'd be aware that there's a pretty fertile debate about non-resi in North America given the broader weakness in industrial complex. The high-single digit growth in bookings during the quarter suggests that you're still seeing relatively fertile end markets. But maybe just pick up on where you stand and perhaps maybe comment on how the front is looking (30:43) right now.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think the surprise in the fourth quarter, at least to me, was the strength that we had both in applied and unitary in North America. We had double-digit applied bookings in the fourth quarter and we had mid-teens booking in unitary in the fourth quarter. So as a backdrop going into the first half of the year, it feels like we've at least got enough out there for us to see in terms of visibility to see that.", "Also, we had really good service growth, kind of high-single-digit growth in services. And controls was up nearly double digits there. So, it feels like we've caught a little bit of a lift in terms of institutional markets. Commercial hasn't turned down fully, that's why we're seeing good unitary, although some unitary spills into K-to-12 as well. So, that continues.", "And then, as you'd expect, just the investments in the service network and service footprint have been good for us. So, it's a pretty good backdrop from the fourth quarter going into the first part of the year.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, I'll leave it there. Thanks, Mike.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Nigel.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Thank you. Just a question around the Climate margin guidance. It looks like you're guiding for a 40%-plus incremental margin in Climate for 2016 overall. Maybe looking at slide 15, you might have some mix headwinds in that segment this year with Resi growing so strongly, Thermo King and Trane Asia being flat to down. So I just wondered what you're embedding for mix in Climate for the year ahead.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So, Julian, as we think about where Climate is going to go in 2016, I think you're right. You hit some of the high points. So we still see the continued trends in what we talked about in terms of Commercial HVAC in the Americas being strong, in EMEA being up, but on the Asia side being down a little bit. We called Residential up mid-single digits. You also have the factors of Latin America as part of the business. And while you have some growth in those sides, you've also got the transport revenues being flat in 2016.", "So I think it's all of those mix pieces could strengthen on the commercial side in North America and Europe, a little down on the Asia side, flat Transport, down on Latin America and good mid-single digit growth in Res.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. So mix is sort of broadly neutral then, 2016 versus 2015 in Climate?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Julian, Residential, if you look at the peer group, we're right at the top of the pack in terms of profitability. I think it's a point often lost on investors is the amount of margin improvement that we've had at Residential business. So good Residential growth is good for us. It's fine.", "On the Transport side, if you look at Transport North America trailer, the industry being down 10%, our guidance embeds more of a 15% decline. We look at APUs, we had good growth for the year, we had 16% growth in APUs over the full year. We had good growth in bookings in the fourth quarter. We've got a strategy for a higher attachment rate to non-refrigerated trailers, about a 3 to 1 ratio; if we sell three APUs, that's equal to one North American trailer. So there is, between APU and some of the air businesses and other businesses that we have within TK, the ability to offset that decline. And then I'd point you back to the fact that European trailer was up nicely and, as that moves up, that's actually even more helpful than North American trailer. So net-net, we're good.", "Actually, what's down for us pretty big is container. We had a big year last year in container. Container is soft, the market in general. We're against a tough comp. But container is an area where, frankly, less container is helpful on the mix. So net-net, we think we can grow margins.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up. Price/material was a 30 bps tailwind for the quarter and the year in 2015. Are you assuming sort of similar-ish for the year ahead?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "We are. Again, you're absolutely right with we ended the fourth quarter with 30 basis points and full year 2015 at 30 basis points to 40 basis points. For 2016, we're going to expect a 30 basis point to 40 basis point range for that gap or that spread between price and direct material inflation. You do have higher material deflation numbers. As you'll recall, we had inflation in the first and second quarters of 2015, so you do get a lift out of that. But I think as we think about the push and take between price and direct material inflation, we think all-in-all it's going to come back to about that same 30 basis point to 40 basis point range in 2016 is what we saw.", "One of the other points, and you didn't ask this but I think it's relevant when we're having this discussion about price and direct material inflation, when we think about the differences between Climate and the Industrial businesses, the largest pieces of the benefit on material deflation do go to the Climate business. There is some and there still is a positive spread in the Industrial businesses, but it's much less than what you would see in Climate. And so as you're trying to compare year-over-year, you also don't have that nice benefit coming out of commodities and the direct material deflation on the Industrial side.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Hi. Good morning. A couple quick questions. First, acquisition pipeline. Can you give us a little feel for where you're feeling the opportunities are presenting themselves most, be it geographic, end market, however you want to address the question?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Really, David, the strategy for us has been to look at all the SBU's core businesses across all markets. And so there's a pipeline that would reflect all that from that perspective.", "There are two fundamental areas that we see for investment. One is channel. We continue to see opportunities, whether it's geographically outside the U.S. for channel or even in the U.S. in terms of buying back commercial distribution. That's a continued emphasis for us.", "We also find that when we can take a product, it might be a technology that we don't have, and sell it through our existing channel, particularly on the Trane Commercial side, we do very, very well with that. So obviously it's more attractive if you're buying anything that's (38:21) outside the U.S. And so we're pretty active looking outside the U.S. for a lot of that, which can be then modified and brought into the U.S. with different power requirements and different efficiency ratings, but some of the technologies can be applied. So we're seeing an active pipeline there as well.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "And given the balance sheet power and the cash flow, would you care to give us any sense of bigger than a breadbasket-type sizing of what kind of size deals are you looking at currently?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, probably, David, truthfully that would only get us into trouble I think by doing a big breadbasket estimates. I think that you can look at where we would end the year in terms of ratios. In terms of EBITDA to debt, we end the year around the 2.4 times range. There's obviously some capacity with some of the current debt rating. We've got the cash. We talked about in the call the $675 million that's unidentified. So, there is an opportunity to do something a little bit larger. But what we're generally seeing though are small- to mid-sized deals that just make great economic sense.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Okay. A couple of quick things. Tax rate, with the IRS settlement now behind us, can you give us some guidance on how you think about the tax rate, be it this year, next year? I saw the tax rate guidance. I must admit, I was looking for a little lower tax rate in 2016 given the IRS settlement. But can you give us some guidelines how to model the next few years?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure. So, we were probably a little conservative on the 24% to 25% effective tax rate guidance for 2016. I think that when you think about the IRS settlement, what the IRS settlement really does is it takes the risk profile off the company and it puts to bed all of the issues around intercompany debt and any issues that would have been in the 2001, 2002 through 2011 range. But what it really doesn't do is it doesn't really affect the overall effective tax rate.", "So, what you have to do in order to make that tax rate move is you have to continue to refine your strategy. Now, having all of those issues off the table certainly does give you an opportunity. And we are certainly involved in looking at that strategy in terms of the different areas that we're looking at.", "So, we have a good trading hub that is in Europe. We're looking at Asia and Panama for trading hubs. We're looking at all of our intercompany debt and making sure that we're as balanced as we go into 2016 as we would like to be.", "But we do also have a slight headwind, if you will, on tax rate. And that is, when you look around the globe and you think about our revenue growth in 2016, the areas that are growing the most are in North America, which does pressure the tax rate.", "So, that's a long way around saying we absolutely have a goal of looking at every opportunity to bring that rate down. We're still going to be just as conscientious about the items we take on as we've always been. But I do think we'll see some opportunities in 2016. We'll continue to work that strategy and continue to communicate. But like I say, it's also a good thing that we have a little pressure on that rate coming out of the North America growth.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "All right. So in speaking quickly on cushions, just making sure, the corporate expense \u2013 I know there's rounding and you have to give ranges on segments and so forth, but it does seem to be implying your corporate expense goes up 10%, $230 million versus $210 million last year. Is that a rounding issue or should we really think that corporate expense is going up that much? But if you back from a total EBIT sort of implied by the segments, it is a larger number than I would have assumed.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Well, so it's not really rounding, but as we look at corporate expenses and \u2013 so, if you think back at 2015, where we started the year with our guidance was about $235 million, may sound familiar, and we ended the year at $210 million on the corporate side.", "When we look at 2016, we took a lot of discretionary spend out of 2015. There are some investments that we need to continue to make around our IT infrastructure, around cyber security. And we also have on the corporate side. So, we talked about pension in total for Ingersoll-Rand being about flat year-over-year. However, with a lot of puts and takes in the elements of pension, pension is a little higher on the corporate side in 2016.", "So it's not just rounding, it's not just putting things back in, but I'll also tell you that we're going to be very conscientious about what that spend is and in looking at not getting ahead of ourselves on any spend before we see what's going to happen in the different markets. So, it's a long way of saying that the $230 million, $235 million range is a lot more normal than $210 million but we're going to watch it closely and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that the money is spent very well and to the level that we need to.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "David, if you take the run rate plus the pension, you're right, there was a little bit of gap there which we would normally apply to things like IT infrastructure and security that we're on a program too to refresh. But, look, if the markets turn down, we would just look to pull back from a discretionary standpoint in other areas in corporate. So, there's a little bit of flex in it that we would take if the markets are a little bit rougher than we think.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thanks and good morning, all.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Morning, Steve.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey, Mike. You've often talked about one of the characteristics, distinguishing marks, of the new Ingersoll-Rand it's how you hold decrementals when volumes are in the down part of the cycle. So, we're obviously witnessing that inside of Industrial, or about to.", "Can you maybe talk about what decrementals you really think you're going to be able to achieve here if things do go a little bit further south? And what's giving you the confidence on just, I guess, down low-single digits in air and industrial products when it looks like bookings are a bit worse than that and the broader environment is also a bit worse?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Steve, look, a great of example of that was what happened within Compression Technologies. If you take the legacy business, it ran almost flat on much lower volume. So, a great example of that. That was a extraordinary effort by that team to really pull all the stops out on productivity and discretionary spending and really to win in the marketplace.", "It's a little bit tough to compare comps against competition. Typically, it's denominated in different currencies. But we did fairly well there on the product and service side of the business. So, that's a great example.", "I would say that where we try to leverage it in the gross range of 25% and 30%, we're certainly looking to deleverage within the gross margin range but not to exceed 25% to 30%. So, that would be sort of the essence of that. It's going to depend a bit on the business.", "I mean, TK has fundamentally, I think, more opportunity. It doesn't leverage up nearly as high as people think, it doesn't deleverage nearly as poorly as people think, largely because the distribution base of that business is independent. And so, we're really turning on and off sort of factory production and we got very flexible plants and labor forces that work with us on that. So, a great example is TK, where we would look to certainly work inside of normal margins in that business.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And, Steve, just to add on to what Mike said on the Industrial side, when I step back and think about Industrial, I kind of think about three big buckets that impacted that. Again, no excuses, the decrementals need to be at the same level as the incrementals when we go forward. But Industrial has an outsized impact from foreign exchange. So, over 50% of their revenues are impacted or they're non-U.S. and are impacted by foreign exchange. So, you have that headwind going against them. We do have the amortization from the accounting on the acquisition of Cameron. Again, took that on. You knew we took that on, but it does impact what we're looking at in 2015.", "And then, as I pointed out earlier, when you think about they don't get the benefit or the big benefit coming out of direct material deflation with commodity prices because that's just not how that segment works, the air business gets the benefit out of some of that but the other businesses within the segment do not. And so, when you say you've got outsized foreign exchange, less direct material deflation, and we put an acquisition in there with some additional amortization, so I'd think about that in the total inflation, too.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, thanks. And then, as a follow-up to an earlier question. You talked a lot about the price versus material deflation rage, spread, but a little more on the pricing environment itself absent material, what are you seeing in your big businesses in pricing, what kind of behavior are you seeing?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, both businesses in the fourth quarter are positive-priced, which is pretty outstanding, frankly, across-the-board, and that's with pressure in Climate in Asia and of course with Industrial pressure all over the world, still able to get price in that business. So, we're still seeing positive price albeit it's pretty thin in the quarter. So that's, I think, a good indicator of sort of pricing power and just sort of the pricing structure within the industry holds pretty well through tougher times.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And that same will hold for 2016, with both segments projecting positive price for 2016.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Jeff.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hey. Just back to Industrial for a moment, Mike. Just thinking about the margins sequentially, if Cameron hit its targets and with the sequential revenue that you just had seasonally, I would have thought the margins would have been a little bit better there.", "Can you just kind of walk us through that? And then, just help reconcile this a little bit, how we get comfortable with the kind of flattish Industrial for the year coming off this Q4 order number? Is there something in particular that you see in the pipeline that gives you some confidence in that number?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Jeff, I'll start and then I'll let Sue finish. But what I think a lot of folks don't recognize when we talk about Industrial is impact that material handling and tools would have. Material handling is really exclusively oil and gas for us. It's 7% (50:34) of that segment has been hit incredibly hard. And, frankly, the tools business was hit very hard by that business as well.", "Highest-margin businesses in the portfolio. And so when those go down, you feel it. It's a substantial headwind buried inside the segment numbers that's independent of what's happening with Cameron or Compression in general.", "The other thing, if you go back to Compression Technologies specifically is we do very well from a margin perspective historically in Asia and in Latin America. And so from a mix perspective, when those markets are down, and they've been absolutely clobbered, we feel that as well from a mix perspective.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Right. And so, let's talk about the ECC business for just a little bit. And so, I think the overarching point that we wanted to make when we were talking about that business is that it was EBITDA and EPS accretive, which is where we had hoped to go. However, I would say that as you look at that business from the time that we looked at the acquisition until we completed 2015, I would say that that roadmap, just like we talked about with the entire company, has a few different components.", "So if you think about the revenue side of that business, you certainly have the four components of the business with the plant, air side of the business being really hit by the weakened Industrial markets, and so that book and turn business definitely took a downturn in 2015.", "You also have tough markets with oil prices. So on the processed gas side and on the engineered air side, you got fewer projects. You've got the same number of competitors, and so you've got some tough markets there. Then, you've got an aftermarket, which is an opportunity.", "Having said all of that, what we did with the business in 2015 with a top line that wasn't perhaps as strong as what we wanted is we accelerated some of the synergies in the business and, in fact, overdrove the operating synergies \u2013 not revenue synergies, but the operating synergies in the business. And we're going to continue to do that.", "So, the point wasn't that it's operating exactly as we would have called it a year ago. But I think as we look to the business and what we were going to do with it, we ended up with a pretty good result on the acquisition.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Jeff, too, lots maybe in this is really strong execution here by the team integrating it. It'll turn out that the synergy in this thing will be about 15% of Cameron's revenues. So, that's double the synergies we thought we would have, which is a good thing because, obviously, the top line is much weaker and that's the reason it's still accretive from cash EPS perspective in the year.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Just one housekeeping item. The release says there's $250 million of repo in Q4 and $250 million in January. That $250 million in Q4 is really referring to a full year number, correct? Was there some settlement issue or something else that I'm missing there? It looks like you did $233 million through nine months.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think that was in October and we had some settlements in September. So there...", "Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations", "Late October, we said we had spent I think $233 million and $250 million by the end of October, yes.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Did you catch that?", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Not completely, no.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Okay, sorry. We were joining in on the response in the room and I apologize for that. So we did do the $250 million in the fourth quarter. We talked about that roughly in the third quarter call. And then we had a separate 10b5-1 program that repurchased $250 million in January.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Right.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "$250 million quarter four, $250 million quarter one.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "All right. I'll follow up. It says $233 million in the Q3 10-Q. That's why I'm confused. But I'll follow up.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "That's right. So, yeah. So what happened there, Jeff, so you're absolutely right. At the time we released earnings for the third quarter, which would have been the third week in October, we had not settled out the entire $250 million. So there was a little bit of leakage that was over into the remainder, but it was an October event.", "So in other words, we were announcing that we had gone into the market just like we are now. We're not talking about the first quarter, but in the first quarter we repurchased the $250 million, we had repurchased $233 million in October and the total was $250 million for the fourth quarter.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay, got it. Thank you for clarifying.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you and good morning. This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. So going back to Residential HVAC, I was hoping you'd give a little more commentary on the mix of new buying versus repair. Have you seen any change in behavior there and I guess any margin implication this might have?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, clearly we're seeing more that's not so much new construction and repair, it's largely new construction and replacement. And so we're moving back now towards replacement. Replacement is a very good place for us. We've got really good shares there as compared to new construction where shares are lower. So when the market moves toward replacement, we generally do much better and you saw that in the high-teens bookings in the fourth quarter and the overall good performance that we had in 2015, where we had really excellent performance in 2015.", "Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. I was wondering if you could give a little more color on China just by segment and then also you touched on VRF trends.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, China, it's still rough. We're not seeing great progress in China in either business. Having said that, we're somewhat in a trough and we didn't see it really dip further in the quarter in quarter four. We saw great strength outside of China, so Singapore, Thailand, India, really sort of...", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hong Kong.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "...Hong Kong, kind of made the day for us relative to Asia. So, nice to see those markets finally recovering on that front.", "VRF continues to do very well for us, continues to grow at or above the pace of our unitary business. And we continue to have a very high share in North America, parts of South America in the VRF business. And I think, as you know, we don't play a big role outside of those territories, we play a small role in China largely in commercial VRF or in hybrid systems.", "Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thank you. That was it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is now open.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Shannon.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Mike, in terms of the acquisitions and the currency impact on Industrial this year, I think it seems like every quarter they've been almost 200 basis points. Maybe Sue could provide us the split of what that was for 2015. How much was the acquisition impact, how much was currency? And then next year I'm assuming the acquisition impact year-over-year goes away but you still have some currency. Maybe help us on how those headwinds change.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It's split about 50/50 in 2015. It was about 1 point both. So, translational and transactional would have been about 1 point and acquisitions would have been about 1 point of headwind.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "And for 2016?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No acquisition headwind because everything based on the calendar, it was all a 2015 start and finish. So there's nothing there. On the FX side, it's going to be, again, a pretty tough row to hoe, probably 4 points of headwind coming into revenues and we'd see normal leverage against that. So it's probably 30 basis points, 40 basis points coming at us on that front.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And to your question on the full year of 2015, so the overall operating margins were down 140 basis points. And the math would work out roughly the same if you took out the foreign exchange and the acquisitions, that that would be the majority of what the decrement was in the overall operating margin percentage.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And then as you think about eventually getting this business get past \u2013 a lot of the focus obviously currently on this call about the near-term Industrial weakness, but you do have this target you want to eventually get to for the 2017 to 2019, and now Todd is in place in the air business. Other than cost take-outs to deal with the tougher current volumes, what are the key things you think you need to clear in order to get this to be a higher-margin business a few years out?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So the material handling piece, Shannon, probably hit for 1.5 points, maybe up to 2 points right there. So I think really an underestimation as to what the impact would be across the segment of the material handling business. So add 1.5 points there. I figure currency at least stops moving against us at some point and flattens out. That's going to be helpful to us. And then any volume we see there, we'd be leveraging that at 30%, 35% on that front.", "So there's been very soft productivity in that business, as I mentioned, particularly as it relates to the integration, that work in the back half, work, once we saw the revenue outlook deteriorates through 2015. So, it's not a productivity issue. It's, again, if you look at a business like material handling, a small business with that sort of an impact \u2013 you look at currency, which they get not only translation but there's a much larger transactional component there, where it doesn't make sense for us to have too many factories at the machining and so on and so forth, so if you're putting those in the wrong part of the world it's hard to move those and you're going to absorb some of that headwind for a while.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, listen, I think that we'll update you when we're together for the Analyst Meeting, Todd will sit again (1:01:49) in that seat and give you a point of view on that. And then Robert Zafari will clearly tell you kind of the other pieces of this as well, which have material impact as they're very high-margin businesses.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.", "Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and good morning.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "I think this has been asked a little bit already, but maybe just to put a finer point on some of the earlier questions about the Industrial assumption for flat growth given the orders have been decelerating. Just maybe, some color there on what's driving that expectation.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, you look at 2009 when we saw customers abandoning equipments, shutting plants, we're not seeing that in 2015, we're not likely to see it in 2016. We're seeing customers that are just reducing CapEx. So, you're not seeing large machines as an example.", "Now, large machines, both Cameron and existing Ingersoll-Rand, were about 10% of the total business. Now, we'll see parts and service probably in the mid- to high-single-digit range next year as these older systems need to be maintained and serviced. We even saw that begin to materialize in the back half of 2015. So again, 10% of the Compression Technology business being big machines, 45-ish percent being services. And then remember, too, you got Club Car, the tools and the fluid business which should be a tailwind. However, material handling will continue to be a headwind again going into 2016 there.", "So, net that all out and the best view we have is that that math works to about negative 1 to 1.", "Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Got you. That's very helpful. And maybe just kind of, well, a housekeeping question on the Hussmann adjustment. I think you talked about $55 million from Hussmann and asbestos. I think those two items through the third quarter were just under $30 million. So, was there like a big Hussmann 4Q, or maybe you can just unpack that a little bit? That would be helpful. Thanks.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "No, the Hussmann result in the fourth quarter were fairly normal with what they've been throughout 2015. So that really didn't have an impact. It was right on where we would have guided at the end of October.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We'll look at what you're talking about, though, and follow back up if there's more to that question.", "Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "A lot of my questions have been answered, so maybe just first one, on the price/cost spread that you laid out there, Sue, if I think about how that pertains to Climate, threw the majority in there, am I to assume kind of normal volume leverage of that in the mid-20%s. Is that what you guys are essentially guiding to or am I missing something?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I think that would be a good assumption.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And then just a follow-up. I know we've beaten the Industrial megatrend discussion to death. But thinking about Cameron backlog presumably coming into 2016, that's a little bit lower. Probably, particularly low in the first quarter given that is more of a 4Q-weighted business. Is that something that is contemplating guidance? How should we think about that as maybe a headwind to the broader reading out of just comps getting easier on some of the resource industries and the service piece being an offset?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Josh, no doubt we're going to see weaker big machine revenues. That's forecast into what we're doing. What we found here as an operator of the business is that the pricing in March in some of that big stuff is not very good. It's really around the service and longevity of those systems over time as opposed to sort of the impact on sale in the quarter and delivery.", "So really, what we need to make up there in the weakness is service, parts. And in some of the smaller machines including oil-free and segments of the market that will continue to grow like pharmaceutical, food and beverage end markets where it's more consumer-driven, say, than it would be through heavy industry.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Got you. All right, that's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Janet Pfeffer for any closing remarks.", "Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator. One thing I wanted to just clarify \u2013 I was a little far away from the mic. And so, on share repurchase, we completed the $250 million buy in the fourth quarter. $233 million of it was completed as of the end of September, the remainder completed out and settled in October. Just so to avoid some folks, any confusion on that, I wanted to clarify that.", "And Joe and I will be around for your follow-up questions today. Everybody, have a good day.

And, Janet, I want to wish you and Ron all the best in your retirement.", "Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations", "Thank you.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So with that, we delivered a very strong quarter that exceeded EPS guidance and reflected excellent execution across the whole company. The quarter really demonstrated the consistency we're seeing in our strategy, which is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, and I'd highlight a few areas here. First, we're leading our markets in the innovation and development of energy-efficient, reliable and sustainable products and services. Second, we're deepening the penetration, the maturity of our operating system, and we're delivering operational excellence across our businesses.", "Third, we're maintaining a disciplined and dynamic approach to capital allocation. And finally, as I said before, critical to any sustained cultural transformation, our employees are engaged, their scores are continuing to increase across the company. Employees continue to see Ingersoll-Rand as a great place to work, which in turn leads to a better customer experience, and that ultimately delivers shareholder value.", "Our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence to raise our full-year guidance, essentially flowing through the first quarter operational beat. Now this morning I'm going to you an overview of what we're seeing in our end markets across the globe and use the opportunity to talk a bit about how we're performing against this market backdrop, give you some color on how we're progressing for the year.", "I thought it would be useful to highlight where our performance maps specifically to our overall strategy, and then I'm going to turn it over to Sue and she'll take you through the quarter and our revised guidance for the remainder of the year.", "So over the past 16 weeks I've spent the majority of my time on the road with leaders across the company, and during that time I've met with customers from many of our business units across vertical markets and regions of the world. I've spent considerable time with our customer-facing employees, from service technicians to sales teams.", "And as always I've spent time inside our operations talking with the people who are building and engineering our products to gain their perspective on the maturity and momentum in our operating system. And I've witnessed good momentum in the deployment of our operating system and remain confident that there is still a long runway of opportunity in front of us.", "With that, let's go to slide 4. And I'm going to note that all my comments are on an organic basis so they're going to exclude currency and acquisitions. And I'll turn first to the North American Climate segment, where our business remains strong overall and we expect this momentum to continue for the balance of the year. In commercial HVAC recent, put in place data continues to support mid-single-digit growth. And we believe this should continue through at least 2017.", "We continue to see strong growth in the retail and office markets, within the institutional markets; education and government markets are also strong. We saw a low-teens revenue growth in the quarter coupled with high-single-digit bookings growth. I want to point out too that we expect to see a record for quarter two with commercial HVAC North American bookings, which should be up approximately 25% over quarter two as a result of some large institutional project awards.", "We expect to continue to outperform the overall market for the balance of the year. Additionally, we're executing well on the volume and saw excellent operating leverage in the quarter. Growth here is a direct reflection of the constant investment we've made over the past years. And we've seen growth specifically in the areas where we have invested, whether in product growth teams, products or channel. As in 2015, we are beginning quarter one of 2016 with double-digit growth in our controls and service business. With over 4,300 company direct service mechanics and technicians, we believe we are now the largest provider of mechanical HVA service to commercial customers in the world.", "Additionally, when we break out our critical growth programs from the base business, we are seeing mid-teens growth in these programs. Overall execution has been excellent. With clear discipline, the management team is running the business through our operating system. Like commercial, our residential HVAC North American business is likely to continue to outperform the market as well. We're proud of this performance and what's ahead for this business.", "I'm occasionally asked what do investors misunderstand about Ingersoll-Rand, and in reading some of the sell-side reports I think there is some misunderstanding about the success we've had in the residential HVAC business, and so I want to lay out some of the facts for you. According to AHRI data, we have increased share each quarter over the past six quarters including the first quarter of 2016. For all of 2015 and continuing into the quarter one of 2016, we have a residential HVAC business with mid-teen EBITDA margins, which makes it accretive to the segment and IR as a whole. Quarter one brought mid-teen bookings growth for the second consecutive quarter and mid-single-digit revenue growth and very strong operating leverage. Our market outlook remains positive. We forecast 4% to 5% unit growth for the industry, and we anticipate our revenue growth to be in the high-single-digit range for the year.", "The residential team has done an outstanding job implementing our operating system across its full footprint. The team is running the entire business in a full product growth value stream, and it's showing in the execution. And strategically, we've executed well on our complete product refresh, repositioning of our channel strategies, and in our connected home strategy, where we have a profitable business platform, robust diagnostic capabilities and nearly 200,000 Nexia enrollments to date. Additionally, connected home is a key driver of our residential Controls business, which has more than doubled since 2011 and continues to grow at around 25% annually.", "Shifting to North America and transport refrigeration markets, as usual the management team did a great job in the quarter and managed to improve their margins with high operating leverage. North America continues to hold up well, especially in the truck and trailer market. Our current view of truck and trailer has improved from our original view of the market from earlier this year.", "ACT raised its trailer units forecast to 47,000 units, which is up about 1% versus last year, and their prior forecast was for the market to be down 10%. We view this market data as being a bit aggressive, but we have raised our own forecast to approximately 45,000 units. And you may recall that our own prior forecast was 39,000 trailer units. So even though we do expect the market to be down over the record performance from last year, our view has improved from when we spoke in February.", "Our truck refrigeration business was also solid, and the overall market for Class 3 to Class 7 trucks is showing moderate growth. And we continue to pursue growth strategies in rail, bus and auxiliary power units to continue to balance North American business into additional vertical markets.", "As we look toward the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we plan to continue to outperform the market in the year ahead with additional new product and service launches planned in the year and excellent management teams executing on the ground, delivering good margin expansion and cash conversion growth.", "We continue to do very well in Europe with organic bookings in the high-single digits against the flattish market backdrop. We are seeing excellent uptake of the new product introductions. And like North America, the service business also grew at a double-digit rate.", "I visited our FRIGOBLOCK team and operations a few weeks ago. The progress made in the adoption of our operating system was absolutely amazing. With the FRIGOBLOCK acquisition, we've taken a step forward now in integrating hybrid electric technology into our product roadmap. The acquisition has been a great success for us.", "Middle East markets are certainly softening. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned and we expect this to continue for some time as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback. Moving to Asia Pacific, it is difficult to know if markets have reached an inflection point in China. The data is mixed and it's not that consistent month to month. Our performance though has been deviating from the market in a positive way due to investments in products and a focus we put on in increasing our direct channel market investment to achieve fuller market coverage.", "Climate bookings in China were up mid-single digits in quarter one and up low-teens for Asia Pacific as a whole. Our strategic focus on growing the service business continues to be successful in Asia, too, achieving a mid-teens growth rate in the quarter. We're also seeing strong mid-teens bookings growth in transport refrigeration equipment as the market continues to grow, and our local engineering and manufacturing teams continue to tune the product to local preferences. Strong growth outside China is being driven by growth in Thailand, India and our performance in Singapore along with good transport refrigeration growth in Australia.", "So concluding, the HVAC and transport refrigeration geographic update would take us to Latin America, where markets remain very volatile with strength in smaller but fast-growing markets in the Dominican Republic and Panama but deteriorating conditions in Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina. Conditions though in Mexico remain fundamentally sound. Organic revenue for the region was flat with low-teen increases in HVAC equipment. So we are pleased with our performance in the market. We have expanded margins in a very tough and volatile Latin American marketplace.", "Let's move to slide five. And here we'll look at the end markets for the Industrial segment of our business, and I'll start with an overall comment that our compression technologies business bookings and revenue were down organically low-single digits in the quarter, with equipment essentially tracking the overall market but with service up mid-single digits. Again, we are focused in growing our service businesses across the enterprise and executing well on that strategy.", "In North America, U.S. manufacturing capacity utilization remains relatively low, hitting 75% last quarter, which is the lowest point over the last 12 quarters. Now large equipment CapEx, typical for what we would see for large centrifugal and large rotary air compressors, historically rebounds at utilization readings above 80%.", "On one visit I had the opportunity to meet with a major customer that's been around for decades building small-scale LNG plants that range from 50,000 gallons to 500,000 gallons per day. I asked this PhD physicist what the most reliable leading indicator he would look for in his end markets, and he responded very simply by saying it's when the telephone rings, and fortunately he did say the phone is beginning to ring, as is ours in that area.", "So whether it's small-scale LNG systems or larger air compressors, our sense is to that even early activity in large machine quoting activity probably will have little impact on large machine deliveries in 2016.", "To give you a little bit more color on this for the North American market, when you look at compressors between five horsepower and 400-plus horsepower, the market for small compressors, those between five horsepower and 15 horsepower, is off roughly 10%, while compressors larger than 250 horsepower are down more than 30% in the first two industry-reported months of the quarter. Smaller compressors quarter. The smaller compressors are quicker book and turn with inventory re-stocking occurring in that category.", "We also believe we are seeing some re-stocking to the wholesale channel in our tools and fluid management business. Our material handling team has done a great job managing their business, essentially holding the business to breakeven on a 50% reduction in revenue. So again, across the business we have a management team doing a very good job exhibiting strong cost control, execution discipline on the backdrop of continued declines in projected global market growth.", "In Europe we're seeing increased exports to industrial production across Western Europe. Eastern Europe continues to be fairly weak. And for Asia Pacific, the current environment continues to experience pricing pressure across the region, but we're cautiously optimistic to see if we have reached an inflection point as manufacturing indices signal pockets of improvement in countries such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea. And China's power consumption index has also shown growth in the first two months of the year, and India is seeing strong market growth in verticals like textile, pharma and food and beverage.", "So rounding up the geographic update for Industrial segment, we'll go to Latin America where volatility in the markets there across the region continues to be driven by political instability, and this has contributed to reduced investment in verticals such as energy, oil and gas, mining and metals. However, other verticals like food and beverage, pharma and textile remain with positive outlooks.", "So before turning it over to Sue, let me conclude by saying again we had an excellent quarter. We continue to invest in the products, service offerings and footprint of the company while using our operating systems to deliver well above industry average results.", "Now I'll turn it over to you, Sue, to cover the financial review and guidance.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Mike. Let's go to slide 6. Let's begin with an overview of the first quarter. Q1 was a strong operational quarter across all of our businesses. As you heard in Mike's comments, end markets continue to be strong in Climate and weaker than expected in Industrial. Our business operating system guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment. Our results show that we did not let costs get ahead of revenues in the quarter.", "Revenues grew slightly on a reported basis and were up 2% organically. The Climate segment grew 4% organically. Industrial was down 5% both on a reported and an organic basis. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses led by commercial and residential in North America. Revenue in our Industrial businesses declined in the quarter, with tough comparisons to the first quarter of 2015.", "Large centrifugal compressors and other Industrial equipment were weaker than our estimates but Club Car performed as expected with low year-over-year growth. Our adjusted operating margins grew 140 basis points year-over-year with organic operating leverage of 75%. Adjusted segment margins grew 150 basis points, which shows the alignment between our operating performance and our Q1 results. Our strength was in price, direct material deflation and mix.", "Earnings per share grew 32% year-over-year, exceeding our prior guidance. In Q1 our capital deployment actions included repurchasing $250 million of shares, and we increased our dividend by 10%. We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016. All impacts will appear in the second quarter.", "Please go to slide 7. I've included a slide to reconcile our Q1 EPS actual results with our prior guidance. I've said on a few occasions this morning that our results were the result of good execution and operational performance. Price and direct material deflation were the largest drivers of the margin expansion in Q1. This is an area where everything went right in the quarter, i.e., there was no breakage. Price was positive in both segments, and direct material deflation was also very positive to our guidance.", "Cost savings and controls were a positive $0.03 for the quarter. Each of our businesses and corporate functions had favorable variances to start the year as we controlled spending while we evaluated our end market volatility.", "Currency, share count and other income were about $0.01 each. We opportunistically repurchased shares earlier in the year than we would normally, and currency was a bit favorable to our guidance range (18:44).", "Restructuring was favorable to our guidance by $0.03 for the quarter. This is timing. We have identified projects to execute and continue to work on restructuring projects that have good returns and shorter paybacks and will spend the remaining $0.03 throughout the remainder of 2016.", "Please go to slide right. Orders for the first quarter of 2016 were up 4% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high-single digits, led by high-teens growth in North America unitary and double-digit growth in Asia applied.", "We continue to see excellent growth in service controls, contracting and parts, with double-digit growth in the quarter. Regionally for commercial HVAC, we saw high-single-digit booking increases with a high-single-digit increase in North America and Europe, up low-teens in Asia, and with declines in both the Middle East and Latin America.", "Residential bookings were up 17%. Organic transport orders were down low-single digits with low-teens growth in truck and trailer in North America and Europe that were offset by lower container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 5% organically. We saw a low-single-digit order decline in compression equipment, a low-teens decline in other industrial products and a mid-single-digit decline in Club Car.", "Performance in compression technologies was mixed in the first quarter. We had an improvement in small compressors while freeing (20:23) in some of our component businesses like dryers and filters. We also had a small improvement in our aftermarket business. These gains were offset by declines in core industrial compressors and by large centrifugal equipment.", "Please go to slide 9. This slide provides a directional view of our segment performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 4% in the first quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and flattish growth across Europe, Latin America and Asia. The Middle East was the only region that declined within the Climate segment. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned in the Middle East and would expect this to continue for some time as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback.", "Our Industrial segment performance in the first quarter, which was down 5%, is representative of the volatility that continues across the globe in the industrials market. Strong performance in Mexico contributed double-digit growth in Latin America. We also saw growth in Europe while Asia was flat and North America was down high-single digits.", "Overall, our regional performance for the first quarter trends with the end market summary that Mike provided us earlier with a strong start in North America. Industrial segment performance is expected to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through productivity gains and cost control.", "Please go to slide 10. Operating margin on a reported basis increased 160 basis points from 5.9% to 7.5% from the first quarter 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. Mix was favorable for the quarter, 40 basis points, largely offset by unfavorable volume and currency. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was the largest driver of margin improvement in the quarter, favorable by 160 basis points. Price realization was achieved across both the Climate and Industrial segments, which was higher than expected, and commodities remain deflationary.", "Productivity versus other inflation was positive 10 basis points, driven by ongoing productivity actions partially offset by other inflation. Year-over-year investments and other items reduced margins by 20 basis points. In the box, you can see that was comprised of 40 basis points from incremental investments, 20 basis points from higher restructuring costs, which were partially offset by 40 basis point improvement related to the absence of acquisition-related step-up costs incurred in 2015. Overall reported operating leverage exceeded 100% in the quarter as we expanded margins in a low-growth environment.", "Please go to slide 11. Our Climate businesses had an excellent quarter in Q1. Adjusted segment income and EBITDA margins improved by 280 basis points and 260 basis points to 9.8% and 12.4% respectively. Increased volumes, favorable mix, price, direct material deflation and productivity offset other inflation and investment spending. The leverage for the Climate segment was 118% for the quarter. Revenues for the quarter were up 4% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by mid-teens unitary equipment shipments in North America and low-teens parts and service revenue in North America.", "Europe had low-single digit equipment growth and high-single digits in services and trucking and (24:00) parts. The Middle East had parts and services growth offset by declines in equipment sales. Residential revenues were up mid-single digits in Q1 with very strong leverage and significant margin improvement.", "First quarter organic revenues were down slightly, but this does not tell the whole story for Q1. North America truck and trailer organic revenues were up mid-single digits, and European truck and trailer organic revenues were up in the mid-20% range. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the first quarter, reflecting a soft start at various box builders for 2016.", "Please go to slide 12. First quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $681 million, down 5% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low-single digits versus last year. Club Car organic revenues were up slightly versus prior year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high-single digits, while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were down low-single digits and were flat in Asia.", "Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 9.6% was down 230 basis points compared with last year. Price and direct material deflation were positive, productivity offset other inflation, and volume and mix were unfavorable.", "Please go to slide 13. First quarter free cash flow of negative $46.3 million was favorable to prior year by $135 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability.", "For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 6.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter, with our days sales outstanding improving 1.3 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventory is on plan for the quarter and we're well-positioned to serve our customers as we enter the heavier-volume second quarter. Capital expenditures of $40 million are lower than prior year due to capitalization of our ERP systems costs in the first quarter of 2015.", "Please go to slide 14. Capital allocation is a key area of strategy for us. We continue to invest in our businesses and I think you'll agree that our results show the value of our product refresh strategy and our operational excellence programs, which are a part of our business operating system.", "We raised the annual dividend 10% in early 2016 with a goal of maintaining a dividend payout consistent with our peers. We have an M&A pipeline that reflects our desire to add to our products, technologies and channels as outlined in our strategy. We are focused on building long-term value. We bought shares to offset benefit program dilution in the first quarter at an average share price of $51.10.", "Please go to slide 15. As always, our intention is to give you the best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. We also added a column to show you our current versus prior thinking on organic revenue.", "North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets have declined. We are forecasting transport markets in North America to be flat. Our forecast for North American trailer volume has shifted from declines of 15% to down slightly for the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets.", "Both the growth forecasts shown here are on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total; high-single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-American \u2013 North American business for us; and a small increase in transport. We expect compression-related products and other equipment to be down high-single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low-single digits.", "Please go to slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for the full-year 2016 to be flat to up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about two percentage points. While these revenue outlets do not show a total change, the segment numbers reflect important updates. We expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. For the Industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of down 4% to down 6% on a reported basis and down 2% to down 4% organically.", "For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get adjusted margin. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%. For the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.8% to 12.3%, a 30 basis point improvement from our prior 2016 guidance and a year-over-year improvement of 70 basis points. Operating leverage would be about 40% on an organic basis for the year.", "Please go to slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.39 to $5.54. Excluding restructuring and the Hussmann gain, the range is $3.95 to $4.10, an increase of 6% to 10% versus 2015 and a $0.13 increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $3.80 to $4. As a note, for 2016 currency is a headwind of about 2% of revenue. This reflects a full-year tax rate forecast of 24% to 25% and an average diluted share count of 261 million shares for the full year.", "Second quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We are projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q2 and Industrial to decline mid-single digits on a reported basis.", "Reported second quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $2.75 to $2.80. Back out $0.01 of restructuring and the $1.49 Hussmann gain to get to an adjusted range of $1.27 to $1.32.", "For the full-year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow, which excludes restructuring and the Hussmann proceeds, of $950 million to $1 billion.", "And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Great. Thank you, Sue. And I'll be brief. As I started out this morning, we had a strong quarter. We improved operating performance in a volatile environment. We realized price in both segments. We achieved outstanding leverage and improved our cash flow. We're growing in the areas we put a strategic focus. There's clear evidence that this won't be crated. (31:39). Our operating system is gaining momentum. And I'm confident in our management team, and we feel good about our forecast for the remainder of the year.", "So with that, Sue and I will take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Hi, good morning, guys.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Josh.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Morning.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Just on the price-cost equation here, clearly a pretty strong contribution in the first quarter. Can you help us with how that dimensions out, just based on purchasing agreements and hedges you already have in place, over the balance of the year?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Absolutely. So you're right. The 160 basis point spread between price and direct material deflation was a strong start to the year. What we expect for the first half of the year is strong performance on a year-over-year basis because last year we were still in an inflationary environment in the first half of 2015. So I think the second quarter will be slightly less favorable than the 160 basis points.", "But what we've adjusted the full year to now, Josh, is 80 basis points of favorable spread between price and direct material deflation. And so the first half-second half reflects basically the year-over-year compares to last year. And then as we look at the 80 basis points, though Q1 performance was driven by strong price performance, and we expect some of that to continue in Q2 and also strong performance from the material side. Price is one of those areas where I think you never want to reach out and assume that you can continue to get price at a big execution level throughout the year in a strong deflationary environment.", "But as it comes to the commodities themselves, here's what we expect. So we have about 70% of our copper locked in for the year through our contracts. We expect that copper and aluminum are going to be fairly stable in terms of what happens throughout the rest of 2016. You'll see some ups and downs. But generally I think those are going to be pretty stable.", "We're seeing a slight uptick in steel, but I don't think that's going to impact us in 2016. Because of the way that our contracts are written we wouldn't start to see that until the very end of the year. So I think our supply base and our commodity teams have done a great job of getting us the deflation that you're seeing in the results. I expect that to continue. All of the tier 2 pricing really seemed to come in in Q1 also. So I think we had a great environment and I think we'll have a great result.", "So if you recall, we had given you a look at the full year I think 30 basis points to 40 basis points when we last gave guidance. And as I said, we took that up to 80 basis points favorable spread for 2016.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Great. That's helpful. And then, Sue, just as a follow-up, I remember last quarter you talked about some of the toggles for the tax rate and specifically mentioned intercompany debt. Could you just maybe update us where we're at on the total tax strategy in light of some of the Treasury rulings?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Right. So I think the first way to start out that question, Josh, is to say that we've looked at all of the proposed Treasury regulations, and we don't expect those regulations to have an impact on our effective tax rate in 2016.", "As we think about the tax strategy that I talked about, getting us into a low-20s% type of tax rate on an ongoing basis, I also don't expect those regulations to have an impact on us getting into those areas. And the reason that I say that is when we're looking at our tax strategy, intercompany debt is one element of some of the things that you can do \u2013 trading hubs, procurement hubs, making sure that your transfer pricing is absolutely aligned, and other tax-efficient projects can help us get to where we want to go.", "We've also been looking at a project that helps us look at effective tax rates by each of our SBUs so that we're all working on taxes, we do our plans, and we do our forward looks. And I think that'll help us with an overall tax strategy that doesn't get impacted by the proposed Treasury regulations. We'll obviously continue to look at those and make sure that we understand all of the sort of derivative impact that might be out there from the regulations, but no impact on the rate and no impact on our strategy going forward.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Perfect. Thanks for the answer.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Joe.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Joe.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I guess my first question, maybe starting on Industrial where you did see decelerating trends. I noticed that you didn't take up the restructuring at all for the quarter, and if I recall correctly there were some cam shipments that were expected to be released in the beginning part of this year. And so I'm just wondering is there still opportunity for further action in Industrial and I guess what's the strategy at this point?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. So the $0.02 of restructuring that we spent in Q1 was related to Industrial. We are continuing to work on restructuring actions for the remainder of the year, and those are going to primarily be in Industrial. So we called out in the guidance about a $0.01 for each of the next three quarters. I think what's important about the restructuring and the way that we look at it is that the restructuring really does have a payback within 2016. So we fully expect to realize the benefits of that $0.05 of restructuring, and that is also what will help us with my comment earlier in my prepared remarks about Industrial margins improving in the back half of the year. So some of that productivity kicks in and some of the restructuring actions that were actually started almost a year ago are going to kick in.", "Now on the ECC side, we did have some shipments that had pushed out of Q4. We actually had some shipments that pushed out of Q1 also into Q2. But the ECC story is an interesting one. So if I look at first quarter bookings in total, bookings in total for the ECC business are actually up significantly in the first quarter. The majority of that is going to be in the products that are outside of the large centrifugal compressors. Those are really coming down, so bookings are up, which is good.", "The revenues that we're seeing are really being impacted by the large centrifugals. But also importantly as we think about ECC and that business is we expect to really be on track with the revenue and the cost synergies for 2016 that we had outlined.", "So lots of moving pieces in the business, but I think you see some strengths in the normal product and in the aftermarket and some bigger weakness and some shipments moving around in the large centrifugal compressors.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Joe, remember, too, that I think that we've been serial restructurers now for years, and that's both qualified and non-qualified. So we're always improving the cost base there. When you look at the type of paybacks that we are seeing in this business, we're getting numbers like seven years, which is indicative of doing a good job around running plants, utilization that we've been able to achieve in our plants.", "If you couple that with the lead time to bring on new capacity when the markets return, that's a 24-month to 30-month process, particularly in the machining centers that we would be moving or upgrading to do that. So we don't want to get whipsawed in doing any larger restructuring when this thing turns around because the margins come back very strong when the business volumes come back as well. So we're being cautious.", "So we're always looking at the ideas that are on the table. If the underlying real estate values change or if tax incentives change from one location to another, it could swing something like that. So we're very cautious about looking at an upswing in the lead time to bring capacity on when you need it. And we don't want to ever be in a situation at an upswing in the market to not have sufficient capacity at that point in time.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That makes sense, Mike. I guess maybe my follow-on question, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you say that 2Q North America commercial HVAC bookings were expected to be up about 25%?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, that's correct.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And is that the reason for the organic revenue guidance raise?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "That's more of an impact in 2017 and it's got a little bit of a positive in 2016, a little bit of a positive in 2018. But the bulk of that would be 2017 shipments. So it's really the strength of the business across the board. Unitary continues to be strong. The pipeline looks strong for us. Europe has been a great success story. I think it will continue as well. And of course the residential business continues to put up some very big numbers.", "And so all of that combined has got more to do with the guidance increase than the large booking number in quarter two. By the way, quarter three should look pretty good for us as well. Although I don't have a prognostication on the percentage rate, it should be a good quarter for us.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Thank you. I just want to say thanks a lot to Janet for all the help, and all the best. In terms of the first question, that would really be back on the Industrial margins. They used to be at sort of 16%, 17% of the odd quarter here and there, and they are down to 9% to 10% right now. And the guidance embeds that by the end of the year I guess they climb back into the sort of low-teens in the next three quarters. So maybe just help clarify what's driving that sort of 400 point-plus margin recovery. Is it just about productivity or is there something going on with the mix as well of Industrial versus compression?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So Julian, great question. On the Industrial margins, your math is absolutely correct that in the back half of the year we do have the operating margins for Industrial improving into the low-teens. And as we look at what's going to happen in the back half of the year, it truly is productivity, still lower inflationary type of rates. So you've got productivity offsetting other inflation. You still have positive price in the back half of the year. And you have just a skosh more volume in the back half of the year than the front.", "I don't want anyone to think there is a lot of volume recovery that we've built into this; we have not. But there is by virtue of how the quarters pan out roughly $50 million of additional revenue in the back half versus the front half. But it's productivity. It is the restructuring actions that are kicking in, and it is the continuation of the actions that the management teams are taking to work through this low revenue and market decline.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "There was also, Julian, the cost control there is exceptional. So even though you were seeing kind of a headline $0.02 restructuring, there's at least that much, maybe more than that which would be non-qualified restructuring. So it's sort of restructuring in place, not replacing or fulfilling spending. So there is a cost for that in the first half of the year and a benefit to that in the back half of the year, which is broadly in line with Sue's productivity comment, but a big piece of that productivity is literally the cost control around head count, some of which is qualified, some of which is non-qualified in terms of how we would actually account for it.", "The longer-term question that you asked about the profitability of the business, Sue did a little bit of analysis on this, and it might be useful to kind of walk through when we would see a 17% margin business.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "All right. That's great. So when I look at it \u2013 so the first thing that we did is we went back and said at the time that we gave the original 17% margin guidance for the Industrial business, the revenues in the business were in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion. If I look at where we're at today, we're roughly in the $3 billion type of territory.", "So I think as we look at the business, we're doing all of the right actions today to get the costs in line, but I think what we need is market recoveries and I think the revenues to return to sort of that upper $3 billion range for us to get into the 17% margin. We think that's doable, but I think the timeframe is really highly dependent on when the markets come back.", "Right now, we haven't seen the markets actually stop falling. So we need to stabilize first and then the markets to return, but again I think the way I'm thinking about it is once the revenues get back up into the $3.6 billion, $3.7 billion area where they were when we gave that guidance, that we'll be nearing those 17% type of margins for Industrial.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Remember, when you look at the gross margins of that business and look at the fixed cost of that business say relative to the Climate segment, you can see very easily why that business snaps back very strongly on volume. So when volume returns to that business, we'll get very aggressive incremental margins out of that. In the short term, we're controlling the heck out of costs the best we can. However, we're not going to spite our nose to save our face as it relates to capacity.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Thanks. And then just my follow-up quickly would be, on your overall firm-wide margin bridge, Q1 you had about 10 points or 10 bps from productivity and other inflation. I guess based on what you just said, should we think the number for the year ends up somewhere between that 10 bps and the sort of the 90 bps tailwind that you had last year for the year as a whole?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I do think that you will \u2013 we do see other inflation to be higher in the first half versus the second half is when our salary increases takes place. That's when a lot of the benefits take place. So when I look at what we plan for the full year, I would say it probably looks more like 40 basis points to 50 basis points for the full year, Julian.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Nigel.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. I really hope Janet isn't calling a peak here. I don't think she is. But thanks for all the help.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "She is fine.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "So this North American auto expenses is really interesting, Mike, and I'm assuming that's really driven by these large-type projects, finally some big spend (49:04). I'm just wondering what's changed here. I mean is it just a case of old equipment we're seeing here, so the extended replacement cycle can move through? Is it budgetary? I mean any color there would be helpful.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Nigel, I think all that's true, but the constant persistent investment we've made over five years, six years, seven years in that business, the constant investment in the channel and the service footprint is really paying off. And I just think the focus we've had on all of that development being around energy efficiency, sustainability, new refrigerant development, all of that is such a powerful story when you look at it.", "This is what we were waiting for. This is what we hoped to have seen, which is outsized growth relative to the market and outsized profitability or margin expansion relative to the market. So this is a huge effort by lots of people all the way through to the technicians providing service on the street for us. This is a real accomplishment.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And obviously very early to call 2017 at this point, but if you just look at your North American commercial HVAC operations based on the backlog of pipeline, is it reasonable to assume that perhaps you might see some acceleration next year?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the thing you have to think about though is what happens to the office and retail business. As an example, our national accounts business has been doing extremely well into retail. Office building is doing really well, as you can see, kind of the high-teens bookings rate again. Unitary, that's been strong again.", "Some point you'd think that that would begin to subside and be replaced by stronger applied growth, which I think will happen. So I think what you end up with is maybe a change in the mix between unitary and applied, but I do think continued strong performance through 2017.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks, Mike. That's helpful.", "Operator", "And our next question from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Steve.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "On the Climate side, I mean just a very big margin number, obviously, and I'm trying to just wrap my head around the seasonality dynamics, 1Q to 2Q. In the last couple years you've had increases, like in 2014 you guys saw a doubling or almost a tripling of the profit number in Climate. Can you just maybe speak to maybe what you expect seasonally there or maybe just at a high level what you expect for the margin in that business as we move through the year? And my guess is the seasonality is a bit muted because you're now seeing the onset of commercial, which is a less seasonal business than some of these other things, or just maybe help us square that, just with the first quarter basis so high that just having trouble kind of getting low enough in Climate.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Steve, so I think that looking at something certainly in the 16% margin range for the entire segment is going to make a lot of sense for us. Again, to Sue's point, price I think subsides a little bit, material inflation kind of clips along pretty much at the same rate, bookings look good, pipeline looks fairly strong. We're not seeing \u2013 the container business on the transport side being down of course is not all that problematic for us in terms of margins as long as European trailer and North American trailer are doing well. So you put that all together and you're probably dealing with something in the 16% range.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Can you at some point soon kind of get to that 17%? Will you kind of hit that at some point this year?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know. I mean, really looking at Q3 and Q4 at that level of granularity around guidance, Steve, I don't know. I mean Q2 is seasonally a pretty good quarter for us. Quarter three can be. So we've got an outside shot at something like that.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just on the kind of go-forward leverage, so you had this nice pop off the bottom on margins. Should we continue to expect that if this kind of current mix holds, that if commercial HVAC does really continue to roll on here and we have a bit more of an extended cycle than I think most people were expecting probably three months to four months ago, can you still leverage that business really well, or do you have to add cost or anything like that? I mean I feel like you got to have plenty of capacity here to let it rip a little bit before you start to throw money at the business from a capacity perspective, right?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the service business and the controls business are growing so well, too, and our margins are obviously much higher. So it's a little bit distorting about how we might think about fixed costs being factory costs. So I do think that there is some capacity we have even in our field service and controls capability that wouldn't require incremental investment. Obviously it's feet on the street, but we stay in front of that, and we typically hire long in the service business. So I don't see why having leverage for the full year \u2013 it starts with a 4 \u2013 would be a problem in the Climate business.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then one last quick one. You guys took up the price cost year-over-year by I think 40 bps you said, but you only took your margins up by 30 bps. Anything \u2013 that's just volume and mix at Industrial, is that kind of that moving part?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, inflation kicks in just in terms of wage increases beginning in April for the full year, and we kind of see sort of the cost increase there as well. Puts a little bit of a squeeze...", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "...on margins there. But fundamentally, Steve, there's not anything really changing other than the fact that it's hard to believe that price would stay high as it normally is, and material inflation should stay about where it is, but we're looking at just closing that gap a little bit probably from the price side.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hey. Mike, can you just elaborate a little bit more on kind of the bookings strength? And was that a \u2013 that 25% number, is that global or are you speaking to the U.S.?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It would be the North American commercial business.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "North American commercial. It does sound like Europe, though, is fairly strong for you on share gain. How do you see that playing out over the balance of the year?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I went \u2013 probably I saw five, six of our factories and operations in Europe a month ago. I met with the engineering teams. I saw product launching between August and December, Jeff. It's one of the best stories I've seen, absolutely the fastest cycle time between ideation and product launch. They're hitting it right on the money in terms of what the customers are looking for. It's been a great story for us on the ECC side in Europe.", "But I'll also tell you, switching over to FRIGOBLOCK, FRIGOBLOCK was a family-run German company. If you put sort of a paradigm around that, you might think slow to change or difficult to incorporate in the operating system. What I found there was one of the fastest implementations of an operating system that we've put in place across the company. It's very exciting. And the openness around that \u2013 and then the openness of our transport refrigeration team to include that hybrid electric technology into the truck platform is also very positive. So I left Europe feeling very bullish.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And then could you address what's going on in 14 SEER? Probably still early in the season to know for sure, but does that price gap versus legacy 13 SEER holding in that 10% to 15% range?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, Jeff, it is holding. And I think the great news about the 14 SEER is what we saw was the balance of 14 SEER and greater product is still about 80% of the revenues in 2016. So we're seeing price, we're seeing the favorable mix that we expected out of the product. And we're also seeing that the balance between 14 SEER and even the 15 SEER and above has not really changed, which does create a good environment as you alluded to with the price and cost differential.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "So is that 40 basis points of positive mix, Sue, that you elaborated all in residential? Did you actually have more than that in residential than you saw somewhere else?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So it was not all residential. It was a combination of residential and also Thermo King. On the Thermo King side, and one of the things that we saw was we saw more strength than we expected in truck and trailer both in North America and in Europe. And then the big declines on Thermo King came from the marine container business that I said was down about 60%. So the 40 basis points of mix was primarily from res and from Thermo King. And my recollection is it was split pretty evenly.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBank Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jeff.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey. So what's driving the 1Q order growth in residential, and what gives you the confidence to kind of move that forecast up ahead of the selling season?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean first and foremost the product line really at this point has been fully developed, and we've hit stride, all the good success with the furnace product, all the good success with the new launches, the variable speed, growth in Nexia. All these things have just been really kind of coming together.", "Operationally, we just find the pipeline for projects and productivity and quality to be improving. Deliveries have been exceptional in terms of on-time delivery and having product available where you need it, when you need it, really investing in the warehousing and investing in the product availability. So just a sense here that things have gone right for a long time here and that we'll do better, particularly as the mix moves up north of 14 SEER, which it is. So as the mix moves north of 14 SEER, we do better anyway. And as the mix moves more toward replacement and away from new construction, we'll do better.", "Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then how's the M&A pipeline kind of informing how you're thinking about buyback through the balance of the year?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "There is no doubt we want to grow the company and grow value over the long run. So we said we're looking at ideas and businesses that we know and run and are successful with. FRIGOBLOCK and Cameron were great examples; different examples but great examples of being able to take businesses, put them into an operating system, improve the businesses and deliver essentially what we said we were going to deliver from an accretion perspective. So we feel good about our capability in doing that.", "We also feel patient. We feel like we don't have to \u2013 we're not compelled to do anything around M&A. We've got great positions in the marketplace, and there's not a compelling need for us to go do something and potentially do something where we pay too much in that process.", "So, Jeff, we'll continue to evaluate that. When we see opportunities that fit the criteria we'll pull the trigger. And we clearly want to grow long-term value to the shareholder, and that's probably the best way to do it.", "With that being said, you couldn't pass up in January. The stock price dislocated 20% from the peer group. I mean we jumped in on that and acquired $250 million in January at $51 a share. So we're going to be dynamic, we're going to be opportunistic, and we're going to grow shareholder value. If that means we find the right bolt-ons to do that, we're going to jump on those, too.", "Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thanks, and good morning. And also appreciate the additional detail in the disclosure today. It's helpful. Let's see. So first of all, Mike, how are you reconciling all of this discussion about commercial HVAC strong growth relative to what is pretty lackluster Dodge data, ABI, all these macro data points? Are you attributing it all to share, renovation, control, service? Just maybe a little clarity on that would be helpful.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's sort of all of the above, Steve, which is probably hard to give clarity on that. But if you take Latin America, we're up mid-teens in Latin America. That's clearly our people out in the street creating demand, making it happen. Mid-teens bookings growth in Asia. I mean Asia is not that strong. Again, our team is hitting the street.", "Europe, we talked about product development, and the pace of product development there is best-in-class in the company and product management, best we have in the company around getting exactly right on these product growth teams and understanding where we're competing, how we're going to win against very specific competitors in the market.", "These products launched, and they do exactly what they were supposed to do. That's a positive for us. So there's a lot of self-help here happening and the backdrop on the markets, with the exception of the Middle East, isn't bad. So you've got decent markets and really strong execution.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. And how are you doing on \u2013 what's the growth rate on VRF in the quarter, progress, any developments there?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Last year we were about 30% growth. This year we're about the same, Steve. We continue to do well on the market. We continue to sell VRF. We're beginning to also see interest in what's referred to as four-pipe chiller. So this is simultaneous heat and cooling around water circulating through buildings versus refrigerant. It's big in Europe, picking up a little bit of interest in the U.S.", "The idea here is we're going to have whatever products are demanded in the marketplace, and then we're going to work with our customers to figure out what the best solution is for the building. And that's why our business was up 30% last year. It's why our business is up about the same this year as well.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "And that concludes our Q&A session.

We had outstanding execution across the company, delivering 15% EPS growth, record operating margins, share gains, and strong cash flow, despite challenging industrial markets.", "We are seeing strong momentum in the operating system that we have been installing and developing in the company over the past six-plus years.", "As we did last quarter, I'd like to start out spending a few minutes linking this quarter's performance to the longer-term strategic direction of the company to help investors understand how we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company over the longer term.", "With our operating system, operational excellence and growth excellence have been cornerstones of the strategy from the beginning, with our goal of becoming the very best operating company within our diversified or multi-industry peer group. This quarter, we continued to deliver best-in-class operating leverage of 47%, and our goal is to achieve top-quartile organic growth for the quarter and for the year as well.", "There were a number of noteworthy milestones that showed clear progress in these areas during the quarter. Our Residential HVAC business had another outstanding quarter with record revenue and profitability. We estimate that over the past quarter and 12 months we now have benchmarked profitability in this business and are seeing the benefits of a five-year effort to refresh the product line, align and reposition the channel and dramatically improve product management, manufacturing and supply chain. Our Residential business is also a model for the deployment of product growth teams who are delivering market share and margin growth.", "Our Commercial HVAC business in North America had record second quarter bookings and revenue. Similar to our Residential HVAC story, we have executed on a consistent strategy with a goal to have the freshest, most energy efficient and reliable product line in the industry, and have supported that with consistent operational improvements along the way.", "We continue to see double-digit increases in our controls business and high single-digit growth in our service business, consistent with our strategy to balance equipment with controls and services.", "In the second quarter, Trane Commercial led the industry with a strong pipeline of new high-efficiency products, many of which earn our EcoWise badge for innovation that improves energy efficiency as compared to legacy product platforms while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.", "Examples this quarter include the North American announcement of the new CenTraVac Centrifugal chiller portfolio using next-generation low global warming-potential refrigerant. The product is for large buildings and industrial applications in the U.S. and Canada.", "We also announced a service program to retrofit the existing installed base for the next-generation low global warming-potential refrigerant, which protects and provides a viable option for our customers' past investment while achieving their own sustainability goals.", "In Europe, we announced another four new products. The Sintesis eXcellent, a new air-cooled chiller with nearly zero global warming potential using next-generation refrigerant.", "Airfinity, a complete new range of HVAC rooftop units designed to comply with the upcoming European Union Ecodesign regulations. They are light, compact and modular plug-and-play HVAC units that are compatible with wireless technology and designed to save time and money when retrofitting and improve the efficiency of existing buildings across Europe.", "XStream, a new range of water-cooled screw chillers now available in Europe and the Middle East. The efficiency and capacity ratings are unmatched by any other screw chiller in the market today. We hope this will become a preferred option for critical applications like data centers, hospitals, process cooling, and district cooling and heating.", "And finally, Trane's Balance, our second generation of innovative multi-pipe systems for high-efficiency simultaneous heating and cooling. The systems repurpose energy that is rejected and use renewable energy for heating.", "Within our Thermo King North America, Europe, and Middle East business, we are demonstrating that we have a more resilient business than the past, expanding margins 270 basis points in a low-growth environment.", "As we noted in our initial guidance, we believe that we could maintain or even grow margins with a 15% North American trailer pullback and flat overall volumes.", "Today, the Thermo King business serves the refrigerated truck, trailer, marine container, air container, bus and rail, telematics, and auxiliary power unit markets, and the completeness of the portfolio has added to margins and the overall resiliency of the portfolio.", "Also of interest, both our Residential HVAC and Thermo King North America, Europe, and Middle East business units have been fully deployed on the new ERP system for the past couple of quarters, and we believe we are now seeing the expected productivity throughout these business units. We continue to deploy new sites routinely in other business units each quarter.", "We continue to be pleased with the tremendous execution we are seeing in our HVAC and Transport Refrigeration business in Asia-Pacific and in Latin America. Both regions demonstrated substantial margin improvement and share growth. HVAC bookings in Latin America were up 36% on an organic basis for the quarter, a really outstanding performance by that team and that region.", "In Asia-Pacific, our Transport Refrigeration business continues to grow, with another 23% increase in bookings and 25% increase in revenue. Both are examples of finding pockets of growth within generally weak markets and then capitalizing on those opportunities.", "Turning to our Industrial Segment, I want to start by saying that I have tremendous confidence in our leaders running these business units and they're operating in a very challenging environment. Within Compression Technologies in North America, which is our largest market for equipment, the 250 horsepower contact cooled rotary market is down 20%, and all other size ranges are also down in the high single-digit range, with only small 5 horse to 15 horse compressors showing year-over-year growth.", "Against this backdrop, we are performing well and supplementing the business with service bookings of approximately 10% in the quarter.", "Remember, too, that the last time we emerged from a down industrial cycle we grew margins nearly seven full points in a 24-month period.", "Our fluid management business continues to perform well with modest growth, and we are seeing continued weakness in the tools business and no sign of recovery in our material handling business, which provides hoist and winches for the oil and gas industry.", "Club Car continues to broaden its strategy and reach outside of golf with small electric vehicles in the commercial and consumer segments.", "Turning to growth excellence, which encompasses the full value stream from strategic analytics, product management, new product and technology introduction, sales management, and service and support, this has been another cornerstone of our long-term strategy. We believe the product, channel and service footprint investments we've made over the past five years to seven years are paying off. It's clearly evident in the HVAC and Transport Refrigeration business units and we believe it will also be the case for our Compression Technology business unit that has been doing a similar investment program over the past couple of years, which will continue the next several years.", "Even as industrial markets are challenging today, we continue the investment in the Compression Technologies business because we expect we'll be rewarded as the market recovers. As one example, one of the product growth teams operates in the Compression Technology business and covers a specific product portfolio which equates to about 10% of the overall revenue of that business. Within the product growth team we're seeing year-to-date bookings increases of 30% and revenues increasing by 17%.", "Its strength in our Climate segment, capacity utilization, and our shared climate and industrial plants and operations and leveraging our technology teams that's allowing us the opportunity to stay the course on critical growth programs in our Industrial segment. We have continued to invest in strategic growth programs across the company through both good and difficult times and the benefits of doing so are clear. Our designated strategic growth programs, many of which are managed through our product growth team process, are growing at a rate three times faster than the underlying growth rate of the company.", "As another example, within the Commercial HVAC business in North America, Europe and the Middle East our strategic growth programs are growing at a 14% rate this year and for the company 80% plus of our growth is coming from investment and focus on these critical strategic growth programs, so as is our model will leverage the success and build and accelerate on the full deployment of this element of our operating system in the years ahead.", "Going forward, we see multiple investment opportunities to deliver long-term growth through innovation and differentiation of the product, software and services we provide. I don't think anyone on this call needs another presentation on the Internet of Things and the possibilities for how that will transform competition and opportunity.", "This macro trend is squarely centered on nearly every growth and productivity strategy in our company, whether it's connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and service, diagnostic and self-healing systems, telematics, consumer marketing and fulfillment and too many other digital concepts to list. We're funding a number of these ideas centrally within the corporate expense line and are likely to accelerate this incubation investment later this year. Incremental 2016 investment for this activity is already embedded in our guidance.", "Finally, building on the culture element of our model, high-quality teams and deep employee engagement are critical to any sustained transformation, and I'm pleased that we continue to excel in these areas.", "One source of great pride within Ingersoll-Rand is our ability to walk the talk on sustainability. To make the point, we continue to see benchmark levels for employee engagement; world-class safety performance for any segment of industry; energy reduction of 5% on an absolute, not volume-adjusted, basis; a 14% reduction in water consumption, also on an absolute basis; and similar reductions of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste.", "So Sue will take you through the quarter in detail. I just felt it was important to align how today's results reinforce the strategy of the company, how we intend to keep delivering great results, and why you should believe we're building a more valuable, sustainable, and less cyclical company for our shareholders.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Sue.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Mike. Let's go to slide four. This is a summary slide that I'd like to begin with and give you some takeaway from today's call. As Mike has discussed, Q2 was another strong operational quarter for us, and it shows through the financial results that we posted. In the second quarter, we drove year-over-year organic revenues higher by 3%, adjusted margins up 80 basis points with a leverage of over 45%, and adjusted earnings per share up 15% against the backdrop of a very slow growth environment and particularly challenged industrial markets.", "Adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.32 by $0.08 at the midpoint and $0.06 at the high end. Our $0.08 beat versus our midpoint was driven by exceptionally strong performance in our Climate segment, partially offset by challenged markets in our Industrial segment and about a $0.06 beat from a lower tax rate in the quarter. And as I'll discuss in detail later, we believe we'll maintain a 200 basis point lower average tax rate than our previous guidance of 24% to 25% for 2016.", "We also posted strong year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million, up $293 million from the prior year. We're seeing the benefits of our focus on working capital management and our business operating system, and with that we're raising our free cash flow forecast to $1 billion to $1.1 billion, excluding the proceeds from the sale of Hussmann.", "Let's turn to segment results. The Climate segment continues to exceed expectations, driven largely by outstanding execution in both Commercial and Residential HVAC with mid-single-digit growth and high-single-digit growth, respectively. Margins also showed healthy expansion, driven by strong volume, productivity improvements, and material deflation of nonferrous commodities. We also continue to invest in the business in order to drive sustainable growth.", "The Industrial segment's end markets are more challenged than previously forecast, and we experienced negative growth in all the major end markets except Small Electric Vehicles, which is our Club Car business, and fluid management, where we continue to see growth.", "Across Industrial, we continue to take measures to drive productivity, shift our mix further towards more profitable aftermarket services and parts markets, and to make prudent cost reductions in the business. We continue to be committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy focused on delivering high returns to shareholders over the long term. Our strong free cash flow generation and cash balances provide us important options as the markets evolve.", "And lastly, we've bumped up the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.05, and our current adjusted continuing operations earnings per share for 2016 is $4 to $4.10. This update reflects expected continued strong growth in our Climate segment and tailwinds resulting from a lower go-forward structural tax rate of 22% to 23%, partially offset by continued weakness in our Industrial end markets, where we're not seeing the signs of recovery we had originally anticipated in our prior guidance.", "Now, if you'd go to slide five, let's begin discussing additional details regarding the second quarter. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment, and we delivered against that objective.", "Enterprise revenues were up 3% organically, with Climate up 5% and Industrial down 3%. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses, led by Commercial and Residential HVAC in North America. Thermo King North America and EMEA truck and trailer revenues continued to be strong in the quarter. Industrial markets declined in the quarter, consistent with the overall market. Club Car performed as expected, with mid-single-digit growth year-over-year.", "Our adjusted operating margins grew 80 basis points year-over-year, with operating leverage exceeding 45%. Our strength in margin expansion was driven through price realization, productivity gains, and direct material deflation. We've inserted a margin table on the slide, and that'll illustrate some of the items I just talked about.", "We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016, for a gain of approximately $398 million.", "Let's go to slide six. Orders for the second quarter of 2016 were up 3% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global Commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits, similar to the first quarter, led by low-teens growth in North America applied and unitary and strong growth of 36% in Latin America, which was against a relatively easy compare in 2015.", "Asia bookings continued to be lumpy from quarter to quarter and were down in Q2 overall, while China was up low single digits. We continued to see excellent growth in service, controls and contracting, with low-teens growth in the quarter.", "Residential bookings were up low teens, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of bookings growth above 10%. Organic Transport orders were down mid-single digits with order growth in overseas markets offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units.", "Consistent with the expectations we set out earlier in the year, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer in the second half of the year, and this is built into our guidance. Transport orders in Asia were up 23% in the second quarter.", "Overall, we anticipated some recovery in the Industrial markets as we moved through Q2 and the balance of the year. But we're seeing continued challenges and market declines. Net orders in the Industrial segment were down 5% organically. We saw a high single-digit order decline in Compression Technologies and Services.", "Services continued to be a bright spot and were up high single digits as we continued to focus on the business with higher-margin product streams. We saw a low-teens decline in other Industrial products and a high single-digit increase in Club Car.", "Now if you'll go to slide seven, please. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 5% in the second quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and low single-digit growth across Europe, Asia and Latin America.", "We saw a decline in the Middle East, consistent with the contraction in the number of building projects planned, primarily in Saudi Arabia, and we would expect this to continue for some time as low oil prices are driving an investment pullback.", "Our Industrial segment performance in the second quarter, which was down 3%, is representative of the ongoing volatility and declining markets that continue across the globe in Industrial markets. Our regional Industrial markets declined except for Europe and Asia, which were up.", "Let's go to slide eight, please. Climate revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter were strong, up 5% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by 20% growth in North America contracting and upper single-digit growth in unitary equipment shipments in North America.", "Europe had equipment growth in the mid-teens and high single-digit growth in services, contracting, and parts. The Middle East revenues declined, largely due to a sharp pullback in Saudi Arabia, as I mentioned earlier.", "Residential revenues were at record levels and up high single digits in the second quarter. Transport organic revenues were up low single digits in the quarter. Truck and trailer organic revenues were up high single digits overall, with improved revenues in North America, Europe, and Asia.", "We also had a high single-digit improvement in aftermarket volumes. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the second quarter, reflecting a soft first half at various box builders for 2016. We also had lower sales of auxiliary power units, reflecting the decline in the Class 8 sleeper market.", "Please go to slide nine. Our Climate operating margins grew 250 basis points year-over-year. Our strength was broad based, based on volume, price, direct material deflation, and productivity gains, and we continue to invest in the business for sustainable growth.", "Please go to slide 10. Second quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $753 million, down 3% on an organic basis. Compression Technologies and services' organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year and Industrial Products were down mid-teens, with growth in fluid management and declines in material handling equipment and tools.", "Small Electric Vehicles, also known as Club Car, organic revenues were up mid-single digits versus prior year from gains in equipment and aftermarket. Regionally, the decline in organic Industrial revenues was led by a mid-single-digit decline in the Americas and the Middle East. Asia and Europe were up modestly, partially offsetting the declines.", "Please go to slide 11. Industrial's operating margin of 9.1% was down 250 basis points compared with last year. Lower volumes were the largest driver, partially offset by pricing, material deflation, and productivity. Despite the downturn, we continued to invest in the business for the long term.", "Additionally, capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development were reclassified to the income statement in Q2, which were a drag on margin of approximately $8 million, or 1.1 percentage points, for the Industrial segment. Excluding this adjustment, Industrial adjusted margins were 10.9% in Q2.", "Moving forward, we expect Industrial segment performance to trend with the market. We are planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through aftermarket growth, productivity gains, and cost controls.", "Please go to slide 12. Our June year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million was favorable to prior year by $293 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. Because of our strong start to the year we have raised our free cash flow forecast range to $1 billion to $1.1 billion from our previous range of $950 million to $1 billion.", "For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.6%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our days sales outstanding improving 0.6 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventory is on plan for the quarter and we are well-positioned to serve our customers.", "Please go to slide 13. Our cash performance in the second quarter and our expectations for the year enable us to, one, continue to invest in the strategic growth programs that Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovation and differentiated product in such areas as connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems, just to name a few.", "Two, we will also maintain a strong balance sheet with a BBB credit metrics. And three, we will also maintain \u2013 we will also retain optionality relative to paying a competitive dividend, acquisitions to build the business and share repurchases.", "Please go to slide 14. As always, our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We have broken it down by major end markets and geographies.", "As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. North America Commercial HVAC and Residential HVAC as well as European Transport and Commercial HVAC markets are generally positive while global Industrial markets are declining. We are forecasting Transport markets in North America to be down low single digits.", "Our forecast for North America trailer volume has not changed and we expect the market to be down slightly for the year. This implies a decline in the second half after single-digit growth in the first half of the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down and Industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure.", "Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. All of our revenue growth forecasts are shown on an organic basis. We are forecasting mid-single-digit growth in Commercial HVAC in total; high single-digit growth in Residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-North America business for us; and a flat to small decline in Transport globally.", "We expect Compression-related products and other Industrial equipment to be down high single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low single digits.", "Please go to slide 15. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up 2% to 3% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about 1 percentage point. We expect Climate revenues to be up 4% to 5% organically. For Industrial, we expect organic revenues to be down 4% to 5%.", "For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get to adjusted margins. We expect adjusted operating margins in Climate to be between 14% and 14.5%. We expect adjusted Industrial margins to be between 10% and 11%, and for the enterprise we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.5% to 12%.", "Please go to slide 16. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.47 to $5.57 and the adjusted range is $4 to $4.10, versus our prior guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain.", "Our full-year guidance reflects a tax rate forecast of 22% to 23% and an average diluted share count of approximately 261 million shares. The tax rate reflects a 200 basis point improvement versus prior guidance of 24% to 25%.", "For the third quarter of 2016, revenues are forecasted to be up by approximately 3% organically. We are projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q3 and Industrial to decline low single digits. Adjusted third quarter earnings per share are forecasted to be between $1.25 and $1.30, excluding restructuring charges of about a penny.", "For the full year of 2016, we also raised our free cash flow expectations and now expect free cash flow to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, excluding restructuring charges and proceeds from the sale of Hussmann.", "And with that, I am going to turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, great. Thank you, Sue, and let's go to slide 17. So to conclude, we had an excellent quarter grounded in solid execution. I am proud of the many people within Ingersoll-Rand that continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders.", "I am pleased with the progress and the momentum and the implementation of our operating system and the growing depth and bench strength throughout the company that makes the operating system come to life through continuous improvement.", "We're building a stronger, more valuable, more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll-Rand than ever before and it's exciting to me and leaders throughout the company to be part of that transformation and to help create a bright future with more individual development possibilities for all our people throughout the world.", "The results we reported this morning are a direct result of the strategic work, the persistence, the tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we're building. It is a strategic advantage and it is the toughest thing in any business for a competitor to copy.", "There are a few takeaways I want to point out to you as we head to the back half of the year and into 2017. First, the Industrial businesses are running effectively in a very tough market environment.", "The management team is aggressively taking and will continue to take the right actions to reduce the overall cost structure of the business and is committed to protecting the key product and service investments that will build long-term growth and margin expansion when the markets improve.", "Second, the Transport market is performing as we expected. As we said at the beginning of the year, we expected the first-half results to be up and the back half of the year would be down.", "The management team has done an effective job anticipating and seeing around the corners and is proactively taking the actions to ensure strong margin performance continues.", "Third, commodity deflation has been a tailwind during the first half of the year and it's going to moderate to neutral in the back half of the year. We have a long track record of managing the price-to-material input equation very effectively and we're going to continue to do so going forward.", "And finally, let me say we are proactively reviewing both prior restructuring considerations as well as new actions as our business, markets and even the input variables into our own models continue to evolve.", "Although we don't have any immediate additional restructuring actions to take or announce today, we won't hesitate to take additional prudent restructuring actions going forward.", "So with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks, good morning. Before I ask my question, I just wanted to clarify. Sue, did you mention the tax rate of 22%, 23% is now a structural tax rate going forward?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes, it's 22% to 23% and that's the ongoing rate.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. That's very clear. Mike, obviously very strong booking orders, bookings for North American Commercial HVAC in North America low teens. You mentioned a 25% number on the last call. I am not sure whether you're comparing apples to apples here, but maybe just clarify that 25% is the low teens that you actually booked and maybe if you could just dig into the health of the light commercial versus applied unitary markets.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Nigel, thanks for the question. Actually, I would expect two quarters of similar growth, two quarters of teens versus one 20-plus% quarter, so I think that's intact. The pipeline, frankly, has never been healthier than it is right now, and it is healthy through all the institutional large project work.", "Commercial is maintaining some resiliency that we are seeing here, and unitary, at the light levels, still strong for us. So Residential all the way up through light commercial still remains very strong for us across the board.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, great, so no signs of weakness there. And then just on the Climate margin outlook, you have done 13.8% in the first half of the year. The low end or the mid to lower end of your margin guidance at Climate would suggest basically flat margins in the second half of the year, which seems pretty bearish. Maybe just contextualize why you see an outlook for maybe 14% at the low end.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So, Nigel, let me start out and Mike can add his comments as we go forward. So as I think about a Climate in the back half of the year, you're going to have a couple of different dynamics, the first of which, as we talked about, was that direct material was going to moderate in terms of its deflationary environment. So let me talk about that for just a second.", "What we expect to see in the back half of the year is we expect to see that steel, particularly in the fourth quarter, is going to turn more inflationary then deflationary. So that's part of what's happening with the flatter margins.", "We're also going to continue to invest in the overall business in the back half of the year. Again, we have got some significant product launches and we see this as an area that really sets us up for success. So it is really price, a little bit of mix that comes from us lapping the 14 SEER in Residential, and then investment in the business.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And, Nigel, I'd just say to me the biggest number on the page is we're putting half a point \u2013 50 basis points of margin back into investment, and it's a formula that's worked for us, it sets us up well for 2017, and we like what we're getting out of those investments.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Thank you. Just on the Industrial margin guide for the second half, so it looks like you're looking at a margin of maybe 11%, 11.5% in the second half. The clean margin was 10.9% in Q2. So I thought maybe there'd be a bit more coming through to support margins from productivity or cost reduction. So I just wondered why maybe there wasn't a bit more urgency around getting the cost out. It looks as if the sort of margin decline is going to be similar second half as first half.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I'm sorry \u2013 Julian, starting I would say that again for me the most important thing that's happening there is they're really, say, 40% through an investment cycle there that there's just no reason to stop and go on that. And so that continues for the balance of the year for us, and that's something that I think is vitally important.", "There's a tremendous effort underway at reducing costs in that business, much of what's not just visible through what you'd say would be qualified restructuring. Much of that is just reduction in place and just other containment actions being taken in the business. So that really, when I say the business is being run effectively, I have no doubt that all the rocks are being turned over, with the exception of protecting this critical investment pool that is important to us going forward.", "And I use that one example for you because it happens to be the example of the product growth team is the one product area that we have launched in that portfolio and we're getting tremendous results with that. So, again, this gives us some confidence that although it's not a great story for the third and the fourth quarter, we're not running the company for the third and the fourth quarter. We're running the company for the long run, and we hope investors see that.", "And that's part of the reason I think taking good success around the Climate business, keeping utilization up through the combined factory structures that we've got, leveraging the network's excellence across the Compression-related businesses that we have, give us the opportunity to stay the course on these investments, and that's really important.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Very clear. And then my follow-up would just be you touched on the input cost impact in Q4. I think the last numbers I have on the sort of COGS (37:02) are from 2010 or 2011, the last time materials were an interesting issue. Is there any update you could give on the breakdown of COGS in terms of sort of raw materials versus processed materials and components and so forth?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure. So if you think about \u2013 and what I'll do is I'll give it to you in terms of dollars. So if you think about direct material spend for the company, Julian, it's about, say, $6 billion a year in direct material spend. If you then break that down into the commodities that we're talking about, it's roughly about 10% to 12% of that. And as you think about then breaking that down even further, steel is going to be the largest component, with copper and aluminum following that. And so the price pressure that we're thinking about in the back half is on steel, because copper and aluminum are pretty much staying the course with what we've seen.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hey, Mike, just thinking kind of bigger picture here strategically, you guys are actually doing a really solid job operationally, and I can't help but look at Lennox at 22 times earnings and Atlas Copco at 22 times earnings and just wonder if you're actually reevaluating the portfolio. I know you went through the exercise with Allegion and the businesses that you retain are air-oriented businesses, but do you have any thought or response to that question or that idea?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Jeff, it's a great question, and thanks for the opportunity to step back and look at it, because I look back over the seven years that I've been in this role and I remember when Industrial was the sweetheart of the portfolio, right, from 2009 to 2011, even through 2013, and we were expanding margins so fast that it afforded us the opportunity to do all the great investment we made in the Trane res and commercial businesses, which is really why you're seeing the numbers that you're seeing today in that business.", "And so now it's flipped. You remember that was all happening with no real commercial \u2013 certainly no institutional support coming from construction markets. And now that's flipped and it's allowed us the opportunity to keep factories fairly loaded. It's given us the opportunity to keep technical professionals highly engaged in development of product, and all that really just sets up where at some point when the commercial market in HVAC slows down, when institutional eventually fades, our hope is that we've got a strong, refreshed, energy-efficient, reliable portfolio sitting particularly in Compression Technologies. And we're going to leverage that, just like we did from 2009 to 2011 when it grew 7 full points. We are very leveraged here toward some of those fixed costs. Where we play in the market is in the big machine. It's not the Cameron \u2013 and when I talk Cameron I'm talking about Cameron plus all the 250 to 400 horse centrifugal air compressors, of which we're the leader now in that area. And we don't really participate much in the vacuum and blower business, which had some growth in it.", "So we have a product portfolio and a position in the market in these larger machines. That's what's getting hurt right now, and we're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here on that, for sure. That's why in addition to \u2013 I had mentioned the product development, but the machining investments, I mentioned last call and this call, those are going to continue. And we will put $50 million into machining in this downturn, so that when we emerge out of this thing we're going to be more productive. The hope is that it's not just 7 points of margin. It's more than 7 points of margin coming back.", "So Jeff, I think I really have got my head around the value of what we have created around integrating the portfolio, and over the long run not really so interested in a flash in the pan around some multiple for short cycle. I'm really interested in building the value of the company over the long run. And again, step back to 2009, Jeff. If you invested back in 2009, you are a very happy investor and I thank you for all the Christmas cards we get to that effect. But it's because we've had the portfolio that we've had.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yes, I had a heroic buyback in 2009. Thanks for that perspective. Also, then, just on the balance sheet, Mike...", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Jeff, just before you do that, incremental margins every single year have been in the top quartile. Organic growth rates almost every single year have been in the top quartile. We've done that with elements of the portfolio firing and not firing at various points in time, and I just have to believe that there is value in that and there is industrial logic around what we are doing around the sustainability and energy efficiency fronts of the business. So go ahead.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "I agree. Your performance has been great. You are not getting fully paid for it. The balance sheet, what is the plan for the year-end? Sue gave us the kind of a generalized color, but with the Hussmann proceeds and the strong cash flow, would you be opportunistically looking to step in share repurchase this year? I can't imagine the M&A pipeline is that active, but perhaps it is.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So Jeff, let me take a shot at that, and then I'm going to let Mike jump in. But I am going to kind of use some of the same passion that Mike had in his comments on the multiples and what we have built at Ingersoll-Rand. From a perspective of our cash generation and then our ensuing capital allocation, we're really trying to create longer-term shareholder value with the cash that we are generating. And so what we have seen that has been really successful for us is investing in our products and investing in areas like energy efficiency and sustainability. Those are proven for us in terms of building our growth excellence.", "If we look at operational excellence, all of the work that we've done and invested in the company, whether it is in our factories or in our overall processes with the business operating system, all of that has shown to be something that has worked very well for us. So our preference, as we think about capital allocation and your question, is to really invest and grow the company.", "So to be more specific than in terms of what that means, it means I want to continue to invest. It means I want to continue to do all of those things. It means we want to look at the M&A pipeline. But what we have is an opportunity where we can be patient, we can wait for the right opportunity and not just take the cash that we are generating and run out and buy something.", "So we're really, really thinking about investment. We are thinking about M&A. Dividends are extremely important to us. We understand that and we're going to continue to have dividends that are in line with our peer payout ratios, and we will also be opportunistic about share repurchase. I don't want to take that completely off the table, but if I set our preference up, it is going to be to build longer-term value through investments in the business and acquisitions.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I agree, Jeff, with Sue's comments completely, obviously. But I would tell you that the competitive dividend's a given and the fact that we are controlling dilution in the share count is a given. We don't want to dilute shareholders through that, so that's a given. The optionality beyond that, we want to be really smart allocators of capital and we want to have our eyes wide open on how we do that. When you get big dislocations in the share price, we want to be opportunistic and we were in the first quarter between $48 and $51 a share. Clearly, that was a good idea. And we have been opportunistic when we saw value in long-term creation through acquisitions. And so we will continue to do that. Now all that being said, I think we have less than $1 billion in cash, so that's not a whole lot of cash we are talking about for a company our size to be walking around with.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And welcome, Zac.", "Zac Nagle - Vice President-Investor Relations, Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Thank you.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So my first question, maybe following up on Jeff's point there on maybe just the investment that you're making in Industrial, Mike. I am just wondering how much of it is playing catch-up versus really investing for future growth? And then, how do you balance that with the idea that we're kind of seven years to eight years into this economic recovery and could be in this kind of lower-growth environment for some time?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Joe, actually the efficiencies of the product launch, the 40% of the portfolio I told you about, are in the range of 9% to 13% more efficient than anything out in the marketplace. That's how we're going to market, around value, around total cost of ownership, and that's why that business is up in the high teens and bookings are closer to 30%.", "We know there is no purpose in us playing catch-up to a me-too. So every single thing we have done has been to leapfrog the efficiency and reliability of what's out there. And if you just look to the Trane portfolio, you would see that. In every launch we've made, not only is it more efficient than anything in the marketplace, but it is using refrigerants that go way past the HFC phase-out. So we're not meeting anybody kind of where they are; we are leapfrogging. And this whole strategic analytics piece of our business operating system of really figuring out kind of where to go attack, specifically. And then having those strategic growth programs outlined with the resources, the talent, the investments outlined and making sure that no matter what we do, we are committing to that, is why you get 80% plus of the growth happening through the areas we are focusing on. And that doesn't come from me-too catch-up.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. That makes sense. How do the investments then, maybe thinking about it through the lens of Industrial, perhaps you can provide just some color there?", "Unknown Speaker", "Well, I'm not sure, what the investments are specifically in Industrial, Joe?", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "No, just I guess just specifically around the investments that you're making in Industrial. You've been in like this really just this weaker-growth environment, probably expected to persist for quite some time. I'm just trying to get a sense for whether there is some catch-up to do on the Industrial side, whether your portfolio is better positioned than your peers. Just any color \u2013 any colors on the competitive dynamics in the investments that you're making.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean, the investments we're making are obviously in the areas that we're not leading, so any place we're not leading is a right spot for it. So if we're leading in 250 horse to 400 horse in the world, we'll keep that competitive and we'll make sure that we're not losing that position, but we're tacking in the other areas that we think are going to grow. That's sort of the general view. And you can understand why I'm not going to be more specific than that, because we would rather book it and have margin improvement versus just talking about it and really signaling where we're going competitively around this stuff. That's not been our style at all.", "But I'll tell you that it starts with the strategic analytics being right and the investments being very specific, and the product growth teams \u2013 so engineering, operations, and product management agreeing and working toward the one or two most critically important things to grow share and margin in a very specific product line or service line has been the formula for us that has been successful. We're going to continue to do that.", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And so the other thing that I would add, Mike, just as a practical matter, Joe, for what you're talking about is the investments that are ongoing in Industrial are going to be in the same general areas, as you would expect. They're going to be in new products. They're going to be in operational excellence, so improving our operating results, and they also include some channel investments, particularly in the Compression Technologies business. So all the areas you might expect.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got you. That makes sense. And just one real quick one for you, Sue, on just the price cost breakdown this quarter. How much did material deflation versus price contribute?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So it was \u2013 so let me take you back to Q1 where it was about 50-50, price and direct material deflation. In the second quarter, it was a little more direct material deflation, but really kind of a 60-40 kind of look with deflation and price, and we were price positive in both segments.", "And so if you remember when we gave guidance and talked about the second quarter, we had originally called that at 110 basis points and it came in at 120 basis points. So again, it performed exactly as we expected it to in the quarter, and I'll repeat the Q1 comment of we didn't have breakage, so it was a good result.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Joe, I actually want to take you back to the Industrial question just for a second. I just had one more comment here. I made a comment about the strength of the management team, which ultimately I think is what really investors need to believe in and buy. And I look at our Industrial Segment management team, and I can tell you that the top five to 10 executives running that part of the business co-architected the entire business operating system with me since it began. I couldn't have higher confidence in our ability to win as the markets recover. So I want to make sure that that point is really clear. It is a very strong management team paying attention to the details in that business.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's helpful. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thanks and good morning, all.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey, Steve.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey. It looks like you are certainly taking profitable share gain on the Climate side, but what's going on in VRF there? And then on the Industrial side, Atlas Copco Compressor Technique orders were up 1% in the quarter. I know they have got a different mix. I know they have got vacuum and also a slightly smaller North American presence. Maybe would that explain at all or is there something else going on as well that we should be aware of?", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Yeah, look, in no particular order, Steve, if you look at Atlas Copco's business, they are going to be strong in oil-free rotary and certainly in a smaller range than our large centrifugal machines. We have got great oil-free product and are growing that business, too, but obviously that's the bulk of what you see with Atlas Copco's business. Vacuum and blowers you called out, and that's actually still been a market growing.", "When you think about oil free or vacuums and blowers, you have to think about the industries that they go into, and those industries happen to be growing as well, as opposed to some of the heavier industries that would use some of the larger centrifugal machines, for the most part.", "So we do a very thorough compare with all public information that we can pick up from all of our various competitors, not just a single competitor, have a good understanding of sort of how that mix looks and then we're realists about where the opportunity is for us to self-help where we can. Right now, the self-help comes into growing the service businesses and they're doing a great job with that. It also comes into refreshing and developing the portfolio in sort of the smaller-range machines. And that's where we're going to play going forward.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, and on the VRF side?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "VRF, we're \u2013 very well. It is growing faster than the underlying unitary business. We continue to have a very high share; no slowdown there from us at all.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, and then just following up on your earlier comments around the balance sheet and whatnot, but I guess, Mike, in the past you have talked about there being kind of opportunity for consolidation within the overall HVAC market. Do you still \u2013 how are you thinking about that, given the dynamics of the industry going forward? Do you think there is still room in that?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I do. I think they are big moves and I think that you look at what we did with acquiring Cameron's compressor business, and we had synergies in the first year of 15% and we will drive it higher this year. So, look, I think great synergies exist and I think that these opportunities are happening, but I think they are bigger, more complex deals.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, all right, great. Thanks.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys, good morning.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Steve.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So what exactly is going on here in Industrial? This just seems like relative to where you were it was viewed as kind of a high-quality business with pretty solid margins, and it just seems like every single quarter we are just getting deeper and deeper into a hole here. I guess you mentioned the end markets. How much \u2013 just remind us, including Cameron, how much is oil and gas? And then, how much would be in and around oil and gas? And maybe we're just kind of mislabeling some of the end markets, perhaps, and you guys, like everybody else, do have more exposure there than we would have thought initially.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Steve, so I'll save the oil and gas math for somebody at the end here, but if you look at the biggest market we're in on big machines, and I use 250 to 400 horsepower as being a big machine, down 20%. Actually as you go up between 250 and 400 and past 400, those growth rates start to look like minus 50%, okay, from where they were. These are the most capital-intensive sort of factories we have, and that certainly when we have those kinds of volume drops really adversely affects our mix.", "So you look at volume alone contributing 3 points of negativity on the bridge, you can see what volume does. And as a proof point, again, go back and look at 2009 through 2011, look what happened when volume came in after we had been effectively restructuring the footprint there, and that's where that 7 points came from. So we're heavily leveraged toward that any way you slice it, and that's the main reason for it. Now on the oil and gas side?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, so oil and gas is really going to be sort of a low single-digit percentage, Steve. I mean that's part of the issue because you don't have large projects, but it's really the derivative, so all the other projects just aren't happening, and so it sort of gets labeled with oil and gas.", "So let me step back and also add to what Mike was talking about. When I started talking about Industrial early in 2016 and I was sort of breaking it down into pieces for you, what I said was that Club Car was about 20% of the business and it was going to be up sort of low to mid-single digits, that the aftermarket was about 30% of the Industrial segment and that it was going to be up low single digits. Then I talked about the big machines being down in excess of 20% and some of the small rotary and small air being up slightly for the year, and then some of the other businesses, like the material handling business and the tools businesses, being down sort of mid-single digits for the year.", "If I take that and transform that now into what we're seeing in 2016 after two quarters, Club Car, the same spot. They're growing in the mid-single-digits range and that's on track. The aftermarket piece of Industrial is continuing to grow. So you have got sort of solid footing with about 50% of the business.", "However, when you get over into the other side where I talked about large machines being down 20%, as Mike said, they're now down 50%, so they are down way larger than what we thought. And even some of the smaller equipment is really much more pressured than I thought it was going to be, and instead of being up sort of low single digits it's going to be down. So you really just have a lot of dynamics that are going on there with the Industrial business, and to bring it back and wrap it around your question about oil and gas and projects, again, it's really the derivative effect for us in most of our Industrial businesses, where the large projects just aren't happening and the ones that are happening are much more competitive.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, it's a bit of a Yogi Berra euphemism, but the business will turn when our customers start spending money on these larger plants, and so that needs to happen.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah, I just don't know of anything like in my sector. I'm not blaming you guys at all. It is what it is. But just outside of \u2013 if you said, hey, it's down 50%, we can look at oil and gas CapEx and that's like, oh, that's obvious. I mean in fact in the market right now everybody's getting credit for a 50% increase in oil and gas-related spending next year, in some instances. So I don't know what in the economy, other than oil and gas, is seeing 50% year-on-year declines. Even things like big gas turbines out there, big-ticket items are certainly not seeing 50% \u2013 maybe 20% declines, not 50% declines. So I just \u2013 that's kind of the source of my question, you know what I mean?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "There's a spot between sort of small plants and energy production that is a large plant. Steel would be a great example of that, marine, these are heavy industries that use large machines for air and that's really kind of where we're suffering on that.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "That makes a ton of sense, then. If it's that derivative type of stuff, that makes a ton of sense. One last question, Middle East you said was down. How much was the Middle East down in Commercial HVAC in the quarter?", "Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "EMEA was down about 14%.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And, Steve, I'm going to add one point. Material handling, if you go back and bridge over a multiyear period, it was 2, 2.5 points of op margin that went away as that business went down 90% or so for us, okay. So you don't want to look at Industrial and kind of hang it all back on a comparison to Atlas Copco on compressors. You want to make sure you understand there's a couple of points of margin there, about a point in tools. Currency is a hit, and then you got the volume impact that we talked about on the bridge.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Good afternoon. I guess I won't belabor the Industrial business. On Transportation, could you just talk as to what you saw in the quarter that your view has changed? Because before you were sort of saying how the North American truck cycle was decoupled from the reefer market, and it seems like you've changed your view.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Andrew, there's subtleties moving inside that, but the view has always been you're going to see a pullback in North American trailer, as much as 15% in flat TK, and the mix is changing slightly within that, but that's really what's happening for the full year.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And can we talk about cadence of Transportation weakening into the second half, third quarter versus fourth quarter decline, and any preliminary thoughts on 2017?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Q3 will look weak, because the compare was so strong last year that it sits the highest of high compares for us there, and then moderates a little bit in terms of the comparisons for the fourth quarter. But again, you take the first half of the year and balance it out to flat with no change and marine container being weak and really all the change coming with North American truck and trailer and a little bit coming, obviously, from APUs with just Class 8 sleeper production being down.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right. Thank you.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And as we have reached the time allotted for our call, our final question will come from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "So, Mike, just you changed your guidance in Climate from 4% to 6% to 4% to 5%, but just following up on Andrew's question, is the difference really APUs or is it marine or is it Middle East, or is it a combination of the three?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Middle East is much weaker than we anticipated at the beginning of the year, and as you can imagine, it is a large HVAC business, and so the drag on the Middle East is fairly material. We're seeing some growth in China. That growth was really around shipping product that was booked, but we really haven't seen the pickup in China, per se.", "If you look at China non-residential construction, it's still negative, but for the past six months or seven months it has been trending up. I think it has gone from negative 17% up to negative 2%, but it hasn't crossed over. We really would have thought at this point we would have seen more a pickup.", "The nice thing in China, buildings are built in about half the speed that we see in other parts of the world and our cycle times for delivery can be half of what they are in other parts of the world as well. So if we did see a China recovery on the HVAC side, you need to see that, say, within a six-month period, not a 12-month period, but as you get into July and you're not really seeing the bookings here, it's just a way of really de-risking the forecast.", "And really, that de-risking is the theme coming into the Industrial portfolio, too. At this point, if we haven't seen bookings on large machines or bookings on midsized, even rotary, machines to this point in time, the reality is you just call it lower and it's what we've done. And so we hope we've got to the bottom of this thing.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Mike, that's helpful. And if you look at European transport and refrigeration in general, and FRIGOBLOCK in particular, it seems like it has hung in there quite well. I'm sure \u2013 have you seen any changes post the Brexit announcement? What's the outlook for that particular business?", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We haven't had a lot of change relative to Brexit. I think, like a lot of companies, there is a lot of discussion going on, but not a lot of change, and our business really \u2013 U.K. business is not that big in general. It's more the knockdown effect about what might happen in the region with GDP being shaved in general. But the business has continued to develop well. It's holding in there and we don't see things turning there as a result of Brexit or other market factors here at least over the next couple of quarters.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you, guys.", "Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A portion of the call. I would like to turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for any closing remarks.", "Zac Nagle - Vice President-Investor Relations, Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call.

Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Thanks, Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'm going to begin by discussing our strategy and how as a foundation our business operating system drives top-tier financial performance for shareholders.", "Sue will provide more details about the quarter financials and guidance, then I'll close with a few comments before we answer your questions. As a matter of strategy more than 90% of our product portfolio directly addresses demands for greater productivity and energy efficiency with lower greenhouse gas emissions in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world. The strength and resiliency of our portfolio comes from our leadership in growing markets that are durable, because these markets are essential to addressing the global, strategic imperative to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to conserve resources.", "Our business operating system is a systematic way our people work within the company to deliver against our strategy globally. It is a holistic approach that establishes strong baseline execution expectations, then builds on those expectations through continuous development of people and improvement of processes and standards. Respecting and engaging our people in the development and maturation of a business operating system, makes it sustainable and is a core element of what it takes to win over the long-term.", "Rigorous execution of the business operating system has enabled us to deliver consistent top tier financial performance across key metrics, including organic growth, incremental margins, EPS growth and cash flow conversion over many years.", "The third quarter demonstrated our consistent progress against these key metrics. We delivered strong organic growth of 3% across a diversified portfolio. We had record operating margins of 14.1% and drove leverage through the P&L, resulting in adjusted EPS growth of 17%", "Year-to-date, free cash flow is more than 100% of adjusted net income, demonstrating our ability to convert earnings into real cash, a fundamental driver of valuation. Record margins in the quarter were primarily driven by continued strength in our Climate business, where adjusted operating margins expanded 90 basis points to 16.7% with particular strength in our commercial and residential HVAC businesses.", "We are also pleased to report that our Industrial business turned in a positive direction in quarter three, moving adjusted operating margins higher by 180 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Adjusting for the capitalized cost that we discussed last quarter of 1.1 percentage points, the business improved 70 basis points sequentially from 10.9% to 11.6%. The actions we've been taking to improve the business are taking hold and we believe we saw margins bottom in the second quarter.", "Improved profitability was driven by operational excellence and our continued focus on delivering innovation centered on energy efficiency, sustainability, system reliability, as well as disruptive game changing technological advancements in areas like controls and digital connectivity.", "In quarter three, our overall growth was led by our commercial and residential HVAC businesses in North America where we continue to see strong double-digit growth and market share gains. Our performance in 2016 is a direct result of a continuous long-term investment program prioritized around a clear set of opportunities and managed from inception to launch by focused and committed product growth teams.", "The net result is that our product growth teams' average to growth rate about four times higher than our overall average growth rate in quarter three. Continuously delivering innovation through our product growth teams is one way we produce strong financial results and stay ahead competitively.", "Another key driver is our commitment to being the leader in energy efficient and sustainable products. About 10 days ago, the 28th meeting of the parties to the Montreal Protocol was held. At that meeting about 200 countries agreed to an amendment that phases out hydrofluorocarbons beginning in 2019 and aims for an 80% reduction in their use by 2045. For several years now, we have been planning for the phase-out of hydrofluorocarbons and over that time we have been a leader in developing several commercialized next-generation lower global warming potential products that meet and exceed the transition requirements to help customers achieve their sustainability goals.", "Two years ago, we made a public climate commitment to a 50% reduction of refrigerant greenhouse gases in the footprint of our products by 2020 and a transition out of current refrigerants before 2030. We did this to help customers plan for the transition period based upon their business needs and system requirements.", "We are on track to complete our commitment goals and to-date have avoided approximately 2 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent globally. Another example is our EcoWise product portfolio, typically when an eco-friendly refrigerant is used in a system, it reduces efficiency and can sometimes compromise safety. For example the gas might be flammable or more toxic.", "With the introduction of our EcoWise product portfolio, we've not only developed a low global warming potential refrigerant product. We've also designed it so the product or system is more energy efficient. A prime example of this is our new line of Centrifugal chillers that have near zero global warming potential, do not concede safety and deliver 13.5% better efficiency than chillers using hydrofluorocarbons. So, now our customer is not choosing between being green or being efficient. Through EcoWise, they are able to do both.", "Growth with these products has been excellent. In Europe, for example the EcoWise portfolio growth has nearly doubled over the last year and we see a healthy pipeline, with high profile jobs coming in like the Chunnel Tunnel between France and the UK. After considering retrofit of their equipment, our expert technical team worked with Chunnel operators to install units from our EcoWise portfolio this year. With near zero global warming potential, the units will allow a savings of around 40% of the electrical energy used in the Chunnel's cooling system. And to give you some perspective, the energy savings for this project is about as much energy as the island of Aruba generates annually. It is a savings of 53% compared to the customers' former units that we replaced from one of our competitors.", "Vertical integration is another way that we drive growth and leverage technical know-how across our Climate and Industrial segments. Our vertical integration in compressor technology is one area of real competitive advantage because we engineer and manufacture our screw, centrifugal and the majority of our scroll compressors. We own the intellectual property and accelerated our time to market with these products.", "Through our energy efficiency strategy, the next-generation R-series air compressor that we introduced in quarter three incorporates the latest advancements in variable speed drive technology to increase airflow output up to 15%, reduce energy cost up to 35%, with an increase in system reliability. Customers are finding the product offering compelling, and we are outpacing the market growth rate as a result.", "These are just a few examples of how we're making investments in long-term innovation, energy efficiency and productivity to stay ahead of the competition and in front of an increasing regulatory environment. We are also tying in services, controls and wireless to our products, so they are leading-edge as technology continues to move quickly. We continue to see double-digit increases in our commercial HVAC controls business and high-single-digit growth in services. In Compression Technologies, we also realized mid single-digit growth in our aftermarket business. Our multiyear trend in aftermarket growth is consistent with our strategy to drive service penetration across our segments and create a more resilient portfolio.", "Turning to cash and capital allocation, Q3 was another quarter of steady and strong cash flow. Year-to-date free cash flow was nearly $1 billion. Over the past five years, our cash flow ROIC has averaged 18% per annum. A top priority is to increase shareholder returns through high ROIC investments in our business that build a platform for consistent cash generation and investment in growth and innovation.", "Our long-standing commitment to organic long-term strategic investments is what has enabled us to perform well in both up and down climate or industrial cycles over the years. As an example, in 2016, we've invested heavily in channel investments that will improve growth by penetrating key markets over the next several years.", "In addition to fully investing in the business, we spent $250 million in 2016 on share buybacks. We've raised our dividend twice, 10% in February, an additional 25% in October, and we continue to have an increasing pipeline of interesting M&A opportunities. Our consistency in performance and a resultant strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet puts us in an excellent position to maintain significant optionality to move quickly across any or all capital allocation fronts as opportunities arise in this is uncertain and often volatile global economy.", "Before I hand things over to Sue, I want to hit on three key areas that we know are important for you to understand based on our conversations with many investors. Turning to slide four, I'm pleased with the progress of our Industrial segment in the third quarter, and we believe we remain on track to achieve our guidance for 2016 margins of 10% to 11%. The continuing actions we have taken and are taking to deliver improvement are taking hold. We continue to focus on operational excellence initiatives, restructuring and reducing cost, increase focus on parts and service, and here we are already seeing growth in the service business, but we believe we can step on the gas even further in this area.", "Segmentation and focus on growing markets like food and beverage, pharma and electronics, and continuing multi-year product, channel and machining investments to achieve strong leverage when the markets recover. It's important to note based on the actions we have taken and what we are seeing in the business that we believe Q2 marked a trough in operating margins for the business and we're expecting improved performance going forward in 2017, although the results may not be a straight line up quarter-to-quarter.", "If you turn to slide 5, the main takeaway here is that the Thermo King business is resilient. We saw this in the third quarter, when revenues were down but margins moved higher. For 2016, we continue to see the business being consistent with the expectations we set out in July. The team deserves a lot of execution credit there for improving margins on declining revenue, and for building a more resilient and valuable franchise over time. (13:22) is a great example, the transport business grew margins on a 12% lower revenue base. We do expect about a 20% decline in trailers next year but we believe we should be able to mitigate some of the downside by growing the business in other regions and in other TK products.", "Moving to slide 6. Another topic on the minds of investors is how the Dodge data for nonresidential put in place translates to Ingersoll-Rand. Here I think it's important to lay out where our business comes from, and what drives the market. I think the market overestimates our exposure.", "As the chart shows, the North American Commercial HVAC segment is about $4 billion and is split about 50-50 between services and equipment. Of the equipment, about 65% is replacement business, so not new put in place.", "The result is that our Dodge put-in-place data just covers about 18% of our business. Additionally, when you drill down further into the 18%, about 50% is commercial and 50% is institutional. Institutional is expected to show good growth in 2016, and even better growth in 2017.", "Our data says North American Commercial HVAC will be mid-single digits in 2016, and a similar number in 2017. So, we continue to see a healthy market going into next year.", "And with that, I'll turn the things over to Sue.", "Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Thank you, Mike. Let's go to slide 7. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points for you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we continued to execute the core tenants for our business operating system in Q3, building upon our strong 2016 performance, across the three pillars of growth, profitability and cash flow.", "Adjusted earnings per share was up 17% on 3% organic revenue growth. Cash flow was 180% of net income for the quarter. Our performance was highlighted by record results in our North America Commercial and Residential HVAC businesses, where we captured additional market share, while at the same time expanding margins year-over-year.", "In our Industrial business, we drove 180 basis points of improved operating margin performance sequentially. We continued to take further actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased our commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service and added cost reduction activities to improve operating results going forward.", "The margin improvement was 70 basis points after adjusting Q2 margins for capitalized new product engineering and development cost that we highlighted in last quarter's earnings materials. We believe we are largely maintaining our growing market share across the portfolio, despite continued soft industrial end markets.", "During the quarter, we also extended our strong free cash flow performance by $644 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $992 million, up $527 million from the prior year. Given our long-term expectations for strong earnings and cash conversion, we also increased our dividend by 25% in October to $0.40 per share or $1.60 annualized, making our dividend highly competitive not only in our peer group, but across the broader market.", "Additionally, we now believe our free cash flow for 2016 will approximate $1.3 billion, up more than $200 million from our previous guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We've also increased our earnings per share guidance for the year given our year-to-date performance and outlook. Our revised guidance of between $4.17 and $4.22 is higher by $0.14 at the midpoint, reflecting the flow-through of our Q3 over performance versus our Q3 guidance midpoint, and an $0.88 to $0.93 fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of $0.90 to $0.91 at the midpoint is consistent with our prior guidance.", "On the next several slides, I will highlight the key messages for this earnings call. Please go to slide eight. Our strong enterprise performance on organic growth, earnings per share growth and cash flow conversion was highlighted by our North America HVAC businesses and by sequential operating margin improvement in our Industrial segment versus the prior quarter.", "Organic revenue was up 3% as adjusted margins improved 30 basis points year-on-year with 30% operating leverage. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low growth environment and we delivered against that objective.", "Please go to slide nine. Organic orders continue to be solid through the third quarter of 2016 led by our Climate business and partially offset by soft industrial markets. Climate orders were up 4% organically, Organic Global Commercial HVAC bookings were up mid single-digits led by low-teens growth in North America unitary. We also continue to drive excellent growth in service, controls and contracting with low-teens growth in the quarter.", "Residential bookings were solid, up mid single-digit. Organic transport orders were down low single-digits with order growth in Europe and Asia, offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with our guidance, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer. On balance the Industrial businesses were flat to down modestly and we are calling a broad-based recovery in the near-term.", "Please go to slide 10. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by regions. In our Climate segment, we saw solid performance in both North America and Latin America and low single-digit growth in the Middle East. In our Industrial segment overall performance was essentially flat with high single-digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa due to the shipment of large orders in the Middle East and mid single-digit growth in Asia, offset by declines in North America and Latin America.", "Please go to slide 11. Climate performance was strong in the quarter, with organic revenues up 3% and adjusted operating margins up 90 basis points. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid single-digits, highlighted by exceptional growth in North America contracting up 17%. And unitary equipment in North America up low-teens.", "In Europe, business was unusually light, impacted by the slowdown in activity during the summer holiday season, driving mid single-digit equipment declines. Europe services contracting in parts were flat. Residential continued their outstanding year with revenues up low-teens.", "Transport organic revenues were down low-teens in the quarter, driven by weakening North America trailer and soft APU and marine markets. Despite lower revenues, margins expanded 110 basis points, with increases in both North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa.", "This demonstrates the more resilient franchise we discussed. Growth in aftermarket parts and services, trucks and in Europe trailers drove higher margins and helped mitigate the impact of the downturn.", "Please go to slide 12. Climate reported operating margins expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. Volume and mix were favorable across commercial and residential HVAC, partially offset by volume in transport. Price and direct material deflation and productivity also contributed to margin improvement. Additionally, we continue to invest in the business to drive innovation and growth.", "Please go to slide 13. Third quarter Industrial margins improved 180 basis points from second quarter trough margins on 1% organic revenue growth. Margin improvement was still solid at 70 basis points when accounting for Q2 2016 capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development of $8 million that we discussed last quarter. Excluding those costs, Q2 margin was 10.9%.", "Industrial end markets remained soft in Q3 and are expected to be soft through 2016. Revenues were up mid single-digits in compressors with growth in aftermarket, oil-free and large machines with easier comparisons to the prior year. Other industrial products were down low teens with material handling showing the largest decline due to oil and gas exposure. Small electric vehicles were down slightly in the quarter.", "Please go to slide 14, industrials reported operating margin of 10.9% was down 300 basis points versus prior year. Volume and mix were the largest drivers of this decline. Pricing offset materials, but given the continued low volumes running through our factories productivity did not offset inflation in the quarter. We continued planned investments in our products and channel and restructuring to improve our cost base.", "Looking forward, we expect margins to improve in 2017 given ongoing margin improvement actions, although we do expect some variability due to cyclicality. Please go to slide 15. September year-to-date free cash flow of $992 million was favorable to prior year by $527 million. Strong operating income improvement and working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. For the quarter working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.9%. Our 2016 goal is approximately 4%. Based on strong performance year-to-date and our confidence in future cash conversion, we have raised our 2016 free cash flow forecast to approximately $1.3 billion. This is up more than $200 million from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion.", "We have a proud history of returning cash to shareholders. Since 2011 our free cash flow as a percentage of net income has averaged 100%. Over that same timeframe we've retuned more than $6.5 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends of $1.5 billion and share buyback of $5.1 billion.", "You may have noted that we've referenced cash flow ROIC a few times today. Our definition is free cash flow divided by gross fixed assets plus working capital. Our goal is period over period improvement in this metric and we're doing well in 2016 with improved free cash flow and balance capital expenditures and working capital.", "Please go to slide 16. Our strong cash performance in the third quarter and our expectations moving forward enable us to; one, continue to invest in strategic growth programs as Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments we're also investing in long-term growth through innovative and differentiated products in areas such as controls for buildings as a resource, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems just to name a few.", "Two, we've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised the dividend over time. Over the past five years, we've raised our annual dividend at a 20% compound annual growth rate. In October, we announced a dividend increase of 25% to $0.40 per quarter or to $1.60 per share annually.", "Three, we will continue to purchase sweeping shares sufficient to offset dilution, roughly $250 million per year. Four, we continue to see an increasing number of positive potential acquisition targets. And five, we strive to maintain a strong balance sheet with BBB metrics to provide optionality as our markets continue to evolve. We will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders through capital allocation, as we have consistently done for years.", "Please go to slide 17. Our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for the remainder of 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. Markets for North America commercial and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC are generally positive, while global industrial markets remain soft.", "We are forecasting global transport markets to be down low single-digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volumes has not changed and we expect the market to be down slightly for the year, this implies a decline in the second half after single-digit growth in the first half of the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure.", "Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. All of our revenue growth forecasts are shown on an organic basis. We are forecasting mid-single-digit growth in Commercial HVAC in total; high single-digit growth in Residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-North America business for us; and a small decline in Transport globally.", "Please go to slide 18. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up approximately 2% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about one percentage point. We expect organic revenues to be up approximately 4% for Climate and down 3% for Industrial.", "Adjusted operating margins, which exclude restructuring costs are expected to be at the high end of our previous ranges for the enterprise at 12% and for Climate at 14.5%. Adjusted Industrial margins are expected to be at the midpoint of our previous range of 10% to 11%.", "Please go to slide 19. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.62 to $5.67 and the adjusted range is $4.17 to $4.22, up $0.14 to $0.15. At the midpoint, this represents a 12% increase in earnings per share over 2015. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain.", "We have raised our full year guidance for free cash flow more than $200 million to approximately $1.3 billion from $1 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued strong cash flows through 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% organically, while Industrial revenues are expected to be down 6% to 8%.", "Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share is forecast to be between $0.88 and $0.93, excluding restructuring charges of about $0.02. The midpoint is consistent with or slightly higher than our previous guidance midpoint of $0.90 per share.", "With that, I will turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Thanks, Sue. As we conclude, I want to emphasize a few points that I think are important for you to have as takeaways as we head into the final quarter and into 2017. First, we're performing well with a solid strategy punctuated with excellent execution over time. As a result, we have delivered consistent, reliable top tier financial performance on organic growth, EPS growth and cash flow over industrial and climate cycles.", "Second, our management team is effective in anticipating and seeing around the corners. Our commercial HVAC business is strong and focused on the right growth areas with equipment, controls and service. We believe we have turned the corner with our Industrial segment, and starting to realize margin improvement versus the quarter 2 trough. And our Transport Refrigeration business is resilient. Our team is capturing margin expansion, despite downward sales.", "Finally, we're building a stronger, more valuable, more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll-Rand. The results we reported today are a direct result of the strategic work, persistence and tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we've built.", "I'm proud of our people, who continue to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. Our momentum is strong as we conclude the year and head into 2017.", "And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question for today comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks, good morning.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Good morning, Nigel.", "Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Good morning.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "So, obviously, very good execution in a really challenging macro. Were any signs of softening as you went through the quarter. And I'm just thinking here about North American Commercial, up 9% orders, obviously a very good number, but you'd pointed to double-digit for this quarter. And so, I'm just wondering if there was any tailing off towards the end of the quarter that maybe just caused you to slightly miss that 10% bogie?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Well, maybe like a tenth of a point, Nigel was the difference. So, the good people here would not allow me to round that up, as they should not have allowed me to round that up. But that's the difference.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And the kind of the frontload activity, you mentioned some larger projects in the hopper, maybe just give some color on that, Mike?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "They were largely institutional, but we're seeing them around the world, there are some large lumpier projects. So, it's difficult to always know the exact timing but the pipeline looks pretty strong going into 2017. So, the backlog 2016 ending will be greater than it was of course 2015 ending and then we've got a good pipeline coming into 2017. So, we feel like the earlier comment about 2017 looking a little bit more like 2016 with perhaps more institutional tailwind and if anything a little less of the commercial headwind will net out to a pretty good year.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then a quick follow-up. TK for next year, you talked about North American trailer down 20%, but you think there is offsets, can you maybe just talk about maybe just round out where you see the offsets to that? And what do you think is the break point where perhaps it turns into a bigger headwind for higher. Thanks.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Yeah, Nigel. First, when you think about the TK unit itself, you've got North America down maybe as much as 20%, you've got APUs down, you've got global marine down, pretty much everything else is going to go up. That's North American truck, truck and trailer and Europe and Asia, air, aftermarket, bus and rail should all go up. So, there's a chance that TK pulls off something close to mitigating that. But when you back away and look across the company, institutional is going to be strong. We think industrial margins will recover. So, there's a lot of levers to pull inside the company and a lot of confidence in the teams that we've got across the company to make it work. We see EPS growth next year. So, that's how I would look at it initially.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks Mike.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Okay, Nigel.", "Operator", "Thank you. And, our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa, from JPMorgan.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Hey, Steve.", "Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Good morning.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So, just on the fourth quarter, Industrial, I think \u2013 just correct me if I'm wrong. Industrial profits are going to be essentially flat quarter-to-quarter? I know there is some moving parts around Cameron that changed the seasonality a bit. It's usually up. Anything to read into there. And then secondly, your free cash flow guidance of $300 million, I believe, for the fourth quarter is down pretty substantially from the third quarter. It's bounced around a bit, but last couple years, it's been actually definitely stronger than that. So, just curious as to why those two dynamics. And I have a quick follow-up.", "Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "So, Steve, let me start out with the industrial comment and the fourth quarter. So, you're correct that the operating income is about flat, but what you have is a dynamic in the fourth quarter where you really have more of the large compressors on a year-over-year basis. It's going to be a tough comparison. (34:58) going to be one of those areas, you have tools and material handling, which are high margin businesses that are going to be down on a year-over-year basis.", "So, in essence, you're going to have a volume challenge. You're also going to have some investments that are occurring in some of the business. For instance we're doing some investments in the Club Car business as well as in new products for the CTS business. So, it's really a story about volume and investment and a little bit less on the Industrial side with commodities, but also some impact there.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, on free cash flow?", "Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Yes. Free cash flow, that's a great question. So what we've done in 2016 is we've really changed the way that free cash flow has come in. So every quarter as we've started out 2016, we've had positive cash flow as opposed to having everything really backend loaded. So again, I think where we're at at $992 million at the end of the third quarter, is fabulous. We brought it forward and we brought it forward by paying attention to things like terms on accounts receivable, making sure that accounts receivable is balanced with accounts payable terms across the globe, with working through inventories and making sure inventories were there to serve the customer, but not too much to have additional product on hand.", "So we've really managed this very, very carefully. And so what you see in the fourth quarter is really that instead of doing heroics to end the quarter, we've normalized it, which is really how we want to operate the business and how we want our cash flow to come in.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. And then Michael, as just a quick one. You mentioned EPS growth next year. I think in prior presentations this fall, you talked about top tier EPS growth, I know you had a bit of a low tax rate, that helped that growth a little bit this quarter still top tier even without that low tax rate. Is there something outside of the fundamentals next (37:17) the tax rate going back up or pension or anything else that kind of will keep you from getting to top tier and I guess with the fundamentals as they are with all that in, I mean, are you still talking that way or is this just hey the bogie is really just growing earnings given the headwinds that we have in TK et cetera?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Yeah. I think Steve, it's a balanced and diversified portfolio, lots of service. We're investing heavily in the service channel as we've done all year long, and that's paying dividends. So, I think our eyes wide open on some of the challenges, but net-net, I'm talking about top tier growth from operations. Sue you might want to comment?", "Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "So, let me comment on the general business first. So, Steve, as we're going through and we're looking at the business, we still see strength in the commercial business for next year. We see strength in the residential business going into next year. We'll see improving margins coming out of the industrial business. So, we're going to get some good play on that. We're going to remain focused in terms of the price cost spread. We know we'll have a few headwinds on the steel side, but we'll still have a bit of deflation that occurs on the basis of copper that we already have locked-in and some of the aluminum that we have locked-in for 2017. We're also going to hit productivity really, really hard in the business, that's part of our hallmark of our operational excellence, and we're going to offset inflation. We're going to continue to press on corporate. So earnings per share growth next year on \u2013 I think is going to come from all of the different parts of the business, as well as tax.", "Now, tax is something that we're really proud of, and we're really proud of because it's \u2013 we started to talk about a low 20%s tax rate earlier in the year, we got there faster than we expected, but we got there by really doing what we call operationalizing tax. Which is basically we assign tax partners to each of our SBUs, they're working projects within the SBUs to actually work down the effective tax rate. Things like trading hubs, things like energy credits, things like really legal entity simplification.", "So, we've really operationalized that, I think it's kind of cutting edge. I still don't think our tax rate is going to go below the low 20%s, I think that's where it should be. So, yes, we'll get some tailwind out of that going into 2017 because I think the low 20%s is where we project the rate. But I think, it's operational also and something I think that's really good for Ingersoll-Rand.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right. So, the low tax rate sustainable that \u2013 that's kind of the bottom line of that conversation, tax rate is feasible.", "Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Yes that is absolutely the low 20%s tax rate is sustainable.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Awesome. Thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Thanks a lot. So, I guess my first question would be on Thermo King. You sized that 25% of the business is North American trailer. I just wondered if you could give any further splits out of that business in revenue terms and also just focusing on Europe for a second, you sounded confident about Europe next year. A lot of the truck OEMs there have actually been talking about Europe slowing and maybe volumes falling next year on truck. So, maybe just give a little bit more detail on your Europe perspective for TK.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Hi, Julian. So, let me start with the quarter, that we've got in North America. You can add about 20% or so to Europe and the rest of the world in terms of trailer. Truck is a little less than 20%, aftermarket is a little bit less than 20%, APU in container are high single-digits, bus, air and rail are low double-digits. So, we've got North American trailer down, we feel pretty good about our plans, pipeline and the other businesses with the exception of marine container, which we don't think will recover much next year.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Thanks. And then my second question just around the balance sheet. Your net debt has come down very rapidly, there was no buyback in the last few months and you talked a little bit about a fairly attractive M&A pipeline, it's been a while since the last couple of deals. So, maybe just give us an update on how you're thinking about sort of size of preferred acquisitions and any sort of financial criteria for them?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Yeah. I think one of the things we wanted to highlight for you was that in the last five years and we could go probably a little bit longer than that, but 18% per annum cash flow return on invested capital, we're doing well. So, even with the timing on Cameron not being great, we didn't lose a beat last year and we're not losing a beat this year in maintaining a strong cash flow ROIC.", "The kinds of things that seem to populate the list for us would be channel investments and product extensions where we're selling products through existing channels that we have today with the sales force that we have today. There's a healthy pipeline of that, probably 50-50, I think across channel versus product and it's important to be patient there. They would be more accretive if they can be closed, don't say share buyback at this level. So, the optionality is important to wait it out to make sure that we do the right thing.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Two topics, first one, just back to Industrial, the comment broad based recovery. I truly want to understand what you mean by that, it would appear that you clearly mean controlling what you can control and improving operations internally. But are you also notwithstanding the pressures you still see in Q4, actually calling a turn in those end markets and see visibility of that happening?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Jeff, we're seeing flattening really, not improving markets, flattening markets and easier comps coming into 2017, but a lot of what we'll do in 2017 is improve margins to the op excellence restructuring and cost activity. And then, very good product launches coming in this quarter, fourth quarter and next year as well and that's really our game plan for Industrial for 2017. We are not counting on a broad based Industrial recovery though.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. That's what I thought. Thanks. And just back to kind of the institutional markets and what you're seeing in the project book. Are those skewed towards new projects or is there a lot of retrofit going on in the institutional outlook and maybe just in general, if you could speak to kind of the retrofit pipeline that you're seeing?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Yeah. I'd say, it's largely energy efficiency retrofits replacing old antiquated systems with newer systems and those projects can get very large. So we'll see it from universities to healthcare to municipalities, state governments, federal installations. This is pretty much the market that we anticipate continuing into 2017.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Great. There's actually just one really quick one, maybe for Sue, just pension next year. Sue, any initial thoughts?", "Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "It's Sue. Our pension I believe as we look at it at this point is going to be flat for year-on-year in terms of pension expense, so I know a lots of people are calling headwind on pension because of discount rates falling and of course obviously ours are down 75 basis points from year end also. But I think with the way that we have the portfolio setup with the asset returns that we've got, my expectation is that we are going to be flat.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Good morning, Joe.", "Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Good morning.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So, my first question, Sue, going back to your comments earlier on cash flow, good job on the working capital. I'm just curious as we think through the bridge to 2017, are there any items that reverse in 2017 or is the right way to think about your free cash flow growth really EBIT growth should equal free cash flow growth in 2017.", "Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "What we're focused on is really exactly what you said that the EBIT growth should be the free cash flow growth, and that's exactly what's happening in 2016 is, the operating income growth is falling through, our percentage on working capital is remaining true. We are not having to invest heavily in terms of capital, but we're also doing all of the projects and all of the items that our businesses bring forward that make financial sense. And so, if we can keep that rigor going, that is exactly the model we want which is see the EBIT flowing through.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. That makes sense. And then, Mike, I just wanted to square some comments you made earlier on Thermo King. So, with North America trailer down next year, and your comments around hoping to offset with other parts of the Thermo King portfolio. Can you square that with what your expectation is for op income for Thermo King. Would you expect it to be up next year given that you think there is going to be some natural offsets on the growth side.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "So, I'm going to punt that down the road here a little bit for us to be honest. We want to dial in what North American trailer volumes will be. We're going to probably set around a 20% down number, and make sure we don't do anything. In the event that it's only down 10% or if it's down 30% we want to optimize the cost structure to match it. So, I know that if it's down 15%, we're working a plan to be relatively flat. We'll see as we get closer and dial this in, but we need a few more months on this before we can really come back to you on that.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker from Bernstein.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thanks and good morning all.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Hey Steve.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey Sue just want to clarify the commentary around price cost heading into the fourth quarter. You've been talking about 20 basis point to 30 basis points spread for the second half, so given the 60 basis point this quarter should we be looking at flat next quarter, and then into 2017?", "Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Yeah. So, let's talk about the fourth quarter first. So you are right if you do the math and you have an 80 basis point spread for the year it would get you to flat to maybe 20 basis point spread in the fourth quarter. But what we see happening and again the third quarter came out better than we had hoped at 60 basis points which was really about 50-50 materials equation and the other price. As we start to look at 2017, I think what 2017 does is it reverts to what we've said all along which is that we would have a 20 basis point to 30 basis point spread between price and cost and as you start to look at commodities for 2017, so steel has moved around a little bit. We saw an increase earlier in the summer to over $800 a ton. We currently see spot prices back in the $700 range. So, we have about a six-month time lag between when those prices move around and when we see it.", "Translated, that means I am going to see some steel inflation in the fourth quarter as well as probably the first quarter of 2017. However, I still continue to see tailwinds coming out of copper and aluminum going into 2017, helping us to offset that balance. So, we have line of sight to what we think the commodities are going to do and therefore we have line of sight to what our costs are, so that we can price per our operating model with top line margin expansion and get back to the 20 to 30 basis points for the year.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. And Mike, lean obviously has been so important to your story for IR, but I am just looking at Climate in it and Industrial this quarter. Excluding volume and mix and 20 basis points on productivity versus other inflation for Climate and down 100 for Industrial. What's going on on a lean path here?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Yeah. Really, it's the volume running through Industrial's so low on the large equipment, which is where the big heavy fixed costs tend to sit. So it's more volume dependent. If you look at what's actually flowing through there's good productivity on that lower volume. So, Steve, the long story short is volume helps productivity, cost reductions we've taken need volume to apply them to and that's \u2013 it needs to happen in the Industrial business.", "But look, fundamentally, you'll see us turning up the gas again in 2017, and we'll make sure the pipeline \u2013 we try to keep the pipeline 125% of what we think it needs to be. We try to calendarize that by quarter. So what we're doing now and we do every month is to make sure that we've got that pipeline lined up to be 125% of where we want it to be for our plan, allowing for things to break or timing to be different.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Mathematically, though, on 14, where you show volume separately in the waterfall chart versus productivity, you're actually saying, look, there's a volume effect running through the productivity as well as in the volume part of that chart.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Absolutely. Because we're trying to separate productivity on volume from volume at standards.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Right. Okay. And just, sorry, one last thing. You talk about the replacement market being so significant for IR. Are you seeing as a result of the new investments, breakeven paybacks coming in shortening for customers that's sort of driving a shortening of the replacement timeframe for specific end markets in any kind of big way?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Yeah. I think the combination of the regulatory effect and the thought about getting in front of that when customers have the opportunity. Plus, from our point of view, there's a passion at the company around energy efficiency and sustainability. I think you hear that every time you talk to us. That combination I think is helping our people in the field make the story more compelling. And I do think it's led to why we're seeing share gain globally across the board.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning, guys.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Good morning, Andy.", "Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Good morning.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Mike or Sue, last quarter you gave us a breakdown of what your Industrial business looked like in its major sub-segments. You talked about Club Car aftermarket, large machines, small rotary, small air. You said larger machines, I think, were trending down 50% and smaller equipment was down a little. How would you characterize those segments, the sub-segments, in 3Q and do you see any improvement in your large factory exposed air business and do you have any initial thoughts as we head into 2017 on those sub-segments?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Yeah you're seeing some of the smaller equipment growing, which is a good sign. You're still seeing really severe contractions in large machines. But we're ready to lap that, I think, next quarter and so that's why I think it's going to stabilize where it is.", "And you're seeing a still good growth in oil-free machines and contact cooled machines that would be supplied into pharma, food and bev in particular, markets which \u2013 again, the earlier comments I made, were really trying to direct more of that proactive activity into the markets that are actually growing. We don't see a lot of relief coming in iron, steel, air separation, those sorts of markets.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, Mike. That's helpful. And then on Climate, can you give us a little more color, I mean you said a marginal change in your guidance this year to 4% versus 4% to 5%. When I look at the sort of the pieces, it looks like the only change here is in transport, down low single digits versus flat to down last quarter was your guide. Is that North American trailers, just APUs and marine still being weaker than you thought or is it something else?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "I'd say it's exactly that, Andy. It's exactly what you just said, it's North America trailer, APU and marine as being weak and not really a surprise. We've been thinking about this really all year. We thought it would actually be earlier in the year, it's actually the back half of the year. But certainly, that's the change really as you come through now the final quarter.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. As you look into 2017 through, marine is very, very low, right? So, we really shouldn't have an impact from marine any more at this point?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "I would hope not. We're trying to look at crop yields and other fundamental factors that determine if you're going to see produce and food and perishables move. So, structurally, you're getting to a pretty low level here.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Hi, Shannon.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, on the institutional improvement, not only in 2016 but you talked about 2017. When it first started for you, it seemed like it was mainly in K through 12 education, now it sounds a bit broader than that. Can you talk a little bit more about how that's developed and what kind of visibility you have into it?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Yeah. It's the typical way is it does evolve. It really is always kind of a K through 12 led institutional recovery, and then it moves up through higher ed, through healthcare and then eventually with state, city and federal projects. And a lot of that is based on just property values, the ability to tax against those values and have bonds pass local city vote. And so, you're into that cycle here now. It's still about 25% below where it was last time on a volume basis. So, there's quite a bit of room I think on the institutional side to continue to grow.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. And then, Mike, you were talking about some of the M&A in terms of channel investments, product extensions, which all sound like good places to go, but they also don't sound very big. The buyback you talked about over the last bunch of years was several years ago. Can you just maybe update us on your current philosophy around buyback? I mean, given where the stock has traded, obviously we talked about it for a while, but doesn't seem like there is big M&A in the pipe. So, maybe just update us on your philosophy on buyback?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Yeah. Maybe to step back even one step further, I mean, the first thing we want to do is make sure that we are absolutely investing in the business fully and I can check the box and say we're absolutely doing that. I can check the box and say, we've now put the dividend in a good place relative to the peer group and we're proud of that. So, it really does come down to what do you do with the other pieces of this thing and if you think about it over the long run, roughly half of the cash going to either acquisition or share buyback. We'd certainly like to grow the company, but we're not going to do that at the expense of making a poor capital allocation decision.", "So, what you see right now is a large number of channel and potential product expansion investments that might fit the portfolio. If we could close, they would be worth the \u2013 the juice is worth the squeeze on those, so that's really why you're seeing us hold back here.", "Now, with all that being said, we've continued for at least seven years I guess now that I have been saying this, always controlling dilution of the share count, so Sue alluded to the fact that's roughly 2.5 million to 4 million shares and we'll continue to make sure it's part of the program going forward.", "Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "And I think what you're seeing, Shannon this is another point on that is, we're going to be patient with this and with the cash that we have, because we really want to create long-term value. We'd really like to invest in some of these opportunities, to your point some of them in the smaller size with channel investments, but also in new products.", "And so, it doesn't mean that we are going to just make an either or decision, we're being patient with the cash that's on the balance sheet and we're finding the best opportunities, but we want to let some of those M&A opportunities flavor a little bit and see if we can close them, because we think that's important too.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Hi, good morning, guys.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Hi, Josh.", "Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Good morning.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "So a couple of questions. First on Industrial margins. Mike, you talked about some of the initiatives there to get margins back up, obviously, some progress this quarter. But to see the kind of jump back to even 2015 levels for margin, 2015 levels. Does that require a particular mix to get there beyond just some productivity improvements and running the business more efficiently?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Well, mix matters, Josh. I mean, definitely, if you look at the high margin material handling and tools businesses, they matter a lot. But if you look at a normal mix that we would've seen sort of pre-downturn, about 70% of the downturn that we've seen has been volume related, the balance being some currency and then some mix. So fundamentally, we do need volume to return, but with that being said, if volume doesn't return next year, and we have the same mix of business that we have today. We have a healthy expectation to expand margins in 2017 in the Industrial business based on the actions we know we can take at these low levels of volumes. And we'll be bold about that and you'll see us commit to that probably in February.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Got you. And then, just following up on some of your comments on institutional and some of the bigger projects that are in the pipeline. I guess that triggers off a little bit of an alert on performance contracting. So I'm trying to understand maybe some of the mix of orders that are coming in that are more project related and have some pull through revenue versus pure equipment type, and I guess it wouldn't be bookings shipped, but more of your own content type orders. And can you maybe help dimension some of that out for us?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Yeah. Josh, I don't have an exact split for you, but I'm amazed at the size of equipment and controls orders that we are getting that are not performance contract based like the Chunnel tunnel and I can name a handful of sort of marquee projects like that. So we are winning a lot of that sort of work and we are loading up on that work as well. With that being said, performance contracting is an interesting place for us to play and there is a healthy amount of pull through that comes both not just in equipment but in service. Performance contracts always have a healthy service component that comes along with the guarantee.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "And when we think about a more institutional mix in 2017, that would have that type of flavor to it?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "It's going to be large applied and performance contracting, and so it will be equipment and controls and service with and without an energy guarantee is the way to think about that.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Got you. Appreciate it. Thanks.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question for today comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stifel.", "Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi good morning everyone. Obviously we've covered a lot here, but I guess the \u2013 I'll try on 2017 one more time. I mean Michael in the context of the last couple of years on the third quarter call, you definitely one year I think you provided a constructive range for EPS growth and then last year, you just talked about kind of the rhetoric around what you liked in terms of your overall HVAC portfolio. But do you think you have a good line of sight to 2017 on a forward basis versus previous periods in other words from 2014 to 2015 or are you \u2013 do you think there is more uncertainty in terms of the outlook this time versus the last couple of years when you were reporting 3Q?", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Robert, I'll tell you, I don't have a public point of view that's primetime at this point. So, good try, I appreciate the last question is one more shot at it. But we're putting our plans together now and there is a pivotal process at all companies to put that together, so I don't want to sort of put an end here too soon on that, but we understand what top quartile will be, we understand what our goals are, what our operating system is set out to do. And so, there is not a lot of acrimony inside the company to understand what good performance looks like. That's what you'd expect for us next year, and I'll dial that in as we get closer into next year.", "Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks for your time.", "Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session.

Our Rest of World segment, which currently represents our South American operations, also met our expectations for the quarter as we continue to contain the losses even in the base of weak production volumes.", "Overall, our Q3 operating results were disappointing coming in lower than our expectations. largely attributable to our North America and Asia reporting segments. In North America, we experience some operational inefficiencies primarily due to capacity constraints and new launch activities to certain body and chassis facilities. These issues negatively impacted our Q3 operating results.", "In Asia, we are negatively impacted by weaker vehicle production, particularly with our largest programs and customers. The lower vehicle production resulted in lower sales and therefore, lower contribution margin in the third quarter of 2015. For the fourth quarter, we expect to continued sales and profit weakness in Asia driven largely by expected declines in production for some of our largest customers in China.", "In North America while we expect modest sequential improvements in operating results at the underperforming body and Chassis facilities.

This past quarterly announced the acquisition of Getrag, a technology leader in transmissions and also announced that we closed a transaction disposing substantially all of our interiors operations.", "These transactions are important elements in refining our product portfolio to focus on core product areas.

These reduced operating income by $7 million, net income attributable to Magna by $6 million, and EPS by $0.01. The following quarterly earnings discussion excludes the impact of these unusual items.", "In the third quarter, our consolidated sales declined 7% or $586 million relative to the third quarter of 2014 to $7.7 billion. The weakening of certain currencies against our U.S. dollar reporting currency, in particular the euro and Canadian dollar had a significant negative impact on our reported sales for the third quarter of 2015.", "Foreign currency translation reduced our sales by about $870 million as compared to the third quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our total sales increased 3% in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014. Reported North American production sales increased 2% in the third quarter to $4.3 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, North American production sales increased 8%, while North American vehicle production increased 4% to $4.3 million units.", "The North American production sales increase is the result of a launch of new programs and higher production volumes on certain programs, partially offset by net divestitures, programs that ended production during or subsequent to the third quarter of 2014 and net customer price concessions.", "Reported European production sales declined 18% from the comparable quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, European production sales declined 1% while European vehicle production increased 4% to 4.7 million units. The Europe production sales decline was primarily the result of programs that ended production during or subsequent to Q3 of 2014, lower production volumes on certain existing programs and net customer price concessions.", "These factors were partially offset by the launch of new programs. Asian production sales decreased 12% or $45 million to $346 million from the comparable quarter, this was primarily as a result of lower production volumes on certain programs, the weakening of the Chinese and South Korean currencies against the U.S. dollar, program that ended production during or subsequent third quarter of 2014 and net customer price concessions. These factors were partially offset by the launch of new programs primarily in China, India and Thailand.", "Rest of world production sales declined 30% or $68 million to $111 million for the third quarter, primarily as a result of the weakening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar and lower production volumes in certain programs. These factors were partially offset by the launch of new programs primarily in Brazil and net customer price increases.", "Complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 28% from the comparable quarter and assembly sales declined 32% to $522 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, complete vehicle assembly sales declined 18% largely due to a decline in assembly volumes on the MINI Countryman and Paceman.", "In summary, consolidated sales excluding tooling, engineering and other sales declined approximately 8% or $641 million in the third quarter, but increased 2% if you exclude approximately $775 million associated with impact of foreign currency translation. Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 8% or $55 million from the comparable quarter to $705 million. Excluding foreign currency translation, tooling, engineering and other sales increased by $150 million.", "Gross margin in the quarter decline to 13.9% from 14.2% in the comparable quarter. The gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by operational inefficiencies at certain facilities in particular at certain body and chassis operations in North America, higher launch costs, lower recoveries associated with scrap steel, an increase in the proportion tooling, engineering and other sales relative to total sales and have low or no margins.", "Insurance recoveries during the third quarter of 2014 related to a fire at a body and chassis facilities in North America and increased pre-operating costs incurred at new facilities. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in the production of complete vehicle assembly sales relative to total sales, which have a higher material content than our consolidated average, lower warranty costs, decreased commodity costs. A decrease in the proportion of sales earned in Europe relative to total sales, which have a lower margin than our consolidated average, primarily due to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar and productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities.", "Magna\u2019s consolidated SG&A as a percentage of sales was 4.7% in the third quarter of 2015, compared to 4.6% reported in third quarter of 2014. SG&A declined $24 million to $350 million in the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to the weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar and the elimination of [indiscernible] fees at the end of 2014.", "These factors were partially offset by higher consulting cost and $2 million net decreased in valuation gains on asset-backed commercial paper. Our operating margin percentage was 7.3% in the third quarter of 2015 compared to 7.5% in the third quarter of 2014. This decline substantially relates to a lower gross margin percentage of sales and the higher SG&A percentage of sales.", "In Q3 2015, our effective tax rate was 27.9% compared to 20.4% in the third quarter of 2014. This was primarily the result of lower favorable audit settlements and an increase permanent items. Net income attributable to Magna from continuing operations declined $91 million to $402 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $493 million in the comparable quarter.", "Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.97 compared to $1.15 in Q3 of 2014. The decline in diluted earnings per share was a result of a decrease in net income from continuing operations attributable to Magna, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the quarter. The decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was due to the repurchase and cancellation of common shares pursuant to our normal course issuer bids.", "I\u2019m now going to review our cash flows and investment activities. During the third quarter of 2015, we generated $563 million in cash from operations prior to changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities, and $33 million in non-cash operating assets and liabilities. For the quarter, investment activities amounted to $434 million including $360 million in fixed assets and a $74 million increase in investments in other assets.", "In Q3, we collected $473 million in proceeds associated with the disposal of our interiors business. This amount excludes payment for China operations and other certain amounts to be collected at later date. In addition, we collected a $118 million in proceeds on the sale of our Bestop operation in the quarter. In the quarter we also issued $650 million of 10-year, 4.15% senior notes and we also repurchased 7.2 million common shares for $346 million pursuant to our normal cost issuer bid that expires this month.", "Our board also approved subject to approval by the Toronto and New York stock exchanges, a new normal course issuer bid to purchase up to 40 million of our common shares. This new bid would expire in November of 2016. Overall, reflecting all these cash flow activities, our cash balance increased by over $800 million in the third quarter. Our balance sheet remain strong with $2 billion in cash at the September 30, 2015. We also have additional $2.2 billion in unused credit available to us. Cash resources are largely expected to be deployed to fund previously announced acquisitions.", "Let me now turn to our updated 2015 full-year outlook, which reflects continuing operations only. We expect 2015 North American light vehicle production to be approximately 17.4 million units consistent with our August outlook. In Europe, we now expect 2015\u2019s total European light vehicle production to be approximately 20.5 million units that up from about 20.3 million units in our August outlook. The increase reflects modestly higher than previously expected European production in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2015.", "Compared to our outlook in August, we are assuming a slightly higher Euro and a similar change in dollar for 2015, each relative to our U.S. dollar reporting currency. Our North American production sales range has been narrow, but is largely in line with their previous outlook. Our European production sales range has increased largely reflecting a higher expected euro and the increase in assumed production volumes.", "We have lowered our production sales ranges in Asia and rest of world largely reflecting downward revisions to production volume to in China and South America and weaker relevant currencies compared to the U.S. dollar. The net result of these factors is a consolidated production sales range of $26.3 to $27.2 billion roughly in line with our previous outlook.", "Our expected assembly sales range has narrowed and increased slightly reflecting modestly higher expected assembly volumes in the higher expected euro relative to our previous outlook. Implicit in our total sales outlook is a more than $200 million increase in our expected tooling, engineering and other sales compared to our previous outlook. Our total sales outlook frame is now $31.3 billion to $32.6 billion which is narrow and increased slightly at the bottom end of the range from a previous outlook.", "We\u2019re now expecting our consolidated operating margin percentage to be approximately 7.7% for 2015, compared to approximately 8% in our previous outlook. The reduction in the expected operating margin percentage, largely reflects operational issues at certain body and chassis facilities in North America, lower margins in Asia, due to our reduced sales outlook and the increased proportion of tooling, engineering and other sales that have low or no margins.", "We\u2019re expecting our income tax rate to be approximately 26%, which is unchanged from our August outlook. For the full-year 2015, we expect fixed asset spending to be approximately $1.5 billion, which represents the top of the range from our August outlook.", "Next, I would like to provide some color on our expected segment margin percentages as a total sales reflecting our updated outlook for 2015. For North America, we now expect EBIT margin percentage of total sales to be approximately 10% for 2015 down from approximately 10.5% we had indicated previously. This largely reflects the operational issues we have experienced in certain body and chassis facilities, which we expect to continue to [negatively] (ph) impact results in the fourth quarter.", "For Europe, we expect the EBIT margin percentage to be approximately 4%, which is in line with our previous outlook. And for Asia, we now expect 2015 EBIT margin percentage to be approximately 6.5% for 2015 down from approximately 8% in our previous outlook. The decline largely reflects the reduced sales outlook and corresponding margin impact, particularly associated with weakened outlook for production on our largest customers and programs in China in the second half of 2015.", "This concludes our formal remarks. Thanks for your attention today. We are pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions] And our first question will be from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Murphy", "Good morning, guys.", "Vincent J. Galifi", "Hi.", "Donald J. Walker", "Hi John.", "John Murphy", "If I could just ask a first question on FX, because there was obviously a big factor in the quarter, I know you highlighted the impact on sales, but is there any way to sort of delineate the impact on EBIT in the quarter by region North America, Europe and Asia or even just in aggregate?", "Vincent J. Galifi", "John, I think when you look at Europe and Asia and rest of the world. It\u2019s a little - I think that that\u2019s just a pure sort of translation, I need to look at movement in exchange rates and whatever exchange rates you are using your model to where we are now. That will flow through to the bottom-line results in U.S. dollars. When you start looking at North American sales, it\u2019s a little more challenging and that\u2019s because we have a number of hedges in place and also we have substantially U.S. sales will be upside and some of the Canadian sales are hedged. So it is a complete pull through on a dollar-for-dollar basis on currency translation, but with the declining Canadian dollar, there certainly will be a negative impact to operating results reported in U.S. dollars.", "John Murphy", "Okay. And then on the second question, if you just think about the inefficiencies in this body and chassis plant in North America. We\u2019re now hearing about a lot of disruption for any customers that\u2019s apparent. So just curious if you could give us a little bit more detail on that. If there is been any disruption to the customer and also how long do you expect this to persists, it sounds like into the fourth quarter, but is this something that you sort of hang around into 2016 or is this something that\u2019s just in the ramp of whatever product it is?", "Donald J. Walker", "Yes. Three facilities and two of them are in Canada, the biggest impact is one in Midwest. We have not had an impact to our customers. However, I\u2019m pretty confident we have plans in place for two of the divisions the third one the biggest one down Midwest has got a lot of launches going on and all their customers rather at full production or pulling over full production. We\u2019re putting an expansion on the plant and we just had a few different impacts of downtime, one is in our press shop, one is in E Coating line.", "So we have had premium freight, we have outsource product as well as we\u2019re doing trials for the new production run. So that one we are still struggling with, it will be in the Q4 for sure and I suspect that we will have some impact going into 2016, because of the two major launches are happening sort of in the Q1 and into Q2. So we\u2019re in the middle of still working through details of it, lot of resources down there, but I don\u2019t anticipated it hitting to customer, but it\u2019s going to be having a lot of inefficiencies over the foreseeable future.", "Vincent J. Galifi", "Yes, John so just to reiterate this is going to spill over into Q4 and it\u2019s going to spill certainly into 2015. If you look at kind of Q4 versus Q3, we are expecting a modest sort of improvement, but a continuing drag on profitability compared to our previous expectation\u2026", "John Murphy", "And this sounds like a capacity issue more than anything else, is that what it is?", "Vincent J. Galifi", "It's a root cause, is capacity, because of the downtimes and because of all of our customers affluence in such a high levels. But once you get into issuing the [indiscernible] we can\u2019t get into maintain the equipments or having more breakdown than we would normally have and we are putting an extension on the plant and we are doing trials for the new launches. So it's a big plant getting bigger and hindsight we probably shouldn\u2019t have put so much in the plant and probably share and put in the second plant. Once it\u2019s up in running, I think it will be good, but we are going through a lot of operational inefficiencies.", "John Murphy", "Okay. And then just a last question on acquisitions, if you could just give us an update on Getrag and also on Stadco, if you could just give us some information on the sort of the customer base and the end geographies of those sales go into?", "Donald J. Walker", "I\u2019ll start with Stadco, in Stadco, we\u2019re expecting the transaction to close at some point in Q4 this year. Stadco sales is probably around $400 million plus or minus, its major customer is JLR, in the UK, it\u2019s got operations in the UK, and it\u2019s got one operation in Germany. In the case of Getrag maybe we have been working with the trust stories to putting all the people for fillings. Our best case at this point in time is this transaction is going to close early in 2016 with an effective date being the beginning of 2016.", "So it\u2019s not going to mess up our year-end accounting and we will start dealing with this in 2016. With respect to kind of any update on sales, John there really is an update from our Getrag call. Getrag is a little bit updating your business plan and we should be getting access to that late this year, so when we come to January and we update not only guidance for existing Magna operation, we will get some more color at that point on Getrag.", "John Murphy", "Okay great. Thank you very much.", "Vincent J. Galifi", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from the line of Peter Sklar from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Peter Sklar", "These issues that you have had in three body and chassis plants in the third quarter, are you able to give us some kind of order of magnitude of what the drag was on operating earnings versus what you would normally expect from those operations as they are launching?", "Vincent J. Galifi", "I guess when you look at it from - Peter, we haven't quantified it, but I can tell you that when I look at from last year to this year, there has been a pretty significant change in profitability, at those three plants, but part of that was expected. We are launching business in those three plants, they part sort of our roll of launch cost in 2014 versus 2015, this was built into it, but there are as Don talked a bit cost that we weren\u2019t expecting as a result some of those inefficiencies.", "And as I look through kind of sequentially year-over-year and the impact on overall margin [indiscernible] the greatest impact would have been with underperformers of operating issues, some of the other things that potentially had impacted margins, got a little bit more launch cost on a year-over-year basis or sorry quarter-over-quarter basis.", "Our investment and these facilities that's been a drag in Q3 versus Q2 and a little bit more net commodity cost, so lower scrap revenues, net benefit of reduced working cost, but you may have run through all that so the negatives are the underperformance, the launch cost and new facility costs are expected in terms of lower scrap revenues. Again that was unexpected, but the biggest part of that would have been underperformance. And that's why Peter, we\u2019re bringing down our leg for margin in North America attributable primarily to essentially those three facilities.", "Peter Sklar", "Right, okay and lastly, I just wanted to go back to Getrag. When you announced the acquisition, you indicated there is a big ramp going on at Getrag, and I\u2019m just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on it to the extent you can as what are those programs? where are they? Are they in the joint ventures in China and what\u2019s the timeframe, when do those programs begin to ramp and when do they achieve production maturity?", "Vincent J. Galifi", "Yes so Peter, when you look for Getrag and some of these things are going to be consolidated, some of them are going to be equity candid. If you look at something that's consolidated which is some of the European operations. There is just a launch of a new transmission DCT300 transmission and sales start to ramp up actually - 2014 to 2015 were expected to ramp up and continue to ramp up in 2018 with substantial growth in 2019, and there is a multiple number of customers that just reporting.", "In North America, there is a joint venture with four that is consolidated when you look through the ownership structure, Getrag won 75% of that. This is a business that any production probably at the end of 2018 and there might be some sales in 2019 that\u2019s kind of 2018, 2019. So that\u2019s ramping down we\u2019ve talked about that before its expected moving away from DCTs in North America.", "Peter Sklar", "The small car program.", "Vincent J. Galifi", "In terms of some of the other areas that are launching - some of the substantial launch are in a joint venture that\u2019s 50% owned by Getrag and it\u2019s in China what\u2019s launching there is a couple of programs the DCT300 and a big part of that is going to be going to Great Wall. And some manual transmissions and sales are ramping up sort on my schedule here at 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 continue to ramp up. In terms of the final joint venture in China, which is 50% own again its couple of transmission with DCT150 and DCT200 and sales structure ramp up in 2017 in this is final joint venture.", "You know Peter as I mentioned to just on my response to John [indiscernible]. We\u2019re in the middle of our own business [indiscernible] as well as Getrag. Once again a little bit more color and at this point we do have limited information, once we have access to all of Getrag, we\u2019ll provide some more color for you.", "Peter Sklar", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Adam Jonas", "Hey everybody. Just kind of launching of comment in one of your answers Vince a minute so ago. I think you side the decline in the margin guidance was mainly attributable to the three facilities. That\u2019s a 50 bit reduction on $18 billion of revenue, which mathematically gets into $90 million. And I know you\u2019re not saying - you\u2019re not qualifying it exactly at $90 million, but are we wrong to interpret that at least the majority of that number given your comment would be related to the facilities operational inefficiencies?", "Vincent J. Galifi", "There is a bunch of moving pieces right, there is mix in all that, but a substantial portion of that margin decline is attributable to the body and chassis facilities that we\u2019ve been talking about.", "Adam Jonas", "Okay. So that\u2019s\u2026", "Donald J. Walker", "The impact is really half a year on that, right.", "Adam Jonas", "Yes. No, I understand. We\u2019ll make run rate assumption but it\u2019s important just for the market to know. How much of the disappointment is related to issues that are kind of not ongoing let\u2019s say or temporary nature [indiscernible].", "Donald J. Walker", "When we say approximately 10%, it\u2019s approximate.", "Adam Jonas", "Understood.", "Donald J. Walker", "So there is some rounding in there and there is bits and pieces of other things, but this is most significant thing.", "Adam Jonas", "Thank you. Just on the FX side, I mean for the quarter for example you are mentioning that $870 million of the negative impact from sales. If I just use as a baseline a pure translation at around 70% margin on 870 of the revenue would lead order Magna $60 million to $65 million reduction of operating profits. Is that a fair baseline to say that I know there is a lot of moving pieces with the hedging and of course where you produce locally, which you do a good job of. But I guess the question is the impact more pure translation like meaning roughly applying that operating margin on the 870 of loss sales to FX or is the net kind of slightly higher or lower than that?", "Donald J. Walker", "Yes, here is the way I was think about, you need to look at the various segments and we did pretty good job in our MD&A. And I think I would look at it in fashion to give you a approximation. If you look at Europe in Q3 alone and I\u2019ll just focus on Q3 on a year-over-year basis, foreign exchange had an impact of about $350 million. So I think the right way to think about that is to just take the $350 million we reported kind of unit margins of 4% in Europe to give you that number.", "Asia there is that - which is primarily China is foreign exchange is about $15 million. So it had some impact, but in the big schema things on Magna we are all not that significant, rest of world translation was about 50 million negative. So that probably [indiscernible] money there. And we also have some tooling and tooling year-over-year is about a $100 million so that has minimal or no impact on overall operating margin on a consolidated basis.", "And then you have got North America and North America its about $250 million of FX and I think if you took the 250 million and use our operating margin in North America that you would over state the impact that translation is happening on the bottom-line, it\u2019s going to be something less than that.", "Adam Jonas", "So your position in North America is more in the direction of natural hedge?", "Vincent J. Galifi", "Sorry, you repeat that again.", "Adam Jonas", "Yes, I mean just to be clear your comment on North America as you are more than translation natural hedge, meaning there is an impact, a negative impact but it\u2019s not in the transaction direction, it\u2019s more of a natural hedge, more neutralized. Is that how you interpret what you just said.", "Donald J. Walker", "Yes its more neutralized, it consists of our program margin.", "Adam Jonas", "Meaning, less in our operating margin. Okay great. That\u2019s very clear, but just last one, I mean any comments, a lot of your supplier peer this earnings season when asked about the Volkswagen issue. And I know you have limited content, of course very little on the engine side, broadly, but they have all said more or less same thing absolutely no impact so far and no expectation of any significant of that going forward. I guess it\u2019s kind of nature given how early to use language like that. Just wanted to offer you a chance to either say something similar or to add any color from your side of the business as we look in to 2016? Thanks guys.", "Donald J. Walker", "Pretty difficult to estimate what\u2019s going to happen and I don't think they have seen much of an impact on their sales yet and I think they are doing a lot of different things with promotions and sort of read in the paper what they are doing. The impact on the company itself, again it's anybody\u2019s guess, is also a speculation what they are going to do. I\u2019m sure they are going through a very difficult time internally, trying to manage with everything with the changes in people, but Volkswagen is a big people organization. I don't know how anybody can say it can have absolutely no impact, because we don't know what the impact is going to be yet. I think from a very high level, from our perspective, if they have lower sales, then it will depend on through the end consumer decides to buy from and then do we have higher content or lower content with that other vehicle and we have higher profit margins or lower profit margins with the other vehicle. I do think that will have a negative impact on the perception of diesel in North America, which isn\u2019t update, seller here anyway.", "I don't think it\u2019s going to have a huge impact on diesel sales in Europe and typically people have relatively short memories, so it probably depends on if anything else happens or not. There has been speculation that this will increase the sales of electric vehicles, I think electric vehicles and hybrids from an end consumer standpoint that are they are going to buy them or not based on how much money they want to spend, because they are so expensive and there is difficult to justify payback sort of on electric vehicles.", "One of thing we\u2019re looking closely at is what will be the impact from the government agencies on the test procedure and will they be - I won\u2019t get into a long discussion here, because it can be a long discussion. But it probably will put more pressure on all of the OEMs to have lower NOX and lower CO2 which probably increases their interest and their rate of adoption new technologies and lighter weight in more efficient power trains, et etera, et etera. So too early to tell, we haven't seen an impact yet, but I guess we\u2019re waiting and see what happens.", "Adam Jonas", "Thanks Don, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Steve Arthur with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Steve Arthur", "Yes, thank you. Just following up on the Asian margins down quite a lot from Q2 levels down by about half and below anything we\u2019ve seen for a while. I guess importantly looking into Q4, your 6.5 type of level for the year seems to imply some sort of pick up in Q4 margins for Asia. Just on correct view and then just on your understanding now, we've recognized the volumes, but looking into 2016, would you expect margins to be somewhat similar to this level for 2015 given the launch practice and so on?", "Vincent J. Galifi", "Let me just answer your sort of second part of the question. When you look at production on our top programs in China, we\u2019ve seen in Q3 a reduction and we\u2019re expecting reduction also in Q4. In terms of 2016 we have some new business that's launching and we need to [indiscernible] business plans, so we need to understand the ups and downs of some of the existing programs and also what our simple launch is, whether it wants you to pay more or less. so I don't have at this point more information of 2016. With respect to overall margins haven\u2019t done a math yet and certainly you have done, but the guidance we\u2019re giving would incorporate the first three course performance, [indiscernible] Asia in Q4.", "Donald J. Walker", "Remember the numbers are small, so it doesn\u2019t take much to move the margin percentage around a lot.", "Steve Arthur", "Right, now it makes sense. Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Donald J. Walker", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rod Lache", "Good morning everybody. A couple of things, one is just getting back to the $20 million decline in EBIT in North America. I think you said that the margin effect on FX is less than 10% so maybe a mid $20 million negative effect, but if you were to apply the historical 20% incremental margin on the implied volume growth that\u2019s a $60 million positive. So there is 50 million or 60 million in the quarter that we\u2019re just trying to reconcile. I was hoping you can just give us a sense of the magnitude of the scrap headwinds and in terms of the inefficiencies are there tranches of improvement that you have some visibility on or could you maybe give us some timeframe for when you would expect to eliminate it?", "Vincent J. Galifi", "Yes Rod, so if I look at the year-over-year North America and I\u2019ll talk about the pieces that are in and out of there. When you look at kind of the incremental sales, less FX were around 20% pull through on that but there are some negatives and I\u2019ll take you through that and I talked about in my formal remarks but last year. There was a fire in one of our body and chassis facilities in China and in Q3 last year we got an insurance recovery", "Donald J. Walker", "Mexico.", "Vincent J. Galifi", "In Mexico we had an insurance recovery of $10 million. So really need to back it out of 2014 as a starting point. We\u2019ve been talking about additional launch costs and new facility costs for the business that\u2019s ramping up in North America and continue to build on our overall sales. So that\u2019s been negative. And we\u2019ve also have on a year-over-year basis a couple of things, when you look at net commodity costs that\u2019s some commodity cost in scrap that\u2019s been a negative.", "And then the other thing that\u2019s really have an impact is the underperforming operations on a year-over-year basis, but some of that year-over-year variance, we were expecting as a result of new business ramping up, but we had unexpected costs that [indiscernible] sort of what the expectations were in the third quarter. So that\u2019s kind of the math and how you get to kind of where we are at the end of Q3.", "Rod Lache", "By this time next year, do you think that there is a path to eliminating the drag from these underperforming operations or launch costs? And do you have a figure for the magnitude of the scrap headwind?", "Donald J. Walker", "I would think by Q3 next year that we will be through the issues, two of the plants hopefully before that [indiscernible]. It\u2019s too early to tell, but I would will hope by at this time next year that we will be through them.", "Rod Lache", "Okay. Europe I just want to confirm that you are still anticipating improvements with a 5% margin arrange. Just obviously it was not a huge volume quarter, this quarter, but just want to confirm that and lastly I was hoping you can just give us some color on how we should interpret your plans for execution of the buyback. Is this 40 million meant to signal a magnitude or is that just meant to provide you with flexibility?", "Vincent J. Galifi", "On the margin in Europe, things are just still going roughly with the plan. Just had a lot of good things going on there. I don\u2019t really want to comment till we get our business plan update, because we will have that in another month and that gives us a better clarity on where things are. Again we don\u2019t know what [indiscernible] rates, but from an operation standpoint we are pretty well on track.", "Donald J. Walker", "Yes Rod, with respect to the buyback, we\u2019ve been pretty clear in terms of where we want to be from a leverage ratio standpoint kind of one to 1.5 times. And if look at the end of 2015 and [indiscernible] in my earlier comments, I said I think it tracks in above early January, but we are assuming that transaction took place in 2015, let me just triple over a couple of days. We are going to be at the higher end of our range of one to 1.5, we might be 1.3 to 1.4. So when you kind of look our preliminary view on cash regenerated from the business, assuming we are not making any [indiscernible] in 2016. So 40 million shares flexibility to continue to be in the one to 1.5 times range on an adjusted EBITDA basis.", "Rod Lache", "Okay, got it. Thank you.", "Donald J. Walker", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Dan Galves with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Galves", "Okay, thanks. Lot of my questions have been asked, but maybe if you could kind of remind us of who your key customers are in China kind of how focused is the top three or four in terms of the percentage of the business? And I guess based on some early indications are positives from the tax stimulus. How much production growth are you expecting for the industry in Q4 and if you can dial down into your business specifically that will be great.", "Donald J. Walker", "Right now in Q4, we are expecting overall industry volumes in China to be down both 3% and as we saw in the third quarter, we\u2019re expecting our top program to be down by a larger amount. So we are seeing the same thing in the fourth quarter essentially as we saw in the third quarter. First half of the year, our top 30 programs was actually positive in growth of the volumes but in the third quarter we start to return negative versus overall volumes then we\u2019re seeing the same thing in the fourth quarter. So hopefully the same less than any other state sales are going to improve that going forward, but that what we\u2019re seeing at this point.", "Daniel Galves", "Okay. Got and in terms of annual pricing, I think you commented that fuel economy pressures or likely to build on the automakers. There has been some comments from different automakers about trying to extract some additional pricing from suppliers. Can you just remind us that what your, typical annual price downs are as a percentage of revenue and how do you feel your position is in terms of resisting incremental pressure? Thanks.", "Donald J. Walker", "Yes, the request from give-backs are all over the map and it depends on a lot of different things, could ultimately depends on whether they are awarding a lot of new business and if they are awarding a lot of new business then typically then suppliers would be more aggressive on give backs. If there is no new business out there then people typically don't give reductions. Our overall philosophy, quite frankly with our world-class manufacturing efforts and looking at doing engineer work and redesign product is to offset the give-backs with operational improvements or design ideas or reduction in our supplier.", "So it is, there is no average percent, people going to be asking anywhere from 0.5% we get request to produce 5%, but it really depends on what a lot of different factors. I don't think we\u2019re seeing any more or any less particularly than in the past, I think with all the changes coming up that the car makers are trying to make in vehicles whether its times driving and lower weight, more efficiency, safety products, whatever they are focused very heavily on major supplier.", "So give us your best technologies, there is always going to be pricing pressure, but I would say it's a more a level of plain field because there is limited number of good global suppliers and we\u2019ll always negotiate tough. So [indiscernible] are going to be taken tough, where I don't know how they can be tougher and they are probably not going to be any easier either.", "Daniel Galves", "Thanks Don its helpful.", "Donald J. Walker", "Just one question on Europe, I would say everything is go pretty well on track. One exception the European on track is the weakness in Russia and volumes are obviously down, we will have to wait and see what happens there politically and then what happens with the economy.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from the line David Tyerman with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.", "David Tyerman", "Yes. So just two quick clarifications on the body and chassis, is there are anything in there that is permanent or is this just launch issues?", "Donald J. Walker", "Just launch issues right now, inefficiency, launch issues, outsourcing so there is nothing there should be permanent.", "David Tyerman", "Okay. Thank you and then on the Asian kind of along the same lines, is there anything that you see on this top programs that could cause them to be lower on a sustain basis, or is that just this program or reps are getting greater inventory correction that sort of things?", "Donald J. Walker", "Yes. It\u2019s hard to say, I mean for a long time, the international OEMs were outperforming the domestics and we start to see earlier this year was a shift of that and based on some new programs are being launched. So I don't know whether we could [indiscernible] sustainable, I mean we will give some guidance, we get into 2016 on where we see our sales and mix relative to the overall volumes, but I don't think it\u2019s something that is necessarily sustainable.", "David Tyerman", "Okay. So it sounds like you are feeling, you saw the better idea by the time you provide the 2016 guidance?", "Donald J. Walker", "Yes.", "David Tyerman", "Okay. Thank you.", "Donald J. Walker", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.", "Richard Kwas", "Hi good morning, just following up on Dan\u2019s question, in terms of the customers in China, the Getrag manufacture, base manufacturers and European the German manufacturers as being your top customers any flavor on that?", "Donald J. Walker", "I would say the Getrag tree and the German tree being a vast majority of our customer base in China.", "Richard Kwas", "And then on CapEx you raised it to the top end of the range, Don any thoughts about CapEx investment in China given the slowdown in the market and how you are planning longer term in terms of CapEx investment over there?", "Donald J. Walker", "Too early to give you much clarity in that. I know the acquisition we are making in Getrag, they have got some big plants there. So I think that we could, if we have more power train, product to launch probably. We could probably fit them in their plant and we have one very big power plant over there, which is very low orders way below where we expect them to be, I'm hoping it\u2019s going to come back, but I think we have open capacity there as well. I still think geographically China is a very good place to do business.", "So, I know right now there are lot of concern about, they seem to slow down a little bit. I still think there is going to be a powerhouse, I think there is going to be lots of opportunity we continue to focus on. And quite frankly I think that\u2019s a better place for doing business than investing more money in some other geographic region and we are growing, we\u2019re being very, very cautious in what we do in Russia obviously and South America is very challenging.", "So other than that region in Europe and for the old Western or the Eastern Europe block being areas - we are seeing lots of opportunity, I think China will continue to be one we look at. We don\u2019t want over capitalize, but we are doing a very deep analysis of what we think the volumes would be, who do we think is going to be successful including the Chinese brands and try and grow our content with them.", "Richard Kwas", "Was the increase for the top end of the range was that regionally was that in China or North America in terms of the increase, where did that go relative to the outlook?", "Donald J. Walker", "I think its across, we are seeing a lot of growth opportunity and that\u2019s why our tooling is up as well, a lot of growth opportunity in North America. So I don\u2019t have it on top of my head, but it doesn\u2019t stick out in one predicted area, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s predicted in China.", "Richard Kwas", "Okay, alright. And then last question on ADAS. I know it\u2019s a relatively small business for you, but what are you doing in terms of investment on the R&D side there with all the news around the automatic emergency braking, I know your product there and how do you think about that business growth was over the next few years?", "Donald J. Walker", "We are very big in camera based ADAS from a sensor standpoint. We are making some investments in R&D and some other technologies don\u2019t get into here. We\u2019ve made some relatively small but investments in some new technologies and some DC companies that we think has very interesting technologies, we talked about one in cyber security. We have been taking a very deep look at where we think the technology is going or we think the volume is going to be. I think it\u2019s going to be rapidly growing area, I think whether you are talking about hybrid or ADAS.", "I don\u2019t think you go from zero do to full implementation in a short time period on anything and I don\u2019t agree what people saying, how quickly we are going to get to complete electric vehicles, but I do think it\u2019s going to be a growing business. We have taken a real deep look at it, we continue to look at it and it\u2019s an area we would like to grow in, but we want to make sure if we are going to make investments in it that we fully understand where the technology is going, how fast its growing. We make good that margins there of what competition is doing. It\u2019s very competitive area.", "Richard Kwas", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Itay Michaeli", "Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been asked, but I want to maybe touch upon bit of a bigger picture question. Some of the other auto supply that talked a little bit at least for a [indiscernible] that their backlog expectation is going forward. I was hoping you can maybe provide a top down update, I think your January outlook of growing the production revenue, I think about $5 billion or so through 2017. In terms of the percentages, how you are feeling about that as you look at the world today, [indiscernible] kind of think about model in your growth over the next couple of years?", "Vincent J. Galifi", "You know what, I think it\u2019s a very good question, I think we are about a month and half, a couple of months way before I talk about that. If you go back to what we talked about in January that\u2019s $5 billion, just there have been some moving pieces, and shares as a longer part of our company and that as a part of that $5 billion. If you go back to January and you kind of want to put box around how big that could have been, I think if you look at the shares that\u2019s 7% of the business and if you take 7% of $5 billion it\u2019s probably not a bad sort of approximation.", "Foreign exchanges have moved quite a bit, and you can see the impact just along this year that\u2019s that impact that outlook. We\u2019ve also done some acquisitions and some new business and we got different volume assumption. So we are going to put that all together and it\u2019s a bottoms up exercise that\u2019s why we don\u2019t any today and we\u2019ll give you some more guidance starting in January.", "Itay Michaeli", "No, that\u2019s very helpful. And maybe just a second question. Ii was hoping you can just give us a broad update on raw material exposure and how to think about the potential impact. Both from an earnings perspective, but also from a margin perspective as you have some pass through [indiscernible] that the margins are being fairly favorable sometimes. Just hoping if you can give us a sense of your exposures and how to think about that over the next 12-months or so?", "Vincent J. Galifi", "When you look at some of the commodities that we've purchased [indiscernible] under customer retail program or we typically have some fixed contracts for a period of time. The exposures that affect us from a P&L perspective, is resin, in resin pricing we are seeing more and more of our buy on resin moving to resale, probably that 15% higher on resins, which is substantially more than a few years ago. So if resin prices move up that will be negative to us, if they go down that just help us a bit.", "And then as part of our process we do have some engineered scrap and we do saw that and as steel price have been coming down, again we are insulated from that from customer resell programs the steel we buy. We are seeing some negative impact on scrap recoveries, you have seen that throughout the balance of the first three quarters of 2015, but when I look at steel prices [indiscernible] steel pricing, I was not sure how much lower they can go, but I think a downside there is less significant than what it was at the beginning of the year.", "Q - Unidentified Analyst", "That's very helpful. And thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Wu with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.", "Justin Wu", "Hi, good morning. Just clearly we\u2019ve seen a ramp up in production schedules in North America for Q3 and Q4 and it seems to me having some negative impact, although fairly isolated on some of your plans, but I was wondering if you can comment, as you kind of look across your footprint in North America, are you see any other kind of divisions where you could see potential issues with capacity problems and resulting inefficiencies if volumes continue to ramp higher?", "Donald J. Walker", "Difficult question to answer. I don't know of any off the top of my head. None of our plants are running pretty full now with extra shifts. The biggest areas would be painting, if you run a capacity in painting, I can\u2019t think of anything off the top of my head. Stamping and we've already talked there are a couple of facilities where we've got some issues we\u2019re dealing with now in capacity. And power train also been another area. I don't know if any that I can think of that would be a constrain, but we are running full. [indiscernible] kind of a breakdown somewhere. I don't know how much more the volumes will be going up, again if they went up few percent that's wondering if they went up 15% that would be a huge challenge manufacturing wise in some of our plants, but I don't anticipate the volumes went up that much.", "Justin Wu", "Okay. And may be just kind of generally in terms of how we should think about operating leverage or your operating leverage in North America. I mean are we kind of at the point where even if we see additional volume growth that you kind of reached the maximum on operating leverage benefits due to some of the kind of inefficiencies that just come with the higher volumes?", "Donald J. Walker", "You know what I would say that if you look at where we are today and where we were three or four years ago. I think the operating leverage today is going to be less than where we were three or four years ago [indiscernible] but you really have to walk plant by plant. To see what operating leverage you can attain and we talk a bit some of the big launch that\u2019s taking place in the Midwest. Well there if you look at operating leverage, the operating leverage is going to coming in average margin from that business launches. So it is really difficult to say other than compared to three or four years ago on average the leverage is going to be less.", "Vincent J. Galifi", "But in theory, if you get higher sales and you don't have the capacity constraint, which most of our plants can handle then you would expect to have a contribution margin [indiscernible] so borrowing a manufacturing constraint higher sale are good.", "Justin Wu", "Okay great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Archambault", "Thank you very much for squeezing me in. A lot of mine had been answer, but just I guess a couple of follow-ups. I guess Dan Galves question on China, I guess one thing I want to clarify was the expectation you have for production we done in the fourth quarter is this kind of a conservative first pass assumption until you get more clarification as to what the market does, or is it based on actual backlog and orders you have. I mean the reason I ask is Ford has come on the call saying that the fourth quarter is actually going to see a big uptake in production and GM sales are up 15% in October in China. So and I understand it takes a while to prepare this guidance and maybe you are putting in a placeholder while some of this is coming through, but just trying to get a sense of how conservative that is?", "Donald J. Walker", "Well, I don't know about placeholder, but it does take a while to run to the process and we are get news every day, but you can\u2019t update your expectations and your business plans and your forecast every day. So it\u2019s going to reflect, the best information that we have at the time, when we prepare the forecast and the volumes that we assumed and we are looking at releases to validate some of the numbers for sure, but yes it\u2019s always a point in time.", "Patrick Archambault", "Okay. That's helpful and then just the other question I had is just understanding the Canadian fee dollar impact. I mean I think you said at the beginning of this call, stuff that's produced in Canada, I guess the sale price is also denominated in Canadian dollars, because I know in Mexico, for instance most people producing Mexico sell to contract that are denominated in dollars. So when the peso depreciates, it\u2019s an advantage, but it seems like in Canada that's not the case, I guess.", "Donald J. Walker", "We actually have contracts in Canada, its normally both in Canadian dollars and in U.S. dollars, and we also purchase goods in Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars. So when you start thinking of that our - on hedging or net exposure. So for the long U.S. dollar by the way and Canada. When you look at revenues and costs and we\u2019ve got hedges in place that we put in place some time ago, it run through our financial, we have an unrealized loss in this foreign exchange contracts, [indiscernible]. So when you start working through math it\u2019s not so just a pure translation like it is in Europe.", "Patrick Archambault", "Okay. And as a result into negative, but less than your operating margin as you kind of went through earlier?", "Donald J. Walker", "Yes.", "Patrick Archambault", "And then just finally my last one is, I know you are at the top end of - or pro forma for Getrag, you are at the top end of the leverage guidance, but I just wanted to get your updated views on, if you would still consider participating in other areas of industry consolidation. As I think we discussed last time, there is a fairly large seeding assets that\u2019s up for sale and I know you had been taking a look at it, but hadn\u2019t really come out any direction on it and I wanted to see if that was still an open possibility or something you were looking at?", "Donald J. Walker", "I think people ask just a lot of questions if we were looking at or not, I don\u2019t think we commented, we never do comment on acquisitions. Getrag is a large acquisition and it fits well in what we want to do, strategically we've made the announcement, we\u2019re making a number rather acquisition smaller ones like Stadco and a number of others. So I guess to answer your question, we will continue to participate in looking at acquisitions if they make strategic sense to us and if we think it\u2019s a good product as far as what we think the car\u2019s features going to be.", "We\u2019ve done a lot [indiscernible] a while and we try to put our cash plan idea, we would like to invest our cash and to the extent we don\u2019t then we have plans to cash with thing I just talked about a bit earlier. The likelihood of us making a massive acquisition is I would say low, but there is probably going to be some interesting opportunities coming up, like just we are always looking at. So I'm not going to comment specifically on major seeding acquisition, but that would be a massive acquisition.", "Patrick Archambault", "Okay, understood. Thanks for all the info you guys have provided today. Very helpful.", "Donald J. Walker", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Richard Hilgert", "Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Just wanted to kind of get a little bit more detail on things going forward here with Getrag. Is there much exposure in their business from Volkswagen or diesel engine in general?", "Donald J. Walker", "Very little exposure to Volkswagen, I think they do a little bit of work with one of their subsidiary companies, actually Volkswagen does a lot of their own DCTs. And diesel I don\u2019t know off the top of my head, it don\u2019t know that would make much difference someone or the other.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay. And then the Stadco acquisition. Is there any particular kind of technology or process in Stadco that could potentially help the operations in North America that are having difficulty with their launches?", "Donald J. Walker", "It\u2019s not a technology acquisition, I would say it\u2019s more geographic customer, but they are very good supplier they have got good capability, they do a lot of aluminum. So it\u2019s nothing revolutionary, but they have good capabilities and both from manufacturing and knowhow standpoint.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay. So there is nothing really in there that would make any kind of a difference for the operations in North America that help get them up to speed a little quicker?", "Donald J. Walker", "No, we know what the issues are, it\u2019s just a matter of getting people on it and getting the equipment running efficiently, in sourcing our dies. We\u2019ve hired a lot of people, we\u2019ve got a lot of energy down there, it\u2019s just a matter of getting through it. There is nothing that we don\u2019t understand.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay. And then with the higher scrutiny coming from government oversight both in the United States and now potentially over in Europe. Have you had to take any additional reserves for warranty or you are expecting that you might have to or how is that all impacting Magna?", "Donald J. Walker", "I'm not sure I can think anything, if you\u2019re talking about the [indiscernible] Volkswagen?", "Richard Hilgert", "No, just in general, there is a higher level of scrutiny coming from governor organizations whether it\u2019s for recalls or whether it\u2019s EPA. Just the general environment that we find ourselves in these days. Does this cause you to rethink whether or not you might have to take additional reserves for recalls and warranty or does this not affect you with all at this point?", "Donald J. Walker", "Certainly nothing material I can think of. I think the whole industry is much more - where that if there is problem, the OEMs are extremely cautious and they are going to be more proactive. I think for the most part of they have been doing that anyway. If anything it probably make it a little bit more front and center to the industry.", "When an OEM is designing a system, especially a safety system to have more clarity as to what they are responsible for in the system, whether its components who is doing what sort of test specifications. Who is doing the test, who is doing the documentation, just so if there is an issue they have a better idea, when you are doing [indiscernible] analysis both on product and manufacturing process and who is responsible for it.", "This is fairly well known, it\u2019s fairly basic but vehicles are extremely complicated. So I think just more focus on general, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing anything different and we wouldn\u2019t expect anything different, but if I look back in five years, you probably will look for the industry and say, while there was more recalls and more investigation as to who\u2019s responsibility was but nothing fundamentally different.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay. Great thank you very much.", "Donald J. Walker", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Mr. Walker we have no further questions at this time sir. I\u2019ll return the call back to you for your closing remarks.", "Donald J. Walker", "Okay well thank everybody for dialing in today, it\u2019s been a challenging quarter and I\u2019m working hard to deal with the issues we\u2019ve outlined today.

Please go ahead, Mr. Walker.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you. Hello, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter and yearend 2015 conference call. Joining me today is Vince Galifi, Chief Financial Officer, and Louis Tonelli, Vice President of Investor Relations. Yesterday, our board of directors met and approved our financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015. And we issued a press release this morning for the quarter. You will find the press release, today's conference call webcast, our updated quarterly financial review, and the slide presentation to go along with the call, all in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.magna.com.", "Before we get started, just a reminder the discussion today may contain forward-looking information or forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities legislation. Such statements involve certain risks, assumptions and uncertainties, which may cause the company's actual or future results and performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied in these statements. Please refer to today's press release for a complete description of our Safe Harbor disclaimer.", "2015 was another successful year for Magna. We made important strides to reposition our product portfolio for the future and in particular, entering into the transaction to acquire Getrag, which puts us in a great position to support automakers' needs for improved fuel efficiency, and disposing substantially all of our interiors business. This business was not core for us and expect future returns do not support remaining in this product area.", "From an operations perspective, excluding the negative translation impact from the strong U.S. dollar and the reported results, I was satisfied with our performance. Our North American segment generated strong sales and EBIT despite the headwinds of lower scrap recoveries, higher launch cost, and underperformance in certain operations. We believe we will overcome the challenges in these operations as we work our way through 2016.", "In Europe, EBIT margins improved once again last year, and we see opportunities to make further improvements to returns over the next few years. In Asia, results by quarter were choppy in 2015 with a particularly soft third quarter. However, overall results were good, and our operations have performed well there. In the Rest of World segment, we managed to reduce losses again in 2015 despite a very difficult volume environment. All in all, a year of good operating results for Magna.", "Looking forward, we are launching a substantial amount of business over the next few years. This should allow us to continue to outgrow industry production, a trend that stretches back a lot longer than the 28 years I've been at Magna. As importantly, we believe that Magna's ability to generate our vast capabilities and technologies position us well to supply a growing portion of the car in the future, which takes us well beyond our business planning horizon. We're going to have more to say about this at our Investor Day in Toronto on March 9.", "With that, I'll pass the call over to Vince.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Don. And good morning, everyone. I would like to review our financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015. All figures discussed today are in U.S. dollars. Please note that operating results for the interiors operations that we sold in 2015 are presented as discontinued operations and this review of results will address continuing operations only. The slide package accompanying our call today includes a reconciliation of certain key financial statement lines between reported results and results excluding unusual items.", "In fourth quarter 2015, we recorded restructuring charges related to our European exteriors and roof systems businesses. These reduced operating income and net income attributable to Magna each by $15 million and EPS by $0.03. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded restructuring charges entirely related to our European exteriors and interiors businesses. These reduced operating income by $6 million, net income attributable to Magna by $5 million and EPS by $0.01. The following quarterly earnings discussion excludes the impact of these unusual items.", "In the fourth quarter, our consolidated sales declined 3% or $222 million relative to the fourth quarter of 2014 to $8.6 billion. The weakening of certain currencies against our U.S. dollar reporting currency in particular, the euro and Canadian dollar, had a significant negative impact on our reported sales for the fourth quarter of 2015. Foreign currency translation reduced our sales by about $770 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our total sales increased 6% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Reported North American production sales increased 5% in the fourth quarter to $4.7 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, North American production sales increased 11% while North American vehicle production increased 4% to 4.5 million units. The North American production sales increase is a result of the launch of new programs and higher production volumes of certain programs partially offset by net divestitures and net customer price concessions.", "Reported European production sales declined 12% from the comparable quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, European production sales increased 1% while European vehicle production increased 7% to 5.5 million units. The increase was primarily the result of the launch of new programs and acquisitions completed subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2014. These were partially offset by lower production volumes at certain existing programs, programs at end of production and net customer price concessions.", "Asian production sales increased 10% or $42 million to $473 million from the comparable quarter. This was primarily as a result of the launch of new programs primarily in China and India, as well as acquisitions completed subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2014. These were partially offset by the weakening of the Chinese RMB against the U.S. dollar and net customer price concessions. Rest of World production sales declined 49% or $82 million to $87 million for the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of the weakening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar and lower production volumes of certain programs.", "Complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 24% from the comparable quarter and assembly sales declined 15% to $628 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, complete vehicle assembly sales declined 3%, largely due to the decline in assembly volumes on the MINI Countryman and Paceman as well as the end of production during the third quarter of 2015 of the Peugeot RCZ.", "In summary, consolidated sales, excluding tooling, engineering and other sales, declined approximately 2% or $195 million in the fourth quarter, but increased 6% if you exclude approximately $685 million associated with the impact of foreign currency translation. Tooling, engineering and other sales declined 3% or $27 million from the comparable quarter to $878 million. Excluding foreign currency translation, tooling, engineering, and other sales increased by approximately $56 million.", "Gross margin in the quarter declined to 14.4% from 14.8% in the comparable quarter. The gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by operational inefficiencies in certain facilities, in particular at certain body and chassis operations in North America; lower recoveries associated with scrap steel; and higher launch costs.", "These factors were partially offset by a decrease in the production of complete vehicle assembly sales relative to total sales, which have a higher material content than our consolidated average, decreased commodity costs; decrease in the proportion of tooling, engineering, and other sales relative to total sales that have low or no margins; a decrease in the proportion of sales earned in Europe relative to total sales which have a lower margin than our consolidated average, primarily due to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar; and productivity and efficiency improvement at certain facilities.", "Magna's consolidated SG&A, as a percentage of sales, was 4.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015, which is unchanged from Q4 2014. SG&A declined $8 million to $412 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to the weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar and the elimination of Stronach & Co. fees at the end of 2014. These factors were partially offset by costs related to the investment in our IT infrastructure and higher professional and consulting costs.", "Our EBIT margin percentage was 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 8.1% in the fourth quarter of 2014. This decline substantially relates to the lower gross margin percentage of sales.", "Interest expense increased $5 million to $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 (sic) [2015] related to the increase in debt assumed to purchase Getrag. In Q4 2015, our effective tax rate decreased to 22.2% from 25.8% in the fourth quarter of 2014. This was primarily the result of a benefit recorded on the write-off of historical tax basis in a South American subsidiary and a decrease in permanent items. These factors were partially offset by lower favorable audit settlements, a decrease in utilization of losses not previously benefited, and an increase in non-creditable withholding tax on repatriations in 2015.", "Net income attributable to Magna from continuing operations declined $23 million to $498 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $521 million in the comparable quarter. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.22 compared to $1.24 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decline in diluted earnings per share was a result of a decrease in net income from continuing operations attributable to Magna, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the quarter. The decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was due to the repurchase and cancellation of common shares pursuant to our normal course issuer bids.", "Let me now quickly review our cash flows and investment activities. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we generated $773 million in cash from operations prior to changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities, and $243 million in non-cash operating assets and liabilities. For the quarter, investment activities amounted to $894 million, including $604 million in fixed assets, $221 million for acquisitions and a $69 million increase in investments and other assets.", "In the quarter, we issued \u20ac550 million of eight-year, 1.9% senior notes as well as CAD 425 million of seven-year, 3.1% senior notes. And we repurchased 3.5 million common shares for $164 million pursuant to our normal course issuer bid.", "Overall, reflecting all these cash flow activities, our cash balance increased by over $800 million in the fourth quarter. The cash resources built up over the third quarter and fourth quarter were used to fund previously announced acquisitions. Our balance sheet remains strong with $2.9 billion in cash as of December 31, 2015, approximately $840 million if you pro forma for the completion of the Getrag transaction. We also had additional $2.25 billion in unused credit available to us.", "And next, let me cover our outlook. The only change to our 2016's full year outlook compared to that which we disclosed last month in Detroit was a modest increase in European light vehicle production. We expect 2016 European light vehicle production to be approximately 21 million units, up slightly from 20.9 million units in our January outlook. We are assuming a slightly higher euro and slightly lower Canadian dollar, each relative to the U.S. dollar. Neither the currency movements nor the European volume increase were significant enough to change our previous outlook ranges. In addition, we have made no changes to our expected segment margin percentages of total sales.", "This now concludes our formal remarks. Thanks for your attention this morning. We'll be pleased to answer any questions you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, guys.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, John.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a first question on the two plants in North America that you're working through sort of the high-class issue of not having enough capacity because the volume was better than you're expecting. I just wonder if you could give us an update on that specifically, but also more broadly as we think if there could be upside surprises to North American volumes through the course of 2016, how your capacity utilization more broadly sets up in North America and what kind of room you have to handle the potential upside.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. There was more than just volume. We had a lot of different issues there. And actually (15:45) finish here just giving a bit more color on it. We actually had three plants we talked about, one plant is performing quite well. The big one down in the States was a combination of a lot of different things. We had some equipment breakdowns, we had \u2013 volumes were up a little bit, we had some problems in the tool room, we outsourced the dies, we had premium shipment. But we also had a couple of very big launches. Yeah, we're spending a lot of money on the launches. So, it wasn't all just because of volumes. So, if the volumes go up, again, it depends on what program, but the bulk of the work there is on some new launches. So, I mean, the launches will be the launches as we get through the ramp phase.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "John, I guess to add kind of little more color there just from a numbers standpoint. As Don talked about, there's actually \u2013 there's three facilities that we've been highlighting in Q3. One actually turned the corner and there's a couple more that we need to focus on making some improvements. When you kind of look at what some of those inefficiencies were from a numbers standpoint, it's pretty hard to precisely quantify what those were. But our best estimate is that the inefficiencies cost us between $50 million to $55 million in 2015. And I stated they were more backend-loaded. And if I kind of look at kind of Q3 and compare that to Q2 and Q1, they increased significantly in Q3. And Q3 and Q4 were roughly the same. I would just say Q4 was probably a little higher from an inefficiency standpoint than Q3.", "As you kind of look out into 2016 and we do have plans in place to tackle those inefficiencies. I think when you get to kind of the end of the year \u2013 sorry, let me back up, when you look at kind of the current run rate at probably $20 million to $25 million a quarter, kind of Q3 and Q4, in each one of those quarters. By the time we get to the end of year, we expect to eliminate half of that current run rate, and dealing with the remaining part of those inefficiencies beyond 2016. And these plants continue to launch business and we see sales ramping up in particular, in the fourth quarter of this year.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, but then more broadly, I mean capacity utilization levels in your plant base in North America and the potential to support upside and particularly on trucks which are big for you, at Ford and GM.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I don't think there's an issue. We would have to go through product line by product line, we've got a lot of content in the big trucks for GM and even raising their volumes. So, in some of the areas, we're running flat out, but we've been putting \u2013 and we've been exceeding the contracted volumes. So, we're supporting the customer. I'm not aware of anything that if they go up where we're going to hold back production. I'd have to think about it from all the different product areas but that would be a good problem to have.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, then just a second question, as we think about the Getrag acquisition, I just wonder if you could give us an update there? But also given the cost of capital was so incredibly low to fund this, I'm just curious sort of what your thoughts on acquisitions right now? I mean obviously there is room on the balance sheet but there's also seem to be room in the capital markets to fund some deals at very low cost. So just curious what you are seeing there in Getrag right now as far as developments and what the opportunities are?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, we certainly have more time to get into the details now that the deal is closed. We're going to be giving in the March review with the investors, March 9, because we're going to be talking more about the Getrag products and why we think they're interesting, so we'll give more detail then. But overall, it's pretty well what we expected in our due diligence, pleased with what we see so far. It's too early to make a lot of comments about the business plans and then joint ventures and everything else. But I guess as far as acquisitions are concerned, Getrag was a big one, and we made a couple of other smaller ones, but we still have to absorbment (20:18) in their Cosma operation. We're continuing to look at things.", "I guess from a cash standpoint, we have the balance sheet. We could make more acquisitions and it'd be interesting to see what happens with the economy, what happens with valuations, with public companies that translate into private companies as well. So, we'll continue to look and if we see something that we like and all the criteria we've talked about before, we can make the acquisition. And if not, then we have more cash available for the buyback program.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And, John, as you noted, the cost of debt that we were to able to achieve in Q4 was at a really good level. But as we're looking at opportunities, whether that's acquisitions or whether it's capital spending, we're not really looking at a hurdle rate that is the cost of debt. We're looking at a hurdle rate that's going to be equal to or greater than cost of capital. It shouldn't be more than the cost of debt.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it, okay. And then just lastly, I mean you mentioned steel recoveries being a little bit of a headwind but raws being a benefit that's offsetting. I mean, as we look at 2016 how should we think about raw materials? Because it seems like it should be probably somewhat of a net benefit, but just how are you thinking about that?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "There's actually two pieces to that, John, that you got to keep in mind. I think when you back out sort of steel which is under \u2013 a lot of it's under resale for us anyway. You look at kind of resin, there's probably going to be some tailwinds there, so we may get some recovery, but what swings us to I believe to the negative is scrap recovery, scrap steel is still selling at pretty low levels, and scrap pricing was coming off as we progressed through 2015. So, if you kind of calculate what the average scrap price was per ton in 2015, and where scrap steel is selling today, we're still below that. So, all in all, when you take steel scrap into account, we're going to have headwinds on the commodity costs in 2016.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you very much, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Peter Sklar with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Peter Sklar - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Thanks. Don, you mentioned in your opening remarks that the Asian results have been pretty choppy through 2015, but in the fourth quarter your margin, I guess, it's your operating profit margin, really rebounded from the levels that we saw in Q2 and particularly from Q3. So, just wondering if you could just give us a little more of an explanation of exactly what's going on in your Asian operations, which I believe is China which is causing these quarterly results to be so volatile or what caused the improvement in Q4?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Maybe Vince, you've got the...", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. Good morning, Peter. I think when you look at our sales outlook for Asia, of which a big part of that is China and which we gave not that long ago and where we ended up. We actually ended up on the sales side exceeding the top end of our range. So, as you're doing that, what you're seeing is some incremental margin falling through which are impacting overall margins in a positive way. And keep in mind that there is launch activities with new facilities going on in China. The base is still pretty small, so a $3 million or $4 million, $5 million business on higher or lower launch costs or higher or lower new facilities start-up does have an overall pretty substantial impact on the reported number.", "So again, as we look at longer term in Asia, we continue to see margins expanding as we continue to ramp up the new programs as well as some of the new facilities.", "Peter Sklar - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Okay. And in terms for your plans for India, I take it you're going to be deploying further capital there and do you think that will be a drag on the overall result of your non-North American, non-European operations.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We don't have a lot going on in India. I'm just trying to think we've got some launches going on. There's no substantial launches. We've got the plants that we're launching. The big capital ones would be for Cosma and the capital is already there. So, they're going through a launch. The growth in China is way bigger than the growth in India, so I don't think India will have substantial impact.", "Peter Sklar - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Okay, and then just lastly I'm wondering if you could comment on your plans for Brazil and Argentina. There just doesn't seem to be any end to the political and economic issues in those regions. And I mean it seems like your plan thus far has been to minimize losses, which you've done a good job at, but I'm just wondering what the endgame is, is it just to wait it out or is there something you can do?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "There's not a lot we can do there. We've got \u2013 we are in substantially three of our product areas down there: stamping; we've got seating, and we've also got some closures business, a little bit of mirrors. Our strategy has been \u2013 and that's one of the reasons we've made operational improvements, we did have some launches. We've made some acquisitions. So we will continue to make improvements with the currencies, with the inflation. We've had some pretty tough discussions with our customers. And, I think, every other supplier would have as well but they're losing money there.", "So our strategy, quite frankly is, to continue to make operational improvements which, I think, we're doing a good job of. Continue to talk to our customers about getting recoveries on what are reasonable. Some of the customers are more cooperative than others. And we're not quoting new business down there unless our customers agree, going forward, that they will have a pricing formula.", "It's hard to shut operations down there. We're not investing much capital. We're not winning much business other than the replacement business where we think we would like to get it. So we're basically going to wait it out and we've been able to cut our losses in about half the last couple of years. Who knows this year? I doubt we'll cut them in half, again, depending on where we see the market going and the currencies and everything else. But it's such a volatile place to do business. But we're going to do very little and we'll just see what happens with the results. It's a pretty small part of our business and will probably be smaller going forward.", "Peter Sklar - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning, everyone. This is Paresh Jain in for Adam. A couple of questions on a more broader level, for complete vehicle assembly business, can you guys tell me what kind of quoting environment you're seeing there? And are you still quoting for business that could start on or before 2018?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "A couple of years ago, we talked about what we were doing in Steyr and it's a business where for the most part we need to have quite a bit of lead time because the nature of the business depends if it's new launch or just excess capacity. We've been working hard and we give an outlook where the sale is going to be, so we are in good shape there. There's a likelihood of us winning new business right now that'll launch in 2017 fairly unlikely (27:59). Sometimes there's some short-term takeover work which we can get in there, but the operation we have in Steyr and Austria will be substantially full in the out years 2018, 2019, and typically we can look at the loading out six years, seven years, eight years, nine years out there, but there is a lot of interest from a lot of customers in smaller volumes and some new entrants are looking at doing this. So, we like the business unit. It's performing well. I was a bit concerned about a couple of years ago. We've had to slow down until we launched the new business we won, but it's a good business in the engineering part of that operation that we get those contracts on an ongoing basis. So, that's just regular business for us.", "Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Understood. And just one follow-up on Asia. If you look at the last two years' margins around 8%, if you were to hold those margins for 2016 as well, what kind of volumes would you need to see in Asia and particularly in China?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, if you kind of look at the guidance we gave in January for Asia, we're guiding at 6% to 7%, which is lower than what we actually recorded in 2015. And there's some \u2013 one significant thing that impacts margins negatively in 2016 and that's acquisition of Getrag. As we talked about before, Getrag is launching quite a bit of business and just consolidating the Getrag results in 2016 for our Asia segment is going to, on a year-over-year basis, reduce margins by about 0.6%. So, if you take what we've kind of ended up for the year of 7.5% and you take away the 0.6%, your comparable number really is about 6.9%.", "And we've got a couple of other things that are going to impact margins in Asia, and we do expect sales to grow between 2015 and 2016. But what's going to impact us is just higher launch costs. We are ramping up additional business. Some of the things that are going to help a little bit is going to be the consolidation of the joint venture with our Cosma Group. Internally, we call that our Stark-Hughes (30:21) joint venture. There's some contribution from new programs that are also going to contribute to overall margins. But Getrag and certainly when you look at the launch costs all in all, we expect it to be a little bit downward pressure compared to where we ended up in 2015.", "Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Understood. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Just a couple things. You're for North America guiding to 10% margin for this year, you are at 9.8% already in the fourth quarter with that $25 million headwind. I was wondering if you could just describe for us what some of the challenging factors might be as you look out to 2016 and how we should be thinking about the exit rate for the year. And similarly, as we think about Asia, just given the volatility from quarter to quarter, but you have a fair amount of growth there. So any thoughts on what we should be looking forward to kind of as an exit rate for 2016 margins?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Rod, when you look at the benchmark, so 2015 if you run the numbers, our EBIT margin was 10.2% in North America. Where we've been guiding to for 2016 in North America is approximately 10%. And what's impacting us there on the negative side is commodity costs which, I don't know if you listened to my earlier answer before, is going to be essentially commodity ex scrap recovery, less scrap recovery. We actually do have increased launch and new facility activity in 2016, which is going to be a negative. Getrag is also in North America a negative operating margin and a big part of that is purchase price amortization, but it will impact reported operating margins.", "We're going to see some contributions from new programs because we have been launching some programs kind of towards the end of 2015 and we'll continue to launch. That'll give us some benefit. And in terms of operating performance, we should get some benefit. We specifically talked about some of those underperforming operations in our stamping group before, and we talked about kind of inefficiencies being roughly kind of $50 million to $55 million for 2015. We'll see some improvements sequentially kind of on an equal basis throughout 2016, but we don't completely eliminate some of those inefficiencies by the end of 2016. They'll continue to improve as we move into 2017 as business ramps up.", "So in terms of exit rate in the quarter, I haven't really given specific color on the quarter, but we are guiding up in 2018 to around 10.5%, but I think that's going to mean that we're going to be exiting a little higher than we're coming into the year.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And Asia?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You mean exits?", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. You've got growth and operating leverage there. So is there a milestone that we should be looking forward to as we think about later in the year?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Rod, you know what, I don't have that information in front of me. I can just tell you that we do have a ton of activity going on in Asia. And as this business ramps up, as I look at the three-year business plan, margin is expected to get to kind of 9% to 10% over that three-year period. So I just don't recall what the cadence is per quarter in 2016.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And can you....", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Overall in China, and China is that segment, just a little bit in India, but overall we do have some launches going on. No particular problems, knock on wood. And we do have the joint ventures from Getrag which we're going to be growing. So I think a lot of it will depend on does the market go up a little bit like we're anticipating, what's the split of the sales like with customers and how does that line up with us, but overall in China things seem to be going pretty well.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you. And just lastly, just a few housekeeping things. You mentioned that raw material because of scrap would be a headwind and you've got some EBIT headwind as well from the Canadian dollar and the euro. Can you provide any quantification of what's the magnitude of that both from an EBIT perspective?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, Rod, we don't get into quantifying those elements, so we can't help you there. Sorry.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. How about the buyback pace lastly? Any thoughts on how we should be thinking about that?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. You know, Rod, we're not happy with our valuation today. You kind of look at our performance in 2015, our outlook that we gave in January given the growth in our business in all our segments, expansion of margins in essentially every segment and we're trading at I think, we all think at a deep discount. We think the stock's undervalued. When you look at where we are from a target leverage ratio, we ended up the year at about, I think, it was 1.23, and if you pro forma for Getrag, we're about 1.22. We certainly have the room available under our normal course issuer bid and room available under our target capital structure to be buying some stock. And given where the stock price is today, we expect to be buying back some stock in 2016.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Gentlemen, how are you? Can you hear me?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, Brett.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, there.", "Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. So a couple of quick questions. First, following on the last question, share repurchase. I'm kind of looking at your history here and it kind of bounces around a bit. So in the past 2013 to 2014, you had a 40,000 (sic) [40 million] shares authorization, and you had another 40 million shares in 2014, 2015, and another 40 million shares in 2015 and 2016. And if I understand the rules in Canada correctly, the idea of an authorization is not like it is in the U.S. My understanding is in Canada you come out with an authorization, you intend to complete that authorization to the best of your ability, doesn't mean you're going to be perfect. In 2013, you did 35 million shares out of 40 million shares. But then in 2014 and 2015, you did 12 million shares out of 40 million shares. And you've done 3.6 million shares out of 40 million shares or at least that's what I'm looking at your auto show thing here. And so I guess what I'm wondering, and you did another 3.5 million shares this quarter, if I'm not mistaken, if I remember correctly, which is not a pace of 10 million shares a quarter. So I guess I'm kind of wondering how do I think about the pace here because it seems like it's bouncing around some, and it's certainly not pacing at 10 million shares thus far this year. And so what do I think about the progression or how should I model it, I guess, is my question?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, Brett...", "Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "If you were me, how would you model?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "...you threw in a whole bunch of facts, and I think you're accurate on all of those things. We actually did buy back just over 3.5 million shares in Q4. Remember, The new bid came into place, I think, it was in the middle of November. So we had just over a month to complete that share buyback.", "If I look over history, in some cases we bought or have been very close to the maximum that's been authorized; in other years, we haven't. And if you think about what our capital strategy has always been about is we do generate quite a bit of cash from operation. And our primary objective would be if we find the right opportunities, whether it's an acquisition or capital expenditures to invest it in a business, because we think we're really well-positioned to continue to generate some decent returns. And to the extent that after doing all that, you still have excess sort of liquidity from a target capital structure standpoint, we'll be buying back some stock.", "So in the years we haven't gone out and bought the maximum amount, if you think about just even last year, think about what we did. We went out and we bought Getrag. We bought it on and closed it on January 4. We ended up doing a transaction in the UK for Stadco and the Stark-Hughes (39:37) joint venture that I talked about earlier all used up cash.", "So make a long story short, as I look at where we stand today, we've got about 36.5 million shares that we're able to buy under our normal course issuer bid, which expires on November 2016, depending on what stock price you use, the $35 or $36 stock price or higher, and you're running kind of $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion and we have the capacity within our target capital structure to be able to do that.", "Now whether we do all that is going to depend on the opportunities we see in the business. It's also going to depend on where we want to land in that target structure. We're looking at a number of things that we may not be able to talk about we may be at the lower end. We do some things then we may be at the higher end. But given where we ended up at the end of the year, we expect to be back in the market buying back some stock in 2016 as soon as we get out of blackout, which (40:46) after results.", "Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Yes. And I'm going to maybe press you on that just a little bit farther by basically \u2013 so your remaining authorization of 35.5 million shares and if I divide that by three months or three quarters let's say, then I'll get basically 11.8 million shares. Now if I basically say, well, let's just divide it by four because we're kind of part way in, so it's 8.8 million shares, so let's round it up to 9 million shares. So if I round it out over the next four quarters, which obviously expires in November, I get 9 million shares per quarter. Would you model 9 million shares per quarter? And in addition to that, your stock is really cheap. So wouldn't you do more now because it's really cheap, if you really believe it's cheap?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, you know what, Brett, I do think the stock's really cheap. You heard my comments before. I'm not going to go out and talk to you about exactly what my strategy is. But I can tell you my strategy is to go out and buy some stock.", "Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Yes. Okay. Okay. I just think it'll be a great signal for the market. Now, Getrag, I just want to clarify. The notes that I've had in the past is it's basically neutral to earnings, including amortization in 2016 and it's accretive to earnings in 2017, including amortization. Is my understanding correct? Has it been modified and maybe I missed it or is that still the same? And then, accretive to earnings in 2017, have you possibly given any indication of quantifying that? I mean, what does that mean? $0.01, $1, any thoughts there?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. No, I guess, we have not updated the color we've given on Getrag. And, again, Brett, if you go back to kind of the detailed presentation we gave in Detroit on our website, what we talked about it is for 2016, including purchase price amortization that it was going to be fairly neutral to earnings per share in 2016. Excluding the purchase price amortization, we talked about EPS accretion of around $0.11. And that is expected to grow in 2017 and 2018. And I think what we said was in 2017, even with purchase price amortization, we believe this transaction is going to be accretive.", "But we haven't gone out and done more than that. Just remember this is pretty early on for us. We've just completed this transaction on January 4. We don't have yet, as you can imagine, the first quarter results obviously done yet, and we're digging into and getting our own people involved in developing a bottoms-up business plan that's similar to what we do throughout the organization. So give me some time and I will you some more color, but just give me some time to just scrub the numbers a little more.", "Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Can I ask you this? In your initial presentation on Getrag, you said that the earnings are going to grow at a 15% rate. Would it be reasonable and even maybe conservative to take the $0.11 accretion in 2016 ex amortization and just run it out at 15%. And I believe that would probably be conservative it would seem to me because you're probably going to do some restructuring and do probably some cost synergies there and so forth. But if just take the $0.11 and multiply it by 1.15, is that may be a reasonable and essentially a conservative representation of the accretion in 2017?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Brett, You know what, I think I've given enough color on Getrag. We just want to get some more of our people involved in trying to piece things together in the way we do things and we'll give some updates a little later. I don't really want to comment any more than that. At this point, it's just hypothesis of saying what it would be for a quarter or for a year. Let's just get through the numbers. Obviously, we've done enough work and feel confident that it is going to be accretive with purchase price amortization in 2017 and certainly excluding PPA it's more accretive in 2017 over 2016.", "Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. That's very fair. And so I just figured I'd ask. So thank you very much and a very good quarter, gentlemen. Nice job.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Brett.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Brett.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yes. Thanks and good morning.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I just wanted to follow up on, I guess, one kind of shorter-term question, one longer-term. So out of the three plants, you have one that's actually sort of coming in line a little a more in Canada. You have another one in Canada and then the big one in the U.S. which I think is Kentucky, if I remember well. Can you just go over that one a little bit more? It sounds like there's a big product launch coming there may be in the first half? And is that an opportunity to really address that since you're going to have some downtime to find engineering solutions to some of these issues that have come about?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. The bigger plants, the losses are both in the one remaining plant in Canada and, Don, there is the bigger plant and more complex plant by far is the one in the States. It has a lot of business running. It's not like the whole plant is turning over, but we're launching two major programs: one of them is a takeover job for a customer from a supplier that couldn't launch, so we took it over very late and we've had a lot of issues just because we took it over so late and the customer understands it, but it's been a lot of inefficiencies. So it's not like we're running the plant down and then ramping it back up again. We're running the plant pretty well full out, and then we're launching the new business. We've got new equipment going in for that. And the other business is ramping down and replacement is coming in. So it's a combination of both.", "So we've got a lot of people down there. We know what the issues are, we know what needs to get done. But there's just a lot of work. And there's issues in the tool room with capacity. We had a couple of equipment breakdowns last year, which really threw us for a loop because we outsource a lot of different things. So it was a combination of a lot of things. So if we don't have any major breakdowns and the launches go the way we expect and we can make the operational improvements we expect and we've got a lot of people there, then we have pretty good idea what's going to happen. So we'll just have to work our way through it.", "Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Got it. Appreciate the color there. I guess just another quick one on China. Obviously, you guys participated in what was a better quarter than most expected from a volume perspective. But can you just kind of give us a sense, like remind us what's your mix on under sort of 1.6 liter vehicles, which is obviously going to be the lion's share of the increase this year. Can you just give us a sense of your positioning and maybe your customer base would be helpful as well?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, yes, I can't help you on our mix in that range. We just don't have that level of detail available to us. In terms of our customer base, we are \u2013 now this is excluding Getrag, so it will be a little bit different with Getrag. But excluding Getrag in our business, pre-Getrag, we're about 85%, 90% international OEM. GM, Volkswagen in particular are big customers of ours and we're growing with some of the others as well.", "Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Understood. And then, finally, I know you've kind of addressed this during your \u2013 I'm sure you will go into more detail in your Analyst Day. But as we think about just the longer term growth drivers of the company and maybe we just stick with North America just for simplicity sake. From a content perspective is it still like metal forming and Magna Powertrain that are the biggest sources of content growth there? I suppose there's an overlay of mix. One thing that is remarkable is you guys are one of the few companies that's actually consistently grown content over the last seven years, so just wanting to get a better sense of that going forward.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. Our growth in North America, I'd have to go through it to give you a real detail, but we're launching a bunch of new plants. One is a new high-pressure aluminum die casting plant which was of Cosma. But it's a very sort of advanced technology. That's a new plant. We've got a new lighting plant that's going up for a new business we've got. We just launched a day shift (49:33) plant. We're putting expansions. We're spending a lot of capital here. So it's all over the map. It's not in any one or two areas. And we'll talk more at the Investor Day because I \u2013 Vince had mentioned earlier that we're not happy with our share price. If you look at our multiple compared to our peers, we're low. If anything, I think we should be at least to what our peers are and maybe higher. But that's our opinion, obviously.", "One of the things we're going to talk about is our product strategy, what do we see going on in the market about things like how fast electrification come, what's going to happen with autonomous driving, where do we see the volumes going, what's happening with the new legislation for fuel efficiency. I personally think people don't understand our expertise and the level of electronics we have within the company. I also don't think people appreciate the technology we've got in product and process. So we're going to try and give more color into that and try and get people to understand we're not a metal-bashing, low-tech company. We've got a lot of technology here. And we've probably haven't done as good a job of explaining that to people. And I think we've got lots of room to grow. We're big but all the feedback from our customers are they want to continue to give us business if we're competitive, because we execute well and we've got good technologies. So we'll give a lot more color in the Investor Day.", "Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Got it. Well, sounds like there's some good share opportunities in a lot of different areas for you. So look forward to the update.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question from the line Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, just a follow-up to the North America execution questions from early in the call, how that feeds into the total corporate margin guidance of high 7% just kind of as the year progresses? So I think in an ordinary year maybe 3Q margin or 4Q margin might be softest, particularly with lower production in U.S. and Western Europe. Should we be thinking about this tracking any differently this year given that you expect to lessen inefficiencies in back-half versus front-half?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think we do have the differences by quarter and there's no reason to think they'd be any different. That's basically holidays and shutdowns and things like that. And Vince just went through the loss we have in those divisions. We've been talking about $20 million to $25 million and that's going to be going down. But if that goes down sort of in a straight line over the year, who knows, I mean it will go up and down, but I don't expect anything different really from what we've seen in the past as far as where the margins are by quarter.", "Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then I know you don't typically provide free cash flow guidance. You talk about CapEx. Anything you can say directionally, though, to help us this year, just given that it seems a little bit more challenging because we're less familiar with underlying cash flow dynamics of Getrag, then there's the Getrag launches, and then there's costs associated with the integration, some of which are cash, some of which are non-cash. Anything you can say there?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think, Ryan, if you kind of look at the color we've given you, I think you'd be able to try to model something. We've given you operating margin. We've talked about D&A. We've talked about level of debt and interest expense and capital. I think it's all kind of factored into our overall guidance I think if you can take a view on that. Certainly, as I look at cash flow, there are variabilities. There could be changes in working capital and delays in parts and tooling or ship them (53:18) a little earlier than we anticipated. But all in all, when I look at kind of our overall business plan, we're still generating excess cash flow even after paying dividends.", "Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, thanks. And just a last question. You do very good and outsized business with BMW and to a lesser extent German luxury generally. There's been some speculation that sales of luxury vehicles could slow. There's been some noise about choppier sales in the U.S. commentary from Mike Jackson, et cetera. Just curious is there anything different there and if there is any particular strength or softness in luxury demand baked into your 2016 guidance?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. It's interesting. Everybody has a different opinion. I think when we were down in Detroit for the first through second week in January, there was a (54:10) from the beginning of the week to the middle of the week people thought maybe we're going to see a drop-off. We haven't seen it yet. I'm not that close to releases, but I haven't seen any drop-off.", "One of the things we'll be interested to see what happens is because of what's going on in China, there's probably going to be less luxury vehicles sold over there that could have an impact on various \u2013 the high-end producers. I hadn't thought much about it, but somebody made a speech and probably a lot of people heard it in Detroit. When we think of luxury vehicles, people are thinking of the higher end European cars, but I think there has been a little bit of a trend with the low gas price where people are now spending $70,000, $80,000, $90,000 on fully loaded SUVs, Ford, GM and other customers. So it may be a bit of a shift what people are looking to buy. I don't really have any more \u2013 and IHS is someone (55:08) I guess will have better information. But we really aren't, at this point in time, seeing the slowdown that everybody is worried about, but I guess we'll wait and see what happens in the market.", "Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yep. That's helpful. Thanks. And nice to see the margin progression this quarter. Thank you.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just to go back to the cash flow discussion, Vince, I think if I look at working capital the last couple of years, it has become a greater use of cash. And I was wondering how you're thinking about working capital in 2016 as you're growing the business. And should we think about working capital maybe as a continued use of cash as you continue to grow revenue? And if so, is there a rough or general rule of thumb that you might think we could model that on?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I think when you look at working capital, generally, when I think about it, I look at it as a percentage of sales. So if sales are growing, you'd expect working capital, plus or minus, to grow. It could be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. But I mean if you go back and did two years or three years, four years of analysis and looked at the percentage, it's probably not a bad way to think about it.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick housekeeping, Vincent. I think you gave us the pro forma cash post Getrag. Could you also give us just a pro forma debt and EBITDA that you're using to get to, I think, the 1.2 times leverage? I don't think you have to issue any additional debt especially with the deal. Just want to make sure I have the correct numbers on the numerator and denominator for the leverage.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Itay, I'll get back to you on the details on that business (56:50).", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I have it.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sorry, I can give you that information. On a pro forma basis, right, so this is as of I guess January 4, and Louis can get back to you with all the adjustments, but the adjusted debt which would include Getrag and leases and so on is about $4.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA is kind of in the $3.6 billion range.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just lastly, I think at the auto show presentation for Rest of World, I think you were kind of guiding for 2016 EBIT loss more or less in line with 2015. Just want to make sure that that's still consistent with your view today. It's a very tough and volatile market. Just curious to see an update on that outlook.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "You know what, we're just a month away from what we did in Detroit. We have no update at this point. So no idea that our January view holds consistent.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. That's great. Thanks so much.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Our next question from the line of Mark Neville with Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.", "Mark Neville - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, good morning everyone. Just a few follow-up questions. Just first on the margins in Asia, you mentioned Getrag being a 60 basis point headwind in 2016. I appreciate the extra costs, the investments you're making, but I guess our expectations were that the equity income would be accretive to margins in the region next year or are we sort of wrong in thinking that?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. There are some investments that are going into \u2013 I mean, a lot of the joint ventures are really just starting, so there's investments in there. Eventually it'll kick in and that's why we have a big improvement in margin \u2013 and one of the reasons why we have a big improvement in margins in Asia going forward, but it's hampering us in 2016.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "The other thing you've got is when you look at sales growth in Getrag, there is substantial growth in sales, their unconsolidated sales in Asia as the year sort of moves on, And as we started allocating purchase price amortization, there's a big chunk of that that's going to be allocated to Asia. So what's hitting us in 2016 on the margin line is also amortization of the purchase price accounting in the segment.", "Mark Neville - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Okay. No, that helps. I guess just...", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "(59:15) because it's ramping up, but you still have purchase price amortization that's hitting you in 2016.", "Mark Neville - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, you know that helps. And I guess just high level on the region, any other puts and takes, sort of launch costs sort of eating into some of your incrementals on higher production volumes, is that sort of a good way to think about it?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Launch costs, yeah.", "Mark Neville - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Maybe just a follow-up...", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Launch costs are more in 2016 versus 2015 in Asia. That's...", "Mark Neville - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "(59:41) yes.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "(59:42) of Getrag.", "Mark Neville - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then maybe just, again, follow-up on the buyback. Looks like you've been quiet year-to-date. But it doesn't sound like anything to read to in there. Just I guess, just busy with Getrag and just being in blackout. I mean no macro concerns, I guess?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We've been absolutely quiet from January 1 because we went into blackout on December 31. And we'll come out of blackout at the end of this week.", "Mark Neville - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'm not sure whether it's Monday or Tuesday next week.", "Mark Neville - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just two quick ones. Don, how would you frame the preferences for M&A going forward post Getrag? Is this powertrain still a focus? I know you've also talked about seating in the past, metal components, et cetera. How would you rank order at this point?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I still think our powertrain group is going to be quite good, and I think there's a lot of changes in powertrain. But we also have to \u2013 we've got a lot going on in our powertrain group and we're going to have to absorb the Getrag organization, which is big. So if there is something great came along we could do it, but I think we got our hands full right now. We made two acquisitions in Cosma, and Cosma has got a lot of growth. So, unless there's something where it naturally gets or gives us geographic or new customers \u2013 we're going to talk more about our electronics strategy when we have our Investor Day, with that scenario where there's a lot of technology going on, whether that's in driver systems or other capabilities for electronic control modules, et cetera, and other area we're interested in. So, it really could be in any of our core products going forward.", "I think valuations are pretty low right now, whether it's a public company or a private company, they typically go hand-in-hand. So, we'd be looking for \u2013 we've got internal priority but if it's a growing product segment going forward, you have good technology and we can handle it, then we'll be interested. But we've just completed a very big acquisition, so we're continuing to look but we're not desperate to go and buy something just for the sake of buying it.", "Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, Vince, on the headwinds for this year going from $20 million to $25 million down to $10 million on a quarterly basis, do we think of that in terms of the exit rate? Is that $10 million \u2013 if we multiply that by four for 2017, is that the right way to think about it or should we think of it by the end of 2017 everything is basically zero, so goes from $10 million or $12 million at the end of the year and then over the course of 2017 it goes to zero? Is that the right way to think about it?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Let me answer that. When Vince was talking about, what we tried do, we spend a lot of time in these division, I've been down there personally, we have had a lot of management down there. So, we try to understand where the losses were and there's a lot of different factors. So, what Vince has been talking about is the inefficiencies. So, we have launch costs as well and we're going to get to the launch cost because we're launching all these products, so that's going to make improvements.", "Vince is talking about taking the inefficiencies which we identified as premium grade, over time, outsourcing the equipment on and on and on. So, I would hope, when we get into 2017, we're through them. We'll be 100% through them, probably not, we don't even track that particularly. But the inefficiencies should continue to wind down and I don't want to see any inefficiencies there, so I don't know, I can't project anything, we haven't got into 2017 yet, but those should eventually go away as the plants stabilize and they get their product launched and we're in normal mode.", "Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Yeah. That's what I meant, inefficiencies, I apologize. Thanks. That's all I had.", "Operator", "Our next question from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. Free cash flow came up a couple of times. Any color on broadly why it's down year-over-year? It seems like down quite a bit. Any reasons to maybe talk about next year?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, when you look at the amount of cash or free cash flow in the year, I guess one thing we've got is we've got bigger investment in working capital in 2015 versus 2014, that's bringing that number down. Sorry, let's back up. The biggest change, I'd say, in free cash flow 2015 to 2014 is foreign exchange translation. And we just talked about how substantial that is on sales and obviously impacts operating income, obviously impacts cash flow. So that, I would say, is sort of the biggest change. When you look at some of the other bigger items that are impacting free cash flow is going to be investment of working capital and sales ramp up we'll make incremental investments in working capital and capital spending, when you look at where we ended up for 2015, we're almost at $1.6 billion even with movement in exchange rates. And we are under $1.5 billion last year and as we're looking at 2016, we're guiding capital, including Getrag, to be higher than where we are in 2015. So, that's not going to impact free cash flow.", "The other thing that sort of pops up in my mind when I look at free cash flow is investment in other assets, which is really tied to new program launches, and that's been growing. But that's been impacting negatively cash flow. But we'll recover that, obviously, as these programs launch in the outer years.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. And just to clarify your comments on the inefficiencies. They're running $20 million, $25 million. That will vastly improve by Q4 of this year. Is the full year still going to be a headwind or is that net-net because we only had $20 million, $25 million. You had $50 million, $55 million this year? Does it cumulatively actually become a tailwind as it comes down into this year, or is it still in that year-over-year headwind though?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "That's for the full year.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think when you think about it, when you are talking $50 million, $55 million, they were back ended for the last two quarters. We should be able to get that run rate down by the time we get to Q4, plus or minus half of where we are run rating at the end of Q4. So, I think, when you kind of look at two quarters in 2015 and you're looking at four quarters in 2016 at a reduced rate, I haven't done the math, but it's going to be probably pretty close in absolute terms for the full year. But to us, more importantly is, where were we in Q4, what's the run rate, are we bringing that down, and we're certainly with the plans in place expecting those operating inefficiencies to be reduced over time.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. And just one last...", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Very complicated. I would hope year-over-year they're down slightly but we'll keep you updated if things change but it's \u2013 yeah, I think that's the best color we can get.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. And just last question. You had a couple of divestitures this year, how do you view that portfolio today, are you kind of done or are you always going to be strategically looking at certain things?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We're going to continue to look at. What are we doing for our product portfolios? We're looking at where we \u2013 what we think the car of the future is going to be, where is the technology going? My personal opinion is that \u2013 and everybody talks about autonomous driving vehicles and electrification. I think all these things comes slower than what \u2013 not what the industry thinks but a lot of outside analysts think.", "So, we're trying to take a look at what's the car going to look like in say, in 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years. Given our products, where are we making the best value from a return standpoint and our invested capital. So, it is an ongoing process. I'm pretty happy with what we accomplished last year, especially our interiors business was quite challenging. The Getrag really strengthens our position and in powertrain, in their specific product lines with just general expertise. But we are looking at other products and we will continue to fine tune but overall, it will be a work in process.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. All right. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Operator", "And with that, gentlemen, our next question will be our final question from the line of Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Please go ahead, sir.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning, Richard.", "Operator", "Unfortunately, Mr. Hilgert has disconnected, sir. So, back to you with your closing remarks.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. That was a long call. I appreciate everybody dialing in and staying on.

Please note, all figures discussed today will be in U.S. dollars. Operating results for our interiors operations that were sold in 2015 are presented as discontinued operations and this review of results will address continuing operations only.", "In the first quarter, our consolidated sales increased 15% or $1.1 billion relative to the first quarter of 2015 to a first quarter record of $8.9 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our total sales increased 19% in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the first quarter of 2015. Excluding currency as well as acquisitions, our total sales improved 10%.", "Reported North American production sales increased 13% in the first quarter to $4.8 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, North American production sales increased 16%, while North American vehicle production increased 10% to 4.5 million units.", "The North American production sales increase is a result of the launch of new programs and higher production volumes in certain programs, as well as the acquisition of Getrag, partially offset by lower volumes on the Chevy Cruze as a result of the changeover for the next generation of the program and net customer price concession. Excluding currency translations in the Getrag acquisition, North American production sales grew faster than the market.", "Reported European production sales increased 20% from the comparable quarter. Again, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, European production sales increased 23%, while European vehicle production increased 7% to 5.6 million units. This increase was primarily the result of net acquisitions and the launch of new programs. These were partially offset by programs at end of production and net customer price concessions.", "Asian production sales increased 26% or $104 million to $507 million from the comparable quarter. This was primarily as a result of acquisitions and the launch of new programs, particularly in China. These were partially offset by the weakening of the Chinese RMB against the U.S. dollar, and net customer price concessions. Excluding currency translation and acquisitions, our Asian production sales outgrew the Asian market.", "Rest of world production sales declined 39% or $51 million to $80 million for the first quarter, primarily as a result of the weakening of the Brazilian real and Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar. This was partially offset by higher production volumes on certain existing programs, the launch of new programs, and net customer price increases subsequent to the first quarter of 2015.", "Complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 15% from the comparable quarter, while assembly sales only declined 1% to $596 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, complete vehicle assembly sales increased 1% with higher volumes in the Mercedes-Benz G-Class, more than offsetting the decline in assembly volumes on the MINI programs and end of production of the Peugeot RCZ during the third quarter of 2015.", "In summary, consolidated sales excluding tooling, engineering and other sales increased approximately 13% or $959 million in the first quarter and increased 17% if you exclude approximately $296 million associated with the impact of foreign currency translation.", "Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 33% or $169 million from the comparable quarter to $687 million.", "EBIT margin in the quarter declined to 7.8% from 8.1% in the first quarter of 2015. The EBIT margin was negatively impacted by the acquisition of Getrag in the amount of approximately 0.2%. Higher launch, new facility and warranty costs, operational inefficiencies at certain facilities, in particular certain Cosma facilities, lower recoveries associated with scrap steel, and a higher proportion of tooling to total sales. These factors were partially offset by margins earned on higher sales, productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities, a lower proportion of complete vehicle assembly sales and lower commodity costs.", "Interest expense increased $13 million to $23 million in the first quarter of 2016, largely related to the increase in debt assumed to purchase Getrag. In the first quarter of 2016, our effective tax rate was 25.5%, which is in line with our full year expectations.", "Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.22, a first quarter record, compared to $1.10 in the first quarter of 2015. The increase in diluted earnings per share was a result of higher net income and a lower weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, primarily due to the repurchase and cancellation of common shares pursuant to our normal course issuer bid.", "I will now review our cash flow and investment activities. During the first quarter of 2016, we generated $767 million in cash from operations prior to changes in operating assets and liabilities, and we invested $469 million in operating assets and liabilities. This investment is consistent with the typical build-up of working capital in the first half of the year. We expect to recover a substantial amount of that investment by Q4 of this year.", "For the quarter, investment activities amounted to $2.2 billion, including $1.78 billion for acquisitions, $346 million in fixed assets and a $54 million increase in investments in other assets. We also repurchased 7.3 million common shares for $300 million, pursuant to our normal course issuer bid and paid $95 million of dividends in the quarter.", "Our balance sheet remains strong with $625 million in cash as of March 31, 2016, and additional $1.93 billion in unused credits available to us. As a result of our continued growth, we recently increased our global credit facility to $2.75 billion from $2.25 billion, and extended the term one additional year. This provides flexibility to allow us to capitalize on future opportunities.", "Next, I'll cover our outlook. Our light vehicle production assumptions are unchanged in North America and have increased about 300,000 units in Europe for 2016, partially reflecting higher Q1 volumes than previously anticipated. Our North American production sales range is up from our previous outlook largely due to a stronger expected Canadian dollar than previously forecasted. Our European production sales range is also up from our previous outlook, largely due to higher production assumptions and a higher expected euro than previously forecasted. Our Rest of World production sales range has declined slightly, reflecting both lower volumes and weaker expected currencies in South America. Our Asia production sales range is unchanged from our previous outlook.", "Our complete vehicle assembly range has increased, mainly reflecting higher sales for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class and a higher expected euro. Implicit in our total sales is an increase in expected tooling sales for 2016, largely reflecting timing shifts in recognition of tooling and increased effect of Canadian dollar and euro compared to our previous outlook.", "As a result of all of these changes, total sales are now expected to be in the range of $35.5 billion to $37.2 billion for 2016. This represents a $900 million increase in sales at the top and bottom of the range. Our EBIT margin percent, tax rate, and capital spending ranges are all unchanged from our previous outlook. We've increased our interest expense range to approximately $90 million compared to approximately $80 million previously.", "Lastly, we made one change to our expected segment EBIT expectations, moving Asia up to 7% to 8% range from 6% to 7%. This reflects expected 2016 operating performance that is better than previously anticipated. Keep in mind, however, that the numbers are smaller in Asia and, therefore, margin percentage experience more variability in this region.", "This concludes our formal remarks.

Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, John.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a first question, you talked about growth above market in North America on an organic basis, which is impressive given your size. Just curious if you can maybe mention what that was more specifically and also sort of your confidence in being able to keep that up going forward and what products were the key drivers there?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "John, look, we kind of look at kind of the actual \u2013 some schedules on that, but if you recall at Investor Day or even when we gave our guidance in January, we looked up to 2018. Implicit in our growth in sales from the end of 2015 to 2018 based on substantially booked business, our expectations are that we're going to continue to outgrow the market in North America. I mean, we had built in some growth in production volumes through that timeframe, but our growth in production sales was actually higher than that.", "And that's as a result of all the things that we've been talking about, continuing to win business, continuing to increase content on replacement business. We certainly are benefiting from more and more global platforms. We continue to benefit from the consolidation of the supply base. And the technologies that we're working on today also bring in added content. If you think about some of the things that Cosma does for example on light-weighting moving from just plain old cold stamped steel to hot forming or to aluminum, you're actually increasing the selling price of a particular unit to the customer, which helps to grow not only content, but also profits.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Just looking at some of the programs like the Ford Edge, it was a big contributor to incremental sales in first quarter versus the prior first quarter. F-Series was another contributor, MKX for Ford was a big one and the Malibu was a contributor. Even the Chrysler Town & Country, more on the volume side, because they don't use a lot of RUs that are being built, it's more RT than RU, but the RU is coming along and that's higher content for us. So that's going to be the same story. That's growing our content from about $2,200 on the prior Town & Country to closer to almost $4,000 on the Pacifica. So it's that kind of thing that's driving our content growth.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I don't know of top off the my head what the change is year-over-year, but some of the new plants we're building, we've got some new seating plants coming online, we just had a new fascia plant come online, we're launching another one in \u2013 fascia plant in Mexico. We have a lighting plant, a new lighting plant being launched. We have a new high-pressure aluminum die casting plant coming on stream. We just launched a new metal stamping plant. So we still have a lot of growth. And I don't think there's any reason why we can't continue to grow, because we have a lot of different products. No customer has ever said to me, you're getting too big as a customer, they may not want us to get too big in any particular commodity, like anybody else, but we do have a lot of products that we could still have growth in.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Very impressive. And then a second question. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color around Telemotive because it looks like it's got some product capability, but also some engineering capability. I'm just curious if you could just give us a little bit more color on how that fits into the aggregate portfolio of Magna Steyr and what it really does for you in that \u2013 with customers and really expanding your capability.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "They're primarily \u2013 and I haven't been there. So they have primarily got engineering service offerings to the customers. They have got a good customer base which we like. And what they're bringing to Steyr is more of the connectivity telematics. So Steyr has a lot of electrical, electronic capabilities; in this area, they didn't have a lot. They're a good standalone business, but when we combine it with what we've got in Steyr already from an engineering standpoint, it just strengthens us even more. And although it's going to be part of Steyr, they're going to continue to run as basically grow the business on their own. We'll have them tied into our capabilities in Magna Electronics as well because there's going to be some synergies there also.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And Don, do you think that is something that is necessary as you potentially forge into new customers, or is this the kind of thing that will be \u2013 help you win a lot of new business with existing customers? Is it just sort of necessary for Steyr to deal with the car of the future?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It certainly doesn't hurt. Whether it's our traditional customers or somebody new, the more capability Steyr has in especially sort of the emerging side of software, telematics, the more capability they have to offer customers. So Steyr is doing quite well and we're growing our manufacturing business quite strong as we indicated as well as getting lots of opportunity for engineering. But when we can add on additional capability, then it should strengthen their ability to win business.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just lastly, I mean, launch costs in the quarter were highlighted as a bit of a negative. Are those particularly heavy in the first quarter and do they stay through the course of the year or should we expect heavy launch cadence through the course of the year?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So you're looking at consolidated I'm assuming. On a year-over-year basis, launch costs were negative. I'm looking through some of the segments. I think launch cost actually improved in North America in the back half of the year, also benefited North America as some programs launch, we get some revenue. I think when I look at Europe, launch costs are going to be more of a drag in the second half compared to the first. And I don't really have a good handle on Asia, John. So I think as you look through Europe quarter-over-quarter on a consolidated basis, launch costs, I don't expect to move substantially away from where we were in Q1 because that was down...", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "...roughly about the same.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And I would assume Asia probably as the products ramp over there, it's a little bit of a headwind continuing through the end of the year, right?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We just moved guidance up in Asia. Remember, they're small numbers in Asia and that really reflects kind of some more optimism we have in some of the performances in Asia. So, based on Q1 results, we should be able to hold those margins for the balance of the year.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah..", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Sklar with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Peter Sklar - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Thanks. Back on the Cosma plants, the underperforming plants that we've been talking about the last couple of quarters, on the last call you gave some guidance, which as I recall that you anticipated that the end-of-year run rate loss was expected to be half of the run rate loss you're experiencing in Q3 and Q4. I'm just wondering is there any change in the guidance or the performance of the plants?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Peter. Just to kind of remind people what we talked about for the three underperforming plants, we were looking at inefficiencies because \u2013 we're launching some business and that's normal course business for us, but we kind of isolate the inefficiencies. It's not always an exact science in how to get the number there. But last year when you kind of look at the inefficiencies, we're probably kind of $50 million to $55 million for the year. And that was substantially all back-ended in the half \u2013 the last half of the year. There was some in the first half, but most of that \u2013 substantial of that was in the last half.", "We talked about kind of Q3 and Q4 last year, inefficiencies were kind of in the range $20 million to $25 million with Q4 being a little bit worse than Q3. What we're expecting when we \u2013 the last time we sort of gave some guidance is that we were going to be able to reduce those inefficiencies by about 50% by the time we got to Q4 of 2016, so somewhere between kind of $12 million to $15 million improvement by the time we got to Q4. I'll tell you \u2013 performance in Q1, we're on track to meet those numbers. So we've seen a reduction in the inefficiencies from Q4 to Q1. But if you look at Q1 to Q1, the inefficiencies were higher because we didn't have many inefficiencies in Q1 of 2015 and our run rate is higher in Q1 of 2016.", "So let me repeat that again just to make sure we're on the same page.", "Peter Sklar - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "No, I got it. I thought that was clear.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We're still on track to where we thought we were. We've still got to get through the launches, but we're pretty well executing what we thought we would be able to do.", "Peter Sklar - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Okay. My next question is on foreign exchange. In your write-up, when you're talking about SG&A, I think you're saying that one of the items you attribute is foreign exchange loss this year versus foreign exchange gains last year. And I'm just wondering if you could wrap some numbers around like how significant is the swing in terms of these foreign exchange gains and losses impacting your financial results?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. So, Peter, when you look at sort of SG&A in the first quarter of 2016, in my mind, there's just three things going on. Translation would have been a benefit for us because the Canadian dollar weakened and we have Canadian dollar based SG&A. However, more than offsetting that is the impact of realized foreign exchange gains and losses. And that just relates to the settlement of payables or the collection of receivables, the date you set the receivable up and the date you collect it.", "So if I look at Q4 of last year, actually I think the MD&A \u2013 you're referring to the MD&A, if you're looking at the Q1 of last year, Q1 of 2015, we would have had some foreign exchange gains that were realized, we would have booked those. In Q1 of 2016, we got some foreign exchange losses. When I look at sort of the overall impact of that, Peter, it's going to be under $15 million, so it's not that significant, but it's certainly an item that impacts our reported SG&A for the quarter.", "Peter Sklar - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Right. Okay. And then my last area I wanted to address, your European operating profit was about 5%. That's better than what it's been running at and I'm just wondering, has there been some organic improvement in your European operations or is that just the blended outlook now that you have Getrag blended in?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, if we exclude Getrag, our operating margins or EBIT margins would have actually been higher in Q1 in Europe. But the impact of Getrag in Q1 was negative 0.4%. So, ex-Getrag, we would have been north of 5% in Europe. So some of the moving pieces are that's helping to drive the margin expansion. I would say that the biggest thing is really just operating performance. What's also helped is other acquisitions excluding Getrag and what I'm referring to is the disposal of our battery systems business and the acquisition of the UK operation of Stadco that would have been accretive to operating margins on a year-over-year basis. Commodity costs were actually a tailwind, so that helped us a bit. And what hurt us a little bit on the year-over-year basis is additional launch costs. So when you kind of sum all that up, there is an improvement from Q1 of last year with Getrag and the improvement would have been larger if we hadn't consolidated Getrag.", "Peter Sklar - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Right. So you seem to be having good performance there in the first quarter. I just noticed, though, in terms of your outlook section where you go segment by segment, you've not moved up your guidance. You're still looking for 4% full-year 2016, which I know there's seasonality in the second half of the year, but it still is 100 basis points behind your performance of Q1. I'm just wondering if there's anything else we should think about?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey Peter, I mean, you've hit one. So we're, first of all, saying approximately 4%, we're not saying 4% so that could be plus or minus 4%, you can interpret my comments on that. Certainly seasonality is an impact. There's generally sort of three things that you should keep in the back of your mind. One is new facility costs are going to be a headwind over the course of the year. We are putting up some new plants throughout Europe and the cost of those plants are going to be a negative. I think they're actually...", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "A modest positive...", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "A modest positive in Q1 and it's going to be a negative for the next three quarters, for the balance of the year.", "The other is, as you think about Magna Steyr, volumes this quarter were about 23,000 units, but as the MINI program comes to an end, volumes are going to come off. So that is going to impact our margins as Magna Steyr's profitability starts to slowdown as they start to ramp up for the new program in 2017.", "And actually the final thing is actually Getrag. When I look at Getrag's results for the quarter, it's a little bit better than expected. We're still trying to get Getrag and we will get them next year into our budget process. So I don't have the same sort of level of confidence in their budget that I do in our own developed budgets. But, I think what's going to impact Getrag for the balance of the year is higher engineering costs and launch costs, and our budget assumes that some of those costs we're going to or more of those costs are going to be incurred in Q1, but there is going to be more of those to be incurred in the balance of the year.", "So when you sum all that up, our expectation is that the 5% is going to come down and seasonality also plays a big part of it. You think about what happens in summer shutdowns in Europe as well as the Christmas shutdown in Europe has a negative impact on margin.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think we've generally seen the first half of the year stronger than the second half of the year in Europe anyway. Overall, Peter, I think we're making, we continue to make a headway in Europe.", "Peter Sklar - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Okay. Thank you for your comments.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, everybody. Had a couple of questions. Just one \u2013 just to maybe button up that last discussion on Europe. Are you saying that if Europe stays on its current trend that it is tracking more or less in line with plan or are you in fact seeing it coming in a bit ahead of plan?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think, Rod, given Q1, Europe is probably a little bit better than our plan. Again, it's one quarter, well, let's get through a couple of more quarters. But we both \u2013 Don and I were pleased with the performance in Europe in the first quarter of 2016.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And your \u2013 the assembly revenue guidance was increased by about 10%, $200 million. Was that primarily \u2013 was that partially FX? Was volume higher? And can you pass along any thoughts, I know you've given us sort of the guidance for this year and the effect of the MINI roll-off. But how does that business look out to next year? There is a huge number, obviously you're tripling the size of the business nearly by 2018. But is that \u2013 can you give us some color on how that looks sort of in this intervening one or two-year period?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Rod, in respect of the guidance for our complete vehicle assembly business, there is two factors that caused us to move up our guidance for the year. One is foreign exchange. The euro has appreciated versus the U.S. dollar relative to where we were in February. So that's been baked into our numbers.", "The other thing is mix and we saw some positive mix in Q1, in particularly the Mercedes G-Class. The volumes were better. The selling price of a G-Class is more than that of a MINI program, so that helps overall sales.", "With respect to where Magna Steyr is going to look like, as we approach the end of the year, the sales on the MINI or at least the plan for now is that, they're going to drop off. Hopefully that's not the case and hopefully we saw more than what we've been told to we're going to \u2013 we need to produce and the business is going to ramp up in 2017. I am not sure, Rod, whether it's sort of a Q1, Q2, but there will be a softening of sales as we approach the end of the year and there will be a ramp up as we move into 2017. So, you have to wait till later in the year until we get up to full assembly volumes for Magna Steyr.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, there's programs with BMW and JLR that are launching in 2017. And then they ramp up through 2017 and 2018 so it's into 2018 where volumes are kind of much higher than where we currently are.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And just two broader questions for the overall company. One is, could you just remind us what your commodity exposure is? And how you are thinking about the effect in the quarter and expectations for the year? And then, lastly, with this acquisition of Telemotive and you recently took an equity stake in a cyber security company, it really \u2013 it suggests that you're placing a greater emphasis in a new area with HMI, infotainment and connectivity. So, maybe just give us some thoughts on where you expect to take that and are you aspiring to be increasingly competitive with the Contis and Delphis of the world in that area?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, just dealing with the first one, Rod, for you, with respect to commodities, when you look at steel, about 75% of our steel buy is on resale programs and the balance \u2013 a big chunk of that is under fixed contracts that's extending, could be a year, year-and-a-half. We buy some steel on the spot market. So I'd say we're pretty well protected from a steel buying perspective.", "On the resin side, which is another exposure we have to commodities, the amount of resin on resale has been growing. It sits right now at about 25%. So, we have more exposure to relatively from a resin standpoint than we do with steel. But the other part of kind of steel is scrap, scrap is part of our manufacturing process. And we're pretty well exposed to that, particularly in North America, we're less exposed to that in Europe, and scrap prices throughout 2015 were coming off.", "And that's why as you kind of listen to our commentary last year, we kept on talking about the impact of lower scrap recoveries. We commented about that in Q1 of 2015. I look at kind of where scrap pricing is today and where it was in Q4, there has been some recovery depending on kind of where scrap ends up if it maintains at this level. I think when you look at the full year 2015, scrap recoveries will still be a hit to us in 2016 compared to 2015.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And in Q1, net-net, scrap, steel and resin was still a negative to us.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Have you been able to quantify that, just how we should be thinking about commodities for the year when you think about scrap and the other small exposures?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I would, Rod, year-over-year I'll put that as a headwind, but the headwind would be less than what the impact was in 20 \u2013 expect to be less than what it was in 2015.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "But again, everything \u2013 it's a pretty volatile market up there. So things could change for the better or for the worse.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "As far as the question you asked on electronics, software, we already \u2013 we explained a little bit about this and Swami Kotagiri did at the Investor Day. We already have a lot of capability in cameras in surround view, front facing, rear facing. We are developing other technologies in the whole space of ADAS. It's an area we think we can compete in. Lots of changes coming up there. I think there is going to continue to be lots of different solutions. And the fact that we bought the Telemotive is not an indication that it's a mainstream product for us as far as infotainment. However, we made the investment in cyber security, because we think that's a \u2013 it's a very good technology.", "We think it's something that the industry needs. We think it's going to be a good investment and also we just continue to build out our expertise in software. Our main focus will be in the area of autonomous driving features, but we already \u2013 I don't think we're seeing as a big electronics player, but we have a lot of electronics, even if you look at our mirror business, the amount of embedded electronics we have in there is huge. So, we will continue \u2013 it's not going to be at the expense of other product areas if they're making good returns, but we do want to continue to grow our expertise in hardware as well as software in the whole electronics side of the business, and the electrification of powertrain is also a big area we're focusing on.", "Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Great. Thanks. What was the driver of the benefit on the corporate other line during the quarter, which I think was an expense in the year ago period?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sorry, you're thinking about sequentially?", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I just noticed it was an expense in the year ago in most quarters and was positive. I was just wondering if there was anything that could have been pushed out of the regions or the corporate, or if you're seeing higher, lower legal costs, I don't know what?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, this is corporate. We reported $12 million in Q1 of 2015, and $8 million in Q1 of 2016, it's a $4 million variance. And there is, I mean there is a bunch of moving pieces and there is this translation of foreign exchange, there is fees, there is IT cost, there is legal fees, there is higher labor cost, it's a pretty small variance for the quarter.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it. Sounds like a lot of moving pieces. Okay. And then, just following up on some of the growth of your products that you showed at the Analyst Day, in terms of the ones that aren't generating revenue now but are expected to, for example, the heat cool seats, for example, how far off is that before it starts to contribute to the top-line do you think?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, if I took a 100 R&D projects, some of them might be in the market in 12 months, some of them may not be in the market for three years. So I don't want to comment any particular one. But, we're a bit careful at telling what we are working on, but we're going to be a little bit more open than we have in the past because I want people to understand how much technology is in the company. But these things roll, as I said, anywhere from one to three years and some of them are closer than others, but you never really know if you get an order.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just kind of last, yeah...", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "When you look at the electronic latch, that's something that we've worked on for years and years. We have a couple of big programs, and now we are starting to get bigger programs. So those will start rolling out now. That's something we've been working on for years.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, good. Then just kind of last question on seating, that was another thing you talked about at the Analyst Day, looking for faster than market growth in North America and Europe, and maybe even faster in China and India, right. So, as we get closer to the spin-off of Adient from Johnson Controls, some speculation that they might pivot from targeting sort of solely financial returns to, I don't know, maybe trying to target growing their business again. Is that your understanding too, and what implications are there for your seating business?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't really know what their strategy is. They're going to spin it off as a separate company. We will have to see how it trades in the market. The JCI and the other companies are all pretty good companies. They all I think know their pricing pretty well. So it's not like people are going out and under quoting to grow their business. I'd be surprised if somebody started doing that. This wouldn't make a lot of sense to me. If it's a financial player that's going to flip their business, that happened back in 2006-2007 time period, then a lot of people went bankrupt.", "So I would expect that we're going to continue to be a disciplined good company. There are already huge market share, and one of the advantages we have had and we're continuing to have in my opinion is, we've got good technology, we're a good manufacturer, we're very competitive, but we've got good competitors there, and our customers quite often will like to have no more than one supplier. And that's why \u2013 I think that's one of the reasons why we've been growing just because they want to see another big seating supplier grow. So I can't comment on their strategy. I would doubt anything drastic happens. If somebody buys them then I guess it depends on who buys them and what the customers' reaction would be to who the owner would be.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. I was hoping maybe we could just talk about the thoughts on the North America margin cadence for the rest of the year maybe roughly, where you think you might exit? That is my first question.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, with respect to North America, kind of look at where we were at the end of Q1. We were about 9.6%. Our expectations for 2016 is around 10%. So if you look over the next three quarters, that implies improvement in margin, and that's coming from a number of things. One is, we were hurt in the quarter-over-quarter as a result of launch costs. As those launch costs start to get reduced as the year progresses, so that will be on a sequential quarter basis accretive to overall profitability and margins. As we continue to launch business particularly in this second half of the year, that additional revenue will also bring with it some profitability, so that should help overall profitability.", "We talked earlier on the call about three divisions in our stamping group in North America. We expect to continue to make improvements in the underperformance. So that's going to be additive. I think what's going the other way is an increase in our investment in new facilities, but kind of when you sum all that up, we are expecting improved margins for entire of 2015 compared to where we were in Q1 of 2016.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "That's very helpful. Thank you. And just a second question related to North America, just given some of the segment shifts that are out there and some of the pockets of higher inventory. I mean are you seeing any changes to production schedules, I mean \u2013 kind of what's the visibility like and kind of how do you think about that for the next few quarters, given that there are some areas where inventory looks a little bit high right now?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, nothing really of the ordinary on the production schedule side and we haven't changed our guidance at all for the full year and let's say Q1 came in pretty close to what we were expecting. So, nothing really to report on production schedule.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon, everyone. Sorry, this is Paresh Jain in for Adam Jonas. Couple of questions, more on the portfolio of products you have here. A few years ago, you had identified almost like 20% of your business as something that you didn't see scaling or was non-core for lack of a better word, and there have been some divestiture since. So, where do you think that number is today?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't remember ever saying 20%, but somebody might have been able to calculate that I guess. The big chunk we sold off was the interiors business. We sold off a very small SMC business unit. We sold the battery business which is very small because it hadn't really launched. Well, there are few other businesses that we were considering a while ago whether we could grow it profitably. One comes to mind is lighting. We never decided we're going to sell it. We've looked at that, we've actually had some very good response for growing that business and putting out a new plant up. So, we're always looking at what the return is compared to other business units, but there are no big chunks of our business right now that we're saying that they're not core, but we always continue to look at it.", "Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Understood. And just a follow up. You bought up autonomous and your capabilities with mirrors and the electronics content you have. And agreed there is still plenty of time till we get to level for autonomous. But even as we move through the levels, how do you see the role of mirrors evolving? Thank you.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. That's a great question. We debate that all the time. I have yet to see any mainstream vehicle and we can look at vehicles that are coming to market three years, four years, five years down the road. I haven't seen any that don't have exterior mirrors on them. Cameras could one day take the content off mirrors. You'd have to have legislation changes. I think you'd also have to have significant improvement in the cost and the picture quality, and a lot of other technical issues in cameras. But we are the biggest supplier \u2013 I think \u2013 we're the biggest supplier of cameras, we're the biggest supplier of mirrors. And there is a \u2013 had one slide up at the annual meeting today, there is a lot of embedded electronics, it has to go somewhere. We have a lot of patents on it.", "I think the interior mirror, I'd be surprised if that would go away. That's a great position to put a lot of electronic features and cameras and everything else. So you may see some changes in legislation around cameras. We haven't seen it yet, but it's something we looked at very carefully and we watch it. I'll be surprised if mirrors are off vehicles in any meaningful volume in the next five years to 10 years, but we'll track it.", "Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Neville with Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.", "Mark Neville - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, good afternoon. I just had a question first on Getrag. I think you said this quarter it was about a 20 basis point headwind to margin. That was a little better than we were thinking. I think you said maybe a little surprise to you as well or a little better than you had expected. So I'm just curious as you're in there now doing the integration, if there's anything maybe that surprised you good or bad either way thus far or anything that's sort of running ahead or behind schedule that's worth mentioning? Again, I realize it's early, but just curious on that.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We talked about 20 basis points in the quarter. For the full year, our expectations on Getrag are still the same at 35 basis points. I think when you look at Q1, I think there was some engineering in particular that \u2013 engineering costs we were budgeting later on in the year, engineering revenue and so there's some timing impact. So Q1 was probably a bit better than expectations, but it's too early at this point of time for us to change our views for the full year.", "From an integration standpoint, we've got an integration team that consists of some people from Magna Powertrain, some senior people from the Getrag operation and from everything we are seeing and hearing, integration is moving along quite well. Remember, it's a pretty big organization, a lot of the things that we're going to do will impact future programs. Remember, these types of programs get awarded typically three to four years before they start production. So we'll see the real benefits of some of the synergies in putting our Magna Powertrain and Getrag teams together as new programs get awarded.", "Mark Neville - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think as the year goes on, we'll continue to get more information, but overall, it's about as we expected. Vince has talked about some of the specific issues. But I think the interest level from the customers, the product analysis will be done, the launch analysis will be done, they've got a lot going on over there. We're still working on whether we can get purchasing synergies, whether we can be in-sourcing manufacturing, but overall, it's about where we thought it would be.", "Mark Neville - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Maybe just one last one on Asia. Again I noticed you did bump the margin guidance, but sales guidance, production guidance unchanged. So I'm just curious, I don't know if you called it out, what was behind the increase to the margin?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Mainly performance. Don't forget, doesn't take much to move the margins in Asia because the numbers are small. But we good performance in the quarter and we continue the good performance in a few of the operations relative to what we had originally forecasted.", "Mark Neville - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks very much. A number of mine have been answered, but just one residual one on China. This was obviously an area which had some pretty abrupt slowdowns and a reacceleration. How is the conversion on that? I mean it seems from the margin performance that you just referenced that it's going well. But maybe a little bit more on how you see the backlog and the order book there evolving and on the expected conversion on that business?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Pat. In terms of what's been going on in China, certainly with some of the tax breaks in China last year, that's helped sales, obviously production. As we look at our production estimates for China for 2016 kind of now to where we were in May, we held things pretty firm at the 25 million units in China. So we haven't changed our expectations in the year.", "I think as you're looking longer term and that's really important to us as we're [quoting] on business. We're still bullish on the market. We're expecting continued growth in production in China. The rate's going to slow down. I know, they're building a lot of cars in China, but each and every year there is a substantial amount of growth from an absolute dollar perspective.", "If you look at the Chinese market, our view is that regulations in China will evolve. They're going to be closer to what we see in North America and Europe and we think that that's going to continue to provide opportunity for us to grow content per vehicle in that market, given the expertise that we have in a number of product areas throughout the rest of the world.", "Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And Vince, I know you \u2013 I think you've given it up before. Can you just remind us like of the proportion of customers that are the locals persist the global JV guys?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "85% international OEMs in China. That number is moving down a little bit with Getrag. I don't have an accurate number but the number has come down...", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Pat, the amount of business with Chinese OEMs is growing. Getrag has a substantial amount of business with the local OEMs. But that's not going to impact the sales we report because we're equity accounting Getrag's Chinese sales, most of their Chinese sales. But I think if you were look at it on a managed sales basis, I think it's a good add on to the other years recollections at the Chinese OEMs gets about 30% to 35% of our overall sales in China versus above the 15% where we are today.", "Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. You, sorry, versus 15%.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah.", "Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Okay. Great guys. I appreciate the color. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions over the phone lines.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Well, I appreciate everybody dialing in. Overall, I said I think we're off to a good start this year.

With me today are Don Walker, Chief Executive Officer, and Vince Galifi, Chief Financial Officer.", "Yesterday, our board of directors met and approved our financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016. We issued a press release this morning for the quarter. You will find the press release, today's conference call webcast, the slide presentation to go along with the call, and our updated quarterly financial review all in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.magna.com.", "Before we get started, just as a reminder, the discussion today may contain forward-looking information or forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities legislation.

Please refer to today's press release for a complete description of our Safe Harbor disclaimer.", "As we review financial information today, please note that operating results for the interiors operations, that we sold in 2015 are presented as discontinued operations, and this review of results will address continuing operations only. The slide package accompanying our call today includes a reconciliation of certain key financial statement lines between reported results and result excluding unusual items. There were no usual items recorded in the second quarter of 2016.", "In the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a gain on the disposition of our battery pack business. This increased the operating income by $57 million, net income attributable to Magna by $42 million and EPS by $0.10. Our quarterly earnings discussion today excludes the impact of these unusual items. And now, I'll pass the call over to Don.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you. Good morning. The second quarter of 2016 was another successful quarter for Magna. We posted records for total sales as well as North American and European production sales. At our Investor Day back in March, one of our key message was around the consistent outperformance of sales growth relative to light vehicle production across product areas and across regions over a number of years. We articulated how the sales outperformance relative to the market is expected to continue.", "Today, sales grew 16% over the second quarter of 2015. Our organic sales growth, excluding net acquisitions and adjusting from movements in foreign exchange rates, was 10% in the quarter. This compares to about 4% growth for global light vehicle production. So our global organic sales outperformance relative to market was 6% in the second quarter.", "Similarly, North American production sales grew 6% organically, excluding foreign exchange movements. This compares to about 2% growth for North American light vehicle production, so we grew three times faster than market growth in North America.", "Our European production sales grew 14% organically compared to 6% for European light vehicle production. This represents 8% outperformance compared to the market and more than twice the market growth. And our Asian production sales grew 22% organically, excluding foreign exchange movements compared to 6% for Asian production. This represents 16% outperformance, almost four times the growth in the Asian market. In addition to our strong sales performance, we posted a record in EBITDA, going over $1 billion for the quarter, and record EBIT net income and earnings per share.", "Let me turn to our segment results for a moment. In North America, we generated another solid EBIT margin of 10.2% despite continued significant launch and new facility activity underway. In Europe, EBIT margin reached 5.6% for the quarter. This was the highest adjusted EBIT margin percent since we started reporting quarterly European segment results going back to 2003. This result was achieved despite the Getrag acquisition, which negatively impacted European margin by about 0.4%, largely due to launch cost for new transmission programs and purchase price amortization.", "Segment results were strong again in Asia with an EBIT margin of 8.2% for the second quarter, despite ongoing investment activities on the continent. And we continue to contain loss within South America despite the challenging operating environment there. Our EBIT loss was $5 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $8 million loss last year in Q2 and an $11 million loss this last quarter.", "Lastly, we recently received considerable industry recognitions for high quality innovation. In the past couple of months alone, we have won awards for excellence from General Motors, Ford, Honda and PSA. We were also recently honored for innovations related to carbon fiber on hoods for Cadillac and for seat innovations on the Chrysler Pacifica. These recognitions reflect our close customer relationships and how we bring forward world-class manufacturing and innovation to support them.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Vince.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. I would like to review our financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016. All figures I'm going to discuss today are in U.S. dollars.", "In the second quarter, our consolidated sales increased 16% or $1.3 billion relative to the second quarter of 2015 to a record $9.4 billion. Reported North American production sales increased 7% in the second quarter to $4.9 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, North American production sales increased 9%, while North American vehicle production increased 2% to 4.6 million units.", "The North American production sales increase is a result of the launch of new programs, the acquisition of Getrag and higher production volumes of certain programs, partially offset by the weakening of the Canadian dollar against our U.S. dollar reporting currency, the (7:30) equity accounted joint venture and new customer price concessions.", "Reported European production sales increased 36% from the comparable quarter, while European vehicle production increased 6% to 5.8 million units. This increase was primarily the result of net acquisitions, the launch of new programs and higher production volumes on certain existing programs. These were partially offset by net customer price concessions.", "Asian production sales increased 28% or $109 million to $499 million from the comparable quarter. This was primarily as a result of the launch of new programs, particularly in China, higher production volumes on certain existing programs and acquisitions. These were partially offset by the weakening of the Chinese and South Korean currencies against the U.S. dollar and net customer price concession.", "Rest of world production sales declined 14% or $18 million to $107 million for the second quarter, primarily as a result of the weakening of the Argentine peso and Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar and lower production volumes on certain existing programs. These were offset by the launch of new programs, and net customer price increases subsequent to the second quarter of 2015.", "Complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 9% from the comparable quarter, while assembly sales increased 7% to $652 million. Higher volumes on the Mercedes-Benz G-Class and the higher euro against the U.S. dollar together more than offset a decline in assembly volumes on the MINI programs and the end of production of the Peugeot RCZ during the third quarter of 2015.", "In summary, consolidated sales, excluding tooling, engineering and other sales, increased approximately 15% or $1.1 billion in the second quarter. Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 33% or $198 million from the comparable quarter to $797 million.", "EBIT margin in the quarter increased to 8.4% from 8.3% in the second quarter of 2015. The EBIT margin was positively impacted by lower commodity costs, including higher recoveries associated with scrap steel, a lower proportion of complete vehicle assembly sales and productivity and efficiency improvements in certain facilities. These factors were partially offset by a higher proportion of tooling to total sales, higher launch and new facility costs, a higher amount of employee profit sharing, operational inefficiencies at certain facilities and the acquisition of Getrag in the amount of 0.2%.", "Interest expense increased $14 million to $22 million in the second quarter of 2016 largely related to the increase in debt associated with the purchase of Getrag. In Q2, 2015, our effective tax rate was 26.9% compared to 26.3% in Q2, of 2015. This largely reflects an increase in non-deductible foreign exchange adjustments related to the re-measurement of financial statement balances of certain foreign subsidiaries.", "Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.41, a record compared to $1.19 in the second quarter of 2015. The increase in diluted earnings per share was a result of higher net income and a lower weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, primarily due to the repurchase and cancellation of common shares pursuant to our Normal-Course Issuer Bid.", "Let me review our cash flows and investment activities now. During the second quarter of this year, we generated $864 million in cash from operations prior to changes in operating assets and liabilities, and invested $151 million in operating assets and liabilities. This investment includes an increase in tooling amounts and is consistent with the typical build-up of other working capital in the first half of the year. We expect to recover a substantial amount of the first half investment by the end of the year.", "For the quarter, investment activities amounted to $543 million, including $409 million in fixed assets, $103 million increase in investments and other assets, and $31 million for acquisitions. We also repurchased 7.8 million common shares for $308 million, pursuant to our normal course issuer bid and paid $98 million in dividends in the quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with $597 million in cash as of June 30, 2016, and additional $2.19 billion in unused credit available to us.", "Next, I'm going to cover our revised outlook. Our light vehicle production assumptions are unchanged in North America and it increased about 100,000 units in Europe for 2016, reflecting higher Q2 volumes than previously anticipated, partially offset by some anticipated softening in the second part of the year relative to our previous expectations.", "Our total sales range for 2016 is unchanged from our previous outlook of $35.5 billion to $37.2 billion. Our North American production sales range was tweaked down very slightly from our previous outlook reflecting changes to certain program volumes. This was offset by our complete vehicle assembly sales range which was increased slightly mainly reflecting our higher expected sales for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class.", "Our Europe, Asia and rest of the world production sales ranges are all unchanged from our previous outlook. We increased our expected EBIT margin for 2016 to approximately 8% from high-7% range, reflecting continued strong execution and better results in Europe. We increased our income tax rate outlook to approximately 26% from the 25% to 26% range reflecting a change in income mix and higher expected non-deductible foreign exchange adjustments as we experienced in Q2. Our interest expense and capital spending ranges are both unchanged from our previous outlook.", "Lastly, we made two changes to our expected segment EBIT expectations. We moved Europe up to approximately 4.5% from approximately 4%, and we narrowed the range in Asia to 7.5% to 8% from our 7% to 8% previous range. These reflect expected 2016 operating performance that is better than previously anticipated.", "This concludes our formal remarks. Thanks for your attention today. We'll be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, guys.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, John.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a first question. And we always appreciate all the detail you give us on the programs, on the positive and negative as you go by region. I was just wondering if you could talk more broadly about the benefit of mix as we're seeing a greater and greater portion of sales, vehicle sales, both in North America and China, and to some degree, Europe, moving to crossovers and in some of these markets disruption. How much of that you think is cyclical and structural, because it seems to be coming your way. I'm just trying to understand that.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "If I look at the overall production sales changes through the year-over-year, or quarter-over-quarter, North America, we benefited from stronger volumes on existing programs, forgetting about what kind of launch. So we have been benefiting from the shift towards SUVs, CUVs, and light trucks in North America.", "And we have \u2013 I mean, we're mostly into our top 10 we're pretty heavy on trucks and second quarter top 10 volumes alone, we're up about 7% versus the market at 2%. So we've certainly been benefiting from the shift towards trucks and crossovers in North America.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Our view in volumes are probably not going to be much different than IHS or anybody else out there. I think if oil prices stay low, there seems to be a big demand for the vehicles. The automakers like to sell them because they're probably getting higher margins on average than smaller cars. So unless something drastic changes in oil price, I would expect to continue to see strong sales in those areas.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks. And then just a second question on China and the Asia segment, I'm just curious. As you look at it, there's a lot of concern about how the market is shifting maybe away from the international players in China or the market may even slow down. So there's a lot of concerns in China. As you look at your business, how reliant are you on market and maybe more importantly how reliant are you on your backlog of business just building and coming through with your partners over there?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "John, I think, when you look at China, our business mix is changing and that's primarily as a result of the acquisition of Getrag. I think Getrag's performance are not showing up on our consolidated sales number because they are equity accounted but obviously it impacts the bottom line results. And Getrag's business with the domestic OEMs in China is a more substantial percentage on our overall Magna business, because Magna business is probably about 85%ish with our international OEMs with the North Americans or the Europeans and 50% is domestic. That's been growing on the domestic side. But if you take managed sales and you look at a couple of years, including Getrag sales, the sales through our-the domestic OEMs has been growing.", "But when I look at kind of the growth in what we're expecting in China, the biggest part of that growth is not coming from volume changes but in fact by launching new programs. That's going to contribute to sales growth. So we're not as dependent on changes involving us but more dependent on the launch of those programs and the success of those programs.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That's helpful. Then just lastly, as we look at Europe \u2013 I mean the guidance for sort of 4.5% EBIT margin there seems a little bit conservative given what you just put up in the second quarter at 5.6%. Is there something you're seeing in the second half of the year that kind of gives you pause on where the margins will go? Or is that really just a bit of conservatism in your outlook?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think there are three factors you need to take into account in the second half of Europe. When you look at overall production, we're about (19:26) about $11.5 million in the first half. We did talk about moving our guidance up by $100,000. But essentially, that was generated in the first half. We're actually taking the second half down. And we're looking at kind of overall volumes to be about $9.9 million in the second half. So you've got volume declines sort of impacting overall if you think about sales.", "Second thing is you've got the summer and the Christmas shutdowns. And in particular to our businesses, when you look at new facility costs in the second half of this year, they're ramping up. And the investment in launches is also ramping up compared to the first half of the year. And a big part of that is in Getrag in terms of launches. So those are kind of a number of factors that are negatively impacting margins in the second half over the first half.", "But as you launch these programs, as you ramp up those new facilities, that will come back to us. So when I look at first half performance in Europe on an EBIT perspective I'm pretty pleased with the progress that we've made, and it's been a tough slug for the last five or six years, and we started with a loss in 2011 and we have some pretty decent margins right now.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would just add that Magna, as I remember, is coming to the end of life on its higher volume programs, and that has an impact on margin at the back half of the year.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got you. That's helpful. And really just one last housekeeping. As we think about the share buyback, the current normal course issuer bid expires, I believe, in November, or at the end of November. And as you get though that, would you expect probably getting another authorization so you have the flexibility going forward? Just trying to understand where that program ends and what we might think about going forward.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, John. I guess, I mean, it's going to be up to the board, our \u2013 Don and I, thinking on all of this is we're comfortable that the capital structure is kind of 1 to 1.5 times, and so we continue to generate free cash flow. So unless our capital spending substantially ramps up or do an acquisition, we'll continue to generate some cash. And our stated philosophy is to be in that range. So that implies that we are going to be going to the board with another authorization when this one expires.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Arthur with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Steve Arthur - RBC Capital Markets", "Great. Thank you. Just following up quickly on that European comment. I understand the pressures in the back half, but Q2 was still stronger than we had thought. And it sounds like the contribution wasn't from Getrag. That was more of a headwind. Was there any kind of onetime in nature in the first half or in Q2, in particular, or is that really just the many little things you've been doing in the traditional business to drive that improvement?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning, Steve. When I look at Europe and I look through it quarter-to-quarter, for Q1 to Q2, kind of we're at 5% Q1 and 5.6% in Q2 and then one thing, kind of what's sort of going on. There's a little bit of benefit from commodity costs and launch costs were a little bit less in Q2 versus Q1. But that was offset pretty well by higher warranty.", "And then when I kind of \u2013 the other two impacts in the quarter was we had pure tooling sales. So that would imply a little bit higher margin, make margin on tooling. And the rest is essentially, pull-through on higher sales and operating efficiencies. So there's nothing here that's fixed out as being an unusual item, a plus or minus in the quarter.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Overall, a pretty clean quarter. And we still got a lot of launches going on. So I'm pleased with the progress we're making in Europe.", "Steve Arthur - RBC Capital Markets", "Sounds good. Back on North America, I realize you don't report content per vehicle any longer. But if we use your production numbers, it looks like something around $1,060 (23:51) for North America for the first half. And your full year outlook implies kind of $20 to $50 higher than that for the second half of the year in terms of CPV. That seems a big jump. Is that just a function of mix or are there any particular program launches, I think, that you can point to that might explain the increase in the back half?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "There's lots of launch activity going on. I mean the Pacifica is still launching. The Acadia just started in April. We have higher content on the new one versus the old one. The Cadillac XT5 is still launching. That's higher content compared to the SRX. Lincoln content will just start. There's a huge content on that one. So it's mainly \u2013 mix is going to improve H2 versus H1. But certainly we still have a lot of launch activity going on this year.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. If you look at kind of production, implied production for the second half of the year in North America, it's down compared to the first half. If you take the midpoint of our outlook on production sales we're implying growth, which means that just like you talked about, achieve higher content per vehicle in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year.", "Steve Arthur - RBC Capital Markets", "And the final one, just more generally, in the opening comments or the press release, Don there was a comment about remaining highly focused on innovation and strengthening positioning of car of the future. I probably got the quote wrong. But that seems to be a key focus. It was the focus of your Investor Day four, five months ago. I guess, since then, any changes to your thinking on the focus technology areas for Magna or the level of investments and nature of the investments you're making there?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Not really. We're spending a lot of time on it, just trying to really understand and have a good estimate of how fast things like electric vehicles penetrate, how fast will ADAS penetrate, what's going to be the impact of ride-sharing, et cetera, et cetera, to make sure our product strategy is aligned with what mobility in cars should be like in the future, with new people that might be involved in the industry.", "But from an innovation standpoint we're continuing to put a lot of focus on it. We just had a tech show with one of our big customers last week, really good feedback from the customers in a lot of different areas. So it continues to be a focus. We're making good headway in what we've been working on world-class manufacturing. And I think, we're going to continue that obviously. But the big focus right now in the company has been and will continue to be on new product and process innovation and so on. A lot of activity there.", "Steve Arthur - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks for the comments.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry if I missed it. Any update on the three North American plants that were having issues? Are those issues past or is it still a challenge? I think you mentioned that there might be more launches, just wanted your thoughts.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Colin, if I look at it kind of sequentially, the three operations sort of Q1 to Q2, that's been a positive impact to operating results in Q2 versus Q1 as we continue to make progress there. Yeah, when I look at those three operations, there's a lot going on. We're still launching some business in a couple of facilities, one of the larger facilities we're launching quite a bit of business. There's been some higher volume in certain programs. We certainly didn't see some efficiency improvements. Scrap price has also moved around a little bit. When I kind of sit back and say, well how much of the improvement is due to what, how much of it is launch, or how much of it is higher volume, how much of it is efficiencies, we saw some inefficiencies on outsourcing and the pricing over time.", "I look at all three divisions combined and kind of the run rate for the first half of the year, they're absolutely in line with where we thought they were going to be at the beginning of the year. And when we look at where we think we're going to be at the end of the year, it's, again, in line to kind of where we thought we're going to be. So again, a lot of activity going on. But we're in line to what our expectations were. And year-over-year that should get positive to operating results for North American as well as Magna consolidated.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And most of the launches in \u2013 one division is actually back to \u2013 it's where we expected it would be. The other three divisions, most of those launches will be through by the end of this year.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. And you actually mentioned scrap which is, actually, my other question. I mean, can you remind us the impact of commodities there. I remember a couple of quarters ago, it was actually a bit of a drag. Is that turning in the second half of the year? And how should we think about commodity exposure with the movement in scrap price?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. When I look at even kind of first half of the year or just quarter, I guess, Q2 to Q1, we did see some positive benefits from a combination of commodity and scrap. And as I look at Q3 and Q4, steel prices remain where they are. That should be a tailwind, so positive for the second half of the year.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. All right. Thank you very much.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "(29:27) but it's certainly going to \u2013 it should be beneficial to us.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. Thanks, and congrats on a good quarter.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Peter Sklar with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Peter Sklar - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Hi. Thanks. Don, now that you've had Getrag under your belt for a couple of quarters, I'm just wondering if you're \u2013 if there's anything you're seeing unanticipated in either Europe or your Asian operations, and just overall how you're feeling about Getrag now that you've had the opportunity to jump into it a little bit more?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The integration has been going well and we're working together on synergies in a number of different areas. So I think the overall \u2013 we just reviewed this with the board yesterday, the integration is going well, the operational results are where we expect them to be. We have looked at the launch status, the products and it's all what we expect it to be. They do have a lot launches. But we're not expecting \u2013 we haven't seen anything unusual there. So overall, pleased with the acquisition, pleased with the progress. We will be updating their business plan in time, a lot of details, and we'll have a better idea, I guess what the results will be going forward compared to what we expected when we bought it. But right now, there's no real concern. I'm actually quite pleased with the way things are going.", "Louis B. Tonelli - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Yes. Peter, if I can just add some comments on Getrag. When I look at overall operating performance for the quarter, even the first half of the year, I'd say Getrag is ahead of our expectations and what we have built in to our forecast. Part of that is sort of timing where there could be some launch activity in engineering that we thought would take place the first half, which is going to take place in the second half of the year. But a big part of it is just due to better operating performance, a little bit stronger on the volume side. So from an operations standpoint, bottom line results of 2016, we're pleased and we're ahead of where we thought we were going to be.", "Peter Sklar - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Okay. And I take it that, structurally, Getrag has a lower reported margin than Magna's traditional businesses because you're doing the whole assembly of transmission. Is that correct to assume?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think, right now, Peter, when you look at the margins they're certainly lower than Magna because there's a number of things. One is we have a whole bunch of purchase price amortization that's impacting the Getrag results. And as we've been talking about previously, there's a tremendous amount of launch activity in Getrag. But I think if you move forward and you get through all that, given the level of capital intensity in the business, the margin profile at Getrag should be accretive to Magna's margins.", "Louis B. Tonelli - Vice President-Investor Relations", "It's a big showing price for the unit. But they have a lot of added values and it's the high technology. So we certainly expect the margins to be higher.", "Peter Sklar - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Okay. And then just one last question. Recently, Ford has gone out of its way to be cautionary in terms of the vehicle demand outlook for the second half of this year in the U.S. And I'm just wondering if you've seen any weakness yet in the release schedules from your customers.", "Louis B. Tonelli - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Up to this point, Peter, I mean, we haven't changed our outlook for North America. All year we've been at $18 million. And we've been coming in pretty much close to our forecast. And we look at releases as part of reviewing the remainder of the year, at least, in the next quarter. And we don't see any concerns at this point. Overall, we're seeing volumes.", "Peter Sklar - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Okay. Thanks, Louis. That's all I have.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Rich.", "Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Just want to ask about Europe, a little longer term question. So I think, John had asked about margins here over the balance of the second half. But I think, your longer-term guidance is in the mid to high 4s and you're tracking above that. So in the out-years, I realize that maybe you're not prepared to update at this \u2013 update that figure at this point. But just directionally, what are the puts and takes around margin in Europe in the out years particularly as it would seem like Getrag gets more traction and probably helps margin in 2017 and 2018? I just wanted to get your thoughts there.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay. Rich, just to comment, we talked about margins for this year being 4.5%, not 4% to 4.5%, but 4.5%. So that's moving up from our previous outlook. Anyway, just to answer your question, there's a number of things you need to take into account when you look at overall longer-term European margins.", "You're going to have a higher portion of assembly sales as we move out to kind of the 2018 timeframe, and we'll talk about 2018 timeframe. And as we talked about before, Magna's assembly business is lower margin business, but decent return on capital business. But that kind of hurts margins as we move out to 2018. What could help grow margins in Europe, I'd say, are relate three items. I think the biggest contributor is going to be the launch of new Getrag business And as we get up to 2018, Getrag's margins are going to be accretive to European margins.", "We've been, over a number of years, the last several years, been a lot more disciplined on putting in new programs. So as the new programs start to come in, the contributions from those new programs is expected to be accretive to overall margins. And we continue to work on improving operating performance. And even though we've talked about where we are from a restructuring standpoint over those number of years. And the last part of restructuring and getting out of the last facility that we planned, is kind of 2018 timeframe. So all of that should be accretive to overall margin. So trending, as we look at kind of 2018 margin should be moving up, not down.", "Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful, Vince. And just on Getrag, I think this year you're saying it's trending a little bit better than expected. So is there any \u2013 I think, originally, there was thought to be very little accretion of more or less nothing for this year in terms of earnings. So is that because of purchase accounting and what not? So as we think about it right now, is that adding a little bit to earnings this year versus expectation? And then next year, is there any change to how we should think about contribution for Getrag?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Rich, I have no \u2013 if you had asked me last quarter or six months ago, I would have said that Getrag, with purchase price accounting, would have been fairly neutral for 2016 sort of plus or minus but close to zero. If you ask me right now, I'd say that it should have a positive impact on earnings per share is accretive.", "But again when you think we got 400 million shares outstanding, it's not going to stand out as a big number. But our expectations for 2017, and we need to update our business filings we are working on right now, was that it was going to be more accretive in 2017 versus 2016.", "Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And ...", "Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Yeah, so...", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "...excluding purchase price accounting, certainly Getrag is more accretive in 2016 and even larger in 2017.", "Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Right, right. Okay. And then just last one, Don. So this report said that Samsung is interested in Magneti Marelli and looking outside or looking to get more involved in the auto business. I know you kind of alluded to looking strategically at what the landscape is looking like going forward with outsiders and then the core automakers.", "What's your view in terms of active safety, infotainment, more software-oriented product portfolio and whether \u2013 I know you're investing internally there. But in terms of external investment, where would you classify that as a priority?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I heard rumors of Samsung. So I can't comment on it because I don't know anything about what's going on there. I think there's \u2013 LG, Samsung and other people are looking at what parts of a vehicle they would like to participate in. We are certainly spending a lot more time looking at the ADAS, building our software capability, looking at new products, either by developing them ourselves or potentially partnering or buying people that would have capability in those areas. I mean it's going to be a lot of change in the next three to four years in who the winners and losers are. But there's a lot more content going into the vehicle.", "So I guess, to answer your questions, it's simply high focus area for us. We would consider acquisitions. It would have to be in an area we want. We're not really looking at getting into the infotainment. But more things, whether it's vehicle to vehicle or security, we've got an investment in an Israeli company, cameras, basically, any type of sensor that would help the automakers in autonomous driving is what we're focused on. So we have a lot of focus on it right now, and we'll keep you advised as we go forward. But we're looking at a lot of different things.", "Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm finding that some investors are increasingly worried about supplier pricing right now just given, I think, amongst other factors, some of the commentary on the Ford call, including outlook for 6% lower automaker prices to consumers in China. And then, the fact that incentives have picked up in the U.S. (40:49) there is, I don't know, take your pick, maybe plateauing or perhaps declining a little. So I'm just curious if you're seeing anything differently in terms of annual customer price reductions, if there's anything there that could impact your margin?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No. I wouldn't say it's any different. The good news is that most of our customers are very profitable right now, which is always good. But even when they're profitable, their engineering and purchasing people are always looking at how to take cost out. It's a competitive market, and they're always looking at the supply base for price reductions and how to redesign product and optimize it through VA/VE. So really, no change because there's always lots of pressure, and ultimately, it comes down to who's competitive. That's why we've put so much emphasis on our world-class manufacturing initiatives and who's got what technology out there.", "I think one of the opportunities in the industry generally is, with all of the changes in the vehicle, whether it's in regulation, fuel economy, autonomous driving features, there's lots of changes. So if you've got the technology, you can continue to win business and should be reasonable margin business, if there's \u2013 if you got something unique there. So no more pressure, no less pressure, and I wouldn't expect it to change much. And even in China, there's a lot of pricing pressure, but there's also a lot of weakness in the supply base over there. So I don't expect to see things change dramatically.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just last question. Obviously, you got very strong results in Europe this quarter and you're raising the outlook there for the year. I'm curious though if you've done any work to try to estimate the impact of Brexit on your operations there and whether that could have any kind of an impact on your target or normalized margin in Europe? I think you gave some outlook at your Analyst Day for 2018 margins. Is all that pretty much still intact do you think or does that need to be revisited?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Ryan, I think it's \u2013 at this point, it's really too early to tell when you look at sort of the activity in the UK. We do (43:17) of annual sales in the UK. A big part of that product is exported outside of the UK. But also export from the EU into the UK. And I think, it's too early to really tell kind of in part what our customers did. When we look at European volumes into 2016, initially before Brexit, we really looked more bullish on European volumes. Our most recent outlook for volumes in Europe reflects a reduction to resolve this. I guess the uncertainty in consumer confidence is now greater in the UK.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Everbody (44:03) what's going to happen there. But if you look at the number of vehicles that we have exported from the UK to Europe and back, I think, it would be a lose-lose. If they do anything on trade negotiations in the upcoming years, that going to hurt that trade. In a strange way, the UK may be able to end up entering other trade deals. It will take a number of years, I'm sure, and export more vehicles. So I wouldn't expect any business will make any big changes right away.", "And with that the lower pound, I don't think it makes much difference because we ship most of our product. Most of our costs are in local currency and we ship it. But that may make the producing parts more competitive long term. But I think, we have to wait a year and see, what happens with trade deals. I don't think it has any real impact other than translation and maybe sales as Vince just said, in the UK, but I don't see it as being a big deal.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Tyerman with Cormark Securities. Please go ahead.", "David Tyerman - Cormark Securities", "Yes. Good morning, guys. First question just on the equity earnings line. It was up quite a bit sequentially in the quarter. Is that just Getrag? And can you give us some thoughts on how should we think about that going forward?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. So equity consequentially was up about $12 million and trying to see where it falls into. A big part of that was in the North America with \u2013 the big part of it was in North America. So that wouldn't be Getrag.", "I think if you look for the balance of the year, David, and thinking about Asia, Getrag is going to be \u2013 I'd just say a negative in the second half particularly in Asia because there's a lot of launch costs that we're going to be incurring as we are involved with the ramp up. I'm not sure how that all balances out. But launch costs are in place. I think it stands out from the \u2013 in Asia in the second half of the year.", "David Tyerman - Cormark Securities", "Okay. That's helpful. And I guess that just sort of brings me to my second question, Getrag and launches. Where do they peak, is it the second half of this year or do they continue to \u2013 the launch costs continue to accelerate for some time in 2017?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. David, my recollection was that the launch costs are pretty heavy in 2017 as well, but in terms in back half of 2016. I just don't recall right off the bat, what happens prior to that. I believe launches continue to move up in Getrag as we move on to 2015 versus 2016. But again, there's a whole bunch of things going on in there.", "We'll give you some, David, some outlook, better feedback once we get through our business plan. And we will help put more color on that.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Certainly more launch, less engineering cost in the back half of this year relative to the front half.", "David Tyerman - Cormark Securities", "Okay, so it sounds like the anticipated better margins from Getrag in 2017 would really be you're starting to get benefits from stuff done this year partially offset by still heavy launch costs?", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, that's right, because what we are expecting overall based on our own accounting Getrag is going to be more accretive to earnings in 2017 versus 2016.", "David Tyerman - Cormark Securities", "Got it. Okay. And last question \u2013 sorry.", "Vincent J. Galifi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "David, the big step up in overall Getrag is going to be 18 and 19 (47:51), margin.", "David Tyerman - Cormark Securities", "Right. Okay. And the last question I had, just generally on M&A, right now, any thoughts \u2013 Don, you mentioned ADAS and areas like that. Is this an area that's attractive to you relative to buying back stock or any thoughts on that side?", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think it's an attractive area of growth. One of the things you want to make sure is we have a good view as to how fast these various things happen, whether it's autonomous driving up to level four, how fast things would be penetrating, whether it's electric vehicle penetration, to make sure whatever we're doing we're not building a business case on something that may not happen as fast as many people think it's going to happen. There is still a lot of different opportunities out there. But we're trying to have a good balance between is it growing the company profitably for the long term and also is it better to repurchase shares because I think our share price is low.", "So it's an ongoing dialogue with the management team and also with the board. If the right opportunity comes along, we'd certainly move on it. And we're not anticipating a big downturn. We're also conscious that things go in cycles. So we don't want to be buying at the peak of the market, so a lot of different factors we're looking at.", "David Tyerman - Cormark Securities", "Super, that's helpful. Thank you.", "Donald J. Walker - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Richard La Francois (49:35), private investor. Please go ahead.", "Unknown Speaker", "Yes.
